(Edlo, Inc., assignee, substituted), appellant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Appellant seeks cancellation pursuant to Section 24 of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1092, and predicates his right to secure cancellation upon his prior use <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of \u201cSlim\u201d for vitamin enriched fluid non-fat milk.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The uncontroverted evidence shows that as early as July 14 or 15, 1949, the word \u201cSlim\u201d was affixed by appellant to cartons containing a vitamin enriched non-fat fluid milk. At least until the institution of the proceedings in which this appeal was taken, appellant has continued to use \u201cSlim\u201d in conjunction with the sale of the same milk product.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">At first operations were confined to the San Francisco area, the original place of business of Bellbrook. Within six months, \u201cSlim\u201d and the product it represented began to receive substantial publicity in newspapers and trade journals resulting in numerous inquiries from all over the United States as well as several foreign countries. Shortly thereafter, Bellbrook began to engage in an advertising and promotional campaign designed to inaugurate a franchising program for \u201cSlim,\u201d which resulted in Bellbrook accumulating a large number of licensees throughout the United States who are packaging and selling \u201cSlim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">Appellant has spent large sums on advertising and in the preparation of booklets, bottle hangers, and other promotional aids for the use of dairies subscribing to its program. Part of the royalties which Bellbrook receives is used for advertising in the areas wherein the licensees sell.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">Bellbrook, via license agreements which are now standard for all licensees, requires its franchise holders to submit samples of the product which the licensees themselves produce in accordance with specifications given them as part of the franchise agreement, once each month. Upon receiving these samples, Bellbrook has them analyzed by a dairy products laboratory to see if they conform to the formula. If the products vary from the specifications, the producers are warned, and according to the testimony of appellant\u2019s vice-president, compliance has always followed any such warning. Only very occasionally, but not on a systematic basis, \u201cspot\u201d checks are made of the licensees\u2019 production of \u201cSlim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">The first use alleged by appellee for \u201cSta-Slim\u201d is February 8, 1951. Ap-pellee sells in the \u201cMetropolitan Chicago\u201d area and has sold almost 17 million quarts under this mark since 1951. Substantial sums have been spent in advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">Appellant\u2019s only witness, its vice president, knew of no instance of actual confusion, and there is no evidence which would tend to show such confusion. Neither is there evidence that the sales areas of the parties, including any licensees, actually overlap.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">The Assistant Commissioner, relying in part upon her decision in Bellbrook Dairies, Inc. v. Hawthorn-Mellody Farms Dairy, Inc., 110 USPQ 372, reversed 253 F.2d 431, 45 CCPA 842 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (herein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>after referred to as the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case) found that the circumstances surrounding the use of \u201cSlim\u201d by Bellbrook and its franchisees \u201chas probably led the purchasing public to think of \u2018Slim\u2019 as a skim milk product put on the market by a dairy in their area, rather than as a trademark identifying the skim milk of * * * [appellant] and distinguishing it from the skim milk of others.\u201d She found nothing in the record to suggest that appellant exercises \u201ccontrol over <em>the nature and quality of the product </em>sold by\" the licensees. Because \u201cSlim\u201d is \u201chighly suggestive\u201d and because of the manner of its use, the Assistant Commissioner felt that the record contained nothing to support the finding requisite to securing cancellation under section 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">It is the avowed position of appellant, speaking through its vice-president, that any use of \u201cSlim\u201d as part of the name of a dairy product infringes its rights. Whenever such a use is discovered, its practice is to so inform that user. Although admitting that \u201cSlim\u201d may be highly suggestive, appellant nevertheless contends that it has trademark rights in it, and that \u201cSta-Slim\u201d is not entitled to registration because it is confusingly similar to \u201cSlim.\u201d Bellbrook also alleges that this court\u2019s decision in the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case is controlling, the factual situation therein purportedly exactly paralleling that of the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Appellee\u2019s position is that the last mentioned decision is not controlling for several reasons, those being that it involved an opposition and not a cancellation proceeding, that there is new evidence, especially third-party registrations, that \u201cSta-Slim\u201d is a descriptive slogan, and that the marks are different. Appellee also asserts \u201cSlim\u201d to be merely descriptive, i. e., it is no more than saying \u201cnon-fattening.\u201d Finally, appellee contends that the fourteen-month wait from the time of issuance of the registration until the time the petition to cancel was filed was unconscionably long.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">We do not agree with appellee\u2019s contention that the decision of this court in the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case is not controlling here. Appellee\u2019s attempt to distinguish the case is not persuasive as will become apparent from the discussion which follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">First, there is no question that the mere failure of appellant to register \u201cSlim\u201d in the United States Patent Office does not militate against its right to petition for cancellation of \u201cSta-Slim.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1092, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1092. It should be remembered in this connection that \u201cSlim\u201d was unregistered and yet its user prevailed in the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case. It should also be noted that the right of appellant to prosecute this action does not depend upon the exclusive ownership of a trademark. California Piece Dye Works v. California Hand Prints, Inc., 159 F.2d 871, 34 CCPA 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">Also, this court has held that a li-censor of an unregistered mark may successfully maintain opposition proceedings. In Wilson v. Delaunay, 245 F.2d 877, 879, 44 CCPA 1019, this court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq2e\">\u201cIt is to be noted moreover that, although the exact terms of the agreements between appellee and his licensees are not shown by the record, it is clear that such licensees accounted to appellee and paid him royalties for the use of the mark \u2018Zombies.\u2019 Evidently, therefore, ap-pellee was regarded as the owner of the mark whether or not he controlled the exact manner in which it was used or the composition of the products to which it was applied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">Second, the mere fact that this is a cancellation proceeding, whereas the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case involved an opposition, is not significant. Appellant had no opportunity to oppose the registration of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>\u201cSta-Slim\u201d on the Supplemental Register but under the Lanham Act was limited to attacking it by a petition to cancel. We find nothing in the statute which indicates that it contemplates a more stringent procedure under these circumstances than when an opposition to registration on the Principal Register is instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Next, appellee contends that the evidence introduced in this case and not found in the previous one distinguishes them. It refers especially to evidence of third-party registrations. The only one using \u201cSlim\u201d which applies to milk is \u201cVita-Slim\u201d which was held unregisterable in the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case. Since the other third-party registrations are applied to different products than those involved in the case at bar they are of no material significance.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Further, appellee asserts that the length of time which transpired between the registration and the filing of this action provides the distinguishing factor. We do not believe that the lapsed time was unreasonable, and appellee cites no cases to substantiate its contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">Coming now to the marks themselves, it would serve no purpose to analyze again appellant\u2019s mark \u201cSlim\u201d for this \u2022court has already done so in the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case in stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">\u201cWhile the word \u2018Slim\u2019 is suggestive of the intended effect of skim milk on the purchaser, as indicated by the fact that both parties have used it in association with the notation \u2018non-fattening,\u2019 it would not be thought of as relating to the physical properties of the milk itself, and hence is not <em>descriptive </em>in the same sense as \u2018Vita.\u2019 \u201d (Italics ours.) [253 F.2d 433.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">There is other evidence in this case which fortifies appellant\u2019s contention that its product, skim milk which has been enriched with non-fat milk solids and vitamins A and D, is known by the trademark \u201cSlim\u201d and as the product of Bell-brook. That trademark has been used by appellant to identify its product in the San Francisco area since 1949 and by its numerous licensees in many states for some time. Further, appellant has registered \u201cSlim\u201d for this product in twenty-seven states. It exerts control over its licensees by contracts having various restrictive provisions including the requirement that each franchise holder submit samples of his product to it monthly for analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">As a prerequisite to the prosecution of this action, section 24 requires that the petitioner believes \u201cthat he is or will be damaged by the registration of a mark on this register * * *.\u201d This matter was considered by this court in the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case and we agree with its holding in this connection wherein it was said, \u201cLikelihood of confusion affords sufficient evidence of probable damage, even though the opposer may not have used its mark as a technical trade-mark. George H. Ruth Candy Co. v. Curtiss Candy Co., 49 F.2d 1033, 18 CCPA 1471; Virginia Dare Extract Co., Inc. v. Dare, 70 F.2d 118, 21 CCPA 1086, and eases there cited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-14\">It appears that several of appellant\u2019s licensees operate in the vicinity of the place of business of appellee. There being no regional limitation upon the registration of appellee, it could expand its operations to cover many of the areas now being exploited by the licensees including appellant\u2019s own area of operation. Hence, if the marks are confusingly similar, it is probable that appellant would be damaged by the registration of \u201cSta-Slim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-15\">Therefore, the next question which we must resolve is whether \u201cSlim\u201d and \u201cSta-Slim\u201d are so similar as to be likely to create confusion. As has been stated, this court in the \u201cVita-Slim\u201d case found \u201cSlim\u201d and \u201cVita-Slim\u201d to be so. It based its opinion on its finding that \u201c \u2018Slim\u2019 forms the dominant part of appellee\u2019s mark \u2018Vita-Slim,\u2019 and the concurrent use \u00aef those two marks on identical goods would be likely to lead to confusion in trade.\u201d Since here the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>goods are substantially identical and \u201cSlim\u201d is the dominant part of \u201cSta-Slim,\u201d we arrive at the same conclusion, that is, the marks here would be likely to create confusion in the trade. Merely because \u201cVita\u201d was held to be more or less descriptive of the product because it contained vitamins, and here \u201cSta\u201d in conjunction with \u201cSlim\u201d is suggestive of the result the registrant hopes to lead others to believe will be obtained by using the product, we see nothing in such a distinction which would make us alter our conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">For the above reasons we are of the opinion that the petition for cancellation should have been sustained, and, accordingly, the decision of the Assistant Commissioner is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">JOHNSON, J., did not participate in decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\">. Registration No. 571,882, registered March 10, 1953.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b669-11\">. The record and briefs show, and appel-lee does not dispute, that appellant was clearly the prior user.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b669-17\">. That case was an opposition brought by the present appellant, said opposition to the registration on the Principal Register of \u201cVita-Slim\u201d for fluid milk being predicated upon opposer\u2019s allegation of confusing similarity with its own \u201cSlim,\u201d the same product involved in the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>appeal. This court, in reversing the Assistant Commissioner, found \u201cVita\u201d to be descriptive and that \u201cSlim\u201d formed the dominant part of \u201cVita-Slim.\u201d It was held that concurrent use of \u201cSlim\u201d and \u201cVita-Slim\u201d on identical goods would be likely to result in confusion in trade.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
