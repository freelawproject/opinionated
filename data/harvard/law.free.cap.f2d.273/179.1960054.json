Opposer\u2019s shoes sold under its mark are professional and casual shoes, and applicant\u2019s are casual and sport, shoes. The shoes of both parties, are sold to the same average purchasers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-22\">\u201cThere is nothing in the record to, aid in determining probability of confusion, so it becomes necessary to. attempt an evaluation of the prob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>able associations and reactions in the minds of average purchasers when they encounter applicant\u2019s trademarked shoes in the retail outlets under the usual market conditions. Since opposer entered the field with its mark first, and since the average purchasers of the shoes of the parties are the same, it must be assumed that such average purchasers are familiar with opposer\u2019s mark, \u2018Foothrills\u2019. Are they likely, when they see or hear applicant\u2019s mark \u2018Thrill-mates\u2019, to associate it with opposer\u2019s \u2018Foothrills\u2019 shoes and to assume that both trademarked shoes are in the line of a single company? \u2018Thrill\u2019 is a rather unusual word to use in connection with shoes, and it is therefore likely to remain in the minds of women shoe buyers. It is believed probable, therefore, that a portion of the buying public familiar with the mark \u2018Foothrills\u2019 will associate \u2018Thrill-mates\u2019 with it. This is a type of confusion envisaged by the draftsmen of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u201cAlthough some doubt is created by a record which shows that applicant\u2019s unit sales have been substantially greater than opposer\u2019s during the period of concurrent use of the marks, it is not sufficient to resolve the controversy in applicant\u2019s favor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Appellant takes issue with the above and argues that the marks, when viewed in their entireties, do not look alike, sound alike, or have the same meaning; that despite extensive advertising in the same trade publications and newspapers and extensive sales of shoes through the same retail outlets, there is no evidence of actual confusion of any kind; that the word \u201cthrill\u201d is an ordinary dictionary word in common use as a part of several trademarks for various products, including shoes, and is entitled to limited protection; and that when an applicant has built up substantial goodwill in a market, its rights are entitled to consideration in an opposition proceeding such as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">Whether marks are likely to cause confusion or mistake or deceive average purchasers is, in final analysis, a matter of opinion. Both of the tribunals in the Patent Office held that concurrent use of the instant marks would be likely to cause confusion as to origin of the goods.'</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">While it is obvious that the marks, which have the word \u201cthrill\u201d in common, have differences in spelling, pronunciation, appearance, and meaning, we do not feel these are sufficient to obviate the possibility of confusion as to origin. The word \u201cThrill\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark is, as the Commissioner said, \u201ca rather unusual word to use in connection with shoes.\u201d The other parts of the marks have little, if any, trademark significance, that is to say they would not tend to indicate origin. \u201cFoot\u201d is quite descriptive of shoes and shoes are sold in pairs, the shoes of each pair being \u201cmates.\u201d \u201cThrill\u201d is, therefore, the significant portion of each mark and entirely arbitrary when applied to shoes, notwithstanding it is a common English word.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">The issue here is not likelihood that purchasers would confuse <em>the marks </em>on the basis of side-by-side comparison. We think it is reasonable to say that average purchasers of shoes may be confused as to <em>the origin of the goods </em>where the two marks here involved are applied to similar shoes. It is, in our opinion, of little or no significance that opposer has produced no evidence of actual confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">We think concurrent use of the instant mark would be likely to result in at least some confusion as to origin. We must, therefore, affirm the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">WORLEY, C. J., and JOHNSON, J., dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b227-14\">. Sec. 2(d) provides, with certain specified exceptions, that no trademark shall be registered if it \u201cconsists of or comprises a mark which so resembles a mark registered in the Patent Office or a mark or trade name previously used in the United States by another and not abandoned, as to be likely, when applied to-the goods of applicant, to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers.\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b228-13\">MARTIN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A5J\">(concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">In my opinion, this case is one which raises some doubt as to whether concur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>rent use of the instant marks would re-suit in confusion as to origin. Any such doubt must be resolved against the newcomer, and for this reason only I join in the affirmance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
