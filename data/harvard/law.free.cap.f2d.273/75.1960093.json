Anderson had a table knife \u201cinto a. quantity of white powder\u201d and Mrs. McClearn had a hypodermic needle and syringe in her hand. After arresting them, the officers found in the room and seized another quantity of powder and certain paraphernalia used in preparing and administering drugs. The white powder proved to be heroin. Both prisoners told the police Anderson had brought the drug to the room. In due course they were indicted and tried for trafficking in narcotic drugs. Both were convicted, but only Anderson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">The search warrant was issued on the basis of a police officer\u2019s affidavit as to what he had observed, and what he had been told by an informer proved by experience to be reliable. The informer had said narcotic drugs were being sold at 1737 North Capitol Street by Charles McClearn, to whom Spurgeon Anderson made daily deliveries of the contraband.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">Anderson\u2019s sole reason for reversal is his contention that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a bill of particulars by which he sought to learn the name of the informer. He concedes he lacked standing to attack the search warrant but says the name of the informer would have been helpful to him in preparing his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">It is not claimed that the informer had participated in the commission of the offenses for which Anderson was indict-' ed, and indeed he had not done so. In these circumstances, revealing his identity was neither essential, relevant nor helpful in the preparation of Anderson\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
