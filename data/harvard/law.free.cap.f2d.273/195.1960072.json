Clark, D.C. D.Md.1959, 169 F.Supp. 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-14\"> It is emphasized that the rider agreement dated June 30, 1943, was construed by the District Court to be an alternative continuing offer unsupported by consideration, and thus revocable by lessors at any time prior to the acceptance of the offer by Gulf Oil Corporation. See 17 C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 50a (1939). Gulf chose to accept the alternative which allowed it to extend the term of the original lease by <em>22y2 </em>months at the rental provided <em>therein. </em>This acceptance, having been made before revocation of the offer by the lessors, binds the parties to recognize that the lease agreement, including and subject to <em>all </em>its provisions and conditions, was extended to September 14, 1958. The lessors could have protected their interests by revoking the offer before it was accepted. This they failed to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-16\">The decision of the District Court will be</p>\n<p id=\"b244-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
