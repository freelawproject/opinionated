MILLER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AL7e\">Pursuant to charges made by Virginia-Carolina Freight Lines, Inc., the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board filed with the Board on August 26, 1958, a complaint alleging Highway Truck Drivers Local 107 of the Teamsters union <footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>had engaged in unfair labor practices in violation of subsections (1) (A) and (4) (A) of \u00a7 8(b) of the National Labor Relations Act as amended, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 151 et seq., 61 Stat. 136.\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">Specifically the General Counsel alleged that on or about July 15, 1958, and on other dates, one William \u201cGoldie\u201d James, a representative of the Teamsters union, threatened employees of Virginia-Carolina with violence to their persons and trucks and so restrained and coerced them in the exercise of rights guaranteed by \u00a7 7 of the Act; and that on or about July 15, 1958, the Teamsters union through its representative James ordered, directed, instructed and appealed to the employees of David Weber Company not to unload the trucks of Virginia-Carolina, with an object of forcing or requiring Weber to cease doing business with Virginia-Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">After conducting a hearing, a trial examiner filed an Intermediate Report in which he made findings of fact, upon the basis of which he concluded the Teamsters union had engaged in the unfair labor practices with which it was charged, and recommended that a cease and desist order be entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-16\">The Board affirmed the rulings of the examiner, adopted his findings, conclusions and recommendations,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and ordered that the Teamsters union, its officers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>representatives, agents, successors and assigns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-4\">\u201c1. Cease and desist from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-5\">\u201c(a) Inducing or encouraging employees of David Weber Company, or any other employer, to engage in a strike or a concerted refusal in the course of their employment to use, manufacture, process, transport, or otherwise handle or work on any goods, articles, materials, or commodities, or to perform any services for their employer, where an object thereof is to force or require David Weber Company or any other employer to cease doing business with Virginia-Carolina Freight Lines, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-6\">\u201c(b) Restraining and coercing the employees of Virginia-Carolina Freight Lines, Inc., by threats of physical harm, or by like or related conduct restraining or coercing employees of other employers doing business with Virginia-Carolina Freight Lines, Inc., in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">The Teamsters union has petitioned for review of the Board\u2019s order and the Board has asked us to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">The findings made by the examiner and adopted by the Board, which we think are supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole, may be quickly summarized.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">In the early morning of July 15, 1958, four Virginia-Carolina trucks with merchandise for David Weber Company arrived at the latter\u2019s plant in Philadelphia. As the Weber receiving bay could accommodate only one vehicle, it was necessary for the trucks to be unloaded one at a time. Before 9:00 a. m. the first Virginia-Carolina truck had been unloaded and the second was in the receiving bay. Charles Echols, the last driver to arrive, was about to move his truck to allow Walter Branch, the driver of the third truck, to back into the bay, when William James, an organizer for the union, arrived in an automobile which he parked in such a position as to prevent Echols from moving. James had been sent by the union, which was striking against Virginia-Carolina, to \u201cget\u201d its trucks at the Weber plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-11\">The organizer asked Echols why he was working and whether he was \u201ctrying to foul things up,\u201d and took Echols\u2019 name and address. He approached Pratt, a helper on Branch\u2019s Virginia-Carolina truck, mentioned the strike, and said \u201cif this kept up somebody might get hurt.\u201d This statement seems to have intimidated Pratt, for he gave a fictitious name when James demanded that he identify himself. After this episode, James reprimanded Branch for working during the strike, and went to the Weber receiving bay where Halmon and Green, Weber employees, had just finished unloading a Virginia-Carolina truck. Hal-mon heard James say they were not supposed to unload Virginia-Carolina trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-12\">James remained at the scene all day and at times acted as a picket. He testified, <em>inter alia, </em>of a conversation he had with one Marshall Corum, a Virginia-Carolina driver. He attributed foul and abusive language to Corum, to which he said he replied in kind, and quoted the driver as saying, \u201cI am going to make a living, and you are not going to stop me.\u201d James said he replied, \u201cWe are going to stop you if you back in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-13\">The parties have stipulated that four questions are presented here. The first question is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b865-14\">\u201cWhether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that petitioner violated Section 8(b) (4) (A) of the National Labor Relations Act, by inducing and encouraging employees of David Weber Company to engage in concerted refusals in the course of their employment to perform work or services for their employer, for an object of forcing or requiring Weber to cease doing business with Virginia-Carolina Freight Lines, Inc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>The Teamsters union argues that the Board\u2019s finding of a violation is based <em>solely </em>upon an inference' that the union\u2019s picket made a statement to an employee of the secondary employer and that \u201cthe inference was made * * * despite the fact that the employe did not know the statement was made to him. Substantial evidence in this case does not support the Board\u2019s finding that the Union\u2019s conduct was directed at the secondary employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">We are constrained to reject the argument. Halmon and Green were Weber employees whose duty it was to unload incoming trucks. Halmon heard the organizer say \u201cwe wasn\u2019t supposed to unload\u201d Virginia-Carolina trucks. In an affidavit made soon after the occurrence, Green quoted James as saying, \u201cYou aren\u2019t supposed to unload Virginia-Carolina;\u201d and in an accompanying affidavit Halmon agreed James had made the statement. In testifying before the trial examiner, however, he said he did not know the picket\u2019s remark was addressed to him and Green. Obviously he did know it, however, for he admitted that he and Green did the unloading.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Clearly, the organizer\u2019s remark was addressed to them, and not to Virginia-Carolina drivers who did not unload their trucks. No more Virginia-Carolina trucks were unloaded that day. The union says unloading was stopped solely on the order of the Weber superintendent. It seems fair to assume, however, that the order was given because of the organizer\u2019s protest against participation in the work by Weber employees. But, regardless of whether the union succeeded in inducing Weber employees to stop unloading Virginia-Carolina trucks, its attempt to do so was an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We hold therefore that the purpose behind James\u2019 direct appeal to Weber employees not to unload Virginia-Carolina trucks was \u201cto tie up the freight,\u201d as he put it, and so to force Weber to cease doing business with Virginia-Carolina. This was a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (4) (A) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">The second question is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">\u201cWhether substantial evidence on the record as a whole supports the Board\u2019s finding that petitioner threatened employees of Virginia-Carolina with physical harm, in violation of Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">There was substantial evidence on the whole record that the Teamsters union through its picket-organizer threatened bodily harm to Virginia-Carolina drivers if they continued to operate their trucks during the strike. This tended, we think, to restrain and coerce the threatened employees in the exercise of their right to refrain from cooperating with the Teamsters union in its strike against the Virginia-Carolina company. The right to refrain from such \u201cconcerted activities\u201d is guaranteed by \u00a7 7 of the Act. We conclude therefore that the record shows a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">The third question is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atc-dedup-0\">\u201cWhether the Board\u2019s Order remedying the alleged violation of Section 8(b) (1) (A) of the Act is valid and proper in view of the nature of the alleged violation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">The Teamsters union says this question should be answered in the negative because the alleged violation consisted of the \u201csingle isolated statement\u201d that \u201csomebody might get hurt.\u201d We cannot agree that a threat of physical violence should be disregarded because the evidence does not show it was repeated. James\u2019 threat constituted positive and purposeful action to deter the Virginia-Carolina drivers from working to avoid physical harm; the Board was, therefore, clearly warranted in characterizing it as unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">The fourth question is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW3B\">\u201cWhether the Board\u2019s Order pertaining to the alleged violations of Sections 8(b) (1) (A) and 8(b) (4) (A) of the Act is valid and proper insofar as it extends in scope to \u2018any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>other employer\u2019 or to \u2018employees of other employers.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">We think the Board\u2019s order should be limited to the employees of the Virginia-Carolina company and the David Weber Company, with respect to whom it was proved the union had violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(b) (1) (A) and 8(b) (4) (A). The words \u201cor any other employer\u201d in paragraph 1(a) of the Board\u2019s order, and the words \u201cor by like or related conduct restraining or coercing employees of other employers doing business with Virginia-Carolina Freight Lines, Inc.\u201d in paragraph 1(b), will be stricken from the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">As so modified, the order will be enforced. The notice to be posted by the Teamsters union will be corrected accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b864-8\">.
