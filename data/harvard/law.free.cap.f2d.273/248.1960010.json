Lester Hash (taxpayer) for the calendar year 1953. The deficiency resulted from the determination by the Commissioner that an amount of $12,284.97, credited in 1953 to taxpayer\u2019s personal account on the books of a corporation of which he was president, was taxable as a dividend constructively received by taxpayer in that year. The Tax Court sustained the Commissioner, T.C.Memo.X959 \u2014 96, finding that the amount credited was income to taxpayer under secs. 22(a) and 115(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">Taxpayer resides in Beckley, W. Va. He is president and a stockholder of the Hash Furniture Company (the corporation), which was organized on May 1, 1946.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Before that date, the present stockholders had carried on as partners the business which was taken over by the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">In 1944 and 1945, the partnership had made investments in the Harrisburg Broadcasting Company, another partnership. On May 1, 1946, an asset account, entitled \u201cInvestment in Affiliate (Harrisburg Broadcasting Co.)\u201d, showing a debit balance of $38,820.89, was set up on the books of the corporation. From <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>time to time various debits and credits were entered in this account on the books of the corporation, most of which are not explained in the evidence or by reference to the account itself. In 1948, the corporation reported income of $25,-690.27 from this investment, entered that amount as a debit to the investment account, and paid income tax thereon. As of April 30, 1950, the debit balance in this investment account, in the amount of $39,190.27, was written off by a charge to taxpayer\u2019s personal drawing account, so that, according to the books, taxpayer\u2019s obligation to pay the corporation $39,190.27 took the place of this \u201cInvestment in Affiliate\u201d as an asset of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">At some time, whether before or after April 30, 1950, does not appear, and for reasons which do not appear in this record, the Commissioner determined that the $25,690.27 should properly have been treated as income to taxpayer in 1948 and not as income to the corporation. Taxpayer agreed to this determination in 1952 and paid the additional individual income tax for the year 1948 required thereby. The corporation, filed a claim for refund, and in August, 1953, received a refund in the principal amount of $12,284.97. After receipt of the refund, and during the year 1953, taxpayer\u2019s personal account on the books of the corporation was credited with $12,-284.97, reducing the debit balance of that account (i. e. taxpayer\u2019s indebtedness to the corporation) to $36,091.15. It is this credit which the Commissioner found taxable as a dividend to taxpayer in 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">It is stipulated that throughout the year 1953 the corporation had accumulated earnings and profits substantially in excess of $12,284.97.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">It is well settled that corporate profits may be distributed other than by a formal dividend declaration. Regensburg v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 41, certiorari denied 323 U.S. 783, 65 S.Ct. 272, 89 L.Ed. 625; Helvering v. Gordon, 8 Cir., 87 F.2d 663; Paramount-Riehards Theatres v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 153 F.2d 602; cf. Wall v. United States, 4 Cir., 164 F.2d 462. If a stockholder derives economic benefit it is immaterial in what manner the distribution takes place. Lincoln Nat. Bank v. Burnet, 61 App.D.C. 354, 63 F. 2d 131. This is true whether or not a dividend is intended by the directors, Waldheim v. Commissioner, 7 Cir., 244 F.2d 1, Hadley v. Commissioner, 59 App. D.C. 139, 36 F.2d 543, and whether or not the shareholder actually draws on the sums made available to him, Brooks v. Commissioner, 4 Cir., 35 F.2d 178. Cancellation by a corporation of a debt due from a stockholder has been held to constitute the receipt of a constructive dividend. Waggaman v. Helvering, 64 App. D.C. 371, 78 F.2d 721, certiorari denied 296 U.S. 618, 56 S.Ct. 139, 80 L.Ed 439; Hudson v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 99 F.2d 630, certiorari denied 306 U.S. 644, 59 S.Ct. 584, 83 L.Ed. 1044; Wilson\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner, 5 Cir., 255 F.2d 702, affirming per curiam 27 T.C. 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Taxpayer argues that the credit of $12,284.97 to his personal account \u201cwas-merely a bookkeeping entry, an erroneous one at that, from which [taxpayer]; did not even receive any economic benefit\u201d. This argument is based upon taxpayer\u2019s contentions: that when the investment account in the amount of $39,-190.27, \u201cincluding\u201d the $25,690.27, was. removed from the books of the corporation as an asset, it should have been charged to earned surplus, and that the entry showing a liability on taxpayer\u2019s, part to repay that amount to the corporation was erroneous, at least to the extent of $25,690.27;- that the tax refund' of $12,284.97 should have been credited to earned surplus and not to taxpayer\u2019s, personal account; and that the credit of $12,284.97 to taxpayer\u2019s account should be treated as a partial correction of the original error.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Taxpayer\u2019s argument is not supported by the record. The proper entry or entries which should have been made at the time the investment account was. closed out and charged to the taxpayer depended upon the nature of the agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>ment or understanding between taxpayer and the directors of the corporation, who represented all the stockholders. The record does not show what that agreement or understanding was. The investment account had been set up as an asset of the corporation, evidently because, as appears from taxpayer\u2019s petition, the \u201ccontributions\u201d to the capital account of the Harrisburg Broadcasting Company had been made by checks of the Hash Furniture Company. The \u25a0other stockholders have an interest in the question how the transactions should have been handled on the books of the corporation, and that question will not be decided here. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that we cannot find \"from the record in this case that the \u2022entry charging the entire amount of the investment account to taxpayer was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">It is probably true that the tax refund should have been credited to earned surplus in the first instance, and the \u201cdividend\u201d to taxpayer charged against earned surplus, but the net result of the one-step entry was the same as the net result of the two-step entry would have been. To constitute a dividend it is not required that the surplus account be charged; the receipt of economic benefit by the stockholder is all that is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">While it is true that bookkeeping entries are not determinative of tax liability, Helvering v. Midland Mut. Life Ins. Co., 300 U.S. 216, 57 S.Ct. 423, 81 L.Ed. 612, the credit of $12,284.97 to taxpayer\u2019s personal account in 1953 reduced <em>pro tanto </em>taxpayer\u2019s debt to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">As noted above, the evidence does not show that the transfer of the investment account as a debit to taxpayer\u2019s personal account was erroneous. Nor does the evidence show that the credit of $12,284.97 to taxpayer\u2019s account was intended as a partial correction of that entry. As the Tax Court said, taxpayer \u201chas made no showing that the transaction in issue was not in fact exactly what the book entry showed it to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">The $12,284.97 was properly included in taxpayer\u2019s income for 1953.
