As against three of the-defendants, the appellees, the action was-, dismissed for lack of personal jurisdietion. The action remained pending-against the others. The judgment of' dismissal contained a direction, such as-, is provided for by amended Rule 54(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,. 28 U.S.C.A., that there was no just reason for delay and that judgment be en~ tered in favor of the three defendants. Thereupon plaintiff filed timely notice of appeal. Amended Rule 54(b) expressly deals with multiple claims; consequent-the weiSht of authority has held that m situations involving multiple parties-. but only a single claim, a 54(b) certificate-is ineffective to make appealable a judgment dismissing the action against some-Parties but leavin&amp; it; Pending against other<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Some decisions in the Second Circuit appear to have taken a contrary yiew Lopinsky v.

Masterpiece-Prodiuctions, Inc., 2 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d. 213. On further consideration we have concluded that the Fifth, the Eighth,, the Ninth and, as we read its opinions,. the Seventh Circuit have been correct in. thinking that amended Rule 54(b) does. not allow a finding of finality in the ease here presented where a single claim against multiple parties is dismissed as against some but not all. In conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>qu.ence we must dismiss the appeals for want of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"A_g\">Appeals dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"avm-dedup-0\">.

However, since here \u201cthe question of jurisdiction was not obviously settled by prior decisions,\u201d the appropriate course is, in dismissing the appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, also to vacate Judge Palmieri\u2019s judgment of September 1, 1959, for the sole purpose of permitting him to \u201center a fresh decree\u201d in which he may include the statement described in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) if in his full discretion he determines that such a statement is here justified.
