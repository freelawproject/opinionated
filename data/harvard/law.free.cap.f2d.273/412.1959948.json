The motion contains the following ground:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aij-dedup-0\">\u201c3. The Court is most respect- \u201e \u201e , , , ., fully requested to reconsider its con-elusion from the evidence that <em>\u2018At Bridge-man\u2019s Request </em>(Italics) they entered the house * * *\u2019(0.2). Bridgeman testified (R. 164) that he gave his permission conditioned upon \u2018if it\u2019s what I think it is, what it smells like\u2019 and only then after the officers asked him for his permission.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6L\">In view 0f the emphasis which we placed on the fact that the entry was at Bridgeman\u2019s request, we think it appropriate to answer this ground of the mo-\u00a1\u00bfon pointing out that the testimony 0f the State Officer contained the follow-^ng passage'</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6u\">\u201e Aad <em>m </em>^ 0 Mr. Bridgeman&gt; tell ou to g0 in there and gee about it and gee what was inhishouse? A. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"asj-dedup-0\">Based on this evidence the trial court found thf Bndgeman \u201cn,ot ed but asked the officers to go m and see about it.\u201d We think that our conclusion that the officers entered the house \u201cat Bridgeman\u2019s request\u201d is a proper condusion on this state of the record.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
