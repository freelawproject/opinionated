Petitioner now contends that he was guilty only of larceny, 18 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(b) which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years but that he was not guilty of unlawful entry, \u00a7 2113 (a), which has a maximum sentence of 20 years. Reliance on Prince v. United States, 1957, 352 U.S. 322, 77 S.Ct. 403, 1 L.Ed.2d 370, is misplaced as the Prince case merely proscribes the pyramiding of sentences for unlawful entry with intent to commit a felony or larceny, \u00a7 2113(a), and the consummated larceny or robbery, \u00a7 2113(b). But this does not effect a merger of the two distinct offenses. United States v. Williamson, 5 Cir., 1958, 255 F.2d 512; Id., 5 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 236. Petitioner here was charged with and convicted of unlawful entry alone and the District Court was correct in concluding that the motion and the files and records of the case conclusively show that petitioner was entitled to no relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
