This appeal ensued.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The first count was based upon the first paragraph of Section 545, quoted in footnote 1, supra, and charged that on or about September 4, 1958, in El Paso County, Texas, the defendant \u201cwith intent to defraud the United States, knowingly and wilfully smuggled and clandestinely introduced into the United States certain merchandise which had not been invoiced as required by law, to wit, One Lady\u2019s Diamond Ring, Emerald cut, approximately 2% carat in an iridium platinum setting; One Man\u2019s Diamond Ring, approximately 2 carats, in white gold setting; One Man\u2019s Diamond Ring, approximately 1 carat, in white gold setting; Four Lady\u2019s Rings with semiprecious stones and Four Man\u2019s Rings with semi-precious stones, and One 21 Jewel Man\u2019s Longines Wrist Watch in platinum case with platinum bracelet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">The second count was based upon the second paragraph of Section 545, quoted in footnote 1, supra. The time, place, and the description of the jewelry or merchandise were the same as in the first count. The second count charged that the defendant \u201cfraudulently and knowingly concealed and facilitated the transportation and concealment after importation of\u201d said described jewelry or merchandise \u201cknowing the same to have been-imported and brought into the United States contrary to law, and without having been invoiced as required by law.\u201d'</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">The appellant\u2019s first insistence on error is in the denial of his motion to dismiss the indictment because each count failed to show that any particular law required that the articles be invoiced, and the words \u201ccontrary to law\u201d' in the second count were insufficient without the allegation of additional facts-, coupled with the violation of some specific law claimed to be violated. The Government filed what it termed a \u201ccontroverting motion,\u201d paragraph numbered III of which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-14\">\u201cIf the defendant desired additional information or facts concerning the alleged violation, the said defendant should have made his motion for a bill of particulars as to-the desired information, which was-not done; that the defendant and his attorneys are well aware that the merchandise was smuggled and introduced into this country and was-transported and concealed in this country without having been invoiced as required under Title 19, Section 1484, United States Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>In Dunbar v. United States, 1895, 156 U.S. 185, 193, 15 S.Ct. 325, 328, 39 L.Ed. 390, the Court approved as the general understanding of the meaning of \u201csmuggling,\u201d Bouvier\u2019s definition, \u201cThe fraudulent taking into a country, or out of it, merchandise which is lawfully prohibited.\u201d In the leading case of Keck v. United States, 1899, 172 U.S. 434, 455, 19 S.Ct. 254, 43 L.Ed. 505, the Court construed the predecessor to Title 18, Section 545, United States Code, and commented at great length on the meaning of \u201csmuggles, or clandestinely introduces\u201d in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201cA reference to the English statutes sustains the statement of the text writers above quoted that the words \u2018smuggling\u2019 and \u2018clandestine introduction,\u2019 so far at least as respected the introduction of dutiable goods from without the kingdom, signified the bringing of the goods on land, without authority of law, in order to evade the payment of duty; thus illegally crossing the line of the customs authorities.\u201d Keck v. United States, supra, 172 U.S. at pages 446, 447, 19 S.Ct. at page 258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ap-dedup-0\">See also Wong Bing Nung v. United States, 9 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 917, 919; Hill v. United States, 4 Cir., 1930, 42 F.2d 812, 814; Tomplain v. United States, 5 Cir., 1930, 42 F.2d 203, 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">In the Keck case, supra, a count was held sufficient which charged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201c * * * in substance that Keck \u2018did knowingly, willfully and unlawfully, and with intent to defraud the revenue of the United States, smuggle and clandestinely introduce into the United States, to wit, into the port of Philadelphia,\u2019 certain \u2018diamonds\u2019 of a stated value, which should have been invoiced, and duty thereon paid or accounted for, but which, to the knowledge of Keck and with intent to defraud the revenue, were not invoiced nor the duty paid or accounted for.\u201d 172 U.S. at page 438, 19 S.Ct. at page 255.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">In Hill v. United States, supra, the Fourth Circuit said that there could be no question as to the sufficiency of a count charging smuggling and clandestine introduction in the language of the former statute, and commented generally, \u201cThe time has passed when convictions will be reversed in the courts of the United States for mere technical defects in pleading.\u201d 42 F.2d 812, 814. See also Rules 2 and 7(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C. \u201cdesigned to eliminate technicalities in criminal pleading and to simplify procedure.\u201d Contreras v. United States, 5 Cir., 1954, 213 F.2d 96, 99.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The opinion in Babb v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 218 F.2d 538, 540, carefully pointed out that the indictment there held insufficient was under the second distinct paragraph of Section 545, quoted in footnote 1, supra, and explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">\u201cThere is a vast difference between smuggling, clandestinely introducing, using false or forged documents, etc., on the one hand, and importing, bringing in or receiving, etc., merchandise, since the first manifestly is unlawful and evil per se, while importing, bringing in, receiving, etc., after importation, is not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">See also particularly footnotes 3, 4, and 7 to that opinion. In the present case, we conclude that the first count was clearly sufficient as against the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-13\">When the second count used the phrase, \u201cwithout having been invoiced as required by law,\u201d the omission of the citation of Section 1484 of Title 19, U.S.C.A. supplied by the Government\u2019s \u201ccontroverting motion\u201d did not furnish ground for the dismissal of the count. Rule 7(c), Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Under the holding of the last Babb case, 5 Cir., 1958, 252 F.2d 702, we think that the second count also was entirely sufficient as against the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-14\">As we construe the Government\u2019s \u201ccontroverting motion\u201d from which we have quoted, 273 F.2d at page 58, it relied as to the first count on the well-understood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>meaning of the words \u201csmuggled and clandestinely introduced into the United States,\u201d but, as to the second count, it elected to rely upon the claimed violation of Section 1484, Title 19, U.S.C.A. Unfortunately for the Government, however, no attempt was made to prove one of the requirements of that Section. The Act of August 8, 1953, c. 397, \u00a7 16(b), 67 Stat. 509, 517, substituted \u201cfive days\u201d for \u201cforty-eight hours\u201d in the second sentence of Section 1484(a) so as to allow entry to be made within five days after the report of the vehicle. According to the Government\u2019s evidence, the defendant in his automobile entered the United States from Mexico by way of the Santa Pe Street Bridge at El Paso, Texas, and passed through one of the customs inspection lanes provided at the end of that bridge \u2014 all on September 4,1958. The proof of failure to make entry for the jewelry or merchandise described in the indictment extended only through September 6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">The defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction. Rule 29, Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, does not require the grounds of such a motion to be more specifically stated. See United States v. Jones, 7 Cir., 1949, 174 F.2d 746, 748. Without more, then, we must hold that the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal as to the second count would require a reversal unless the two-year concurrent sentence can be sustained under the first count. See Abrams v. United States, 1919, 250 U.S. 616, 619, 40 S.Ct. 17, 63 L.Ed. 1173; Sinclair v. United States, 1929, 279 U.S. 263, 299, 49 S.Ct. 268, 73 L.Ed. 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The defendant\u2019s arrest and prosecution grew out of his surveillance by two detectives of the El Paso Police Department who suspected that he might be bringing crooked gambling paraphernalia from Mexico into the United States. A considerable part of the testimony is directed to showing that the diamonds and jewelry found in his possession were to be used as a part of a fraudulent scheme. The appellant urges that the district court erred in admitting all such evidence. The Government insists that concealment of the intended illegal use of the jewelry and merchandise showed the defendant\u2019s purpose or motive in committing the crimes with which he was charged. We have heretofore held that the district court exercises a broad discretion in admitting this type of testimony to show the defendant's motive, but that the jury should be cautioned that the evidence is admitted only for the light that it might throw on the federal offenses on trial; that care should be exercised by the court to avoid a conviction of the defendant for the federal offenses, merely because the jury concluded that he was committing other crimes. Montgomery v. United States, 5 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d 887, 891; Ford v. United States, 5 Cir., 1954, 210 F.2d 313, 317; Baker v. United States, 5 Cir., 1955, 227 F.2d 376, 377; Ehrlich v. United States, 5 Cir., 1956, 238 F.2d 481, 484. See 22 C.J.S. Criminal Law \u00a7 687; 2 Wigmore on Evidence, 3rd ed., Sections 300, et seq. While we find no reversible error in the admission of this type of evidence, we think that upon another trial the district court may well exercise greater caution to confine the jury to its consideration only insofar as relevant to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence of the particular offenses charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Appellant urges that the district court erred in denying defendant\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>tion to suppress as evidence and to return the property seized by the State officers in alleged violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States. Unless and until the Supreme Court rules otherwise,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Circuit is committed to recognition of the doctrine announced in Weeks v. United States, 1914, 232 U.S. 383, 398, 34 S.Ct. 341, 58 L.Ed. 652, that property illegally seized by state officers under no claim of federal authority and without federal participation is admissible in evidence. Fredericks v. United States, 5 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 712, 714; Serio v. United States, 5 Cir., 1953, 203 F.2d 576, 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">One of the issues in this case was whether the jewelry was on the \u201cfree list,\u201d that is, exempt from duty, more particularly under Title 19, United States Code, Section 1201, Paragraph 1798(c) d):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201c(c) In the case of any person arriving in the United States who is a returning resident thereof\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-8\">\u201c(1) all personal and household effects taken abroad by him or for his account and brought back by him or for his account. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the district court permitted the Government witness, Herman Cherry, a Supervisory Customs Inspector with 28 years experience, to testify to his construction and interpretation of the custom laws, statutes, rules and regulations and to give his opinion that the jewelry found in the possession of the defendant was of a commercial nature rather than personal effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">Of course, the Government cannot in this manner be permitted to substitute its witness for the Court in charging the jury as to the applicable law. 7 Wig-more on Evidence, 3rd ed., Section 1952. Nor was the witness\u2019 opinion and conclusion admissible as to one of the ultimate facts to be decided by the jury. Mack v. United States, 5 Cir., 1959, 268 F.2d 931, 934. This testimony was highly prejudicial, and the error in its admission necessitates a reversal of the judgment of conviction on Count 1 as well as on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-12\">It is not necessary to rule upon the numerous other claimed errors. Some of them are not substantial and the others need not and probably will not recur upon another trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-13\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b106-9\">. That section reads in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">\u201c\u00a7 545. <em>Smuggling goods into the United States</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">\u201cWhoever knowingly and willfully, with intent to defraud the United States, smuggles, or clandestinely introduces into the United States any merchandise which should have been invoiced, or makes out or passes, or attempts to pass, through the customhouse any false, forged, or fraudulent invoice, or other document or paper; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-15\">\u201cWhoever fraudulently or knowingly imports or brings into the United States, any merchandise contrary to law, or receives, conceals, buys, sells, or in any manner facilitates the transportation, concealment, or sale of such merchandise after importation, knowing the same to have been imported or brought into the United States contrary to law\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-16\">\u201cShall be fined not more than $10,000 or imprisoned not more than five years, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-6\">.
