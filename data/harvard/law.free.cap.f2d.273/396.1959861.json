The correctness of plaintiff\u2019s account is not in dispute; the issue litigated was whether defendants were entitled to an offset <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>in the sum of $6,392.58 for adjustments claimed to have been made by them with their customers on defective tires. Plaintiff unsuccessfully moved the court for a directed verdict for the full amount sued for. The issue was submitted to the jury which found for plaintiff in the amount of $2,950, thus in effect allowing defendants a portion of their claimed offset.</p>\n<p id=\"A57\">Here, as in the trial court, plaintiff contends that the evidence was wholly insufficient to create a jury issue on defendants\u2019 pleaded offset. In defense of the counterclaim or set-off, plaintiff set up a written contract designated \u201cDun-lop-Dealer Franchise,\u201d dated March 4, 1957, which provided inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"agb-dedup-0\">\u201c7. Adjustments: The Dealer shall refer to Dunlop, in accordance with procedure established by Dun-lop, all claims for adjustment or replacement of Dunlop Tires, Tubes or Batteries and shall await Dunlop\u2019s approval and instructions before making any adjustment or replacement for account of Dunlop. Any adjustments approved by Dunlop are handled for the user through the Dealer. When approved adjustments are handled for the customer through the Dealer, Dunlop will allow the Dealer a merchandise credit equal to 10% of price of the adjustment charged to the customer, the Dealer to pay transportation charges. It is understood that the Dealer is not authorized to make adjustments on behalf of Dunlop nor is the Dealer authorized to guarantee any product sold hereunder, except as set forth in Dunlop\u2019s written Guarantee or adjustment policy in effect at the ^me</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV__\">... \u2018 10. No Modification: This franchise, which supersedes and cancels all other franchises referring to the subject matter hereof except the Dealer\u2019s obligation to make full payment for any merchandise purchased thereunder, Sets Forth the Entire Franchise between the Parties Hereto and Has Been Entered into Only Under the Inducements and Representations Herein Expressed. * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A47\">\u201cThis franchise may be signed without alteration of printed condition and/or cancelled in its entirety by the General Sales Manager, Division Manager or any officer of Dunlop, but its provisions cannot be altered, waived or modified except in writing signed by the Dealer and by Dunlop\u2019s General Sales Manager, or any officer of Dunlop.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AI0\">It is defendants\u2019 position that paragraph 7, which clearly sets out the procedures to be followed with respect to claims for adjustment or replacement of DunloP tires- was changed or enlarged uPon ^ an oral contract claimed to have been entered into after the execution of the written contract. In defendants\u2019 original \u201cset-off and counterclaim\u201d filed Au-Sust 4- 1958&gt; they Pleaded that the tires were Purchased pursuant to representations of quality made by one Pete Wisner, plaintiff\u2019s agent; that the tires purchased by defendants were defective, as ^be rssult of which they became obligated to make adjustments to their customers \u2122 ^be amount of their claimed offset. In their Amendment to Answer, Set-Off and Counterclaim filed October 1, 1958, defendants alleged that after the March contract was signed the parties entered into an agreement, the same being *n addition to the original conti act, and beinS a change and innovation in so far as Paragraphs 5, 7 and 8 of the original contract is involved, and being an enlargement thereof, the said innovation b^ine as follows:\u201d Then followed allegations to the effect that it was agreed defendants could make adjustments as they saw fit and advise plaintiff and plaintiff WOuld accept the adjustments so made give defendants credit therefor,</p>\n<p id=\"AQ4\">The rules of law applicable to the issues before us have universal reeognition and may be stated simply:<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> All antecedent and contemporaneous negoti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>ations, conversations and representations are deemed to have been merged into the written agreement of the parties and it is conclusively presumed that the whole agreement between the parties was reduced to writing. Jeter v. Windle, Ark., 319 S.W.2d 825, 827; Cox v. Smith, 99 Ark. 218, 138 S.W. 978; 17 C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 381; 12 Am.Jur. Contracts \u00a7 428. In the absence of fraud or mistake, where a written contract is plain, unambiguous and complete in its terms, parol evidence may not be used to contradict, vary or add to any of its provisions. Jeter v. Windle, supra, 319 S.W.2d at page 827; Cox v. Smith, supra, at page 980; 32 C.J.S. Evidence \u00a7 901; 12 Am.Jur. Contracts \u00a7 428. Professor Corbin has stated the rule in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aby-dedup-0\">. When two parties have made a , , , .... contract and have expressed it m a ... , , . _ writing to which they have both assented as the complete and accurate integration of that contract, evidence, whether parol or otherwise, of antecedent understandings and negotiations will not be admitted for the purpose of varying or contradicting the writing. This is in substance what is called the \u2018parol evidence rule\u2019, a rule that scarcely deserves to be called a rule of evidence of any kind, and a rule that is as truly applicable to written evidence as to parol evidence.\u201d Vol. 3, Corbin on Contracts, 1951 Ed. \u00a7 573, P- 215.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvP\">Parties to an unperformed or executory contract may change or modify it by mutual consent, and resort may be had to any competent evidence, parol or otherwise, for the purpose of establishing, by clear and convincing proof, a subsequent novation or modification of the written contract. Lemm v. Sparks, Ark., 321 S. W.2d 388, 390; Elkins v. Henry Vogt Mach. Co., 125 Ark. 6, 187 S.W. 663, 664; Corbin on Contracts Vol. 3, \u00a7 574; 12 <em>Am.Jur. Contracts </em>\u00a7 428; 17 C.J.S. Contracts \u00a7 373.</p>\n<p id=\"AMY\"> We have carefully reviewed the evidence and, giving the defendants the benefit of all favorable inferences that legitimately may be drawn therefrom, we are satisfied that it affords absolutely no proof that any of the terms of the written contract were modified by a subsequent mutual agreement of the parties,</p>\n<p id=\"AV_o\">Fred Thompson, principal owner of defendants\u2019 business, testified that on March 4, 1957, and shortly after the written contract was signed by him, he had this conversation with Mr. Wisner, plaintiff\u2019s sales representative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8i\">\u201e , , , 1 wouId <em>*\u00bb* </em>the da^ 1 signed the contract 1 sald\u2019 That ,1S fif\u2019 Wlsner- 1 want ^ and ^ br\u00b0ther <em>g0 </em>down and ca^ on one \u00b0f my best customers.

The only thing that he told me in the way of guarantee that is, for an adjustment, that anything that was wrong with the tire that I had that it would be taken care of with Fred Thompson Buick Company.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AxgK\">jt js defendants\u2019 position that the fore- \u00a1 testimony was sufficient in law to permit the jury t0 find that Para^raPb 7 0f \u00a3he written contract had been modified by mutual agreement of the parties so as to authorize defendants to make ad-justments directly with their customers, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>with subsequent reimbursement to defendants by plaintiff for adjustments so made.</p>\n<p id=\"AQN\">Aside from any discussion of Wisner\u2019s authority to so modify the written eon-tract,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or of the question of whether defendants successfully establish\u00e9d the existence of this new agreement by clear and convincing proof,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a further review of Fred Thompson\u2019s own testimony conclusively demonstrates that the above conversations had on March 4 were but a continuation or reiteration of negotiations antedating the execution of the written contract. Thus, Mr. Thompson es 1 e '</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyB\">\u201cPrior to March 4, 1957, for a period of several weeks I had been negotiating with Dunlop through its agents, Mr. Wisner and Mr. Edwards (Division Manager). \u2019/ * * Before March 4th, I talked with Ed- , ,, \u2019 , ,, ,, wards over the telephone. *** TTr ,, We discussed thoroughly over the telephone before ifich 4, 1957, their policy of adjustment. I told Mr. Edwards that Wisner had told me about their policy on adjustments. Mr. Edwards knew at that time that I was considering signing a dealer\u2019s franchise agreement with him and we discussed that possibility. I had made up my mind at that time that I was going to sign with them. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afz\">\u201cQ. Now, all of the understanding with reference to how the adjustments would be handled, were agreed upon between you and Mr. Edwards before March 4th, 1957, weren\u2019t they? A. Yes, sir. No, I wouldn\u2019t say before. We discussed that about 30 days, the types of adjustments and so forth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap3\">\u201cQ. You wanted to be very careful about what their policy was with reference to adjustments before you entered into any deal with them, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A65\">\u201cQ. You wanted also to be very careful with all of the other different phases of the arrangements that you were going to make with them, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtJB\">\u201cQ. Then when you had that understanding \u2014 after you had completed your understanding, you did sign up, didn\u2019t you? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWj\">\u201cQ. when you signed this agreement, did you expect to be bound by it&gt; by what the agreement said? A. g0 far as being their dealer, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A00\">\u201eQ_ But did not t to be bound by ^ terms <em>^ </em>reference to the adjustments \u2014 with the provisions with reference to adjustments in the contract? A. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"avg-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. This part down here where \u00a1t sayg the eontract cannot be changed or modified except in writ. , ___ mg by some officer of the company, ,, , , , , ,,.4.0 Did you expect to be bound by that ? a mi. a u t u ,, A' They told me I wonldn t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2c\">\"Q- ^nd you did no^ expect to be bound by that. Is that right? A. We sent the representative of Dun-1\u00b0P down to Mr. Cross, our customer&gt; and ^ ^im present our case, what we would do. We would supply Wm with these tires, and we would make adjustments as he outlined to Mr. Cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4g\">\u201cQ. In other words, when you signed on March 4, that was just a conditional tentative signing. Is that right? You didn\u2019t expect to be bound by them until later. Is that what you\u2019re saying? A. Of course I accepted their deal when I signed the contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArP7\">Mr. Thompson\u2019s testimony, in response to questions by the Court, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANU\">\u201cQ. [By the Court] As I understand, Wisner brought this contract and you signed it and then he took the contract and supposedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>sent it to Mr. Edwards ? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"anz-dedup-0\">\u201cQ. And you didn\u2019t get it back? A. That\u2019s right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"aby-dedup-1\">\u2019\u201cQ. Now, you are talking about this Bear Brand sale. Do you recall when that sale was made? A. The date that I signed the contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV2\">er You mean on March . . Yes, sir, whatever day Mr. Wisner was there. I sent he and my brother</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ayh-dedup-0\">_ _ \u201cQ. I see. I was just trying to get it straight, the sequence of the thing. You said you had some conversation with Mr. Edwards who is listed here as Division Manager. When was the conversation you had with him, the first conversation about your contract with him in reference to the sale to the Bear Brand people? A. I discussed the tire deal with Mr. Edwards, that is, him being the Division Manager, we talked two or three times a week over the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANB\">\u201cQ. Did you talk to him prior to the signing of this contract? A. Oh, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axum\">\u201cQ. After you signed the contract what did you talk with him about? A. We discussed adjustments and so forth and, of course, he said, 'You all take care of the customer.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2e\"> Although de\u00b1endants contend that their right to recover is based upon a new contract which superseded the provisions of the written agreement relating to adjustments, and that \u201cthere is no question presented regarding the variation of a written contract by parol evidence * * * ,\u201d the record made does not bear them out. The real purport of defendants\u2019 evidence is that at all times prior to and contemporaneously with the execution of the written contract by defendants, their understanding of the agreement was that they had full authority to act independently in making adjustments directly with their tire customers \u2014 a position diametrically opposed J0 t^ir authority under the written contract Thus, by insisting that the Thompson vfslon of the P\u00b0llcy on adjustments was the agreement throughout defendants m effect seek to impeach the written contract by parol evidence, urging that it did not express the true intent of the parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This they cannot do. Fred Thompson, an experienced businessman, who was the moving force for defendants in negotiating the contract, was under compulsion to have the written contract accurately express the true agreement of the parties. Having failed to do so, the defendants cannot now rely upon prior and contemporaneous negotiations, because \u201cit is conclusively presumed that the whole agreement of the parties, and the extent and manner of their undertaking, were reduced to writing.\u201d Jeter v. Windle, Ark., 319 S.W.2d 825, 827, quoting Wilson v. Nugent, 174 Ark. 1115, 299 gw 18, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"aka-dedup-0\">Concededly, the defendants failed to comply with the written contract in making adjustment of defective tires, an&lt;^ since, for the purpose of this litigation, defendants claimed adjustments must be deemed to have been gratuitous- ^ made, plaintiff was entitled to a directed verdict for the full amount of defendants\u2019 unpaid account, $6,467.61, and bave judgment entered upon such a verdict for that amount and costg-</p>\n<p id=\"A3GL\">Since the plaintiff made no motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict of the jury, we are precluded from directing the entry of the judgment to which we hold it was entitled, Johnson v.
