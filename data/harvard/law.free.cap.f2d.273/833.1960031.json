Furthermore, the Board erred in making its order cover any possible agreements between the Union and <em>cmy other employer,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in finding that the Union coerced Fluor\u2019s employees to join and should therefore refund their dues. The entire order will be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b882-9\">. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, etc. v.
