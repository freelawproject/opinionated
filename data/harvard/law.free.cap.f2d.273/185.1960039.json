Its returns for the fiscal years'-1952 and 1953 were examined by one-revenue agent and its returns for the-fiscal years 1954 and 1955 were examined by another. These agents duly submitted their audit reports in September,. 1954, and July, 1956, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-13\">Subsequent to these examinations the-Regional Inspector, who operates independently of the Regional Commissioner and reports directly to headquarters ini Washington, and who is concerned with the operating practices and the security and integrity of the Internal Revenue-Service in his Region, and the Regional Commissioner, who is concerned primarily with the determination and collection of taxes in his Region, set up a joint, project to investigate allegations of collusion between taxpayers and revenue agents in the Fall River area. Field agents working on this joint project reported to the project coordinator that their investigations disclosed close personal and business relationships between the respondent and the agents who had examined the taxpayer\u2019s returns for the years involved. They reported that prior, during and subsequent to his audit the agent who had examined the taxpayer\u2019s returns for 1952 and 1953 had negotiated for himself and members of his immediate family several loans from the taxpayer amounting in gross to $11,000 and that these loans were unsecured, bore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>either no interest or interest at one half of one per cent per month, and that the taxpayer\u2019s cards recording the loans were marked DND for \u201cdo not dun.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 And they reported that the respondent had a longstanding personal relationship with the agent who had examined the taxpayer\u2019s returns for 1954 and 1955, that the respondent had negotiated an exchange of checks in the amount of $6,-500 for the agent\u2019s minor son, that the respondent had served as an accommodation party in a real estate transaction \u2022entered into on behalf of members of the agent\u2019s family pending the outcome of a law suit and that he had also served as an officer of the agent\u2019s family corporation. They also reported that in an interview the respondent had said that he made loans to revenue agents at favorable rates, that he encouraged good relations with revenue agents, and that lie had frequent social meetings with revenue agents, such as meeting with them for drinks at cafes two or three times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The coordinator of the joint project passed this information on to the Regional Commissioner with the request for a reopening letter addressed to the taxpayer and the Commissioner complied \u2022on May 20, 1958. The respondent declined to make the taxpayer\u2019s books and records for the years 1952 through 1955 .available for inspection as requested in the reopening letter and on June 13 he was served with a summons issued by the Commissioner under \u00a7 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. 26 U.S. 'C. \u00a7 7602. The respondent appeared at the time and place designated in the summons with some corporate records but refused to permit any inspection of them. Application under \u00a7 7604 id. for attachment against the respondent as for a contempt was thereupon made to the court below and that court after hearing entered the order enforcing the summons from which this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The first three of the four tax years here involved admittedly are \u201cclosed\u201d by the three year statute of limitations (\u00a7 6501 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501), to the assessment of any tax except for fraud or other matters not involved herein. The basic questions on this appeal are whether the Commissioner as the Secretary\u2019s delegate had statutory authority to issue his summons requiring disclosure as to those closed years, and, if he did, whether there was enough evidence before the District Court to warrant its conclusion that there was \u201cprobable cause\u201d to believe that the taxpayer\u2019s returns for the \u201cclosed\u201d years were fraudulent. See O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connell, supra. We think both questions must be answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Counsel for the appellant asserts that all of the evidence points inescapably to the conclusion that the sole purpose of the Regional Commissioner in issuing the summons directed to the taxpayer was to further the investigation of the Inspection Service into the conduct of the revenue agents who had audited the taxpayer\u2019s returns for the closed years in question. Wherefore he contends that the Commissioner as the Secretary\u2019s delegate lacked statutory authority to issue the summons, for \u00a7 7602, supra, gives the Secretary or his delegates power to summon a person liable for tax only \u201cFor the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The District Court found that \u201cthe Regional Inspector could be said to have instigated the reopening letter,\u201d and that \u201cthe Inspection Service hopes that its investigation may benefit from the present proceeding.\u201d [171 F.Supp. 122.] But it found that the investigation of the conduct of the revenue agents was not the Commissioner\u2019s sole purpose for issuing the summons. And it found that this case was not one in which no discoverable incorrectness in the taxpayer\u2019s returns for the closed years could lead to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>termination of a tax liability. On the basis of these findings it, we think entirely correctly, distinguished United States v. O\u2019Connor, D.C.Mass.1953, 118 F.Supp. 248. See Boren v. Tucker, 9 Cir., 1957, 239 F.2d 767, 772, 773. The court then found and ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdM\">\u201cThe very circumstances which excited the interest of the Regional Inspector here were of equal concern to the Regional Commissioner. If examination of the corporate books and records were to disclose malfeasance on the part of the agents who examined the returns, by the same token it might well disclose irregularities by the taxpayer. While the interest of the Inspection Service was primary in point of time, and continued, I find the summons was issued in the name of a revenue agent attached to the Audit Division as a result of a reopening letter signed by a Regional Commissioner whose purposes included a bona fide desire to ascertain the correctness of David\u2019s returns in connection with David\u2019s tax liability. I rule that neither the additional, concurrent interest of the Regional inspector for other purposes, nor the fact that he was the first actor in the matter, is a legal deterrent to these proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">The findings of fact above are supported by substantial evidence in the record and the reasonable and logical inferences to be drawn from that evidence. Thus under the familiar principle embodied in Rule 52(a), F.R.Civ.P., 28 U.S.C., they cannot be successfully challenged in this court. And we agree with the District Court\u2019s rulings on that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Under \u00a7 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 the authority of the Secretary or his delegate to summon persons liable for tax is limited to \u201cthe purpose of ascertaining the correctness of any return.\u201d The authority is not, although of course it might have been, further limited by requiring that the \u201csole\u201d or \u201cprimary\u201d purpose of the Secretary or his delegate in issuing a summons must be to determine whether a taxpayer has filed a correct return. However, were we to read into the section greater limitations upon the power to summon than the Congress chose to provide, we believe that we would not be construing the section but legislating. As the statute reads there is authority to summon for the purpose of ascertaining the correctness of a taxpayer\u2019s return. There must be this purpose. That there may perhaps also be other purposes in particular cases seems to us inconsequential as it did to the court below. See Boren v. Tucker, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">We turn now to the question whether there is sufficient evidence in the record to support the District Court\u2019s order directing compliance with the summons served upon the respondent-appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">In O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connell, 1 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 365, 370, we rejected the contention that all the Secretary or his delegate needed to show to obtain an order enforcing a summons with respect to a closed year was the honesty of his subjective belief that the taxpayer had been guilty of fraud in such a year. We said that to make the provision of \u00a7 7605(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 forbidding unnecessary examinations or investigations of a taxpayer\u2019s books of account truly effective \u201cthe Secretary or his delegate, when a court order is needed to enforce compliance with a summons to testify as to a \u2018closed\u2019 year, should be required to establish to the court\u2019s satisfaction that there is probable cause for an investigation into such a year.\u201d We pointed out that this did not mean that proof of fraud was required but meant only \u201cthat before the tax authorities are entitled to a district court order enforcing a summons directing a taxpayer to testify as to a closed year they must establish to the district court\u2019s satisfaction that a reasonable basis exists for a suspicion of fraud, or put another way, that there is probable cause to believe that the taxpayer was guilty of fraud in a statute barred year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The District Court encountered difficulty in applying the rule of O\u2019Connor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>v. O\u2019Connell, its particular difficulty being with the nature and extent of the burden resting on the petitioner to show probable cause or reasonable ground for suspicion of the existence of fraud. It posed the question: \u201cIs the district court to be satisfied that a reasonable basis exists for petitioner\u2019s determination, as to both the underlying facts and the existence of probable cause, or is it to make its own?\u201d [171 F.Supp. 123.]</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\"> In O\u2019Connor v. O\u2019Connell supra we used the substantially synonymous phrases, see footnote 3 of Draper v. United States, 1959, 358 U.S. 307, 310, 79 S.Ct. 329, 3 L.Ed.2d 327, \u201cprobable cause\u201d and \u201creasonable grounds\u201d in their generally accepted meaning in other contexts. In using the familiar phrases we meant to imply that in ordering enforcement of a summons the district court should apply the same test that it would apply in deciding whether an arrest by an officer without a warrant, and perhaps his incidental search of the person of his prisoner, complied with constitutional or statutory requirements. See Draper v. United States, supra, and Brinegar v. United States, 1949, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879, and cases cited. See particularly Carroll v. United States, 1925, 267 U.S. 132, 161, 45 S.Ct. 280, 288, 69 L.Ed. 543, in which Mr. Chief Justice Taft writing for the Court said quoting and citing earlier cases: \u201c \u2018If the facts and circumstances before the officer are such as to warrant a man of prudence and caution in believing that the offense has been committed, it is sufficient.\u2019 \u201d The function of the district courts in these cases as we see it is comparable to the function of a grand jury. It is to prevent the Secretary or his delegate from going on a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d into a taxpayer\u2019s books or records for closed years, or from acting upon a mere hunch or a vague surmise, but to permit inspection as to closed years when the court is satisfied, meaning persuaded or content, that the official who issued the summons had a reasonable basis for his belief that the taxpayer had been guilty of fraud in a closed year. Thus we think the court below was quite right when it said during the trial, and repeated in its opinion, that if a basis for probable cause was shown by witnesses whose testimony, although contradicted, was not so incredible as to be beyond reasonable belief, it would not substitute itself for the Regional Commissioner in resolving the issue of fact presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We see no need for lengthy discussion of the question of the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant the District Court\u2019s order of enforcement. Certainly an ulterior tax motive leading to a reasonable suspicion of fraud may be inferred from the evidence of the respondent\u2019s business and personal intimacy with the agents who audited the taxpayer\u2019s returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Other arguments advanced by the respondent-appellant do not require discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">Judgment will be entered affirming the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b234-9\"><em>.
