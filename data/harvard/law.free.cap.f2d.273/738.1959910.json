The single issue presented is whether the tax court correctly determined that taxpayer\u2019s mineral deposit was quartzite within the meaning of Section 114 (b) (4) (A) (iii), the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (26 U.S.C., 1952 Ed. \u00a7 114) thereby rejecting the Commission\u2019s contention that the deposit was subject to but 5 per cent depletion allowance as stone under Sec. 114(b) (4) (A) (i). The cited statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASOa\">\u201c\u00a7 114.

In the case of quartzite there can be little doubt that the \u201ccommon understanding\u201d of what that mineral is varies greatly by locale, use and expert defin\u00edtion. The instant record contains over thirty definitions of the mineral each springing from an authoritative source, The Tax Court in its opinion did not adopt any specific definition of the mineral, nor attempt original definition, and though the Comissioner now complains of this, we believe the Tax Court properly limited its consideration. The issue there, as here, is not what the defined and end limitations of the mineral are but rather whether taxpayer\u2019s particular dePosit is &lt;Partzite.</p>\n<p id=\"AZX\">The subject deposit is sedimentary in nature, contains between 60 and 65 per cent silicon dioxide; 20 to 30 per cent caIcium donate; 0.03 to 1.84 per cent aluminum oxide; up to 1.15 per cent iron oxlde' Xt \u2122 \u2122ted with calcite so Be,curelf tbat |he minef1 breakwhen f\u2122ctured, as easily through the gram as tbrough the cem(;nt- Many eminent petrographers would not accept deP\u00b0slt as quartzite for classically the mineral has been defined as a metamorphie, silica-cemented sandstone containing at leagt 95% silicon<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Quartz_ ite meeting ^ requirements of this definition would be suitabie for uge ag &amp; refractory. Taxpayer&gt;s deposit is ad. mittedly not.</p>\n<p id=\"AEv\">However, had Congress intended to limit quartzite by quality a more restricted term would have been used in describing the mineral as was done in listing clay and limestone, i. e. \u201crefractory clay,\u201d \u201cmetallurgical grade limestone,\u201d \u201cchemical grade limestone.\u201d And certain it is that quartzite should not be limited to that quality of stone suitable ^or a Particular use. United States v. Wagner Quarries Company, 6 Cir., 260 F.2d 907; Spencer Quarries, Inc. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 27 T.C. 392</p>\n<p id=\"A-u\">We believe it to have been the intent of Congress to have used the term quartzite in an unrestricted sense and to have set a 15 per cent depletion allowanee whenever the mineral was accepted commercially as quartzite. Taxpayer\u2019s deposit has been so accepted by the construction industry. For a great num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>ber of years the taxpayer has marketed the deposit as quartzite. Large buyers such as the Union Pacific Railroad have ordered the mineral as \u201cquartzite\u201d and accepted the product as such. The Kansas Geological Survey Bulletin (an official publication) has described taxpayer\u2019s deposit as quartzite suitable for use in the construction industry. Under such circumstances we hold that the Tax Court properly determined that the mineral should be classified as quartzite for tax purposes and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"aqg-dedup-0\">.
