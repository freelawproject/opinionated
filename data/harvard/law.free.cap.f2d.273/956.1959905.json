Upon inquiry it was ascertained that the Grand Jury minutes had not been transcribed. Nevertheless, and despite the admission by counsel on the application for bail to Judge Lumbard on August 13, 1958 that the request for the production of the minutes \u201cwas abandoned when the Assistant United States Attorney said they were not available,\u201d we are urged to reverse the judgments of conviction. It is clear, we think, that the rule of Jencks v. United States, 1957, 353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103, and the so-called Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500, are not applicable to Grand Jury minutes. United States v. Zborowski, 2 Cir., 1959, 271 F.2d 661. Insofar as the point concerns the duty of the court to inspect the Grand Jury transcript for inconsistencies between the testimony of the government agent at the trial and his testimony before the Grand Jury there is nothing before us as the request for the transcript was in effect withdrawn. Had the transcript been available we have no doubt that Judge Murphy would have examined it and made available to counsel any parts that disclosed inconsistencies. Moreover, as the transcript is now available, we have ourselves compared the testimony of the witness before the Grand Jury with his testimony at the trial and have been unable to find any inconsistencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
