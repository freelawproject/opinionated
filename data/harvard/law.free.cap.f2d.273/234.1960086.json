Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Dawson\u2019s well reasoned opinion is reported in 170 F.Supp. 592.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\">Appellant attacks the constitutionality of \u00a7 1406. His principal argument is that the immunity granted under this statute will not protect him from state prosecutions. That a federal immunity statute need not do so was settled long ago in United States v. Murdock, 284 U.S. 141, 52 S.Ct. 63, 76 L.Ed. 210.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He says that the courts should re-examine the Murdock decision. But, obviously, such re-examination is not for this court to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">At the time of his appearance before the grand jury appellant was serving a prison sentence for conspiracy to violate the narcotic laws.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The grand jury sought to question him concerning this crime. Seizing upon certain expressions in Brown v. Walker, 161 U.S. 591, 16 S.Ct. 644, 40 L.Ed. 819, which sustained the constitutionality of a federal immunity statute similar to \u00a7 1406, appellant makes the fantastic contention that \u00a7 1406 is unconstitutional as applied to him because it does not grant a \u201cgeneral amnesty\u201d or \u201cpardon\u201d for his past offense. The error in this argument is that it attempts to convert a general discussion in the Brown v. Walker opinion, at page 601, of 161 U.S. at page 648 of 16 S.Ct. as to the power of Congress to pass acts of general amnesty into an independent principle of law, requiring appellant\u2019s past offense to be pardoned. No authority is cited to support this extraordinary contention.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Additional points made by appellant have been considered but are so plainly without merit that they require no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b283-8\">.
