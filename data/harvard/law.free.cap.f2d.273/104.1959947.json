We are unable to agree that \u201creasonable men could not reach different conclusions\u201d from the evidence, which the court summarized fully in a thoughtful opinion. McManus v. Rogers, D.C., 173 F.Supp. 118, 125-126.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>At the time of the accident the defendant\u2019s son was driving the defendant\u2019s car and the plaintiff was riding on the outside right rear deck or fender. The car was filled to overflowing with other young people who, like the driver and the plaintiff, had attended a church-sponsored party in a private home. The plaintiff fell and was injured when the car made a left turn at an intersection. He was found lying unconscious in the street. We think a jury might reasonably find from the evidence that when the car arrived at the intersection it was going downhill at about 25 miles an hour; that the turn the driver made was \u201csharp\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that although there was no evidence of exactly when he learned there was somebody riding on the rear deck, he learned soon enough so that he might, by using reasonable care, have refrained from making a turn; and that the turn increased the danger of a person in the plaintiff\u2019s position, was negligent as to him, and was a cause of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">As the court said in its opinion, according to the driver\u2019s statement to the police \u201che heard that someone was on the back of the car as he came down the street, he cut the wheels to turn into Belt Road, and at that time he put the brakes on because he know he was going too fast \u2018if there was someone on the back of the car.\u2019 \u201d 173 F.Supp. at page 124. The court correctly stated the law to be that \u201cTo either a trespasser whose presence is known or may reasonably be known or a bare licensee, the driver owes a duty to use reasonable care not to commit any negligent act which will create a danger * * * \u201d 173 F.Supp. at page 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">We agree with the court that the plaintiff was \u201cnegligent as a matter of law\u201d in putting himself in the dangerous place from which he fell. This negligence was a cause of the accident. But as we have indicated, we think a jury might reasonably find that negligence of the driver, after he learned of the plaintiff\u2019s danger, was also a cause of the accident. In that case the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, provided either (1) at the time of the accident it was too late for him to save himself by using reasonable care, or (2) the requirements of the \u201clast clear chance\u201d doctrine were met in some other way. In the District of Columbia this \u201cdoctrine is broader than its name.\u201d Capital Transit Co. v. Garcia, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 168, 194 F.2d 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b153-9\">. One witness so described it. Another said it seemed the driver \u201cjust grabbed the wheel and pulled it to the left\u201d and it seemed \u201cthe car wasn\u2019t going to make it around the turn.\u201d 173 If.Supp. at page 124.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b153-14\">BASTIAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Add\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">I would affirm the judgment on the opinion of the District Judge.
