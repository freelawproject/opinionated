Charles T. Lucey, the author of the libelous article appearing in the Scripps-Howard newspapers published by the corporate defendants, is a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"alf-dedup-0\">Summons was served outside the state of Illinois on each defendant, together with a copy of the complaint, in accordanee with \u00a7 16, ch. 110, R.S.Ill.1957.</p>\n<p id=\"AKp\">Defendants procured the removal of the case to the district court and then moved to dismiss the cause on the ground that the court \u201clacks jurisdiction over the persons\u201d of defendants. The court granted the motion, 172 F.Supp. 615, and from an order to that effect, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah8\"> <em>Weu </em>r?er7ed \u00b0ur rul' mg on a motion by defendants to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the action herein is barred because of these facts:</p>\n<p id=\"aji-dedup-0\">In the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, since the filing of the ease at bar, plaintiff sued Memphis Publishing Company and the complaint and answer therein raised the same issues as were raised \u2122 this case-. UP\u00b0n a trial&gt; a <em>^ </em>found * e issues in favor of defendant, and Judgment for defendant was entered, whlch Judgment has become final,</p>\n<p id=\"ABYi\">We believe defendants mistakenly urge that this judgment is <em>res judicata </em>as to all the defendants here. The charge of libel against Memphis Publishing Company in the Tennessee suit is entirely distinct from the charge of libel by publication by the other defendants named in the complaint herein. Identity of causes of action is essential to a plea of <em>res judicata. </em>Troxell v. Delaware, L. &amp; W. Ry. Co., 227 U.S. 434, 33 S.Ct. 274, 57 L.Ed. 586; Holland v. Forcum-James C. &amp; L. Co., 154 Tenn. 174, 285 S.W. 569; <em>Sweeting </em>v. Campbell 2 Ill.l2d 491, 496-497, 119 N.E.2d 237</p>\n<p id=\"ATi\">Nor can defendants\u2019 motion be sustained on the doctrine of estoppel by finding or verdict. A former judgment does not operate as an estoppel by verdict in a second action except where it is clear from the record that a specific material and controlling fact common to both cases was litigated and determined in the firgt case. Chicago Theological Seminary v. People, 189 Ill. 439) 443-444 59 N.E. 977; People ex rel. v. Wyanet Elec. Light Co., 306 Ill. 377, 383, 137 N.E. 834; Hoffman v. Hoffman, 330 Ill. 413, 418, 161 N.E. 723; Prudential Ins. Co. of America v. Zorger, 7 Cir., 86 F.2d 446, 108 A.L.R. 498; Harris v. Mason, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>120 Tenn. 668, 115 S.W. 1146, 25 L.R.A., N.S., 1011. The rule is well stated in the Wyanet Electric Light Co. case, where the court said 306 Ill. at page 383, 137 N.E. at page 836:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_B\">\u201cIt is absolutely necessary, in order that a former judgment should operate as an estopped [sic] by ver-diet, that there shall have been a finding of a specific fact in such former judgment or record that is material and controlling in that case and also material and controlling m the pend-mg case It must also conclusively appear that the matter of fact was so m issue that it was necessarily determined by the court rendering the judgment interposed as a bar by reason of such estoppel. If there is any uncertainty on this point by reason of the fact that more than one \u2022distinct issue of fact is presented to the court the estoppel will not be applied, and for the reason that the \u25a0court may have decided it upon one of the other issues of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"acj-dedup-0\">_ . , , \u201e , . There is nothing properly before this court which shows what fact was found which resulted in the verdict against plaintiff in the Memphis case. Indeed, the verdict of the jury might have been based on a finding that plaintiff had not proven that he had a general reputation in the Memphis area or that he had not proven that his reputation was damaged by the Memphis publication. Ihe jury could have concluded that the article referred to plaintiff but that their verdict should be for defendant because plaintiff did not prove he was damaged by the Memphis article.</p>\n<p id=\"AXP\">We see no impelling reason for dismissing this appeal and the motion of defendants is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AVV\">2. Plaintiff bases his claim that the district court had jurisdiction of defendants on section 17 of the Illinois Civil Practice Act, \u00a7 17, ch. 110, R.S. Ill.1957, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asv-dedup-0\">\u201c(1) Any person, whether or not a citizen or resident of this State, who in person or through an agent does any of the acts hereinafter enumerated, thereby submits said person, and, if an individual, his personal representative, to the jurisdiction of the courts of this State as to aay cause of action arising from the doing of any of said acts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AA3\">\u201c(a) The transaction of any business within this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">\u201c(b) The commission of a tortious act within this State; * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXt\">\u00ab(2) Service of process upon any pers0n who ifl subject to the juris_ diction of the courtg of thig state&gt; ag provided in thig Bection&gt; be made by pergonally serving the sum_ mong upon the defendant outside thig stat ag provided in this Act, with the game force and effect as though summons had been personally gerved witMn thig state_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AW5U\">_ Only causes of action aris*n\u00a3 ^roin ac^s enumerated herein may be asserted against a defendant \u2122 an aeti\u00b0n in which jurisdiction over him is based upon this section. # # \u201e</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AGd\">If plaintiff is correct in his claim as to the meaning and application of \u00a7 17 to this case, it is undisputed that service of summons on defendants was made in compliance with \u00a7 16(1) and (2) of said Act.</p>\n<p id=\"AZoG\">Tfae controlHng facts appear in affi_ davitg ffled -n the digtrict court;</p>\n<p id=\"Ah2\">The corporate defendants are incorporated and have their principal places of business in states other than Illinois. Their respective newspapers are published in states other than Illinois. No corporate defendant is licensed to do business in Illinois or has a registered agent in Illinois or maintains an office in Illinois or is listed in any Illinois telephone or business directory. No corporate defendant employs an agent who is permanently located in Illinois or maintains assets or has a bank account in Illinois. No individual defendant personally owns or operates any business in Illinois and none resides in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>Each of the defendant companies sends a number of copies of its respective newspaper into Illinois each day. Some of these copies are mailed directly to subscribers, and others are sold to the lili-nois public through a wholesale distributor and from newsstands. All payments by subscribers, wholesalers and newsstand operators are mailed to the respective principal offices of the several publishing companies outside Illinois. The distributors also circulate newspapers other than those of defendants, the several defendants have no financial interest in or control over the formers\u2019 enterprises, they are independent contractors which purchase newspapers for their own accounts, receive them by mail from outside Illinois, and do not account to defendants for the proceeds of sales. Each corporate defendant publishes a newspaper from without the state of Illinois; all defendants\u2019 printing occurs outside Illinois; each defendant first distributes its particular newspaper without Illinois and within the city of printing; distribution elsewhere than in the city of printing is always made <em>subsequent </em>to distribution in the city of printing; payment to the defendants for papers shipped and any orders that might be receded for papers are all transmitted to defendants principal offices for receipt and acceptance; no collections or subscription activities whatsoever are carried on by any of the corporate defendants within Illinois; the corporate defendants\u2019 newspapers are circulated in Illinois only by independent news vendors, independent wholesalers, and mailings from without the state ; no circulation whatsoever is made within the state by any of the defendants.

Thig day_ to-day entrance into the Illinois market produced the circulation of the libelous article in Illinois,- to the substantial injury of plaintiff.

International Life Ins. Co., 355 U.S. 220, 78 S.Ct. 199, 2 L.Ed.2d 223; Travelers Health Ass\u2019n v. Commonwealth of Virginia, 339 U.S. 643, 70 S.Ct. 927, 94 L.Ed. 1154; Wanamaker v. Lewis, D.C., 153 F.Supp. 195; WSAZ, Inc. v. Lyons, 6 Cir., 254 F.2d 242; and French v. Gibbs Corp., 2 Cir., 189 F.2d 787, plaintiff asserts that-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AmI\">\u25a0 '\"\u201cdefendants in the case at bar transact sufficient business m this state \u2022c. that'it iS not unfair to subject them to suit here. Their physical presence in Illinois is not required as a prerequisite to this result, and even if it is, each, of them is \u2018present\u2019 here by virtue of the use of the \u25a0mails as the agency whereby their newspapers are delivered in this .state. Since they have so conducted .this phase of their businesses, they cannot hide behind the fact that deliveries are made by the Post Office. The Post Office may properly be regarded, as it was by Judge Hand, as .the agent of each of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7K\">The question which arises under \u00a7 17 (1) (a) is whether the facts reveal that defendants transacted any business within the state of Illinois. We have already passed on a similar question in Schmidt v. Esquire, Inc., 7 Cir., 210 F.2d 908, cer-tiorari denied Schmidt v. Crowell-Collier Pub. Co., 348 U.S. 819, 75 S.Ct. 31, 99 L.Ed. 646. We said, 210 F.2d at page 916:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axj7\">\u00ab * * * Esquire, Inc., is a corporation foreign to the State of Indiana and is not licensed nor admitted to do business there. It publishes the Esquire and Coronet magazines, which are available in Indiana either through subscription or at the newsstand. These magazines are printed in Chicago and are mailed directly from there to Indiana subscribers. They are placed on newsstands in Indiana by the Curtis Circulation Company, an independent corporation which purchases the magazines from Esquire and effects distribution \u25a0 through independent wholesale organizations. Esquire has no office of any kind in Indiana, and it has no employees or agents there to gather material for publication, nor to solicit advertising, subscriptions or newsstand sales,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYx\">^ Under <em>these </em>fact,s&gt; d\u00b0 \u201cot Jf? 5 Can Seri0UsIy be contended <em>that Esqmre </em>was amenable to suit in Indiana- * * * <em>0^s\\tha </em>J. \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5g\">We adhere to our ruling in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"A8c\">Our interpretation of \u00a7 17(1) (a) is consistent with the holding in Grobark v. Addo Machine Co., Inc., 16 Ill.2d 426, 158 N.E.2d 73.</p>\n<p id=\"A1e\">Among the many cases which are authority for the proposition that a foreign publishing corporation is not transacting business in a state because it ships its periodicals into the state to subscribers or independent contractors for resale, are the following: Street &amp; Smith Publications, Inc. v. Spikes, 5 Cir., 120 F.2d 895, 897-898, certiorari denied 314 U.S. 653, 62 S.Ct. 102, 86 L.Ed. 524; Deighan v. Beverage Retailer Weekly &amp; Trade Newspaper Corp., 16 A.2d 612, 613-614, 18 N.J.Misc. 705; Reed v. Real Detective Pub. Co., 63 Ariz. 294, 162 P.2d 133, 139-140; Whitaker v. MacFadden Publications, Inc., 70 App.D.C. 165, 105 F.2d 44-45; Cannon v. Time, Inc., 4 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>115 F.2d 423, 425-426; Putnam v. Triangle Publications, Inc., 245 N.C. 432, 96 S.E.2d 445, 450-454.</p>\n<p id=\"A72\">Moreover, there is no legal basis for holding the editor defendants personally liable on the theory that they transacted any business in Illinois. Plaintiff does not even suggest a basis for such a holdlng\u2018</p>\n<p id=\"ace-dedup-1\">On the other hand, our recent case of National Gas Appliance Corp. v. AB Electrolux, 7 Cir., 270 F.2d 472, affords an example of what amounts to \u201cthe transaction of any business within this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Axy\">. ,, . , [5] 3. Also relying on this language in \u00a7 17(1) (b): \u201cThe commission of a tortious act within this State\u201d, plaintiff maintains that the\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aam\">\u201cseveral defendants published the libelous article in Illinois by virtue of the sales by them of their respective newspapers to their respective lili-nois subscribers, including the wholesalers and newsstands. We need not be concerned at this time with what those subscribers did with the newspapers after they received them in the mails, since upon receipt in Illinois, the several libels were complete so far as this state is concerned. Therefore, while it is true that not all of the tortious acts complained of occurred in Illinois, since publication of each newspaper also occurred elsewhere, this state is nevertheless the situs of a significant portion and, moreover, is the most significant situs of injury in view of plaintiff s residence here.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Auf5\">Upon the same facts which we have found inadequate to prove defendants transacted any business within Illinois, plaintiff now asks us to hold that all of the defendants committed a tortious act there.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> None of the defendants either personally or through an agent was present in Illinois. Cf. Nelson v. Miller, 11 Ill.2d 378, 393, 143 N.E.2d 673, 681.</p>\n<p id=\"A7X\">\u201e . ... ,. Plaintiff argues that each publication 0f the Lucey article is a separate tort and the subject of a separate cause of action\u201d and also that \u201cit is well settled that the place of wrong, or the place where the last event necessary to make the defendant liable in tort occurs, is \u2018where the defamatory statement is eom-municated\u2019, and not the place \u2018from which the offending material is sent or where it originates.\u2019 \u201d He adds that the \u201cseveral torts were nonetheless committed when the newspapers were received in Illinois after having been mailed by the defer\u00ed6\u00abn\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"aso-dedup-0\">In substance, plaintiff argues that the appearance of defendants\u2019 papers in Illin0^s the \u201clast event necessary to make the defendant liable in tort\u201d. That this *s a mistaken conclusion is established by Illinois law. In Winrod v. Time, Inc., 334 Ill.App. 59, 65-72, 78 N.E.2d 708, 710-714, leave to appeal denied 336 111. App. xiv, it was held that in cases of multi-state circulation of periodicals the cause of action for libel is absolutely comp\u00edete at the time of first publication; subsequent appearances or distributions \u00b0t the periodicals are of no consequence whatsoever to the creation or existence \u00b0t the^ cause of action but are only relevant in computing damages.2 <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> *To the same effect was our holding in Winrod v. MacFadden Publications, Inc., 7 Cir., 187 F.2d 180, 182, certiorari denied 342 U.S. 814, 72 S.Ct. 28, 96 L.Ed. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"AgYS\">It f0ii0WS that the facts in this record show no tortious act committed within Illinois and hence jurisdiction under \u00a7 17 (1) (b) could not attach. Of course, plaintiff would have had a right to sue in the states where the libel was published, a right of which he took advantage when he sued one of the defendants herein in the federal district court at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>Memphis, Tennessee as hereinbefore referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"Afr\">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">Affii\u2019inpii</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-13\">.
