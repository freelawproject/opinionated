Prior to May 22, petitioner had been confined to jail due to his inability to raise bail and he alleged that before pleading guilty he had been in solitary confinement in a dark cell, known as \u201cthe hole\u201d, that he had a great fear of the dark, and that he entered the plea of guilty out of fear of being returned to \u201cthe hole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-21\">Judge Smith fully recognized the seriousness of these allegations. Accordingly, he issued a writ of habeas corpus. After seeing and hearing the petitioner and other witnesses, he discharged the writ, finding that the petitioner\u2019s will was not so weakened as to be overborne by fear. While deploring the treatment of the petitioner, Judge Smith was not convinced that the treatment impelled him to enter his plea involuntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>After carefully considering the whole record, we find that Judge Smith conducted an extremely thorough hearing and at all times showed a scrupulous regard for the rights of the petitioner. There was more than enough evidence to warrant the conclusion that the plea was not coerced.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Petitioner\u2019s other allegations are unsupported by evidence or otherwise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
