In particular, it is not clear whether, and if so how, the provisions of paragraph 3(b) of Section I, and of paragraph 13 (d) of Section II, of Army Regulation 604-10 were applied in appellant\u2019s case. Under these circumstances, this court cannot properly exercise its function of judicial review. In a case of this kind, the fact that appellant makes no point regarding the matter is not controlling, cf. Peters v. Hobby, 1955, 349 U.S. 331, 75 S.Ct. 790, 99 L.Ed. 1129. We accordingly set aside the order of the District Court entered May 22, 1959, granting defendant-appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and order that the ease be reopened for further proceedings not inconsistent with law. Such proceedings shall include opportunity to plaintiff-appellant to request copies of the findings, if any, and an opportunity to the appellee to supply them. Cf. Coleman v. Brucker, 1958, 103 U.S.App.D.C. 283, 257 F.2d 661; Coffey v. Jordan, 1959, - U.S. App.D.C. -, 275 F.2d 1. If it appears that no approved findings were made, or that new findings are being offered nunc pro tunc, the District Court should consider the bearing of the cases herein cited, together with Vitarelli v. Seaton, 1959, 359 U.S. 535, 79 S.Ct. 968, 3 L.Ed.2d 1012. Any resulting order or judgment of the District Court may be appealed in the usual course by any party aggrieved, subject to applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-14\">BASTIAN, Circuit Judge, concurs in the remand, but not in the form of the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
