Although the order of dismissal does not designate specific grounds therefor it is apparent that the trial court premised the dismissal upon a holding that plaintiff had failed to obtain proper service of process upon defendant and that such failure had resulted in barring plaintiff\u2019s claim pursuant to the applicable Kansas statute of limitations. This appeal requires consideration of two questions of law, each governed by the statutory law of Kansas as aided by judicial expression in that state: 1. Did the plaintiff substantially comply with the Kansas \u201clong-arm\u201d statutes relating to service of process upon a nonresident motorist ?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2. Does the absence of a nonresident motorist from the state toll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the running of the statute of limitations ? <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Plaintiff is a resident of Kansas, defendant of the state of New York. On July 17, 1958, plaintiff filed a complaint in the District Court of Barton County, Kansas, setting forth a claim for damages arising from an automobile accident which occurred on July 18, 1956, in that county and state. The Kansas court, after determination that the complaint alleged facts showing the proper application of the \u201clong-arm\u201d statute, entered an order on July 17, 1958 that \u201cservice of process be made on the defendant as provided in section 8-401, General Statutes of Kansas, 1949; that a copy of the process herein, of plaintiff\u2019s petition, of this order, and a notice that the same have been served upon the Secretary of State, pursuant to said Section 8-401, General Statutes of Kansas, 1949, and Section 8-402, 1957 Supplement to General Statutes of Kansas, 1949, be delivered to said defendant by registered mail or personally to said defendant by a Sheriff or Deputy Sheriff in the State of said defendant\u2019s residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Summons was issued July 17, placed in the hands of the sheriff on July 19 and served by him on the Secretary of State on July 21. On July 17 counsel for plaintiff mailed to the defendant a letter in notice form thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201cJuly 17, 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">\u201cMr. Charles Mills Golden, 59 Fort Sperry Road, Cohoes, New York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">\u201cRe: Bond v.

On November 5, and while the motion to dismiss was pending, a second letter-notice was mailed to and received by defendant which admittedly meets the statutory requirements set forth in 1957 Kan.G.S. Supp. 8-402. Proof of this service was made on November 6. On this date, too, an affidavit was filed in regard to the July 17 letter and its enclosures. This affidavit does not purport to be made \u201cby the person making said service\u201d (1957, Kan.G.S.Supp. 8-402) and the affiant merely states that the files of plaintiff\u2019s counsel indicate that the July 17 letter and enclosures were sent to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">In Kansas, as in many other states, the rule that statutes in derogation of the common law should be strictly construed has been made inapplicable by legislative enactment. 1949 Kan.G.S. 77-109; 1949 Kan.G.S. 60-102. But regardless of whether a statute is liberally or strictly construed substantial compliance with its requirements is essential before the benefits of the statute become available. Nor is it any answer to the fact of non-compliance with statutory requisites to assert that the general purposes of the statute have been met by means extraneous to the particulars of the statute. Service by substitution upon a fictional agent \u2014 here, the Secretary of State- \u2014 cannot meet the demands of due process unless such service is complemented by notice to the defendant of the service. Goldey v. Morning News of New Haven, 156 U.S. 518, 15 S.Ct. 559, 39 L.Ed. 517. The notice sent July 17 does not and cannot comply with this essential of the statute for service upon the Secretary of State was not had until July 21. The statute states, and the state court order required, that notice be sent that process and pleadings \u201chave been served upon the secretary of state.\u201d These statutory words clearly set out the necessity of notice of an accomplished fact and do not call for the application of a rule of statutory construction. Where notice of an accomplished fact is required it is impossible to give such notice before the actual occurrence that brings into existence the fact. An attempt to so do is patently futile and a fatal non-compliance with the statute. Bucholz v. Hutton, D.C.Mont., 153 F. Supp. 62. State ex rel. Stevens v. Grimm, 192 Wis. 601, 213 N.W. 475. And although plaintiff points out that on July 22, the date the purported notice was received by defendant, process had been served on the Secretary of State this coincidence does not aid him. It is compliance with the statute, not receipt of the summons and complaint by the defendant, that attaches jurisdiction. State ex rel. Stevens v. Grimm, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">The second defect in plaintiff\u2019s effort to obtain \u201clong-arm\u201d service upon defendant lies in simple failure to make any attempt to make proof of service until the issue of faulty service was before the court and then to fail to observe the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>statutory mandate in such regard. Since the statute does not designate when the proof should be made a liberal construction of the enactment might grant great leeway in the matter of time. But the statute is clear that such proof \u201cshall\u201d be made and \u201cby the person making said service.\u201d This has not been done.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">The ruling of the trial court was, as we have pointed out, that the action should be dismissed with prejudice. Ordinarily an action which fails for lack of process, since the merits are not reached, is not so dismissed. However such dismissal would be proper if lack of process made it apparent from the pleadings that the claim was then barred by limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">This action was filed in state court one day before the applicable statute of limitations would bar the claim. 1949 Kan.G.S. 60-306. In such case the statute is tolled subject to the limitation noted by the Supreme Court of Kansas in Mingenback v. Mingenback, 176 Kan. 471, 271 P.2d 782, 789, wherein that court holds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">\u201cIt has long been the rule of this court that when an action is filed and summons issued, or an affidavit for publication filed within the period of limitation and the plaintiff faithfully, properly and diligently endeavors to procure service, the action is deemed commenced as of the date of the filing of the action, <em>provided service of summons or first publication is actually had within sixty days </em>* * (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Since we hold that the attempt of July 17 to obtain service was defective and since the proper service had November 5 occurred more than sixty days after the action was filed it follows that the claim is barred unless, as plaintiff contends, the statute of limitations is further tolled by defendant\u2019s absence from Kansas and by virtue of 1949 Kan. G.S. 60-309. In consideration of that question we are not guided by Kansas judicial expression. However this court has had recent occasion to consider the identical question under Oklahoma law. Moore V. Dunham, 10 Cir., 240 F.2d 198. There, as here, we are aided by the considered opinion of a district judge upon a matter of first impression arising in and governed by the law of his resident state. Here, as there, we see no reason to reverse the trial court\u2019s interpretation of local law. For the reasons set forth in Moore v. Dunham we hold that the Kansas statute of limitations was not tolled by defendant\u2019s absence from Kansas and that plaintiff\u2019s claim is barred. It follows that the trial court properly dismissed the action with prejudice and the judgment is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-11\">. 1949 Kan.G.S. 8-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">\u201cService of process in actions against nonresidents.
