Appellee, a native and formerly a citizen of Germany, entered this country for permanent residence on December 3, 1951. Soon thereafter, pursuant to the requirements of 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix \u00a7 453, he registered for selective service. During the summer of 1952 he was classified I-A. On September 11, 1952, his Local Board, on its own initiative, reclassified appellee IV-C, a category which indicated that Hoellger was an alien exempt from selective service by virtue of a treaty in force between the alien\u2019s nation and the United States. On May 13, 1953 (a date more than four months after December 24, 1952, the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952) the Local Board again acting on its own initiative sent appellee a form application for exemption together with the explanatory statement that if the form were filled out and returned appellee\u2019s exempt status would continue in effect.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellee filled out the form and returned it to the Board. Appellee\u2019s IV-C classification continued until February 9, 1955, when his Board reclas-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>sifted him as I-A because of the abrogation of the treaty arrangement with Germany pertaining to military service. Almost immediately thereafter appellee received an induction notice. He was inducted on April 18, 1955 and, after serving his full term, received an honorable discharge on April 6, 1957. Subsequent to his discharge, on August 8, 1957, appellee filed a petition for naturalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">The parties agree that appellee\u2019s eligibility for citizenship is to be determined by Section 315(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1426(a), which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-5\">\u201cNotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b) of this Act, any alien who applies or has applied for exemption or discharge from training or service in the Armed Forces or in the National Security Training Corps of the United States on the ground that he is an alien, and is or was relieved or discharged from such training or service on such ground, shall be permanently ineligible to become a citizen of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">A careful reading of this section would seem to require the conclusion that to be permanently ineligible for citizenship an alien must not only <em>apply </em>for exemption, but in addition he must be <em>relieved </em>from military service. If there had been any uncertainty as to this interpretation it has been dispelled by Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, 1957, 352 U.S. 599, 606, 77 S.Ct. 545, 549, 1 L.Ed.2d 583, where Justice Brennan, speaking for a unanimous court, defined Section 315(a) as creating a \u201ctwo-pronged requirement for the determination of permanent ineligibility for citizenship.\u201d Applying this authoritative construction to the facts here, solution becomes easy. Even if we assume that appellee applied for exemption, inasmuch as his induction was ordered by the Local Board at a time selected by it and inasmuch as he served a full term, it becomes obvious that ap-pellee has not been relieved from military service. Hence he is eligible for citizenship.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">The Government seems to argue that one who serves is \u201crelieved from service\u201d if his involuntary induction is delayed. It is difficult to reconcile this interpretation with the normal meaning of the words used in Section 315(a). It seems more reasonable to conclude that when Congress used the words \u201crelieved * * * from * * * service\u201d it meant <em>effectively </em>relieved. An alien who has actually served in the Armed Forces under compulsion of the executive branch of the Government cannot be said to have been effectively relieved from service. Moreover, the cases the Government cites do not support the proposition that under Section 315(a) eligibility for citizenship is lost despite the fact of military service resulting from involuntary induction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>Such might well have been the result prior to the effective date of the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when the consequences of an alien\u2019s application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>for exemption from military service were determined by Section 3(a) of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, formerly 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 303(a), and Section 4(a) of the Selective Service Act of 1948, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 454(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under these acts the mere application for exemption could be sufficient to disqualify permanently the alien from citizenship.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, supra, 352 U.S. at pages 604-605, 77 S.Ct. at pages 548-549. But, as Ceballos v. Shaughnessy, supra, 352 U.S. at page 606, 77 S.Ct. at page 549, makes clear, Section 315(a) produced a fundamental change in the law by substituting the \u201ctwo-pronged requirement.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">In view of the above we hold that ap-pellee was not relieved from service within the meaning of Section 315(a); and we also point out that the principle of \u201celementary fairness\u201d suggested in Moser v. United States, 1951, 341 U.S. 41, 47, 71 S.Ct. 553, 95 L.Ed. 729 may well be applicable here. We affirm the judgment of the district court.

We note that it is by no means certain that the Local Board had power to exempt appellee, a permanent resident, from the requirements of military service under 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 454(a). See Schenkel v. Landon, D.C.Mass.1955, 133 F.Supp. 305, and cases there cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-7\">. The cases cited are United States v. Kenny, 2 Cir., 1957, 247 F.2d 139; Petition of Cuozzo, 3 Cir., 1956, 235 F.2d 184; Velasquez v. United States, D.C.S.D. N.Y.1956, 139 F.Supp. 790, affirmed 2 Cir., 1957, 241 F.2d 126; Petition of Cerati, D.O.N.D.Cal.1957, 160 F.Supp. 531. Even assuming 315(a) is applicable to all four cases \u2014 but see note 8 infra \u2014 these cases are readily distinguishable. In neither Kenny nor Cuoz-zo nor Velasquez did the applicant for citizenship enter the Armed Forces. Ce-rati was active in seeking relief from military service, and his term of service resulted from voluntary induction at a time when it served his own convenience, not at a time chosen by his Local Board, supra, 160 F.Supp. at page 532. In contrast Hoellger served without protest at a time and under circumstances chosen for him by his Local Board. Furthermore, an exhaustive search of prior cases involving the eligibility of citizenship of aliens who applied for exemption subsequent to the enactment of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 has failed to disclose support for the interpretation of Section 315(a) advanced by the Government. See Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-18\">The Government, by citing the cases discussed in the preceding paragraph, suggests that in the context of Section 315(a) excuse from military service on grounds of physical disability is equivalent to actual service. This suggestion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>is erroneous. An alien who postpones induction by means of an application for exemption, and who is thereafter rejected for physical disability, may legitimately be said to have been relieved from military service by virtue of his exemption application. This results from the fact that the physical disability may have arisen between the date the alien would have been inducted but for the obtaining of the exemption and the subsequent date on which induction is ordered. Petition of Velasquez, supra, offers a striking example. Petitioner in that case applied for and received an exemption on grounds of alienage. As soon as he became older than the maximum age at which men were being inducted he sought to have his exemption canceled. Velasquez was \u201crelieved from\u201d military service as a result of his exemption application even though his classification was changed from exempt because of alienage to exempt because of having become 38 years of age.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b811-6\">. Whether 315(a) has any effect upon aliens who applied for exemption prior to December 24, 1952, the effective date of the 1952 Act, is a question of some difficulty. The Act contains two savings clauses which relate to this question, 405 (a) and 405(b). (These sections appear as notes following 8 U.S.O.A. \u00a7 1101.) 405(b) provides that any petition for naturalization filed before December 24, 1952 is unaffected by the 1952 Act save as \u00a7\u00a7 301-360, 8 U.S.O.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1401-1503 expressly provide to the contrary. Section 315(a) does provide to the contrary. Thus one might conclude that section 315 (a) would be applied retroactively if section 405(b) were the only obstacle thereto. However, the preceding section, section 405(a), is far broader than section 405(b) and reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201cSec. 405(a) Nothing contained in this Act, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, shall be construed to affect the validity of any declaration of intention, petition for naturalization, certificate of naturalization certificate of citizenship. warrant of arrest, order or warrant of deportation, order of exclusion, or other document or proceeding which shall be valid at the time this Act shall take effect; or to affect any prosecution, suit, action, or proceedings, civil or criminal, brought, <em>or any status, condition, right in process of acquisition, act, thing, liability, obligation, or matter, civil or criminal, done or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect; </em>but as to all such prosecutions, suits, actions, proceedings, statutes (sic), conditions, rights, acts, things, liabilities, obligations, or matters the statutes or parts of statutes repealed by this Act are, unless otherwise specifically provided therein, hereby continued in force and effect.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 405(a) is not referred to in section 315(a). This omission cannot have been inadvertent in view of the careful provisions in 315(a) with reference to 405(b). One must conclude that the matters listed in 405(a) are protected from the changes wrought by 315(a). Even though it be argued that an interpretation that 315(a) can only apply prospectively nullifies the provision permitting retrospective application of matters within 405(b), the argument fails because a contrary interpretation would nullify the clear intent to leave 405(a) unaffected. Any apparent difficulty here stems from the fact that 405(b) is almost wholly redundant in view of the broad coverage of matters contained in 405(a). In United States v. Menasche, 1955, 348 U.S. 528, 536, 75 S.Ct. 513, 99 L.Ed. 615, the Court said: \u201cAs we read the statute, subsection (b) merely implements and emphasizes the operation of its forerunner,\u201d and later, at page 538, of 348 U.S. at page 518 of 75 S. Ct. the Court also said: \u201cThe Government\u2019s contention that 405(a) does not apply to any phase in the processing of naturalization petitions would defeat and destroy the plain meaning of that section.\u201d The companion case of Shom-berg v. United States, 348 U.S. 540, 75 S.Ct. 509, 512, 99 L.Ed. 624, does not indicate a contrary result. In Shomberg the Court merely indicated that the clause in section 318 providing for retrospective application \u201cnotwithstanding the provisions of section 405(b)\u201d merely denied effect to any status acquired by having petitioned for naturalization prior to the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">Assuming this interpretation of the interrelationship of 405(a) and 315(a) to be correct, ineligibility for citizenship because of prior application for exemption from military service would certainly appear to be a \u201cstatus\u201d or \u201cliability\u201d \u201cdone or existing, at the time this Act shall take effect.\u201d Cf. Brownell v. Rasmussen, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 300, 235 F.2d 527, certiorari dismissed, 355 U.S. 859, 78 S.Ct. 114, 2 L.Ed.2d 66; Barreiro <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>v. McGrath, 9 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 585, certiorari denied, 348 U.S. 887, 75 S.Ct. 207, 99 L.Ed. 697. Accepting this argument one might conclude that the consequences of an application for exemption made prior to December 24, 1952 are unaffected by 315(a). Petition of Mirzoeff, 2 Cir., 1958, 253 F.2d 671, 672, is <em>contra, </em>and that ease draws some support from the language in 315(a) which refers to \u201c * * * any alien who applies or <em>has applied </em>for exemption * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-7\">The appendix to this opinion is organized on the assumption that Section 315(a) is not applicable to aliens who filed applications for exemption prior to December 24, 1952, the effective date of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. But even if this assumption is incorrect, and 315(a) is applicable to all petitions for naturalization adjudicated after December 24, 1952, irrespective of the date when petitioner applied for exemption, there is almost nothing in the cases to suggest a result contrary to the result reached in the present case. See note 8, infra.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b812-8\">. Section 3(a) of the 1940 Act provides in part:</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b812-21\">. But see note 7, infra</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b812-22\">. Section 403(b) of the 1952 Act repeals; all parts of prior laws inconsistent with provisions of the 1952 Act. As indicated in this opinion, 315(a) is inconsistent with \u00a7 3(a) of the 1940 Act and \u00a7 4(a) of the 1948 Act, and to that extent these-earlier acts are repealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b812-23\">. See Note 7 on Page 766.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b814-7\">. The eases footnoted 7 hold that the alien was not debarred from citizenship although he had filed an application for exemption. Insofar as these cases do not rely upon Section 315(a) (see note 3, supra and note 8, infra) they rest upon the doctrine of Moser v. United States, 1951, 341 U.S. 41, 71 S.Ct. 553, wherein the Supreme Court held that, in order to satisfy principles of elementary fairness, a waiver of eligibility for citizenship must have been knowing and intentional.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b814-8\">. In the above cases the courts purported to base the decision upon a construction of Section 315(a) even though the applications for exemption were filed before the effective date of the 1952 Act. While not indicating disapproval of the result reached in any of these cases, it can be argued that the ground of decision was incorrect for the reasons set out in note 3, supra. Even so, it is to be observed that in the \u25a0cases listed under I and II, only one, perhaps two, of them can be said to support the position that 315(a) disqualifies an alien who had applied for exemption but nevertheless was inducted thereafter. In Petition of Elken, supra, where naturalization was denied to a petitioner in service, the court based its decision almost entirely upon Petition of Kenny, 247 F.2d 139 (2 Cir.1957). Reliance upon Kenny was misplaced, however. Kenny rested upon the fact that there petitioner did not serve in the Armed Forces. In Petition of Carvajal, supra, it is not clear from the opinion whether petitioner had been inducted into the Armed Forces.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b814-11\">.

Appellee fully understood the consequences of his election in claiming draft exemption.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He traded ineligibility to become a citizen against relief from service \u2014 not a mere temporary stay or deferment subject to cancellation. However, the government\u2019s part of the bargain was that he be relieved from service. When the government by its own act destroyed Hoellger\u2019s exempt status by changing its arrangements with Germany, thereby making its nationals subject to service in our armed forces and thereafter compelled him to serve, it took away the consideration for the original bargain. Because the government deprived Hoellger of that which it represented to him would be granted, it is in no position to insist on enforcement of citizenship ineligibility, the price he was paying for that which he did not receive.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-12\">. Upon the hearing before the Examiner, appellee testified that he had originally been classified I-A and subsequently classified as a German treaty national. His answers to certain questions affirmatively establish that he knowingly and voluntarily chose exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">\u201cQ. Did you read this document when you signed it? A.
