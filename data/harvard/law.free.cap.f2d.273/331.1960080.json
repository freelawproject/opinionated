As basis for her right to recover she alleged, in substance, that she was employed by defendant General Cable Corporation at its plant in St. Louis, Missouri, on or about June 6, 1944; that from that date to about August 13, 1957, she worked in various departments and about the Spring of 1956, while serving as an employee of defendant, she began to work near certain bake enamel ovens; that the performance of her regular duties required her to work in close proximity to these ovens which, during all this time, would billow forth large quantities of noxious and harmful paint and enamel fumes; that in her employment she was exposed to these fumes, breathed and inhaled them many times each day, and absorbed them constantly each day, because she was required to work in close proximity to the source; that she complained of these conditions and asked defendant to eliminate them but defendant did not heed her complaints and incorrectly advised her that it was safe to work under the existing conditions; that defendant knew or should have known that injury to the health of plaintiff and others so employed was likely to occur if these conditions were not corrected; that as a direct result of defendant\u2019s failure to provide her with a safe place in which to work, or safety devices with which to work, she suffered physical injuries, principally a pulmonary emphysema.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">Defendant answered, denying all allegations of negligence. It affirmatively pleaded that it was a major, self-insured employer and had elected to comply with the provisions of the V/orkmen\u2019s Compensation Act of the State of Missouri, Section 287.010 et seq. RSMo 1949, V.A. M.S.; that the injuries of which plaintiff complains were compensable under said Act; that the court was without jurisdiction of the subject matter of the claim alleged; that exclusive jurisdiction of the adjudication thereof is vested solely in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission of Missouri; and that plaintiff and defendant were subject to and governed by the provisions of said Compensation Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-13\">In due course defendant moved for a summary judgment, basing its motion on the pleadings and an affidavit. The affidavit set forth the specific acts taken by defendant to bring it within the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of the State of Missouri, alleged that the plaintiff had not rejected the Act, affirmatively alleged that both the plaintiff and defendant were under the Workmen's Compensation Act and its \u201coccupational disease\u201d amendment, and alleged that the proper notices had been posted as required. There was no issue raised as to the allegations of defendant\u2019s affidavit showing that it had complied with the provisions requisite to bring it within the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act and its \u201coccupational disease\u201d amendment. The court, being of the view that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact, sustained the motion and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s complaint for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-14\">Plaintiff contends that the court erred in sustaining defendant\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>summary judgment. She takes the position that the nature of her action is a damage suit in which she was injured while employed by the defendant and the injury was not the result of an \u201caccident\u201d within the meaning of that word as used in the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act but was due to the negligence of the defendant in failing to furnish her with a reasonably safe place in which to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"> As this is a diversity of citizenship action, the rights of the parties must be determined by the applicable Missouri law. If the cause of action alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint is to recover for an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d then the injuries for which plaintiff seeks to recover come within the provisions of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act of Missouri, as amended, which is exclusive, and hence plaintiff cannot maintain a common law action. Marie v. Standard Steel Works, Mo., 319 S.W.2d 871; King v. Monsanto Chemical Co., 8 Cir., 256 F.2d 812; Smith v. Harbison-Walker Refractories Co., 340 Mo. 389, 100 S.W.2d 909; Smith v. Stanolind Pipe Line Co., 354 Mo. 250, 189 S.W.2d 244; State ex rel. Fisher Body St. Louis Co. v. Shain, 345 Mo. 962, 137 S.W.2d 546; Fitzgerald v. Fisher Body St. Louis Co., 234 Mo. App. 269, 130 S.W.2d 975; Sanford v. Valier-Spies Milling Co., Mo.App., 235 S.W.2d 92. Thus, in Marie v. Standard Steel Works, supra, the Supreme Court of Missouri, referring to the applicable law in cases arising under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as amended, among other things said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201cThe compensation act, including the occupational disease amendment where applicable, is not supplemental or declaratory of any existing rule, right or remedy, but creates an entirely new right or remedy and where the employer and employee have elected to accept the provisions of the act such new right or remedy is wholly substitutional in character and supplants all other rights and remedies, at common law or otherwise.\u201d [319 S.W.2d 875.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">In King v. Monsanto Chemical Co., supra [256 F.2d 814], Judge Sanborn, speaking for this Court, reviewed all the applicable Missouri law on the question we are now considering, and in the course of his opinion said, inter alia:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201cIt is conceded that the parties were both subject to the Act. It is, therefore, clear that if the plaintiff\u2019s cancerous condition is an \u2018occupational disease\u2019 within the meaning of the Missouri Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, he is, as the defendant contends, entitled to nothing more than the compensation and other benefits provided by that law for an employee in his condition and with his disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">No material changes in the applicable Missouri law, statutory or judicial, have been called to our attention since Judge Sanborn\u2019s opinion in King v. Monsanto Chemical Co., supra, and we have found none.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Plaintiff alleges that her exposure to the noxious and harmful paint and enamel fumes sent forth from the bake enamel ovens of defendant so injured her lungs and breathing system that she was caused to suffer a pulmonary emphysema. Was this, under the facts alleged in plaintiff\u2019s complaint, an \u201coccupational disease\u201d within the purview of the controlling legislative acts as interpreted by the appellate courts of Missouri ? This question was considered by us in King v. Monsanto Chemical Co., supra, wherein it was contended that cancer from which the plaintiff was suffering was not an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d After reviewing many of the Missouri decisions, it was held that, under the facts in that case, cancer was an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d In the course of the opinion it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-10\">\u201cApparently it is the plaintiff\u2019s theory that if a disease, at the time it was contracted, was not known to be incidental and peculiar to an occupation, it was not an \u2018occupational disease,\u2019 and the fact that it subsequently came to be known to have resulted from and to be incidental and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>peculiar to that occupation would not bring it within the coverage of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act as an \u2018occupational disease.\u2019 That seems to us to be illogical, since it is fair to' assume that as to employers and employees who accepted the Occupational Disease Amendment, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was intended to cover both injuries and diseases resulting from and incidental to the hazards of a particular occupation in which they were engaged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">It is plaintiff\u2019s contention that her disease was contracted, not because of her occupation, but because of the place or surroundings in which she was required to follow her occupation. In support of this position she says that she was by occupation a wire inspector, that fine wire is free from fumes, that inspecting such wire is hazardless if performed in an open field; hence, it is impossible for a fine wire inspector to sustain an \u201coccupational disease,\u201d even when required to work in a \u201cphysical location that subjected her to a foreseeable peril.\u201d We think this contention finds no support in the controlling Missouri decisions and is in the teeth of what is said by us in King v. Monsanto Chemical Co., supra, to the effect that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cThat seems to us to be illogical, since it is fair to assume that as to employers and employees who accepted the Occupational Disease Amendment, the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act was intended to cover both injuries and diseases resulting from and incidental to the hazards of a particular occupation in which they were engaged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">In Marie v. Standard Steel Works, supra, the court held that loss of hearing was an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d The employee in that case was a welder, not an unusually noisy occupation as such, but he was required to work inside a tank within six feet of where other workers were working and hammering on another tank. Metal finishers, using disk grinders and polishers which made a loud, high pitched noise, also worked \u201cin this general area.\u201d [319 S.W.2d 873.] There was noise from punch presses in the same department. The noise which induced loss of hearing was incident to the place where he worked, not the inherent nature of a welder\u2019s job. Plaintiff in King v. Monsanto Chemical Co., supra [256 F.2d 813], was a pipe-fitter, an occupation which certainly carries no special peril of disease as such. However, he was required to do such work in a place where defendant \u201cpermitted poisonous, noxious and deleterious * * * fumes, vapors, gases and other substances to enter,\u201d which he inhaled in the course of his work, to his injury, and we held, under the applicable Missouri law, that plaintiff had contracted an \u201coccupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">We are convinced that the trial court committed no error in holding that the injury for which plaintiff claims damages was an \u201coccupational disease\u201d, and hence plaintiff could not maintain a common law action but her remedy was such compensation as provided by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as amended. The court was therefore correct in dismissing the case for want of jurisdiction and the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
