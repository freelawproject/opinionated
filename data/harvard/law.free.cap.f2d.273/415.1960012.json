A provision in the contract required the owners to complete construction within ten months; otherwise the oil company should have the option, to be exercised within sixty days, to complete the work and take the lease, or to abandon the project entirely. Difficulty in financing and other causes delayed the owners\u2019 performance; the oil company elected to cancel; and the owners claimed that on principles of waiver, estoppel or election the company\u2019s conduct should bar it from cancelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">After trial on the merits the District Court denied relief and entered judgment for the defendants. The District Judge filed a carefully considered and comprehensive opinion which we adopt as our own. See 1959, 171 F.Supp. 400.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
