The plaintiff claims that an operator in the defendant\u2019s beauty parlor permanently impaired the plaintiff\u2019s hearing by negligently permitting shampoo liquid to enter her left ear. According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, she had a perforated eardrum and asked the operator for cotton to put in her ears, telling her \u201cI only had one good ear and I had to protect that\u201d; she received and used the cotton; but the operator did not put her hands over the plaintiff\u2019s ears, and liquid entered in such quantities that the cotton had to be replaced several times.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-22\">The court thought, and we agree, that the plaintiff made a prima facie case of proximate cause; \u201cnamely, some liquid that she got into her ear caused the impairment of hearing.\u201d The court directed a verdict for the defendant on the ground that there was \u201cno proof of any negligence * * * not sufficient proof here that the operator departed from accepted standards.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b880-23\">In response to a hypothetical question based on the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, the director of a \u201cbeauty college\u201d testified that the defendant\u2019s operator was not \u201cexercising that degree of skill and care usually exercised by beauty parlour operators of ordinary skill, ability and prudence who are engaged in the busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ness of giving shampoos in this community.\u201d The owner of a beauty shop testified by deposition that the operator was not \u201cexercising that degree of skill and care which is usually exercised by a person of ordinary skill, ability and prudence * * * engaged in the business of giving shampoos, permanent waves, tints, and haircutting in this community.\u201d Specifically, this witness testified that in order to give a good shampoo it is necessary that the operator put her hand over the customer\u2019s ear, and that if the defendant\u2019s operator failed to \u201ccup\u201d the ear, i. e. put a hand over it and bring it forward, she \u201cwasn\u2019t observing good practice.\u201d We think this evidence would have supported a finding of negligence and the case should have been submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
