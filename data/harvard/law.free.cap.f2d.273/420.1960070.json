This is true for two reasons. First, the record makes it altogether clear that appellant and his attorney acquiesced in, and in substantial effect consented to, the action of the state trial court in discharging the jury; and second, from all of the circumstances established and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>appearing to the state trial court, it was a proper exercise of his discretion to conclude that appellant could probably not receive a fair and impartial trial before the jury as then constituted and that the jury should therefore be discharged. This action of the trial court was taken to safeguard appellant\u2019s rights, and, under the circumstances, the later trial of appellant before the Court upon the same charge did not constitute double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The order of the District Court denying the petition for the writ of habeas corpus is, accordingly, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
