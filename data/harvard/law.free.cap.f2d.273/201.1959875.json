The Company shall not be required to permit any payee to make more than four (4) partial withdrawals during any one contract year, nor to permit any partial withdrawal of an amount less than Fifty Dollars ($50). If by any withdrawals the balance retained for any payee would be reduced to less than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000), the Company shall have the right to pay such balance in one sum to the payee who would then be entitled to receive payments thereunder, in full discharge of all liability of the Company.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cExcept as otherwise expressly provided in this agreement, no payee shall have any right to assign, alienate, anticipate or commute any installments or payments, to make withdrawals of proceeds, or to make any change in the above provisions; and except as otherwise prescribed by law, no payment of interest or of principal shall be subject to the debts, contract or engagement of any payee, nor to any judicial process to levy upon or attach the same for the payment thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">The \u201cFourth Option\u201d referred to in the beneficiary clause reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201cMonthly interest payments at the rate of $2.06 for each One Thousand Dollars of the amount applied to this Option, commencing one month after this Option becomes operative and continuing, during the life of the Payee, or such other period as may be mutually agreed upon with the Company. This interest is the equivalent of two and one-half per cent at the end of the year. At the decease of the Payee or at the end of the period agreed upon, the amount then retained, with any accrued interest, shall be paid in one sum, unless otherwise provided.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The pertinent portions of the Equitable beneficiary clause provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">\u201c1. Settlement of the net sum due under this policy by reason of the death of the Insured shall be made with the Insured's wife, Cleo Werbe, if living at the death of the Insured, as provided in paragraph 2, if not then living, the said sum becoming due shall be divided into the number of equal shares that will provide :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">\u201cOne share for each of the Insured\u2019s sons, Thomas C. Werbe, Jr. and Richard H. Werbe who may be living at the death of the Insured and settlement of each such share shall be made with said respective child as provided in paragraph 3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-14\">\u201cOne share for the then living children of each said son of the Insured who may not be living at the death of the Insured and each such share shall be paid in a single sum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>in equal shares to said children of said deceased sons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cShould the Insured\u2019s said wife, the Insured\u2019s said sons and the children of the Insured\u2019s said sons be not living at the death of the Insured, the said sum becoming due shall be paid in a single sum to the executors or administrators of the Insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201c2. A. The amount becoming due to said wife under paragraph 1 shall be applied under Option 1 of the Modes of Settlement at Maturity of Policy with interest payable annually to said wife during her lifetime, except</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201c(1) On interest due date said wife may elect to withdraw all of the amount then held under Option 1 or any part thereof but no partial withdrawals may be made for less than One Hundred Dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-8\">\u201c4. Payment of any such with-drawable hereunder at the option of a beneficiary may be deferred by the Society for a period not exceeding six months after receipt of application therefor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">Option 1, mentioned in 2. A., above, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">\u201cDeposit Option: Left on deposit with the Society at interest guaranteed at the rate of 3 per cent per annum, with such Excess Interest Dividend as may be apportioned.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">The learned District Judge concluded that the surviving spouse had only a terminable interest in the proceeds of the policies within the meaning of Section 812(e) (1) (B) of the Code as the proceeds might, upon the occurrence of an event, ultimately pass from decedent to persons other than the surviving spouse for less than full consideration, and that the proceeds did not qualify for marital deduction under the exception set out in Section 812(e)(1)(G) because the surviving spouse\u2019s power of appointment over the proceeds was not exercisable in all events. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">Plaintiff contends that Mrs. Werbe, the surviving spouse, had the right to withdraw the entire proceeds of the New England policies at the death of the insured because the restrictive language applies not to withdrawal <em>at </em>death, but only to withdrawal <em>after </em>death.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-14\">The Director of Estate Planning Services for New England, with more than thirty years, experience in supervising settlement requests, testified that New England would have paid the entire proceeds promply on receipt of Mrs. Wer-be\u2019s request therefor, if such request were received before or with proof of death; and that had she made such request and died prior to receipt of proof of death by New England, then New England would have paid the proceeds to Mrs. Werbe\u2019s personal representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-15\">However, as the District Court found, the provisions of the policies before us are not ambiguous or contradictory. Additional explanatory parol evidence is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-16\">The New England policies provide that the proceeds are payable on receipt of proof of death. These proceeds are retained under the Fourth Option, <em>supra, </em>which becomes operative on decease of the insured. Interest payments to Mrs. Werbe begin one month after that, if she survives, and continue for her life. If Mrs. Werbe dies while the option is operative, amounts due on the proceeds go in equal shares to the insured\u2019s sons. Thus Mrs. Werbe\u2019s interest is terminable and, on occurrence of the stated contingency, it can pass to the sons for less than full consideration under Section 812(e) (1) (B). The exception provided in Section 812(e) (1) (G) is applicable only if, under the terms of the contract, Mrs. Wer-be\u2019s power to appoint is exercisable by her alone and in all events.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-17\">The policy provides that the Fourth Option goes into effect on decease, not on receipt of proof of death. Mrs. Werbe may make withdrawals only while the Fourth Option is operative. She may make such withdrawals on interest payment dates, the first of which comes one month after decease. Thus Mrs. Werbe could not exercise her right \u201cin all events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Plaintiff relies on Kellar v. Kasper, D. C. S.Dak.1956, 138 F.Supp. 738; Steele v. United States, D.C.Mont.1956, 146 F. Supp. 316; and Smith v. United States, D. C.Colo.1957, 158 F.Supp. 344. These cases held that the devised property (under the terms of the respective wills involved) vested at death, under the respective state laws concerned (although each will conditioned inheritance on survival to the time of distribution) and therefore held that the property qualified for marital deduction. These are clearly distinguishable on facts from the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">With respect to all five policies, plaintiff contends that the restrictions on withdrawal were solely for the administrative convenience of the insurers and did not prevent Mrs. Werbe\u2019s exercise of her rights \u201cin all events\u201d. Plaintiff refers to Treasury Department Regulations 105, Section 81.47a(d) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-7\">\u201cA contract which otherwise requires the insurer to make annual or more frequent payments to the surviving spouse following the decedent\u2019s death will not be disqualified merely because the surviving spouse must comply with certain formalities in order to obtain the first payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Plaintiff construes all of these as mere formalities: (1) the New England restriction of withdrawal to monthly interest payment dates; its right to require 90 days\u2019 written notice, to limit withdrawals to four annually, or to refuse partial withdrawals of less than $50; (2) Equitable\u2019s restriction of withdrawals to annual interest payment dates, to defer payment for six months after application of withdrawal, and to refuse partial withdrawals of less than $100.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">Both New England\u2019s Director of Estate Planning Services and the President of Associates Life Insurance Company of Indianapolis, Indiana, testified that such provisions are commonly inserted into policies for convenience of insurers to minimize administrative expense; that they do not prevent the surviving spouse from having a power of appointment \u201cin all events\u201d at the moment of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">As indicated, we are not here consid-ring contradictory or ambiguous provisions which require explanation. It is possible that, as a practicable matter, Mrs. Werbe might have secured all the proceeds in certain circumstances. However, we cannot agree that she could have exercised her right \u201cin all events.\" The possibility of disability is present and thus it is possible that the surviving spouse\u2019s power of appointment would not be exercisable \u201cin all events\u201d. Starrett v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 1955, 223 F.2d 163, 167. The decision of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\">.
