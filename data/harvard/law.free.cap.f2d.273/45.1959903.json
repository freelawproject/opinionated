that the insurer, thus advised, accepted the notice and immediately commenced and prosecuted its investigation ; and that, since the notice clause provides that \u201cit shall be given by or for the insured * * * as soon as practicable\u201d, White\u2019s notice fully sufficed as a notice by both insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">The defenses to the claim under the assistance and cooperation clause were: that, while it is true that White did falsely state that he was driving, this statement was not made in collusion with the claimants or to damage, or with intent to prevent or impair the insurer\u2019s defense, but was made because of his desire, as between himself and his nephew, to protect his nephew by assuming the full responsibility for the occurrence and taking upon himself whatever consequences the law visited upon the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-13\">As to the failure to earlier inform the insurer of the true facts, the defense was that, having taken upon himself the blame by pleading guilty to a charge of aggravated assault, he was loath to change his statement unless and until it became necessary to do so, and that, when confronted with the necessity of giving a deposition and thus making a statement under oath of the true facts, he in advance of giving his testimony advised the counsel for the insurer of the true facts and in the deposition fully stated them.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-14\">In defense of the claims of breach of both policy provisions and particularly of the cooperation provision, defendant relied on the governing principle <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in such cases that, in order to avoid obligations under a policy on such grounds, the insurer has the burden to show a substantial and material breach, that is that some prejudice to the company has resulted therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-15\">Finally, as to both the claims of breach, appellants assert that if there was any material breach of either the notice or the cooperation provisions of the policy, the insurer, by continuing to defend the case, with knowledge of the claimed breaches, waived them.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-16\">The case was tried to the court without a jury on evidence presenting no dispute of fact but only a dispute of law, and the district judge, in an opinion <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> fully setting out the undisputed facts and canvassing the disputed questions of law, determined and declared: (1) that the notice containing deliberately false information as to who was the driver was \u201cno notice at all\u201d; (2) that such deceit, continued as it was for a period of seven months following, was a substantial and material breach of the cooperation clause; and (3) that \u201cthe insurer here has been prejudiced\u201d by the breach of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>clause; and entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Appellants here thus epitomizing the undisputed facts as found in the record <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and urging upon us that the district judge erred in law in so determining and deciding, insists that the judgment should be reversed and here rendered for appellants or at least reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\"><em>We </em>agree with appellants that the judgment was wrong and must be reversed with directions to deny the relief asked.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">This is so, first because the conclusion of the judge, that the notice given by White was no notice at all, while supported by some of the cases cited by appellee in its brief, is in our opinion not a correct statement of the law. Cf. General Acc. Fire &amp; Life Assur. Corp. v. Rinnert, 5 Cir., 170 F.2d 440; American Indem. Co. v. Davis, 5 Cir., 260 F.2d 440; Am.Jur. 5A, \u201cAutomobile Insurance\u201d, Sec. 136; Standard Acc. Ins. Co. of Detroit, Mich. v. Winget, 9 Cir., 197 F.2d 97, 34 A.L.R.2d 250. Certainly the Klein case, Klein v. Century Lloyds, 154 Tex. 160, 275 S.W.2d 95, does not support this view. That case went off entirely on the ground not that Gunter gave a false notice and therefore gave no notice at all, but that Gunter, who gave no notice at all until thirty-two days after the accident when an adjuster took a statement from him, as a matter of law failed to give the required notice \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d 154 Tex. at pages 162-163, 275 S.W.2d at page 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">It is so, second, because under the overwhelming weight of authority, including that of the courts of Texas, it is the law that it is essential to proof of breach of the cooperation clause, that actual, not merely suppositious or theoretical prejudice to the insurer therefrom be shown,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and no such showing is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">. \u201c3. <em>Notice.

Griffin, D.C., 178 F.Supp. 678.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">. \u201cThe accident was July 28, 1957, and involved a pick-up truck owned by White and covered by the policy issued by Ap-peEee to the named assured, White. White, the named insured, gave notice of the accident to Appellee Insurer on July 30, 1957, stating that he was driving the automobile, and that notice started insurer\u2019s investigation. Suits for damages to recover for injuries to minor appellants, Griffin and Richardson, were filed in Port Bend County, Texas, Dec. 4, 1957 against White. Depositions in the Port Bend County suits were taken Peb. 28, 1958. Before such depositions were taken, Arthur AYhite told Mr. Gannon, the attorney for appellee-insurer, that he was not the driver but that his minor nephew, Arthur Lee Felder, was the driver, and he so testified on his deposition. Mr. Gannon, with full knowledge of all the facts, nevertheless continued in the defense of the damage suits in Port Bend County. Mr. Gannon filed this suit for declaratory judgment, but he has continued in the defense of the damage suits in Port Bend County to this date.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab2\">\u201cAppellee-Insurer does not claim any fraud or collusion between claimants and insureds.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b96-14\">.
