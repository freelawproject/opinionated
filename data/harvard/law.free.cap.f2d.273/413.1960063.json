The first is whether the governmental agency\u2019s final decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second is wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>er, as a matter of law, the request by appellant for relief from military service as a native of a neutral country could operate to deprive him of his right to later becoming a citizen<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when, m fact, the country of his citizenship was later declared to be a co-belligerent instead of a neutral nation.</p>\n<p id=\"Axgd\">Touching on the first question is appellant\u2019s charge that he was unable to have produced certain documents in the hands of the immigration authorities which would have disclosed that at the time he executed the form DSS 301 he could not read, write or speak the English language. Appellant urges on us, as he did on the trial court, that this fact was relevant to his contention that he could not intelligently \u201celect between service in the Armed Forces and denial of citizenship.\u201d This, we think, is a complete non sequitur. It does not at all follow, nor could it be inferred, that because appellant was unable to read, write or speak English he therefore did not voluntarily and intelligently prepare and sign the form requesting exemption from military service. No other proof was offered by him that he was in fact not able intelligently to make the request, T, . . , . . , ., , \u201e ,, \u201e it is immaterial whether he fully appre- , , , ,,,,,, , i. hended what would be the legal resu t flowing from such request. The result was such as was fixed by law. So long as it is not disputed on the record that he knew the effect of the request, that is that he would acquire an exemption from military duty, it is not necessary that he also know that by obtaining such exemption he was thereafter subjecting himself to the disabilities such action entailed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The document which he sought to have produced in the hearing before the Special Inquiry Officer, showing only that he did not read, write or speak English, would not have thrown any light on the issue whether he understood the effect and purpose of his request for exemption,</p>\n<p id=\"AEz\">As to the second point&gt; we need on]y dte our earlier deciaion in Jubran v. United States, 5 Cir., 255 F.2d 81. Appellant is here relying upon the deci. gion of the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan in Petition of Aj*\u00b0unyt E.Supp. 327, for the proposi\u00ed'lon ^bid: a <em>reclues^ </em>bled as was ^bis one 18 ^effective to debar the applicant from citizenship when the country, then a neutral&gt; 18 later held by the Executive De<em>P^tment </em>to be a co-belhgerent. _ We do not behevf an^ 8Uch holdlTn? 18 war~ wanted. We so held m the Jubran case, ,Here\u2019 a8m tbe Jubran ease, the appellaat aPPhed for and <em>obtained </em>a defer-rfd 8tatas by reason of his request on the baS18 of hls bem? a \u201ctlzen of wbat be thought was and for all we know actually was untd theTTlater. determination, a nea1fal country- He enjoyed his defer\u2122ent f\u00b0r some saven months, after which hl8 draft statas ^a8 changed to eliminate his ground for deferment. Upon tbe execution of such request and the granting of the deferment it is our view \u00ab?at ^e statute inexorably attached the disqualification. As we said m Jubran, the statute gave him the choice of ex- ,. , ... . . emption and no citizenship, or no exempt\u00edon and citizenship/, and further&gt; \u00abthe bar arigeg from the making of the appli_ cabion and the granting of relief from military service.\u201d Jubran v.
