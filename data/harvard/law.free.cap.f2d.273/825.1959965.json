The District Court on motion of the ap-pellees<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dismissed the caveat, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Appellees argue that the widow is not a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of D.C.Code \u00a7 19-307 (1951). Relying upon Kimberland v. Kimberland,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> they say the widow lacks standing when \u201cshe has the statutory power to renounce her deceased spouse\u2019s will and to claim the same share of the estate as she would take by intestacy if the will were held invalid.\u201d The District Court had agreed with that contention. In Kimberland the caveator argued that his \u201cdifferent\u201d share or claim stemmed from the possibility that he might be appointed administrator. We then deemed that contingency too remote to predicate standing, and do so now to the extent that appellant here relies upon any such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">But a very different element is otherwise presented on this record. The interrogatories to the caveator and her verified but unchallenged and uncontro-verted replies are before us. We need not catalogue details which, as they now appear, disclose that a substantial issue-attends the execution of the will and the testator\u2019s capacity at the time. This factor is relevant and may be critical since-the executor in seeking probate of the will listed among the testator\u2019s debts, one of $18,670.02 to his son and another of $11,515.76 to the daughter. The record, indicates that both claims might be barred by the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>' In the first clause of the will, the testator acknowledges his indebtedness to his son. and daughter, directs his executor to-make that indebtedness a first charge upon all his property, and after an accounting, to pay the amount of such debts to-his son and daughter. Such directions, if executed, will place the son and daughter-in such position that possibly stale-claims, if allowed, will depreciate the-dollar value of the widow\u2019s share by as-much as $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-15\">D.C.Code \u00a7 18-515 (1951) provides: \u201cIt shall not be considered as the duty of an executor or administrator to avail himself of the act of limitations to bar what he supposes to be a just claim, but the same shall be left to his honesty and; discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">Under that statute, if this-were an intestate estate, the administrator whoever he might be,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> would first, pass upon the justice of the claims. Then, after they shall have been critically-examined by the Probate Court, they still would not be allowed,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> unless the court be satisfied that they are just. Such prerequisites must be established, not only to permit of an allowance of the stale claims by the administrator but to justify an allowance of the administrator\u2019s account by the Probate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>No less strict compliance is required \u2022of an executor. What facts will establish the justice of a stale claim are largely left by the statute \u201cto his honesty and \u2022discretion.\u201d At this juncture, then, we reexamine the facts so far disclosed of record. The appellees in their brief argue to us that \u201cthe children may offer the will as evidence in proof of their claims, the will being a written admission by the testator of his indebtedness.\u201d But the caveat charges that the named executor was one of those whose conduct procured the will to be so written. All appellees would look to the will as important evidence to establish the claims. It may be developed by evidence that the son\u2019s claim was eleven years and the daughter\u2019s, some six years or more, past due. The executor in his petition for letters testamentary specifically identified the son\u2019s claim as a debt which had been so acknowledged in the will. The executor\u2019s allegation as to the daughter\u2019s claim was of like tenor and import, particularly when read in context with the terms of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Under such circumstances, whether or not a <em>valid </em>will was executed becomes \u2022material. Whether or not the purported \u2022acknowledgment of the debts in question represented the will of the testator, or of .some other party or parties, presents an issue as to which the caveator is entitled to a jury trial. While in any event, whether the will be valid or not the son and daughter must prove that just debts in fact are owing,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it may yet develop that the purported testamentary acknowledgment by the testator is to be vitiated. The widow as caveator is not to be bound by language in a void instrument whether it be a will or any comparable document for which like effect is claimed. Surely, if the son and daughter had through fraud procured the testator\u2019s signature on a note, it would not be contended that a valid debt could nevertheless be so evidenced. In Moore v. Snider,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we strictly construed the requirements for revival of a debt barred by the statute of limitations. We held that the party charged was entitled to show in a trial that her signature had been procured through false representations. We reversed the District Court which had entered judgment on the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">We have said enough to indicate why the exceptional circumstances herein noted served to distinguish this case from Kimberland v. Kimberland, supra. Accordingly, we are satisfied that in the instant situation, the widow is a \u201cparty in interest\u201d within the meaning of D.C. Code \u00a7 19-307 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-10\">.
