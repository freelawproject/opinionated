We find no error in the ruling of the trial court that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, appellee\u2019s action is not barred by the statute of limitations. Cf. Rosario v. United States, 1939, 70 App.D.C. 323,106 F.2d 844, certiorari denied 1940, 308 U.S. 606, 60 S.Ct. 143, 84 L.Ed. 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<author id=\"b133-20\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AMK\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-21\">I think appellee\u2019s suit on her meritorious claim is barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
