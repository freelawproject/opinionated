See \u00a7 941.03., .07, Fla. Stat. (2018) (describing rendition warrants); \u00a7 941.13 (describing two procedures under which a \"credible person\" may bring forth appropriate allegations to effect the arrest and detention of an alleged out-of-state fugitive from justice); France v. Judd,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8426089\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/932/1263/#p1268\">\n    932 So. 2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006) (\"[T]he deputy was a recipient of information and not the source of credible information. Thus, none of the affidavits constituted a charge on the oath of a credible person that [the petitioner] had committed a crime in another state and had fled from justice .... Nor did any of the arrest affidavits have attached to it or make reference to an affidavit of a credible person in another state that a crime had been committed in that state and that [petitioner] had been charged with committing it.\"). The petitioner shall be brought before the court immediately and released with respect to the aforementioned cases. But see Whetstone v.
