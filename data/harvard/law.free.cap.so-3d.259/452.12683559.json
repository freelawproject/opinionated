Love, Judge Edwin A. Lombard, Judge Tiffany G. Chase )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Appellant Brian Mule, seeks review of the March 2, 2018 judgment of the Office of Workers' Compensation (\"OWC\"), holding that his claim for compensation against the Appellee, the St. Bernard Fire Department, was prescribed, and that the estoppel exception to prescription was inapplicable. We affirm the judgment of the OWC, finding that the decision of the OWC is not manifestly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Mule was an employee of the Appellee, when, on May 22, 2009, he injured his back while transporting a patient down a set of stairs. It is uncontested that he properly reported the incident and injury to the Appellee. As a result of the incident, he received medical treatment and was restricted from work. He received epidural injections and physical therapy treatment for his injuries. Mr. Mule was paid Worker's Compensation indemnity benefits from the date of his injury through July 24, 2009, when he was released to return to work. Mr. Mule testified that he received his full pay while out from work and did not lose any of his benefits as a result of sustaining an on-duty injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reflects that a Worker's Compensation Form 1002, a Notice of Payment form, was submitted by the Appellee to the Louisiana Workforce Commission on July 2, 2009, stating that Mr. Mule has been paid \"full pay in lieu of comp.\" However, Mr. Mule testified no one ever explained this to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Following his return to work in 2009, Mr. Mule periodically suffered with more intensive back pain, causing him to miss more time from work. He received full pay during each of these absences, as more fully described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   He experienced back pain in March 2011, for which he received treatment and had to miss time from work. He was diagnosed with a herniated disc. He again received full pay while absent from work in 2011. He later returned to work. In 2013, his back pain returned and he received treatment and underwent surgery, causing him to miss time from work. He continued experiencing pain and had another surgery in 2014, wherein a neuro-stimulator was implanted into his spinal cord on June 26, 2014. He returned to work on August 18, 2014. Nevertheless, Mr. Mule testified that the stimulator dislodged a few months later, causing him to have another surgery, but to no avail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Despite passing a functional capacity exam in December 2014, Mr. Mule was not able to return to work because he was unable to perform his job without taking pain medications. In 2016, Mr. Mule was advised by his treating neurologist, Dr. Gregory L. Fautheree, that his treatment options for pain had been exhausted and that it was best for Mr. Mule to retire. Mr. Mule did opt to retire. Thereafter, he filed a Disputed Claim for Compensation on March 16, 2017, wherein he named the Appellee as a defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A trial was held on November 30, 2017, in the OWC. Mr. Mule and Stephanie Bradbury were the only two witnesses who testified at trial. Ms. Bradbury, the insurance or risk manager for St. Bernard Parish, testified that Mr. Mule received indemnity benefits from May 22, 2009, through July 24, 2009. She explained that the Appellee and St. Bernard Parish government are self-insured. She stated that Mr. Mule received no further indemnity benefits after July 2009. She testified that she explained to Mr. Mule in 2013, when he called her seeking assistance with having his initial surgery approved, that his indemnity benefits had prescribed. She\n   further testified that she explained to him that his indemnity or supplemental earnings benefits had prescribed when he retired in 2016. Lastly, she explained that in 2011, an internal notation was made within the file of the third party administrator, FARA/York, citing that Mr. Mule's indemnity claim had prescribed. This notation was admitted into evidence at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    The OWC later ruled that Mr. Mule's right to indemnity benefits had prescribed under the Louisiana Worker's Compensation Act, and that the estoppel exception to prescription was inapplicable. Mr. Mule's claim was dismissed with prejudice.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    Mr. Mule timely filed the instant appeal. He raises two assignments of error:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n    1. The OWC judge erred in failing to calculate the prescriptive period from the date he became disabled under La. Rev. Stat. 23: 1031(E); and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n    2. The OWC judge erred in holding that the estoppel exception to prescription did not apply.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    The jurisprudence is well settled that in workers' compensation cases the appropriate standard of review to be applied by an appellate court in reviewing a WCJ's factual findings is the manifest error standard.\n    <em>\n     Dean v.

Rev. Stat. 23:1031.1 (E). The Appellee notes, however, that Mr. Mule did not raise this issue before the OWC. Therefore, it argues that he is precluded from raising this issue for the first time on appeal. We agree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Pursuant to our review of the record, Mr. Mule failed to urge that his herniated disc is an occupational disease. Mr. Mule's arguments before the OWC centered upon the denial of his request for supplemental earnings benefits (SEBs) and that the Appellee should be estopped from raising prescription. He did not address having an occupational disease at trial, or in his pre-trial statement or post-trial memorandum.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    \"Pursuant to Rule 1-3, Uniform Rules-Courts of Appeal,\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    issues not raised in the district court will not be given consideration for the first time on appeal.\"\n    <em>\n     Guillory v.

Moreover, because this issue was not raised below, the record is devoid of arguments and evidence for this Court to review related to this assignment of error. Therefore, we find that Mr. Mule is precluded from raising this assignment of error as the OWC did not have an opportunity to review this issue.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     ESTOPPEL\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    In the alternative, Mr. Mule asserts that the estoppel exception to prescription applies. He contends that he was induced by the Appellee's tender of full pay during each of his absences, which lulled him into a false sense of security about whether he should file a claim for indemnity benefits. The Appellee, in response, maintains that following July 24, 2009, all of the payments tendered to Mr. Mule were for his medical claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    This Court has previously explained the applicability of estoppel in workers' compensation actions and what is required to prevail on an estoppel exception claim:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    A workers' compensation claimant may avoid prescription by proving that his case falls under one of the 'refinements' or exceptions developed in the jurisprudence. 14 H. Alston Johnson, III, LA. CIV. L. TREATISE, WORKERS' COMPENSATION LAW AND PRACTICE \u00a7 384 (5th ed.).
