Lombard, Judge Daniel L. Dysart, Judge Paula A. Brown )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Paula A. Brown\n   This appeal arises out of an insurance policy coverage dispute between the insurer, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America (\"Travelers\") and its insured, The Ville St. John Owners' Association, Inc. (the \"Association\"). Travelers filed a Motion for Summary Judgment contesting coverage, and the Association filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court granted Travelers' motion for summary judgment and denied the Association's cross-motion; the district court dismissed, with prejudice, all of the direct action claims against Travelers. The Association appeals, seeking review of this judgment. For the reasons set forth below, the district court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Tripp Forrest was Trustee for the Jack Thrash Forrest III Trust (the \"Trust\"), and the Trust owned unit, number 301 (the \"unit\"), in a condominium complex managed by the Association. On March 3, 2016, a fire occurred in the unit resulting in damage to the unit and to common elements of the condominium complex. The Association carried a commercial property insurance policy with Lloyd's, London, International Insurance Company of Hannover SE (\"Lloyd's, London\"), and the unit was insured under the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Association made a claim under the commercial property insurance policy for payment of losses suffered as a result of the fire damage to the unit and the common elements of the complex. Lloyd's, London accepted coverage for the loss and paid the Association; the payment to the Association represented specific amounts for repairing the common elements and, separately, the unit. With the payments from Lloyd's, London, the Association repaired the common elements but had insufficient monies to pay for repairs to the unit. As a result, the Trust filed a Petition and an Amended and Superseding Petition for Damages against the Association asserting the following pertinent claims:\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 1: Breach of Duty under Civil Code article 2315\n   </strong>\n   17.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n   Under La. R.S. La. R.S. 9:1123.112(D), the Association had the fiduciary, contractual, and legal duty to adjust the insurance claim reasonably both for itself as well as for the Trust. To the extent the Association failed to secure adequate compensation for the loss of both the common elements and the Trust's condominium, the Association breached that duty. Further, to the extent the Association performed minimal repairs within the Trust's unit and did so in a negligent manner, it has also breached its duties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   To the extent the Association failed to secure adequate compensation to repair the Trust's unit, and to the extent it negligently repaired the unit, it has proximately caused the Trust to sustain damages in that the unit remains damaged and unrepaired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   19.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The Association is, therefore, liable to Mr. Forrest (in his capacity as Trustee)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-17\">\n   under article 2315 for an amount to appropriately repair the unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Count 2: Failure to Repair under the Louisiana Condominium Act\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   23.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-21\">\n   The Association has failed to \"promptly\" repair the Trust's unit and has likewise failed to pay the Trust the proper amount to repair the damage. This conduct violates La. R.S. 9:1123.112(G) and renders the Association liable to Mr. Forrest (in his capacity as Trustee) for the amount to repair the Trust's unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The Appellant, in its brief to this Court, mistakenly refers to the insurer of the commercial property insurance policy as Travelers, but the record indicates the insurer was Lloyd's, London.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    La.

Any loss covered by the property policy under Subsection A(1) shall be adjusted with the association, but the insurance proceeds for that loss shall be payable to any insurance trustee designated for that purpose, or otherwise to the association, and not to any mortgagee. The insurance trustee or the association shall hold any insurance proceeds in trust for unit owners and lien holders as their interests may appear. Subject to the provisions of Subsection G, the proceeds shall be disbursed first for the repair or restoration of the damaged common elements and units, and unit owners and lien holders are not entitled to receive payment of any portion of the proceeds unless there is a surplus of proceeds after the common elements and units have been completely repaired or restored, or the condominium is terminated.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    G.

The cost of repair or replacement in excess of insurance proceeds and reserves is a common expense. If the entire condominium is not repaired or replaced, (1) the insurance proceeds attributable to the damaged common elements shall be used to restore the damaged area to a condition compatible with the remainder of the condominium, (2) the insurance proceeds attributable to units and limited common elements which are not rebuilt shall be distributed to the owners of those units and the owners of the units to which those limited common elements were assigned, and (3) the remainder of the proceeds shall be distributed to all the unit owners in proportion to their common element interest. If the unit owners vote not to rebuild any unit, that unit's entire common element interest, votes in the association, and common expense liability are automatically reallocated upon the vote as if the unit had been condemned under Section 1121.107, and the association promptly shall prepare, execute, and record an amendment to the declaration reflecting the reallocations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Subsection, Section 1122.120 governs the distribution of insurance proceeds if the condominium is terminated.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    <strong>\n     Count 3: Failure to Properly Spend Insurance Funds under the Louisiana Condominium Act\n    </strong>\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n    24.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n    Under La.

Travelers had issued to the Association a Community Association Management Liability Coverage Policy (the \"Management Policy\") that provided coverage for losses incurred due to directors and officers' alleged wrongful acts. The Association reported the Trust's claims to Travelers; Travelers denied coverage, including the duty to defend.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    In September 2017, the Association moved for a summary judgment against Travelers, requesting its third party demand be granted on the ground that there was coverage under the Management Policy. In October 2017, Travelers moved for a summary judgment seeking dismissal of the Association's third party demand arguing that coverage was excluded under the policy, and Travelers had no duty to defend the Association. A hearing on the motions was held on November 17, 2017. On December 7, 2017, the district court denied the Association's motion for summary judgment, and granted Travelers' motion for summary judgment, dismissing with prejudice all claims against Travelers. The Association, pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 966(C)(4), requested written reasons for judgment which were provided by the district court.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    In its written reasons, the district court found that coverage for the Trust's claims was excluded as \"[t]he policy\n    contains a clear and unambiguous exclusion precluding coverage 'for any claim based upon, arising out of, directly or indirectly resulting from, in consequence of, or in any way involving' property damage.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    From this judgment, the Association seeks review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    The Association asserts the district court erred by dismissing the third-party demand and granting Travelers' motion for summary judgment. In challenging the district court's judgment, the Association assigns two errors: (1) the district court erred in finding the Management Policy unambiguously excluded coverage for the Trust's claims; and (2) the district court erred in failing to find Travelers had the duty to defend the Association against the Trust's claims as required by the Management Policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    \"A motion for summary judgment is a procedural device used when there is no genuine issue of material fact for all or part of the relief prayed for by the litigant.\"\n    <em>\n     Tate v.

We find this interpretation of the exclusion is flawed. A plain reading of the property damage exclusion reveals \"construction defect\" is just one type of property damage barred by the exclusion; the exclusion includes \"\n    <em>\n     any damage to\n    </em>\n    , destruction or deterioration of, loss of, or loss of use of any\n    <em>\n     tangible property\n    </em>\n    , including any\n    <strong>\n     Construction Defect\n    </strong>\n    ....\" (emphasis added). This claim lacks merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Secondly, the Association asserts several arguments in support of its position that the district court erred in finding the Management Policy \"unambiguously excluded coverage\" of the Trust's claims. In brief, the Association contends that the property damage exclusion is ambiguous, and particularly, the \"arising out of\" language contained in the exclusion, should be \"interpreted narrowly against the insurer.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    The Association argues the claims asserted against them by the Trust involve omissions or breach of the Association's ministerial duties. The Association points out that the property damage to the unit occurred before any action or inaction by the Association.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Additionally, the Association urges that \"it does not dispute the Travelers' policy excludes damages\n    <em>\n     caused\n    </em>\n    by those [the Association's] ministerial acts\"; rather it argues that the Trust's claims-for alleged acts of omission and breach of duty-are clearly covered under the policy as \"Directors and Officers Wrongful Act\" under subpart F and N in the definition section of the policy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Travelers responds that the property damage exclusion encompassed the breach\n    of duties alleged by the Trust against the Association as the allegations \"are based upon, arise out of, result from, are in consequence of and involve property damage.\" Travelers contends that but for or without the damage caused by the fire the Trust would have no claims against the Association. Travelers urges that this Court, like other Louisiana courts, should broadly interpret the language \"arising out of\" contained in the property damage exclusion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The district court, in its written reasons, cited\n    <em>\n     Burmaster\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7029800\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/64/312/#p316\">\n     64 So.3d 312\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , to support its finding that the Trust's claims arose out of damage to the property and were excluded. The district court wrote in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    This policy exclusion is similar to the exclusion in\n    <em>\n     Burmaster\n    </em>\n    .

This Court believes that [the Trust's] claims against the Association \"arise out of\" the property damage to the Trust's unit due to the fire.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Burmaster\n    </em>\n    , the plaintiffs filed a class action against the Plaquemines Parish Government (\"PPG\") public officials and their public official liability insurer for property damages caused by the \"hurricane protection levees\" built by the PPG when the levees failed after Hurricane Katrina. The public official liability policy excluded coverage for property damage, including \"[p]hysical injury to ... tangible property, including all resulting loss of use, or resulting reduction in value of that property.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7029800\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/64/312/#p316\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , 10-1543 at p. 7,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7029800\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/64/312/#p316\">\n     64 So.3d at 319\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the insurer, and this Court affirmed the judgment.

While Mr. Laborde, his two sons, his brother-in-law and his son, were spending the night on \"The Amanda,\" the generator installed by Mr. Deblanc malfunctioned causing carbon monoxide fumes to leak out of the exhaust system resulting in the death of one of Mr. Laborde's sons and his brother-in-law's son, and injuries to Mr. Laborde and his other son. Mr. Laborde and others filed suit. Mr. Deblanc and State Farm, which insured the boat, were among those named as defendants. State Farm filed a third party demand against America First Insurance Company (\"American First\"), which insured Mr. Deblanc's home during the time of the incident. American First filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the third-party demand, and State Farm filed a motion for summary judgment, pertinently asserting that American First provided coverage for the loss, and the American First policy was primary. The district court denied American First's motion and granted State Farm's motion; and American First appealed. On Appeal, this Court reversed the district court's judgment. One of the arguments asserted by American First was that the homeowner's policy issued to the Deblanc's excluded coverage for any watercraft.

This claim lacks merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <em>\n     The Duty to Defend\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Association asserts the district court erred in failing to find Travelers had a duty to defend it against the Trust's claims.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    First, the Association contends the district court committed reversible error when it failed to decide whether Travelers had a duty to defend, as there is no reference to the duty to defend in the district court's written reasons. We disagree. In its written reasons, the district court specifically mentioned the duty to defend, quoting\n    <em>\n     Elliott v. Cont. Cas.

This claim lacks merit.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Secondly, the Association contends Travelers owes the Association a duty to defend it against the Trust's claims because the property damage exclusion does not unambiguously exclude coverage.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    \" 'Generally the insurer's obligation to defend suits against its insured is broader than its liability for damage claims.' \"\n    <em>\n     Plaia v.

As discussed\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , these claims arise out of and are derivative of the property damage caused by the fire to the unit, and the property damage exclusion of the Management Policy unambiguously excludes these claims.
