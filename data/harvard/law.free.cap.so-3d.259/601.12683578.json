For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's convictions and sentences, and we further grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as attorney of record for defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 1, 2016, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant with four counts of distribution of cocaine occurring on four\n   different dates in April of 2013, violations of La. R.S. 40:967(A). Defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 10, 2016, defendant withdrew his pleas of not guilty, and after being advised of his rights, pled guilty as charged. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment with the Department of Corrections\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on each count to run concurrently. The State then filed a bill of information, pursuant to the provisions of La. R.S. 15:529.1, seeking to have defendant adjudicated a second felony offender. After being advised of his rights, defendant stipulated to the allegations in the multiple bill. The trial court then vacated defendant's sentence on count one and resentenced defendant, in accordance with the plea agreement, to fifteen years imprisonment with the Department of Corrections without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 26, 2018, the trial court granted defendant an out-of-time appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      ANDERS\n     </em>\n     BRIEF\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Under the procedure adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v. Bradford\n   </em>\n   , 95-929 (La. App. 5 Cir. 6/25/96),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1110-11,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   appointed appellate counsel has filed a brief asserting that she has thoroughly reviewed the trial court record and cannot find any non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. Accordingly, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967) and\n   <em>\n    State v. Jyles\n   </em>\n   , 96-2669 (La. 12/12/97),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11870799\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/241/\">\n    704 So.2d 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    per curiam\n   </em>\n   ), appointed appellate counsel requests permission to withdraw as attorney of record for defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous. If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In this case, defendant's appellate counsel has complied with the procedures for filing an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief. She details the procedural history of the case as well as the circumstances surrounding defendant's guilty pleas and sentencing. She particularly notes that there were no pretrial rulings which could arguably support an appeal, and that defendant entered unqualified guilty pleas, thereby waiving any non-jurisdictional defects. Appellate counsel further sets forth that defendant's guilty pleas to the original and multiple offender bills of information were not constitutionally infirm because defendant was advised of and indicated that he understood the rights that would be waived by pleading guilty. Further, appellate counsel recognizes that defendant was not forced, coerced, or threatened to enter the guilty pleas, and that the sentences were imposed in conformity with the plea agreements. Defendant's appellate counsel concludes that after a conscientious and thorough review of the trial court record, she can find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal and no ruling of the trial\n   court that arguably supports an appeal. Therefore, she requests permission to withdraw as attorney of record for defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court has performed an independent, thorough review of the pleadings, minute entries, bills of information, and transcripts in the appellate record. Our independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We particularly note that the record reveals no constitutional infirmities or irregularities in defendant's guilty pleas to the four counts of distribution of cocaine that would render them invalid. The transcript of the guilty plea proceeding and the acknowledgment and waiver of rights form show that defendant was aware of the nature of the charges against him, that he was properly advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, including the right to a jury trial, the right to confrontation, and the privilege against self-incrimination, and that he understood he was waiving these rights by pleading guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In addition, the record reflects that defendant was informed by the trial court and in the waiver of rights form of the maximum sentences on all counts and of the actual sentences that would be imposed upon acceptance of his guilty pleas.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, during the guilty plea colloquy and in the waiver of rights form, defendant confirmed that he had not been forced, coerced, or intimidated into entering his guilty pleas. After his colloquy with defendant, the trial judge accepted defendant's guilty pleas as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With respect to the multiple offender proceeding, the record shows that defendant was likewise adequately advised of his rights. The waiver of rights form and the transcript indicate that defendant was advised of his right to a hearing at which the State would have to prove his multiple offender status and of his right to remain silent throughout the hearing. Defendant was also advised of the potential sentencing range as a second felony offender and the actual sentence he would receive. Defendant indicated that he had not been forced or coerced into stipulating to the multiple bill, that he understood his rights and the legal consequences of pleading guilty to the multiple offender bill of information, and that he wished to plead guilty. The trial judge thereafter accepted defendant's stipulation to the multiple bill as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Further, defendant's sentences were imposed in accordance with the plea agreements. La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2) precludes a defendant from seeking review of a sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement that was set forth in the record at the time of the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v. Washington\n   </em>\n   , 05-211 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/6/05),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9020490\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/916/1171/#p1173\">\n    916 So.2d 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173. Likewise,\n   this Court has consistently recognized that La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2) precludes a defendant from seeking review of an enhanced sentence to which the defendant agreed.\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   , 12-299 (La. App. 5 Cir. 12/11/12),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7017358\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/106/1068/#p1075\">\n    106 So.3d 1068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1075,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 13-109 (La. 6/21/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003408,7003321,7003386,7003349\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/118/406/\">\n    118 So.3d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In addition, defendant's sentences fall within the sentencing ranges set forth in the applicable statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 40:967(B)(4)(b) ; La. R.S. 15:529.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Based on the foregoing, we find that defendant's guilty pleas to the original and multiple offender bills of information and the sentences imposed pursuant to the plea agreements do not present any issues for appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lastly, we have reviewed the record for errors patent and have found none that require corrective action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. art. 920 ;\n   <em>\n    State v. Oliveaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9644569\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/312/337/\">\n    312 So.2d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (La. 1975) ; and\n   <em>\n    State v.
