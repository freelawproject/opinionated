Love, Judge Edwin A. Lombard, Judge Tiffany G. Chase )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Judge Terri F. Love\n   This appeal arises from a public records request. A proposed apartment development was denied by the historic landmarks commission. The developer then filed a public records request for the commission's documents regarding the development. The developer, after receiving an incomplete response to the request, filed for a writ of mandamus. The trial court initially denied the developer's writ of mandamus regarding the public records request. However, after the filing of a limited motion for new trial, the trial court found that a previously withheld exhibit was a public record. The trial court also found that the plaintiff was entitled to attorney's fees with an amount to be determined after submitting documentation for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection. Defendants appealed contending that the motion for new trial was untimely, that the trial court committed manifest error by granting the motion for new trial, and the trial court erred by awarding attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We find that the developer's motion for new trial was timely filed because the notice of signing of the judgment was not mailed until the day after it was signed. We find that the exhibit, an e-mail, was a public record. Also, we find that the developer was entitled to attorney's fees as a prevailing party. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mercato Elisio, L.L.C. (\"Mercato\") sought to develop an apartment complex named the Elisio Lofts in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans. However, the Historic District Landmarks Commission (\"HDLC\") did not approve the development. Subsequently, Mercato submitted a public records request to the HDLC regarding records relative to the Elisio Lofts development. The public records request stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   As such, we request copies of all public records, as defined in La. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 44:1 A(2)(a), dated between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012, in the possession of the HDLC and/or Commissioner John Deveney including, but not limited to, letters, e-mails, text messages, notes, documents, meeting minutes, calendar entries of meetings, reports and memoranda to and/or from any person or entity related to the Elisio Lofts-501 Elysian Fields Project, Mercato Elisio, LLC, Ekistics, LLC, and/or Sean Cummings. Please note such records include those that exist or were created using private accounts and/or devices utilized in conducting the business of the HDLC.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After receiving a response to the request, Mercato filed a Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Civil Penalties, pursuant to\n   La. R.S. 44:35, against the City of New Orleans, the HDLC, and John Deveney\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (a commissioner on the HDLC) (collectively \"Defendants\"). Mercato contended that Commissioner Deveney improperly sought to have the development denied and planned to prove same with the documents from the public records request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mercato alleged that the response to the request did not include documents from Commissioner Deveney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the deposition of Commissioner Deveney, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment contending that they fulfilled the public records request. The trial court denied the Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment. Mercato then took Mr. Costello's deposition regarding Commissioner Deveney's compliance with the public records request.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mercato filed a Supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Civil Penalties and Fees averring that Defendants only partially produced responses to the public records request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court denied Mercato's Petition for Writ of Mandamus, Civil Penalties, and Fees. The trial court based the denial on a finding that Exhibit G\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not a public record because \"[t]his is between two spouses so it's not a public record.\" Mercato filed a Limited Motion for New Trial asserting that the denial of attorney's fees was contrary to the law. Mercato also maintained that the trial court erroneously determined that Exhibit G was not a public record. The Defendants filed a Joint Motion to Strike or Dismiss Mercato's Motion for New Trial alleging that the motion was untimely. The trial court found that Mercato's Motion for New Trial was timely filed. The Defendants sought supervisory review with this Court on the timeliness of the Motion for New Trial. This Court denied writs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court granted Mercato's Limited Motion for New Trial. The trial court found that Exhibit G was a public record because there is no exception for communications between spouses. The trial court also found that Mercato was entitled to attorney's fees pursuant to La. R.S. 44:35(D). The trial court ordered Mercato to submit proposed attorney's fees and costs for an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection and a separate determination. Defendants' suspensive appeal from the judgment granting the Motion for New Trial followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The applicable standard of review in ruling on a motion for new trial is whether the trial court abused its discretion.\"\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    Mr. Deveney is represented by separate counsel in his official and individual capacities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Commissioner Deveney was not present and did not vote on the development, as he was out of town.

Further, the trial court determined that Exhibit G was \"an independent draft different in form and substance from the final draft and it is a public record within the meaning of the statute.\" We agree.

Exhibit G was not a word processing document that was written over while Commissioner Deveney was preparing his statement.

Therefore, we find a determination of Commissioner Deveney's status as a custodian is premature, as the matter is not before us on appeal. Based on the above, we find that the trial court did not commit manifest error by determining that Exhibit G was a public record.

In addition, if the court finds that the custodian unreasonably or arbitrarily failed to respond to the request as required by R.S. 44:32 it may award the requester civil penalties not to exceed one hundred dollars per day, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays for each such day of such failure to give notification.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    While Defendants contend that their state of mind voids the award for attorney's fees, this Court previously addressed the issue with an analysis of legislative intent.

App. 4 Cir. 1/20/99),\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11784590\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/726/1082/\">\n      726 So.2d 1082\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Also, the trial court relied upon\n     <em>\n      Times Picayune Pub. Corp. v. New Orleans Aviation Bd.\n     </em>\n     , 99-237 (La. App. 5 Cir. 8/31/99),\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11667843\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/742/979/\">\n      742 So.2d 979\n     </extracted-citation>\n     , which held that the amount of attorney's fees awarded was subject to an abuse of discretion review. While the full facts and circumstances present in\n     <em>\n      Dwyer\n     </em>\n     are unknown, the trial court focused on cases regarding partially prevailing parties and the amount of attorney's fees; neither of which is at issue in the present matter. Therefore, we find\n     <em>\n      Dwyer\n     </em>\n     is inapplicable and distinguishable. The case\n     <em>\n      sub judice\n     </em>\n     concerns a party who completely prevailed and was found to be entitled to attorney's fees with the amount to be determined later.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
