After a full trial on the merits, the trial court awarded Mr. LeBlanc the following: past medical expenses in the amount of $35,846.38; future medical expenses in the amount of $100,532.50; past lost earnings in the amount of $59,348.00; future loss of earning capacity in the amount of $524,595.00; and past and future general damages in the amount of $250,000.00 for a total award of $970,321.88. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 1, 2016, Riley LeBlanc was standing outside of his neighbor's home at 203 Gauraud Street in Abbeville, Louisiana, speaking to his neighbor, Reed Hebert. The two men were in front of Mr. Hebert's house, Mr. Hebert inside his fenced yard and Mr. LeBlanc on the outside. During their conversation, Mr. Hebert's daughter, who had been playing in the yard, fell into a rose bush and cried out for help. Both gentlemen immediately stepped toward the sound in an effort to\n   reach and assist the child. In his haste, Mr. LeBlanc stepped on a metal storm grate that was partially covered with grass. The grate sits above a catch basin. When Mr. LeBlanc stepped on the metal grate, it purportedly broke at two separate corners, causing Mr. LeBlanc's right leg to fall through the opening. This caused Mr. LeBlanc to suffer a severe laceration to his lower leg. Due to this injury, Mr. LeBlanc is unable to continue his work as a carpenter and purportedly has ongoing pain and issues with his lower extremity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 21, 2016, Mr. LeBlanc filed a Petition for Damages, naming the City as the defendant. Mr. LeBlanc stated that the metal storm grate involved is part of a sewage servitude maintained by the City in connection with its sewage, water, and wastewater systems and that the City is authorized and conducts routine maintenance and inspections on the sewage servitude and its related parts. He asserted the storm grate in question was severely deteriorated and riddled with rust. The City denied all of Mr. LeBlanc's claims and filed a motion for summary judgment, claiming that it owed no duty to the plaintiff as the storm grate was open and obvious and also that the grate was in good condition and not unreasonably dangerous. The City's motion was heard and denied on October 23, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A trial on the merits took place on November 20, 2017 to November 21, 2017, after which the trial court rendered judgment in favor of Mr. LeBlanc with written reasons signed on December 6, 2017. The trial court found the City liable for Mr. Leblanc's injury, citing the provisions of La.Civ.Code art. 2317 and La.R.S. 9:2800. It specifically found that the compromised condition of the storm grate was not \"obvious to all\" and as such the City did owe a duty and, further, that the City had constructive knowledge of the grate's defect. Finally, the trial court awarded Mr. LeBlanc both general and special damages, including past medical expenses, future medical expenses, past lost earnings, and future loss of earning capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The City timely appealed on January 3, 2018. On appeal, the City presents six issues for review.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1)Whether the trial court misapplied the law to the facts presented at trial on the issue of whether the storm grate was [an] open and obvious condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) Whether the trial court committed legal error in finding that the City of Abbeville owed a duty of care to plaintiff to protect him from an open and obvious condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (3) Whether the trial court committed legal error in finding that the City of Abbeville had notice of any alleged defect pursuant to La.R.S. 9:2800.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (4)Whether the trial court committed legal error in failing to find that the City was immune for its discretionary acts under La.R.S. 9:2798.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (5)Whether the trial court committed error in failing to assess plaintiff with any fault.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (6)Whether the damages awarded by the trial court are impermissibly excessive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City asserts that the trial court committed legal error in finding that it was liable for Mr. Leblanc's injury. The City stipulated that the storm grate involved in the incident was in its custody. However, the City argues the trial court erred in ruling that the storm grate in question was not an open and obvious condition for which the City owed no duty to\n   Mr. LeBlanc and also in ruling that the City had notice as to any alleged defect in said storm grate. Under La.Civ.Code art. 2317, \"[w]e are responsible, not only for the damage occasioned by our own act, but for that which is caused by the act of persons for whom we are answerable, or of the things which we have in our custody.\" Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:2800(C), which governs the analysis of a public entity's liability for a defective thing within its custody or care, further states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [N]o person shall have a cause of action based solely upon liability imposed under Civil Code Article 2317 against a public entity for damages caused by the condition of things within its care and custody unless the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the particular vice or defect which caused the damage prior to the occurrence, and the public entity has had a reasonable opportunity to remedy the defect and has failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   To establish a claim against a public entity for damages caused by the condition of things within its care or custody, a plaintiff must show that (1) the thing that caused the damage was in the care or custody of the public entity, (2) the thing was defective due to a condition that created an unreasonable risk of harm, (3) the public entity had actual or constructive notice of the condition yet failed to take corrective action within a reasonable period of time, and (4) the defect was a cause in fact of the plaintiff's harm.

Constructive notice means the existence of facts which imply actual knowledge. La.R.S. 9:2800(D).

As such, we will now address these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (1) Care or Custody of the Storm Grate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The City's custody of the storm grate involved in the incident is undisputed. Clay Menard, the City's Public Works Director, and Richard Sysak, the foreman for the City's Streets Department, both testified at trial. Mr. Menard acknowledged that the storm grate was in the custody of the City and that the City is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and cleaning of storm and drainage grates that are in its rights-of-way. Mr. Sysak testified that the storm grates around the City are part of the City's infrastructure and they are responsible for maintaining them. The City replaced the subject storm grate after the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (2) Unreasonable Risk of Harm\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   To determine whether a defect presents an unreasonable risk of harm, the supreme court has adopted a risk-utility balancing test, synthesized to a consideration of four pertinent factors: \"(1) the utility of the complained-of condition; (2) the likelihood and magnitude of harm, including the obviousness and apparentness of the condition; (3) the cost of preventing the harm; and (4) the nature of the plaintiff's activities in terms of its social utility or whether it is dangerous by nature.\"\n   <em>\n    Broussard v.

The storm drainage system employed by the City is designed to remove water from the roadways and provide proper drainage for neighborhoods. However, this is only the first prong in our inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Likelihood and Magnitude of Harm: Obvious and Apparent\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   It is while studying the likelihood and magnitude of the harm that the obviousness and apparentness of the complained of condition should be considered. Mr. Menard and Mr. Sysak both testified for the City that storm grates located within the City's rights-of-way, such as the one at issue here, are expected to be able to fully support the weight of a vehicle. While instances of injuries involving storm grates are rare, the involved storm grate's structural integrity was weakened to such an extent that the portion of the grate that Mr. LeBlanc stepped on broke and fell into the catch basin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The City asserts that the trial court did not properly apply the law to the facts and evidence adduced at trial. The City suggests that the accident occurred, not because the storm grate was rusted, but because it was not seated properly over the catch basin. According to the City's version of events, the improperly seated storm grate flipped up when stepped on by Mr. LeBlanc, allowing Mr. LeBlanc's leg to fall between the grate and the wall of the catch basin. This is in direct contradiction to the testimony of Mr. LeBlanc and his neighbor, Mr. Hebert, who witnessed the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Both Mr. LeBlanc and Mr. Hebert testified that the storm grate broke when Mr. LeBlanc stepped on it. Photographs taken after the event by Mr. LeBlanc's father and by Mr. Menard corroborate this version of events and show the storm grate with broken pieces and jagged\n   edges. The trial court specifically found that Mr. Menard's testimony was not credible and, further, that his assertion that the storm grate was not bent or broken was contradicted by other evidence. \"[W]here there is conflict in the testimony, reasonable evaluations of credibility and reasonable inferences of fact should not be disturbed upon review[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Rosell v. ESCO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548305\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/549/840/#p844\">\n    549 So.2d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 844 (La.1989).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   When findings are based on determinations regarding the credibility of witnesses, the manifest error-clearly wrong standard demands great deference to the trier of fact's findings; for only the factfinder can be aware of the variations in demeanor and tone of voice that bear so heavily on the listener's understanding and belief in what is said.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548305\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/549/840/#p844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548305\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/549/840/#p844\">\n    at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As there is ample evidence in the record to support the trial court's findings, we will not disturb them here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The City also asserts the trial court erred in regard to its finding that the corroded storm grate was not an open and obvious condition such that it owed a duty to Mr. LeBlanc. Whether a dangerous or defective condition is obvious and apparent is covered under the second prong of the risk-utility balancing test utilized by the supreme court in determining if a condition presents an unreasonable risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000011\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/175/#p184\">\n    113 So.3d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The City argues that because Mr. LeBlanc knew of the location of the storm grate, he was in a better position than the City to view any defect in said grate. It urges that Mr. LeBlanc has lived across the street from the storm grate for many years and points to Mr. Leblanc's testimony stating that the weather on the day of the accident was sunny and clear and that Mr. Leblanc saw the storm grate before he stepped on it. The City asserts that based upon these facts, it owed no duty of care whatsoever to Mr. Leblanc. However, as the supreme court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [T]he key to a finding of no liability in such cases is not the plaintiff's subjective awareness of the risk, but the determination that the defendant did not act unreasonably vis-a-vis the plaintiff, or injure the plaintiff through the instrumentality of an unreasonably dangerous thing in his custody.

This storm grate, as testified to by the City's own employees, was expected to be able to support the full weight of a vehicle. However, as the trial court's extensive written reasons for judgment note, \"this particular storm grate was so compromised by pitting rust that it was incapable of supporting the weight of an adult male.\" This, coupled with the fact that the grass was allowed to grow around and into the grate masking its deteriorated condition, clearly show that the likelihood of the storm grate causing harm was high.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Cost of Preventing the Harm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The third prong in the risk-utility balancing test requires us to balance the risk of harm presented against the cost and feasibility of repair.\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000011\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/175/#p184\">\n    113 So.3d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Evidence at trial shows that the cost of replacing the storm grate in question would cost the City approximately $100.00. This is clearly not an unreasonable amount, especially given the injury sustained. The City argues that since it has thousands of storm grates in place as part of its drainage system, the cost to replace each one at any showing of rust would be cost prohibitive. It claims it does not have the manpower nor the financial resources to replace its storm grates at such a rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   However, as the trial court noted, it is not necessary for all of the storm grates to be replaced as soon as they begin to exhibit signs of rust. Rather, the City had a duty to replace this particular storm grate when it became, or should have become in the exercise of reasonable care, obvious that it needed to be replaced. Mr. Sysak, who inspected the grate six months before the incident, acknowledged that this particular grate had not been replaced during the thirty-three years he had been employed by the City and, further, that the City had never utilized the type of material used in this particular storm grate at any point during his tenure. It is clear from the evidence introduced at trial that the storm grate in question was severely compromised and that the cost of replacing it is between $100.00-$200.00. Thus, it appears the City failed to take the relatively inexpensive precaution of replacing its outdated grate. As such, we find the trial court did not err in holding that the cost of preventing the harm was not as great as the City's arguments would suggest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Nature of Plaintiff's Activities\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, we must examine the nature of Mr. LeBlanc's activity, particularly in terms of its social utility and whether it was dangerous by nature.\n   <em>\n    Broussard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7000011\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/113/175/#p184\">\n    113 So.3d 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Both Mr. LeBlanc and Mr. Hebert testified that Mr. LeBlanc moved in response to Mr. Hebert's young daughter crying out in pain. As the trial court noted, Mr. LeBlanc's action of stepping on the grate was taken in a laudable attempt to aid a child in distress. The instinct and determination to aid those in peril is highly useful to society.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The City's position is that Mr. LeBlanc's activity of stepping on the storm grate was unreasonable, stating that he was in a position to avoid his injury by merely walking around the storm grate. However, we do not find stepping on a storm grate in one of the City's rights-of-ways to be an inherently dangerous activity. Both Mr. Menard and Mr. Sysak testified that such storm grates are expected to hold the weight of a vehicle. Therefore, it follows that it should be more than capable of supporting the weight of an adult male. Is stepping on a manhole cover considered an inherently dangerous activity? Manhole covers are numerous, have great utility, are easily visible to those who encounter them, and could cause great injury if an unsuspecting person fell into one. However, people routinely step on manhole covers while walking along streets every day. Are we to presume all of these people are acting unreasonably or engaging in inherently dangerous activities?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Further, given Mr. Sysak's claim that he thrice jumped up and down with his full weight to test the strength of the grate in question, it is not unreasonable for Mr. LeBlanc to have assumed the storm grate was capable of holding his weight as he rushed to assist Mr. Hebert's daughter. We find the City's argument that a reasonable person would have walked around the grate in Mr. LeBlanc's situation to be unpersuasive. The trial court found Mr. LeBlanc's actions to have high social utility, and that it was the condition of the storm grate, rather than the actions of Mr. LeBlanc that was unreasonably dangerous. The manifest error-clearly wrong standard demands great deference to the trier of facts findings.\n   <em>\n    Rosell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548305\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/549/840/#p844\">\n    549 So.2d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in balancing the gravity and risk of harm created by the corroded storm grate offset against Mr. LeBlanc's actions and their social utility along with the cost and feasibility of repair.

The City claims that because no complaints or other reports of a problem were made concerning the specific storm grate, it can not be found to have had notice. We again find the City's argument unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Evidence introduced at trial clearly shows the City conducted maintenance on the catch basin beneath the subject storm grate on October 9, 2015. Mr. LeBlanc's accident occurred on April 1, 2016, a mere six months later. Mr. Menard, Director of Public Works for the City, testified that the City is responsible for the maintenance, repair, and cleaning of the storm and drainage grates in its rights-of-way. Furthermore, it was City policy that workers performing maintenance on infrastructure were required to inspect the part on which they were working for potentially hazardous conditions. Mr. Sysak, therefore, would have inspected the subject storm grate while working on the catch basin beneath in October 2015, as he would have had to remove the storm grate and reinstall it after the catch basin repairs were made. Mr. Sysak claimed that he did perform a strength test on the subject storm grate and that he \"found it was sound.\" However, he then stated that the test he performed was merely himself jumping up and down on the grate a few times. He admits he in no way tested whether the grate was capable of holding the weight of a vehicle, as the City's policy dictates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Both Mr. Menard and Mr. Sysak acknowledged that the storm grate in question was not constructed of the same steel grating material utilized by the City as a cover during their ten and thirty-three year respective tenures. Further, it was not galvanized and was subject to rusting, unlike the cast-iron/rebar-type material utilized by the City as a cover because such material is less resistant to corrosion. The pictures admitted into evidence clearly show a storm grate with heavily corroded corners and a broken row. The evidence in the record clearly establishes that the subject storm grate has been in use for many years, as no storm grates made of the same material as the one at issue were installed in either Mr. Sysak's or Mr. Menard's time with the City per their own admissions. Though no evidence was introduced regarding the precise rate at which the storm grate corroded, there was also no evidence admitted suggesting or explaining an accelerated rate of deterioration in the storm grate. Even Mr. Sysak admitted in his deposition testimony that there was no material difference in the storm grate between when the work was performed in October 2015 and Mr. LeBlanc's accident in April 2016 and acknowledged that failing to replace the grate in 2015 may have been an error. Specifically, Mr. Sysak's deposition testimony stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Q With respect to your previous testimony, Mr. Sysak, regarding jumping up and down on this particular grating - and I think you said in October of 2015 when the project took place for the work under it - yeah - how many times did you jump up and down on it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   A Two or three times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   Q Okay.

Mr. Sysak is the foreman for the City's Streets Department. He and Mr. Menard testified that part of their duties included the maintenance of the City's drainage system, which includes storm grates. Though Mr. Sysak was more reticent at trial, it is clear he was aware of the rusted condition of the storm grate. He stated that even freshly built grates have rust, meaning the rust on the subject storm grate would have begun to form early and presumably become progressively worse over its more than thirty-three years in use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The trial court inferred from the aforementioned facts that \"significant deterioration must have been evident when the grate was removed and reinstalled six months prior to the accident.\" There was no evidence suggesting an accelerated rate of deterioration. Though the City claims the trial court ignored Mr. Sysak's claim that the grate's condition was substantially worse than when he first saw it post-accident compared to its condition when plaintiff's counsel requested to photograph it, we note Mr. Sysak's own deposition testimony. Where there is conflict in testimony, a reviewing court should not disturb reasonable evaluations of credibility and reasonable inferences of fact.\n   <em>\n    Rosell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7548305\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/549/840/#p844\">\n    549 So.2d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, we find the trial court did not err in finding the City had\n   notice of the defective condition of the storm grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (4) Causation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The trial court found that the accident occurred in the manner described by Mr. LeBlanc and Mr. Hebert, namely that part of the storm grate broke when Mr. LeBlanc stepped on it causing his leg to fall through. Mr. Hebert also testified that he noticed blood and flesh on a broken edge of the grate; a statement corroborated by photographic evidence. While Mr. LeBlanc acknowledges that the farthest side of the storm grate flipped up and his leg scraped against the concrete wall of the catch basin, the trial court found that this alone would not account for the severe laceration suffered by Mr. LeBlanc as the City's theory suggests. As the trial court stated in its extensive written reasons for judgment, \"It cannot be reasonably inferred that such a severe, penetrating injury occurred by simply scraping against the side of an intact storm grate ... [t]he most likely cause was contact between [Mr. LeBlanc's] leg and the broken edge of the storm grate identified by Mr. Hebert.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As we find that the record contains ample evidence for the trial court's holding that the storm grate was an unreasonably dangerous condition, we further find the trial court did not err in finding said dangerous condition to be the cause of Mr. LeBlanc's injury. Mr. LeBlanc, therefore, is entitled to recover from the City for his injury per the provisions of La.R.S. 9:2800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    Other Arguments Advanced by Appellant\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Discretionary Immunity per La.R.S. 9:2798.1\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Alternatively, the City argues the trial court erred in failing to find that it was immune from liability as a public entity under La.R.S. 9:2798.1. Louisiana Revised Statutes 9:2798.1 states, in pertinent part, \"B. Liability shall not be imposed on public entities or their officers or employees based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform their policymaking or discretionary acts when such acts are within the course and scope of their lawful powers and duties.\" The City asserts that Mr. Sysak performed an inspection in October of 2015 and did not find the grate to be broken, bent, or corroded. He then made the decision not to replace the storm grate\n   <em>\n    in his discretion\n   </em>\n   , and as such, the City is immune from liability under La.R.S. 9:2798.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   However, the immunity offered to public entities under La.R.S. 9:2798.1 applies only to policy decisions, which are those based on social, economic, or political concerns.\n   <em>\n    Saine v.

However, it is unlikely Mr. LeBlanc stepping on the storm grate \"involved an awareness of the danger,\" as stepping on a storm grate should not be an inherently dangerous activity as discussed above.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8374671\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/968/863/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, an adult male stepping on a grate purportedly capable of supporting the weight of a vehicle is not a high-risk activity. The City further argues that Mr. LeBlanc was in a superior position to note the defective condition of the storm grate, given his personal knowledge of the area. However, as noted by Mr. LeBlanc, if the condition of the storm grate was not obvious to Mr. Sysak, a professional tasked with the maintenance and specific inspection of such storm grates, then it is equally unlikely to be obvious to Mr. LeBlanc, particularly given the overgrown grass surrounding the grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As to the significance of what was sought by the conduct, Mr. LeBlanc was attempting to assist a young child in distress. This is also pertinent to the fifth consideration regarding extenuating circumstances that might cause Mr. LeBlanc to act in haste. The City asserts that because the child was ultimately fine, that there was no need for Mr. LeBlanc to have jumped to action.

The wound developed a deep infection that required surgery and the removal of tissue. Though the wound was sutured after, Mr. LeBlanc was left with significant scarring. He then was forced to undergo a second surgery in October 2016 due to the lasting pain caused by his injury and its failure to heal fully. After the surgery, Mr. LeBlanc's mobility was severely restricted, and his leg immobilized in a splint and later in an orthopedic device. His physicians have stated future surgery will also be necessary, again resulting in restricted mobility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Mr. LeBlanc continues to experience pain, balance problems, and swelling of his leg, foot, and ankle. He asserts he has lost the ability to engage in recreational activities he enjoyed before the accident. As noted by the trial court, \"[a]t best, his activities will be significantly limited by the pain and swelling in his legs.\" His experts testified that he will be unable to resume employment in his chosen field of carpentry. Experts for both sides agree he has some level of permanent disability, though they disagree about the extent of that rating.

He developed a deep infection causing the wound to break open, so Dr. Weston Miller performed a debridement and secondary closure of the wound. Before he could do so, Dr. Miller had to remove gangrenous tissue, leaving a large scar. Mr. LeBlanc was referred to Dr. Darrell Henderson, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, on July 6, 2016 because he was still having pain in his unhealed wound and because Dr. Miller felt he was developing a condition known as stenosynovitis, meaning the tendons in Mr. LeBlanc's leg were stuck together, resulting in an inflammatory response and scar tissue formation causing clicking, popping, and crunching sounds known as crepitus. Dr. Henderson agreed and referred Mr. LeBlanc to a neurologist, Dr. James Domingue. Dr. Domingue found Mr. LeBlanc had tears in the nerve and an enlargement of the nerve known as a neuroma just below the inner ankle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   On October 4, 2016, Dr. Henderson performed a neurolysis, consisting of removing scar tissue from the nerves. He also prescribed physical therapy to try to increase the motion and strength of Mr. LeBlanc's leg and allow him to walk freely without the use of an orthopedic boot device. The trial court found Mr. LeBlanc had incurred medical expenses totaling $35,846.38 at the time of trial and that those expenses were reasonably incurred and necessary for the treatment of his injury. The City does not argue against the\n   amount of past medical expenses awarded to Mr. LeBlanc.

He feels that it is more likely than not that Mr. LeBlanc will require surgery to have the neuroma removed, consisting of excising the neuroma and inserting the end of the nerve into a bone in his lower leg. Dr. Henderson stated that he believes the neuroma is going to gradually worsen over time. Dr. Henderson notes that even with the surgery the neuroma would inevitably reform, but in its new location in the bone marrow canal, it could not be pressed or hit, causing more pain or inflammation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The City's expert, Dr. Kenneth Odinet, stated he did not believe additional surgery\n   would be medically necessary. He admitted that Dr. Henderson's recommendation would be an option but suggested a nerve graft as an alternative. Dr. Henderson acknowledges that the surgery he recommends would result in an additional loss of sensation. The City argues that this would leave Mr. LeBlanc in a worse position than he currently is, but, as Dr. Henderson notes, causing the foot to be more numb is a reasonable payoff for decreasing chronic pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Dr. Henderson also stated that Mr. LeBlanc will need to wear compression stockings on his injured leg for the remainder of his life. The stockings presumably last about two months, and the court found each pair lasts Mr. LeBlanc twice as long as he only wears one stocking at a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Dr. Henderson further recommended semi-annual doctor visits and periodic EMG studies for the rest of Mr. LeBlanc's life. Dr. Odinet testified that he did not believe semi-annual visits would be necessary while simultaneously acknowledging that future doctor visits might be. He offered no insight into how often those doctor visits might be required if or when Mr. LeBlanc experienced problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Finally, Dr. Henderson testified that Mr. LeBlanc would need a membership to a gym that has a pool, as it would take the weight off of his leg and be the best way to perform most of his exercises. Though Mr. LeBlanc testified that prior to his injury he had a membership at a different gym, the trial court found that he also engaged in many other physical activities. The trial court's written reasons for judgment specifically state, \"Inasmuch as he can no longer engage in these other activities, and he is forced to get his exercise under the low impact conditions afforded by a gym with a pool, the Court finds that an award of the future costs of a gym membership is appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The trial court found that as Dr. Henderson was Mr. LeBlanc's treating physician, his opinion was entitled to greater weight. It found that the need for future surgery had been established with sufficient certainty, as well as the other future medical expenses listed above.

Mr. LeBlanc testified that when he began carpentry in 2008, he was earning $10.00 per hour. He worked other jobs but returned to full time carpentry in 2014 on jobs secured by his father and grandfather. He stated that his initial billing fee was $18.00 per hour but that it had been increased to $20.00 per hour as his skills and experience increased. Mr. LeBlanc introduced a pay stub that showed that at the time of his injury, he was earning $20.00 per hour on a job for the Vermilion Corporation, which is in line with his testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Dr. Rice, the economist retained by the plaintiff, calculated Mr. LeBlanc's lost earnings at the time of trial to be $68,343.00. This number was based off of a forty-hour work week, fifty-two weeks a year, at the rate of $20.00 per hour. However, as the trial court noted, Mr. LeBlanc admitted that while he worked forty to forty-five hours per week, he typically only worked forty-two to forty-three weeks per year. Pursuant to this testimony, the trial court appropriately lowered Mr. LeBlanc's award for past lost wages from $68,343.00, based on annual earnings of $41,600.00, to $59,348.00, based on annual earnings of $36,125.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The City argues that Mr. LeBlanc failed to show any proof at trial that he earned his $20.00 per hour wage for forty-two weeks out of the year, while acknowledging that he was earning that wage on the job he was working at the time of his injury. Mr. LeBlanc's father, with whom he works, specifically testified that carpentry work was in high demand in late 2016 due to the excessive flooding in the area. Further, Mr. LeBlanc's Vocational Rehabilitation Expert, Mr. Sy Arceneaux, testified that the annual earnings amount calculated by Dr. Rice corresponded with what the statistics reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Lafayette, Louisiana metropolitan area show a carpenter of Mr. LeBlanc's age and experience would be expected to earn in the area.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   This court set forth the standard in determining past lost wages and stated that: \"Lost wages 'need not be precisely proven, they must be shown with reasonable certainty.' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The City argues strenuously that Mr. LeBlanc's tax returns for the years immediately preceding the accident do not support the trial court's award for past lost wages. On the other hand, Mr. LeBlanc's testimony concerning his earned wages was not only uncontradicted but was specifically corroborated with pay stub evidence.

As such, we find the trial court clearly had a reasonable basis for the award of past lost wages to Mr. LeBlanc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Finally, the trial court awarded Mr. LeBlanc $524,595.00 for future loss of earning capacity.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   To recover an award for future loss of earnings, the plaintiff must present medical evidence that indicates with reasonable certainty that a residual disability causally related to the accident in question exists, which results in the plaintiff's inability to earn wages to the same extent he could have earned had he not been injured.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Fontenot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11102573\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/787/588/\">\n    787 So.2d at 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Mr. LeBlanc testified that while he is not totally disabled, standing or walking for more than a couple hours and anything involving high impact increases his symptoms. Further, his ankle swells if forced to make even a two hour drive to New Orleans. He also stated he has experienced balance problems, which have slowly improved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The City argues that their expert, Dr. Odinet, would not place any work restrictions on Mr. LeBlanc other than a general one against climbing. However, Dr. Odinet acknowledged that Mr. LeBlanc will always have swelling in his leg that limits how much he can and cannot walk based upon the build up of fluid in his ankle. Dr. Odinet further testified that he did not test for balance problems that may have been caused by Mr. LeBlanc's injury, which may further limit certain jobs Mr. LeBlanc will be able to perform. Dr. Odinet specifically found Mr. LeBlanc had suffered a permanent partial disability of his lower right extremity; though he felt Mr. LeBlanc's impairment was only five to ten percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Alternatively, Dr. Henderson testified that in his opinion, Mr. LeBlanc would only be able to perform fully sedentary work with opportunities to rest and elevate his leg and that activities that caused more swelling and pain were too much and\n   should be restricted. He stated that it would be best if Mr. LeBlanc doesn't have a job where he has to stand on his feet and testified that Mr. LeBlanc will have to choose the type of work he will perform very carefully. He unequivocally stated that Mr. LeBlanc cannot go back to carpentry. Dr. Henderson found that the permanent partial disability of Mr. LeBlanc's right lower extremity was thirty percent, to which Dr. Miller, another one of Mr. LeBlanc's treating physicians, agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The trial court accepted the testimony of Dr. Henderson regarding Mr. LeBlanc's abilities when re-entering the labor force. The trial court specifically stated in its written reasons for judgment that it \"accords greater weight to the opinions of the treating physicians.\" When opinions of expert witnesses differ, it is for the trier of fact to determine the most credible evidence and these determinations will not be overturned unless it is proven that the expert's stated reasons are patently unsound.\n   <em>\n    Fontenot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11102573\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/787/588/\">\n    787 So.2d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Next both the City and Mr. LeBlanc had vocational consultants testify regarding the types of sedentary jobs available to Mr. LeBlanc given his training and background. Mr. Arceneaux, Mr. LeBlanc's vocational consultant who tested and evaluated him, testified that earnings of $20.00 per hour or $41,600.00 per year is consistent for a carpenter based upon data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the Lafayette area. Given Dr. Henderson's recommended restrictions on Mr. LeBlanc's future employment, Mr. Arceneaux concluded that Mr. LeBlanc is unable to perform eighty-seven percent of all available jobs in the current labor market, including all of his prior work experience. He found that based upon Mr. LeBlanc's experience, skills, and restrictions, he would be able to find entry-level, sedentary positions that would pay between $18,400.00 and $23,020.00 annually. Tiffany Harrington, the vocational consultant employed by the City, found available positions for Mr. LeBlanc with annual earnings between $18,800.00 and $20,880.00 were he to work full time, year-round.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Though the record contains testimony relating to the benefits of a functional capacity evaluation in determining Mr. LeBlanc's physical restrictions and future work ability, no such evaluation was ordered or provided. Further, though the City elicited testimony that retraining might improve Mr. LeBlanc's future prospects, there was no testimony regarding Mr. LeBlanc's potential to be retrained, the time and cost said training would involve, or to what extent retraining might improve his future earning capacity. Therefore, the trial court found based upon the evidence before it that Mr. LeBlanc's future earning capacity was most appropriately set at the median figure of $20,740.00, as was utilized by Dr. Rice in calculating Mr. LeBlanc's loss of future earning capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The City again argues that Mr. LeBlanc failed to show that he was consistently earning $20.00 per hour. It argues that even though Mr. Arceneaux's research clearly shows the average annual earnings of carpenters with Mr. LeBlanc's experience and skill level, it is inequitable to attribute those earnings to Mr. LeBlanc based upon his past tax returns and his own testimony that he only worked forty-two to forty-three weeks a year.
