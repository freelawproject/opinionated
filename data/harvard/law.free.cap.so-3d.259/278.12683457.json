We directed each party to file a response to the other party's motion, and each provided a thoughtful and helpful memorandum. Upon consideration of the motions and responses, we withdraw our opinion of September 20, 2018, grant both parties' separate motions for clarification, deny the State's alternative motion for rehearing, and issue this opinion in the place and stead of the prior opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Simon Silva appeals his convictions for the second-degree murder of Samuel Forman and the attempted first-degree murder of Deborah Daoud. Silva argues that the trial court committed fundamental error by using a jury instruction that shifted the burden to Silva to prove Forman's alleged aggression beyond a reasonable doubt in order to establish the defense of self-defense. We reverse Silva's conviction\n   as to the second-degree murder count, but affirm Silva's conviction and sentence on the count for the attempted first-degree murder of Daoud. Silva's counsel did not request a self-defense jury instruction regarding the attempted first-degree murder count, thus waiving any claim of error for failure to give such an instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Silva was charged with the first-degree murder of his employer and landlord, Forman; and the attempted first-degree murder of a neighbor, Daoud. The charges arose from the shooting of both Forman and Daoud following a confrontation between Silva and Forman. The parties' account of the confrontation differed: Silva claimed he reacted in self-defense, based on a prior threat by Forman and Forman's reach for a dark object in his pocket; while the State claimed Silva was the initial and primary aggressor. The undisputed evidence, however, demonstrated that Silva shot both Forman and Daoud, with Forman succumbing to his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Silva claimed the shootings were in response to the aggressive demeanor and actions of Forman and Daoud. Silva resided in a trailer on, and worked at, Forman's junkyard. Silva claimed that Forman started a verbal altercation when Forman observed Silva's unauthorized use of electricity to power his trailer. The parties' confrontation escalated quickly. After a brief exchange of words, Forman allegedly stated \"I'm going to shoot you\" and reached into his front pocket. Silva testified that he observed Forman pull out a black object, which Silva believed to be a pistol. Silva claimed that this belief, and the accompanying fear, led to the shooting and killing of Forman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the initial shooting, Silva testified that Daoud grew visibly upset and threatened him. Silva claimed Daoud attempted to lunge and throw a microwave at him. Silva reacted to these actions by shooting Daoud, who survived the injuries and fled the scene. Following these events, Silva awaited the arrival of the police. Silva's explanation of the events was emphasized by defense counsel at the beginning of closing arguments, \"This is a case of self-defense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To discredit the self-defense claim, the State presented a differing account of the events. The State portrayed Silva as the initial aggressor and a disgruntled former employee and tenant. For example, the State presented Daoud, who testified that Silva was \"aggressive\" and \"pulled the gun out of nowhere ... [and] just shot [Forman] once.\" Thereafter, Daoud explained, \"[Forman] was kneeling ... with his hands up\" and \"[Silva] shot [Forman] again.\" The State claimed the evidence-including, for example, the testimony of Daoud-demonstrated that Silva shot two unarmed individuals who did not act in a manner to justify Silva's claim of self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After each side presented its case, the trial court engaged in a standard colloquy with Silva and his counsel regarding the jury instructions. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: All right. So do we need to go over them again, just put it on the record in the presence of the defendant? Defense, had you made any objections to any of the substance of matters contained in the jury instructions?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [Silva's Counsel]: No, I have not, [y]our Honor, and I'm in agreement with them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   And I've informed my client that I'm in agreement with them.... I believe he's in agreement with the -- with the instructions the way they're written right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   THE COURT: All right. Mr. Silva, are you satisfied then with what your attorney is saying about him going over the jury instructions and finding them to be not objectionable, and you're in agreement with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   DEFENDANT SILVA: Yes, [y]our Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following this exchange, the trial court instructed the jury on self-defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   THE COURT: An issue in this case is whether the defendant acted in self-defense. It is a defense to the offense which Simon Silva is charged if the death of Samuel Forman resulted from the justifiable use of deadly force.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Deadly force means force likely to cause death or great bodily harm. The use of deadly force is justifiable only if the defendant reasonably believes that the force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself while resisting another's attempt to murder him or an attempt to commit an attempted first-degree premeditated murder upon him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   To find the defendant was justified in his use of deadly force to resist an attempted first-degree premeditated murder, you must find the following three elements\n   <em>\n    beyond a reasonable doubt\n   </em>\n   . Samuel Forman did some act intended to cause the death of Simon Silva that went -- went beyond just thinking or talking about it. Samuel Forman acted with a premeditated design to kill Simon Silva, the act would have resulted in the death of Simon Silva except that someone prevented Samuel Forman from killing Simon Silva or he failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   A person is justified in using deadly force if he reasonably believes that such force is necessary to prevent imminent death or great bodily harm to himself or another or the imminent commission of an attempted first-degree premeditated murder against himself or another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (Emphasis added). The written jury instructions included the same language:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   To find [SILVA] was justified in his use of deadly force to resist an Attempted First-Degree Premeditated Murder, you must find the following three elements beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. SAMUEL [FORMAN]\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   did some act intended to cause the death of SIMON SILVA that went beyond just thinking or talking about it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. SAMUEL [FORMAN] acted with a premeditated design to kill SIMON SILVA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   3. The act would have resulted in the death of SIMON SILVA except that someone prevented SAMUEL [FORMAN] from killing SIMON SILVA or he failed to do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   These instructions were repeated a total of three times. Silva's counsel did not object to the trial court's instructions; Silva concedes this point on appeal. No separate instruction on use of force and self-defense was requested or given among the instructions relating to the count for the first-degree attempted murder of Daoud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Following the jury instructions, the case was submitted to the jury. The jury found Silva guilty of second-degree murder of Forman and attempted first-degree murder\n   of Daoud. Silva was sentenced to life in prison. Silva's appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Second-Degree Murder Conviction and Sentence (Forman)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The jury instruction regarding self-defense as to the second-degree murder of Forman was not the then-current standard instruction, and it was error to issue it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The error was not preserved and is reviewed for fundamental error.\n   <em>\n    Wyche v.

While counsel may assemble and submit proposed instructions, the court may not delegate to counsel the court's non-delegable duty to assure that the jury is instructed on the correct law to be applied to the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.985 provides that the trial court should generally give the standard jury instructions (found on the Florida Supreme Court's website). If the trial court deviates from, or modifies, the standard jury instruction, it is required to state on the record or in a separate order the reasons for doing so. Thus, while the standard jury instructions may be presumed to be correct, final responsibility for correctly instructing the jury remains with the trial court.\n   <em>\n    State v.

We hold that, under these circumstances, this burden-shifting instruction rose to the level of fundamental error, depriving Silva of a fair trial on the charge for which he relied upon his claim of self-defense.\n   <em>\n    Alexander v.

Consistent with that paucity of evidence, the erroneous jury instruction approved and read to the jury on the second-degree murder count was not included with the instructions pertaining to the attempted first-degree murder count. The self-defense instructions read to the jury mentioned only Forman's name and did not refer to Daoud. Three separate times the instruction stated that self-defense required a demonstration that \"Samuel Forman acted with a premeditated design to kill Simon Silva.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   It is undisputed that Silva used deadly force in his initial interaction with Forman, his landlord, before Silva turned his attention to Daoud. Silva testified that Forman's employees had told him that Forman carried a gun; that Forman pulled a black object from his right pocket; and that Forman said \"I'm going to shoot you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to Daoud, however, there was no such testimony or evidence. Silva himself said that Daoud's approach was after Silva had shot Forman. His testimony that he feared Daoud was going to \"throw the microwave at [him],\" was undercut by crime scene photographs showing the microwave, and by Silva's own testimony that he placed his firearm on the microwave as he called 911 to report the shootings. In Silva's initial statement regarding the shootings, Silva did not think that he had shot anyone other than Forman. He told police in that initial interview that he had reported to 911 that \"he had shot his boss,\" which could only be a reference to Forman (Daoud was only a neighbor, not Silva's employer or landlord).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Regarding Silva's prior interactions with Forman, Silva testified that Forman had previously threatened to shoot him. Silva said that he had not reported the prior threat to the police, because Forman was a lawyer and a millionaire, and \"All the police around there, they know him.\" Silva never mentioned any such threat, concern, or interaction regarding Daoud. So the defense's failure to request or include a separate instruction relating to a claim of justifiable use of force against Daoud may have been intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Silva's argument that the erroneous instruction regarding the second-degree murder count may have infected the jury's consideration of the attempted first-degree murder count involving Daoud is unavailing. The complete omission of Daoud's name from the self-defense instruction given as to the second-degree murder charge and Forman distinguishes the present case from the fundamental errors involved in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Alexander\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Montijo\n   </em>\n   , cited above and by Silva.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nor is Silva's back-up argument, a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel \"apparent on the face of the record,\" citing\n   <em>\n    McMullen v.
