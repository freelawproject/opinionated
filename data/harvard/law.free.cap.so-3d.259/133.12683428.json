The petitioner argues the circuit court erred in two respects: (1) by denying his facially sufficient petition without setting forth a factual basis for what appears, from the face of the order, to have been the circuit court's conclusion that he sought the name change for an ulterior or illegal purpose; and (2) by denying his request to have a court reporter record the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   We agree with both arguments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zimmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12200673,12200639\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/207/1006/\">\n    207 So.3d 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007 (Fla. 4th DCA 2017) (\"Where a trial court denies a facially sufficient petition [for name change], the factual basis for doing so must be set forth in its order.\"); Fla.
