Dysart\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The State of Louisiana (the \"State\") appeals a district court judgment granting a motion to quash in favor of defendant, Terry Earl. For the reasons set more fully herein, this Court lacks jurisdiction over this appeal. We, therefore, dismiss this appeal without prejudice and transfer this matter to the Appellate Division of the Criminal District Court for the Parish of Orleans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant, Terry Earl, was charged by bill of information dated February 7, 2017 on two counts. Count one of the bill of information charged Ms. Earl with simple criminal damage to two tires belonging to Vincent Earl, with the damage amounting to less than five hundred dollars. Ms. Earl entered a plea of not guilty and, on August 15, 2018, she filed a motion to quash count one of the bill of information. The district court granted the motion on September 24, 2018. The State appealed this ruling on October 11, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Louisiana Constitution confers jurisdiction to the appellate courts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Except as otherwise provided by this constitution, a court of appeal has appellate jurisdiction of.... (3) all criminal cases triable by a jury, except as provided in Section 5, Paragraph (D)(2) of this Article.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   La. Const. Art. 5, \u00a7 10 (A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   La. C.Cr. P. art 779 provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A. A defendant charged with a misdemeanor in which the punishment, as set forth in the statute defining the offense, may be a fine in excess of one thousand dollars or imprisonment for more than six months shall be tried by a jury of six jurors, all of whom must concur to render a verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   B. The defendant charged with any other misdemeanor shall be tried by the court without a jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   It is clear that the charge of simple criminal damage to property, a violation of La. R.S. 14:56 B(1) is not a case \"triable by a jury.\" Under La. R.S. 14:56 B(1), \"[w]hoever\n   commits the crime of simple criminal damage to property where the damage is less than one thousand dollars shall be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned for not more than six months, or both.\" La. R.S. 14:56 B(1). Accordingly, this Court does not have jurisdiction over this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Gaubert\n   </em>\n   , 15-0774, p. 6 (La. App. 4 Cir. 12/9/15),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6841033\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/179/982/#p987\">\n    179 So.3d 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 987,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 16-0122 (La. 1/23/17),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12364226,12364233,12364218,12364242\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/215/681/\">\n    215 So.3d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"there is no right of appeal from a misdemeanor conviction.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

Const. Art. V, \u00a7 10 (A) ] ....' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We therefore dismiss this appeal without prejudice.
