We reverse because the case below was removed to federal court one day before the trial court entered the final judgment; thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After the Bank sued Garcia to foreclose a mortgage, a tenant of Garcia filed a cross-complaint against Garcia in the foreclosure action, alleging that Garcia and his wife violated the federal Truth in Lending Act by representing that the subject mortgage had been rescinded. The tenant asserted in the cross-complaint that this misrepresentation entitled the tenant to remain in the property. On July 10, 2017, this cross-complainant filed a notice of removal of the entire foreclosure action to federal court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following day, on July 11, 2017, the trial court entered the final\n   foreclosure judgment. The United States District Court remanded the case back to the circuit court on July 19, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   State court jurisdiction ceases upon removal of a case to federal court and any pre-remand proceedings occurring in the state court after the case has been removed are void.\n   <em>\n    Musa v.

On January 20, 2017, a different tenant of Garcia filed an identical cross-complaint and sought removal of the entire case to federal court. The United States District Court remanded the case back to the circuit court on February 24, 2017.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    As the First District pointed out, a frivolous or bad faith removal to federal court may implicate the trial court's \"authority to sanction such conduct (once it regains jurisdiction).\"\n    <em>\n     Musa\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6772276\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/181/1275/#p1277\">\n     181 So.3d at 1284\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
