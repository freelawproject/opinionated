For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's conviction and sentence and remand the matter for correction of the State of Louisiana Uniform Commitment Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Robert Howard was shot in the carport outside of his home on the evening of April 16, 2009 and died three weeks later on May 10, 2009. His cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck that transected his spinal cord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On the night of the shooting, the victim's father, Robert England, was inside when he heard five gunshots. He ran outside to find his son lying on the ground with a gunshot wound to his neck. He was still conscious and stated that he did not know who shot him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Deputy Ted Raymond of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office (\"JPSO\") arrived on the scene around 7:50 p.m. The victim was still conscious and advised the officer that he did not know who shot him. After paramedics had transported the victim to the hospital, Detective Jeffrey Rodrigue arrived on the scene and began trying to locate witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the victim succumbed to his injuries on May 10, Detective Rodrigue spoke with Adrian \"Stank\" Haynes and Dagenera Molison. Mr. Haynes later testified at trial that he was close friends with the victim and lived around the corner from him in the Lincolnshire subdivision of Marrero. On April 16, 2009, Mr. Haynes, the victim, and their friend, James Moore, played basketball and headed home around 6:00 p.m. Soon after Mr. Haynes and the victim made it back to the victim's house, Mr. Haynes went home to shower and planned to return so the three friends could shoot pool later that night. But when Mr. Haynes returned, the victim had been shot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dagenera Molison later testified at trial that she knew both defendant and the victim and was dating defendant at the time of the shooting. She testified that she spoke with defendant after the shooting and he told her that he did not mean to shoot the victim, but that he intended to shoot James Moore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Based on his conversations with Mr. Haynes and Ms. Molison, Detective Rodrigue spoke with James Moore and Rickell London. Mr. Moore gave two taped statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   His first statement began at\n   10:46 p.m. and concluded at 10:55 p.m. on May 13, 2009. Mr. Moore explained that on the day before the shooting, he had an altercation with Angelica Williams, defendant's sister. Then, on the day of the shooting, Mr. Moore, Mr. Haynes, and the victim played basketball. When they finished, Mr. Haynes and the victim went back to the victim's house while Mr. Moore went back to his house. Mr. Moore was walking back over to the victim's house when he noticed a champagne-colored Toyota pass by with a driver and one passenger. When Mr. Moore got to the victim's house, he sat with the victim in his carport and noticed the same car pass two or three times with a female driver and male passenger. He then heard gunshots, saw the victim slumped over, and ran off. Mr. Moore stated that he did not know who shot the victim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Moore's second statement began at 12:33 a.m. and concluded at 12:36 a.m. on May 14, 2009. In this statement, he changed his story and stated that he saw defendant shoot the victim. He then identified defendant from a photographic lineup.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At trial, Mr. Moore testified that he had a run-in with defendant's sister the day before the shooting-though Ms. Williams testified at trial and denied any such run-in. Mr. Moore explained that on the day of the shooting he, the victim, and Mr. Haynes had played basketball. Afterwards, he went home, while Mr. Haynes and the victim went to the victim's house. Mr. Moore was walking over to meet them when he observed a vehicle with defendant in the passenger seat and a female in the driver seat. Soon after he met up with his friends, Mr. Haynes left to shower, leaving Mr. Moore and the victim sitting in the carport in front of the victim's garage. While there, Mr. Moore noticed the vehicle circle the block and then heard gunshots. He told the victim he was going home because \"something looking funny.\" As he started to walk away, he heard six gunshots at close range and saw defendant discharging a handgun in the victim's direction. When Mr. Moore noticed the victim slumped over, he ran home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Moore also testified about some prior inconsistent statements. He testified about a letter he wrote while incarcerated on February 1, 2010 to a \"Mr. Robertson,\" wherein he asserted that he was \"on lockdown\" and that he did not see defendant shoot the victim. He explained in the letter that he only said he did in his statement because he was threatened by the detectives. He also testified about an affidavit he signed on November 30, 2010 while incarcerated. In this affidavit, Mr. Moore stated that he did not see defendant shoot the victim and that he only said he did because of threats from the detectives. He further testified about phone calls he made from jail between October 2012 and February 2013 to his grandmother and cousin in which he told them that he did not see who shot the victim. At trial, he recanted his statements in the February 1, 2010 letter, the November 30, 2010 affidavit, and the phone calls, and testified that his testimony at trial was the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Rickell London testified at trial that around 7:30 p.m. on April 16, 2009, defendant asked her to give him a ride to Lincolnshire \"to go kill someone.\" She did not think he was serious, but she noticed that he had a gun in his waistband. Ms. London was driving a champagne and burgundy Toyota Camry and defendant was in the front passenger seat. As they approached Lincolnshire, defendant remarked to Ms. London, \"Whatever goes on stays.\" It was then that she realized defendant's homicidal intent was sincere. Defendant directed her through the subdivision, and they circled one block several times. When Ms. London noticed \"three or four boys\" in\n   front of a house, defendant instructed her to park two houses down and to turn off her headlights. She complied. Defendant exited the vehicle and pulled the gun from his waistband. Within seconds, Ms. London, who could not see defendant or the other boys, heard several gunshots. Defendant soon returned to the car, put the gun back in his waistband, and told her to \"drive off fast.\" Ms. London testified that she was offered a plea agreement to accessory after the fact to second degree murder in exchange for her testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ms. London also testified about prior inconsistent statements she had made. She explained that while incarcerated on a charge of principal to second degree murder, she made several phone calls to her friends and family, in which she stated that she did not know anything about the shooting. She acknowledged statements she made to an assistant district attorney in which she said she had nothing to do with the shooting. Ms. London further testified about her statements she gave to Detective Rodrigue in the days after the victim's death. She explained that she lied in her first statement when she said that she did not drive defendant on the day of the shooting. Ms. London recanted her prior inconsistent statements and testified that her testimony at trial was the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Detective Rodrigue obtained an arrest warrant for defendant based on his conversations with Mr. Moore and Ms. London. And on July 16, 2009, a Jefferson Parish Grand Jury returned an indictment charging defendant with the second degree murder of Robert Howard. Defendant entered a plea of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The matter proceeded to a trial by jury on March 11, 2013. On March 14, 2013, ten of the twelve jurors returned a verdict of guilty as charged. On April 23, 2013, defendant moved for a new trial, which the court heard and denied on February 18, 2014. Following numerous continuances, defendant was sentenced on November 13, 2017 to life imprisonment at hard labor with the benefit of parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel orally moved for reconsideration of sentence which was denied in open court. On November 14, 2017, defendant filed a written motion for reconsideration and a motion for appeal. His appeal was granted on November 20, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the record in this appeal was lodged here, on March 14, 2018, the Clerk of this Court ordered the district court to rule upon defendant's written motion for reconsideration of sentence. The district court denied defendant's motion on March 19, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, defendant raises four assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (1) The State failed to prove defendant guilty of second degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt and, by the trial court's ruling and the State's withholding of evidence, the defendant was denied full cross-examination of the only witness who purported to identify him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (2) The district court erred in denying the motion for new trial based on trial defect of having a juror decide the case who was not qualified to serve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (3) The district court erred in denying the motion to declare La. C.Cr.P. art. 782 unconstitutional and in accepting a verdict in this case that was not unanimous.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (4) The district court erred in imposing an illegal sentence, as it violated the ex post facto clause and life imprisonment with parole was unconstitutionally excessive under the circumstances of this offense or the offender.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Assignment of Error One\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant submits six arguments in support of his first assignment of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (a) James Moore was the single witness who identified Dwayne Williams as the shooter. James Moore's purported identification of Dwayne Williams changed three times and does not support the conviction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (b) Defendant was prevented from cross-examination of James Moore as to his violent history as a juvenile and involvement in other conflicts, in particular a murder, such that other persons may have been out to get him, in addition to reflecting on his credibility and self-interest;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (c) Reasonable hypothesis as to other perpetrators were not excluded; instead the State prevented the defendant from developing them. The day of his death, Robert Howard was hanging out with Stank and James Moore who were known to be involved in drug sales, as each of them had distribution arrests after this incident. Moore had attacked someone in Bridge City and allegedly had killed someone over his brother's drug death. The families and friends of these people were likely seeking retribution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (d) Dwayne Williams was convicted on a vote of 10-2. If only one more juror was persuaded by the evidence about James Moore's activities, the\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation would have effected [sic] the verdict and Mr. Williams would not have been convicted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (e) Neither Dagenera Molison or Rickell London identified Dwayne Williams. Neither of them were believable as they had their own interests, their claims could not be verified, and London's statements also changed multiple times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (f) The State offered no corroboration of the identification by forensic evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   This opinion addresses these arguments in the following three subsections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We first address the sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, James Moore's credibility would have been impeached with this additional bad character evidence.

We address each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   With regard to the first argument, our review of the record indicates that James Moore's credibility was effectively impeached by defense counsel at trial without this evidence. The jury was made aware of Mr. Moore's several prior inconsistent statements and Mr. Moore testified about his own criminal history, detailing his incarceration relative to a second degree battery conviction and his arrest on possession of marijuana in a school zone. We therefore find that this evidence reflecting additional criminal conduct amounts to cumulative impeachment evidence, and that defendant has not demonstrated a reasonable probability that the outcome of the proceeding would have been different had it been disclosed to the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   With regard to the second argument, we first observe that whether the prosecution may have leverage over a witness due to that witness's pending criminal charges is a valid area of cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The warrant for Mr. Moore's arrest was not issued until after defendant's trial had concluded. Thus, not only were no criminal charges pending against him, but the evidence indicates that Mr. Moore was not even aware that he was a suspect or being investigated on the charges. Under these circumstances, there is no possibility that the State had any leverage over Mr. Moore on the basis of the 2012 murder investigation at the time of defendant's trial.

In his motion for new trial, defendant argued that one juror was disqualified on the basis of a prior felony conviction under La. C.Cr.P. art. 401(A)(5), which provides: \"In order to qualify to serve as a juror, a person must:...Not be under indictment for a felony nor have been convicted of a felony for which he has not been pardoned by the governor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   At voir dire on March 11, 2013, one prospective juror, R.H., advised the court that she had a prior felony conviction for possession of alprazolam. During a discussion regarding her eligibility to serve, the clerk advised: \"I ran her name, and the first offender pardon letter is in the computer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Based on this, the court determined that she had been pardoned and permitted her to remain on the venire. The parties did not challenge R.H. for cause or exercise peremptory challenges to strike her as a potential juror. In fact, the record reflects that defendant only exercised five of his twelve peremptory challenges. R.H. was ultimately accepted on to the petit jury and was one of the ten jurors who voted for defendant's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In his motion for new trial, defendant argued that the defense mistakenly believed R.H. was qualified to serve as a juror pursuant to the first-offender pardon. In this mistaken belief, the defense (as well as the State and the court) had relied on the pre-2010 version of La. C.Cr.P. art. 401(A)(5), which provided: \"In order to qualify to serve as a juror, a person must:...Not be under indictment for a felony nor have been convicted of a felony for which he has not been pardoned.\" But in 2010, the Legislature amended the provision so that it now provides: \"...Not be under indictment for a felony nor have been convicted of a felony for which he has not been pardoned\n   <em>\n    by the governor\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Emphasis added). Therefore, since R.H. had not been pardoned by the governor, she was not qualified to serve as a juror, and the defense did not became aware of the change in the law until after the jury verdict. On this basis, and especially on account of the fact that R.H. was one of the ten jurors who voted for defendant's guilt, defendant argued he was entitled to a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The decision on a motion for a new trial rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and the ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

C.Cr.P. art. 851(B)(4), which provides that a new trial shall be granted when \"[t]he defendant has discovered, since the verdict or judgment of guilty, a prejudicial error or defect in the proceedings that, notwithstanding the exercise of reasonable diligence by the defendant, was not discovered before the verdict or judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   We observe La.

He contends that because the mandatory sentencing provision that was in effect at the time of his offense was ruled unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

He presents his argument in his brief as follows: \"The sentence imposed on Dwayne Williams had to be one that was available in 2009. When the 2009 sentence for second degree murder was declared unconstitutional as applied to juvenile offenders, only 2009 law could fix it and that law required a sentence of no more than forty years.\" In support of this argument, defendant relies in part on\n   <em>\n    State v.

In accordance with this jurisprudence, we reject defendant's argument here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Second, defendant argues La. C.Cr.P. art. 878.1(B)(2)(a) and La. R.S. 15:574.4(G) violate the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   clause and the doctrine of separation of powers. Defendant did not raise this separation of powers argument below in his motion to reconsider sentence, and so he is precluded from raising it now on appeal in accordance with La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.1(E), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Failure to make or file a motion to reconsider sentence or to include a specific ground upon which a motion to reconsider sentence may be based, including a claim of excessiveness, shall preclude the state or the defendant from raising an objection to the sentence or from urging any ground not raised in the motion on appeal or review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   In defendant's\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   argument, he argues that La. R.S. 15:574.4(G) violates the\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   prohibition because it retroactively changes the penalty by imposing a minimum sentence of twenty-five years that did not exist in 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Louisiana Supreme Court has observed that \"the linchpin inquiry in determining whether a statute violates the state Ex Post Facto Clause is whether the change alters the definition of criminal conduct or increases the penalty.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Holloway\n   </em>\n   , 15-1233 (La. 10/19/16),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12362622\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/217/343/#p348\">\n    217 So.3d 343\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The law in effect at the time of defendant's offense mandated a minimum sentence of life imprisonment without the benefit of parole. The law no longer mandates such a sentence, but now allows for the benefit of parole. This change did not alter the definition of the crime of second degree murder, and certainly did not increase the penalty, but permits a more lenient penalty. Defendant's\n   <em>\n    ex post facto\n   </em>\n   claim is therefore without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Lastly, defendant argues his sentence is unconstitutionally excessive.

A sentence is considered excessive, even when it is within the applicable statutory range, if it is grossly disproportionate to the seriousness of the offense or imposes needless and purposeless pain and suffering.
