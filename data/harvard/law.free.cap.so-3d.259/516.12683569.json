For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 6, 2016, while at defendant's store located at 300 W. Esplanade Avenue, in Kenner, plaintiff allegedly slipped and fell on a wet spot on the floor. As a result of this incident, plaintiff allegedly sustained injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 4, 2017, plaintiff filed via facsimile a petition for damages with the Clerk of Court for the 24\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court for the Parish of Jefferson. The Clerk of Court received the facsimile on July 5, 2017. Plaintiff's counsel prepared and mailed via the United States Postal Service, a certified mail package containing the original petition for damages and applicable fees to the Clerk of Court's address listed as P.O. Box 10, Gretna, Louisiana 70054. The certified mail package's return receipt requested card (\"green card\") was delivered to the P.O. Box address and was signed by Faye Simoneaux on July 13, 2017. On July 14, 2017, the Clerk of Court stamped as filed plaintiff's original petition for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant filed an answer and an exception of prescription. In its exception, defendant argued that plaintiff failed to satisfy the requirements of La. R.S. 13:850 B(1) because plaintiff's original copy was not delivered to and received by the Clerk of Court within seven days of the facsimile filing on July 4, 2017. Defendant contended that plaintiff's original copy was received on July 14, 2017, one day after the applicable seven-day time period, and plaintiff's claim was therefore prescribed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to defendant's exception, plaintiff filed a memorandum in opposition arguing that she complied with La. R.S. 13:850 B because the original petition and applicable fees were mailed to the Clerk of Court via certified mail return receipt requested to the Clerk of Court's listed addressed and it was delivered to the Clerk of Court when the green card was signed by Ms. Simoneaux on July 13, 2017. In support of her opposition, plaintiff attached the affidavit of her counsel, wherein counsel stated that he mailed the original petition and applicable fees via certified mail, return receipt requested, to the address listed on all of the Clerk of Court's communications - Clerk of Court, P.O. Box 10, Gretna, Louisiana 70054 - and the green card was signed by Ms. Simoneaux on July 13, 2017. Plaintiff also attached a copy of the green card and a copy of the Clerk of Court's facsimile filing receipt. After a hearing, the trial court granted defendant's exception of prescription and dismissed plaintiff's claims against defendant. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Procedural Issue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 16, 2018, plaintiff filed a motion to supplement the record on appeal by including an affidavit executed on March 13, 2018, by Ms. Simoneaux, the deputy clerk of court. Plaintiff argues that\n   the affidavit and its attached exhibit are relevant and material to key issues of law before this Court and are required for a complete record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 20, 2018, defendant filed an opposition to plaintiff's motion to supplement, arguing the trial court granted defendant's exception of prescription on October 30, 2017. Defendant contends that the affidavit sought to be included in the record was not previously introduced in the exception of prescription hearing in the trial court. Defendant argues that La. C.C.P. art. 2132 does not permit the introduction of new evidence after an appeal is filed in the appellate court. Further, defendant contends that La. C.C.P. art. 2164 precludes the appellate court from considering new evidence that is not part of the record on appeal. Defendant contends that Ms. Simoneaux's affidavit was not a part of the trial court record as it was executed on March 13, 2018, after the record was lodged for appeal with this Court. Therefore, defendant argues that this Court should deny plaintiff's motion to supplement the record on appeal. This Court referred the motion to the merits of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   An appellate court must render its judgment upon the record on appeal. La.

Moreover, the affidavit itself shows that it was not executed until after judgment was rendered and the record was lodged for appeal with this Court. Accordingly, we deny plaintiff's motion to supplement the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Delictual actions are subject to a liberative prescription of one year. La. C.C. art. 3492. Prescriptive statutes are strictly construed against prescription and in favor of the obligation sought to be extinguished; thus, of two possible constructions, that which favors maintaining, as opposed to barring, an action should be adopted.\n   <em>\n    Carter v. Haygood\n   </em>\n   , 04-0646 (La. 1/19/05),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9035887\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/892/1261/#p1268\">\n    892 So.2d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1268. Prescription commences to run from the date of the injury or damage sustained. La. C.C. art. 3492. The burden of proving prescription ordinarily lies with the party raising the exception, but when prescription is evident on the face of the pleadings, the burden\n   shifts to the plaintiff to show that the action has not prescribed.\n   <em>\n    Maestri v.

R.S. 13:850 because the certified mail green card establishes that the original petition was timely delivered to the Clerk of Court's listed address on July 13, 2017, within seven days, rendering the petition timely as required by La. R.S. 13:850 B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant contends plaintiff's claim is prescribed because, at the trial court level, it was undisputed that the last day to timely file plaintiff's original petition was Thursday, July 13, 2017. Specifically, defendant contends plaintiff's petition was not delivered to the Clerk of Court until Friday, July 14, 2017, as evidenced by the date and time stamped on the original petition, and thus, plaintiff's petition is prescribed on its face. Defendant argues that the green card indicates that the original petition was sent to an incorrect address, instead of 200 Derbigny Street, Gretna, Louisiana 70053, and was received by someone who picked up the mail at the P.O. Box on July 13, 2017. Defendant clams, therefore, that the trial court correctly granted the exception of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   There is no current jurisprudence interpreting La. R.S. 13:850 B as amended by 2016 La. Acts, No. 109, ordinary session. Subsection B provides that \"\n   <em>\n    Within seven days\n   </em>\n   , exclusive of legal holidays, after the clerk of court receives the facsimile filing,\" the appropriate documents \"\n   <em>\n    shall be delivered\n   </em>\n   \" to the clerk of court's office.
