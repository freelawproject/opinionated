Because the docket indicates that the petitioner is represented by counsel in circuit court case number 18-CF-1130, the petition and supplemental petition for writ of prohibition are dismissed. See Logan v. State,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9119259\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/846/472/\">\n    846 So. 2d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 2003). Petitioner may challenge this conclusion by filing a motion for rehearing, under oath, within 15 days of the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   LaROSE, C.J., and NORTHCUTT and SILBERMAN, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
