Belsome, Judge Sandra Cabrina Jenkins, Judge Paula A. Brown )\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Judge Paula A. Brown\n   This case involves incidental matters related to divorce proceedings. A hearing was held on a rule filed by Appellee, Pamela Savedra Burford (\"Mrs. Burford\") requesting Appellant, Harold Burford, Jr., (\"Mr. Buford\") to show cause why Mr. Burford should not pay child and spousal support along with other related matters. After taking the matter under advisement, the district court rendered judgment on March 8, 2018. From this judgment, Mr. Burford appeals. In response, Mrs. Burford requests the appeal be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the reasons given below, the appeal is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Burfords married and two children were born of the marriage. On September 29, 2017, Mrs. Burford filed a petition for divorce based on La. C.C. art. 102. Simultaneously, Mrs. Burford filed a petition for protection from abuse which included a rule for Mr. Burford to show cause why he should not pay child and spousal support. A hearing was held on February 7, 2018. After taking the matter under advisement, the district court rendered judgment on March 8, 2018, along with written reasons. The district court found that Mr. Burford was voluntarily unemployed and calculation of his child and spousal support should be based on La. R.S. 9:315.11(A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 29, 2018, Mr. Burford filed in the district court a motion seeking a devolutive appeal which was granted. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    MOTION TO DISMISS APPEAL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In her brief to this Court, Mrs. Burford urges that the appeal be dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. Mrs. Burford points out the district court did not render judgment on all of the issues tried at the February 7, 2018 hearing, and it retains jurisdiction of this matter until all the issues are ruled upon. Mrs. Burford contends dismissal of the appeal is warranted as the district court's judgment is not a final appealable judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The judgment provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n    Plaintiff's rule for child and spousal support were heard on February 7, 2018.

The judgment only addressed the issue of Mr. Burford's voluntary unemployment; the judgment did not set monthly child and spousal support along with other matters.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    Moreover, the record does not reflect the district court designated the March 8, 2018 judgment as final; and Mr. Burford does not assert that he obtained one. Consequently, we find the judgment is a partial judgment and is not appealable absent designation as a final judgment by the district court. La. C.C.P. art. 1915(B) and La. C.C.P. art. 1911.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Accordingly, this Court lacks appellate jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Nevertheless, appellate courts have the discretion to consider a partial judgment or interlocutory judgment under its supervisory authority.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Dupuy Storage &amp; Forwarding, LLC v.

Next, this Court, in contemplating whether to convert an improper appeal to a supervisory writ application, \"has found it appropriate to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction only in cases where the circumstances of the case indicate that an immediate decision of the issue sought to be appealed is necessary to ensure fundamental fairness and judicial efficiency, such as where reversal of the trial court's decision would terminate the litigation.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892278\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/155/560/#p563\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (citations omitted).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    In the case\n    <em>\n     sub judice\n    </em>\n    , Mr. Burford's appeal was filed within the thirty day period\n    required for filing an application for a supervisory writ. Rule 4-3, Uniform Rules, Courts of Appeal. Notwithstanding, any ruling by this Court on the March 8, 2018 judgment would not terminate litigation; and it would require the matter to be remanded to the district court to resolve the remaining issues such as setting the monthly payments for child and spousal support. As a result, this Court's exercise of its supervisory review in this case would promote piecemeal review and infringe on the principles of judicial economy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lobell v.
