Dysart\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an appeal of a trial court judgment granting a peremptory exception of no cause of action filed by defendant-appellee, District Attorney Charles J. Ballay, in his official capacity as District Attorney, 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District, State of Louisiana (hereafter, \"DA Ballay\"). After having conducted a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of this matter, we find that the exception was properly granted. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In this suit seeking damages for malicious prosecution, plaintiff-appellant, Benjamin Tickle, alleges that, on September 1, 2012, he, his wife and a friend had gone to the Belle Chasse ferry landing with the intention of \"checking up on the post-hurricane condition of [his] property.\" There, they encountered several police officers. At the time, Mr. Tickle \"was carrying a holstered .45 caliber Glock semi-automatic pistol clearly visible on his right hip\" and one of the officers \"approached him from behind and seized his weapon,\" refusing to return the weapon unless it was disassembled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ultimately, Mrs. Tickle's vehicle was searched, two additional guns were found in the glove compartment and marijuana was found under the floor mat. Marijuana was also discovered in a search of Mrs. Tickle's purse. Mr. Tickle, his wife and his friend were then arrested.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Tickle was charged by bill of information dated January 3, 2013 with possession of a schedule I substance under La. R.S. 40:966, and \"possession of a CDS ( La. R.S. 14:95(E).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   An amended bill of information\n   filed on January 8, 2014 charged Mr. Tickle with \"Statewide Permits for Concealed Handguns ( La. R.S. 40:1379.3 (I)&amp;(L) ).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Tickle, maintaining that there had been an unlawful search in connection with his arrest, filed a Motion to Suppress the evidence, which was denied by the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Tickle was tried and acquitted of all charges and \"[t]he matter ... finally disposed of in January, 2015.\" Mr. Tickle filed a federal lawsuit for malicious prosecution against DA Ballay in December of 2015. The federal court dismissed all claims; the state law claims were dismissed without prejudice. Mr. Tickle then filed the instant lawsuit, naming DA Ballay and several officers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response to the Petition for Damages (\"Petition\"), DA Ballay filed Peremptory Exceptions of No Cause of Action and Prescription. After a hearing, the trial court granted the exception of no cause of action, by judgment dated December 28, 2017, dismissing, with prejudice, all claims against DA Ballay, but denied the exception of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Tickle timely appealed the trial court judgment. DA Ballay answered the appeal, requesting that, in the event that the grant of the exception of no cause of action is reversed by the Court, that the exception of prescription, denied by the trial court, be considered. As we find that the exception of no cause of action was properly granted, we do not address the exception of prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW; PEREMPTORY EXCEPTION OF NO CAUSE OF ACTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A peremptory exception of no cause of action under La.

He contends, however, that the immunity protects prosecutors, individually, but does not protect against those claims asserted against them in their official capacity. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity evolved from the United States Supreme Court in the decision of\n   <em>\n    Imbler v. Pachtman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n    424 U.S. 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n    47 L.Ed.2d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   involved a suit against a prosecutor (and others) for malicious prosecution filed pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court, concluding that \"the same considerations of public policy that underlie the common-law rule [of immunity] likewise countenance absolute immunity,\" noted as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   If a prosecutor had only a qualified immunity, the threat of [\u00a7] 1983 suits would undermine performance of his duties no less than would the threat of common-law suits for malicious prosecution. A prosecutor is duty bound to exercise his best judgment both in deciding which suits to bring and in conducting them in court. The public trust of the prosecutor's office would suffer if he were constrained in making every decision by the consequences in terms of his own potential liability in a suit for damages. Such suits could be expected with some frequency, for a defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the State's advocate. ... Further, if the prosecutor could be made to answer in court each time such a person charged him with\n   wrongdoing, his energy and attention would be diverted from the pressing duty of enforcing the criminal law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436879\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/681/944/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n    424 U.S. at 424-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n    96 S.Ct. at 992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also noted other factors which justified the doctrine of absolute immunity: \"affording of only a qualified immunity to the prosecutor also could have an adverse effect upon the functioning of the criminal justice system\" and \"[t]he ultimate fairness of the operation of the system itself could be weakened by subjecting prosecutors to [\u00a7] 1983 liability.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n    424 U.S. at 426-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/\">\n    96 S.Ct. at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Petition then alleges the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   - The Plaquemines Parish District Attorney's office instituted charges against Mr. Tickle by way of a Bill of Information filed on January 3, 2013, and the \"criminal proceeding lasted over two years;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   - Defense counsel filed a motion to suppress, which was denied; a supervisory writ to this Court was likewise denied;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   - An amended bill of information was filed on January 8, 2013;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   - After a trial on the merits, Mr. Tickle was acquitted of all charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Mr. Tickle's suit is not against DA Ballay; there are no specific allegations against DA Ballay.

As such, the trial court properly granted the exception of no cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We need not reach the issue of whether, as Mr. Tickle suggests, at the hearing on the exceptions, the trial court improperly considered the outcome of the preliminary examination in the criminal proceeding. We note that, aside from argument of counsel, there is nothing in the record which demonstrates that the trial court's ruling was based on the finding of probable cause in the criminal matter. There is no transcript of the hearing in the record and the judgment does not contain any reference to the preliminary examination. Nor were any reasons for judgment issued which indicate that the court's ruling was in any way based on a probable cause finding. The only reference is in a minute entry which states that \"[t]he Court addressed the parties regarding probable cause found by Judge Clement.\" This issue is, therefore, not before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

They propose to allege a cause of action against the sheriff not based on his vicarious liability for the tortious acts of his deputy, but grounded on his primary liability as a tort feasor personally.

As we have found, this conduct is clearly encompassed by the doctrine of prosecutorial immunity.
