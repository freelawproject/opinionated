On appeal, the Fifth District Court of Appeal affirmed his convictions and sentences and rejected overbreadth and void-for-vagueness arguments Martin presented challenging the constitutionality of section 1006.63, Florida Statutes (2012), Florida's hazing statute. Martin sought review under article V, section 3(b)(3) of the Florida Constitution, based on the Fifth District's express declaration that the hazing statute is valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We granted jurisdiction, and we now consider Martin's various challenges to the constitutionality of the statute. Our analysis leads us to agree with the Fifth District's conclusion that Martin has presented no basis for declaring the hazing statute unconstitutional. We therefore approve the decision on review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In explaining our decision, we begin with a review of the text of the hazing statute. We then briefly recount the facts regarding the episode involving the Marching 100 that was the basis for Martin's convictions. Next, we summarize the ruling of the district court rejecting Martin's arguments that the hazing statute is constitutionally invalid. Finally, we discuss the application of the relevant case law to Martin's overbreadth and void-for-vagueness claims regarding the hazing statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The hazing statute, section 1006.63, contains both criminal and regulatory provisions. Subsection (1) provides a definition of hazing-including language specifically excluding from its coverage certain conduct-that is applicable to both the criminal and regulatory provisions. The specific criminal provisions are set forth in subsections (2)-(6), and the regulatory provisions are found in subsections (7)-(10). This case,\n   of course, raises questions related to the criminal provisions. Of particular relevance here are the definition of hazing in subsection (1); the provisions of subsection (2) establishing the offense of third-degree felony hazing; the provisions of subsection (3) establishing the offense of first-degree misdemeanor hazing; and the provision of subsection (5) providing that certain enumerated circumstances are not defenses to a charge of hazing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The definition of hazing is, of course, critically important to determining the scope of criminal liability under the statute. An act is not punishable as a crime under the statute unless it falls within the ambit of that definition. But an act may come within the definition of hazing and still not be a criminal offense. The provisions establishing felony hazing and misdemeanor hazing both contain additional elements that go beyond the definition of hazing. An examination of those elements readily reveals that they substantially narrow the scope of criminal liability under the hazing statute.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (1) As used in this section, \"hazing\" means\n   <em>\n    any action or situation\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    recklessly or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health or safety of a student\n   </em>\n   for purposes including, but not limited to, initiation or admission into or\n   <em>\n    affiliation with any organization operating under the sanction of a postsecondary institution\n   </em>\n   . \"Hazing\" includes, but is not limited to, pressuring or coercing the student into violating state or federal law,\n   <em>\n    any brutality of a physical nature, such as whipping, beating\n   </em>\n   , branding, exposure to the elements, forced consumption of any food, liquor, drug, or other substance, or other forced physical activity that could adversely affect the physical health or safety of the student, and also includes any activity that would subject the student to extreme mental stress, such as sleep deprivation, forced exclusion from social contact, forced conduct that could result in extreme embarrassment, or other forced activity that could adversely affect the mental health or dignity of the student. Hazing\n   <em>\n    does not include customary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions\n   </em>\n   or any activity or conduct that furthers a legal and legitimate objective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00a7 1006.63(1), Fla.

Stat. And the two offenses both contain an additional element related to the consequence of the act of hazing. The felony offense requires that \"the hazing results in serious bodily injury or death\" of the victim. \u00a7 1006.63(2), Fla. Stat. For the misdemeanor offense to be established, the act of hazing must \"create[ ] a substantial risk of physical injury or death\" to the victim. \u00a7 1006.63(3), Fla. Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Under subsection (5), the consensual participation of the victim in the event or situation that constitutes hazing is not a defense. \u00a7 1006.63(5)(a), Fla. Stat. Likewise, it is no defense that the hazing was not officially sanctioned or that it \"was not done as a condition of membership.\" \u00a7 1006.63(5)(b)-(c), Fla. Stat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On appeal from the judgment and sentences, the Fifth District set out the facts of the crimes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Martin] was a member of the percussion section of the Florida A &amp; M University's marching band, the \"Marching 100.\" Members of the percussion section are entitled to ride to away events in a motor coach known as \"Bus C.\" [Martin] was president of Bus C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   A tradition or ritual known as \"Crossing Bus C\" has existed at the University for some time. The ritual consists of three components: 1) the hot seat, 2) the prepping, and 3) the crossing. During the hot seat, the participant takes a seat on Bus C (near the front) and is struck or hit repeatedly by others, including members of the percussion section. Next, the participant is prepped. During the prepping, the participant stands up and places his or her hands on the luggage rail and is then slapped a number of times with full force by the others on the bus. After the prepping, the participant crosses from the front of the bus to the back while others slap, kick, and punch the participant. [Martin], as bus president, decided when someone could cross Bus C.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   On [November 19, 2011], Keon Hollis, Robert Champion, and [Martin], as members of the Marching 100, performed at the Florida Classic in Orlando, Florida. Immediately following the band's performance, [Martin] asked Hollis if he planned to cross the bus. Hollis indicated that he wanted to do so. Later, Jonathan Boyce, also a member of the band, received a text from [Martin] asking him to convey to Hollis and Champion that if they wanted to cross \"it's available\" to them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   That night, Lissette Sanchez (another member of the percussion section), Hollis, and Champion crossed Bus C, and [Martin] participated in these crossings. Champion was the last to cross. When Champion made it to the back, he appeared tired, but indicated, \"I'm good.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   After the crossings were completed, everyone left the bus except Champion. When Boyce noticed that Champion was not with him, he returned to the bus. He found Champion in the back of the bus panicking; and, shortly thereafter, Champion passed out. Champion was taken to a hospital, but efforts to save his life were not successful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Champion's body was transferred from the hospital to the medical examiner's office. Dr. Sarah Irrgang, the associate medical examiner, visually examined Champion's body. She observed some discoloration and a few superficial abrasions, she took several photographs, and then released Champion's body for bone harvesting. The next day, after his leg bones had been harvested, Champion's body was returned to the medical examiner's office. At that time, Dr. Irrgang noticed unevenness in the skin on Champion's torso, suggesting swelling. This observation prompted Dr. Irrgang to investigate further. She took a number of pictures of Champion's body during the ensuing autopsy. Based on her investigation, she determined that the manner of death was homicide.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

The district court rejected Martin's argument on this point because Martin failed to make the necessary showing that the hazing statute \"is susceptible of application to speech or conduct protected by the First Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177245\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/310/#p313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177245\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/310/#p313\">\n    at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In doing so, the court referred to certain dictionary definitions of \"competition\"-including the definition in\n   <em>\n    Webster's Third New International Dictionary\n   </em>\n   of competition as \"a common struggle for the same object\"-to show that the term \"competition\" \"is sufficiently definite such that the defendant was not forced to guess at its meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177245\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/310/#p313\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177245\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so3d/207/310/#p313\">\n    at 317-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We first examine Martin's argument that the hazing statute is unconstitutionally overbroad on its face for criminalizing constitutionally protected speech and conduct. Martin bases this overbreadth argument specifically on the claim that subsection (5)(a) of the hazing statute-which provides that the victim's consent is not a defense-makes criminal a substantial amount of protected speech and conduct. Martin contends that the \"statute's criminalization of voluntary acts in many circumstances chills commonplace and customary conduct.\" This argument fails to show that the criminal hazing statute meets the standard required for establishing that a statute is unconstitutionally overbroad.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Under the First Amendment facial overbreadth doctrine, \"[l]itigants ... are permitted to challenge a statute not because their own rights of free expression are violated, but because of a judicial prediction or assumption that the statute's very existence may cause others not before the court to refrain from constitutionally protected speech or expression.\"\n   <em>\n    Broadrick v.

Given the \"plainly legitimate sweep\" of the hazing statute, it cannot be said that the statute \"prohibits a substantial amount of protected speech.\" The \"strong medicine\" of the overbreadth doctrine has no application in this context. Martin's overbreadth challenge fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We turn now to Martin's void-for-vagueness claims, in which he argues that the hazing statute is unconstitutionally vague not only as applied to him but also on its face. His as-applied argument is based largely on the assertion that the term \"competition\" in the last sentence of the definition of hazing in subsection (1) \"lacks precision.\" In brief, Martin contends that because \"the bus crossing bore sufficient indicia of being a competition,\" the statute was unconstitutional as applied to him. Martin's argument that the statute is facially invalid relies more broadly on the last sentence of the definition of hazing. He contends that uncertainty in the interpretation of the terms contained in that sentence-which excludes certain categories of conduct from the scope of the definition of hazing-renders the statute void for vagueness in \"its entirety.\" Martin has failed to establish that the statute is invalid either facially or as-applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   It has long been recognized \"[t]hat the terms of a penal statute creating a new offense must be sufficiently explicit to inform those who are subject to it what conduct on their part will render them liable to its penalties\" and that \"a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that [people] of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Connally v.

The conduct in which Martin was involved falls squarely and unambiguously within the statute's core proscription of \"brutality of a physical nature, such as whipping\" or \"beating\" that \"intentionally or recklessly\" \"results in serious bodily injury or death\" or \"creates a substantial risk\" of such harms. \u00a7 1006.63(1) - (3), Fla.

The final sentence of the definition of hazing provides that hazing \"does not include customary athletic events or other similar contests or competitions or any activity or conduct that furthers a legal and legitimate objective.\" \u00a7 1006.63(1), Fla.

This conclusion is further bolstered by the fact that in order to interpret the word \"similar\" as disjunctive to the term \"competition[ ],\" this Court would have to adopt the nonsensical view that a \"customary athletic event[ ]\" is not, in fact, a \"competition[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1006.63(1), Fla.
