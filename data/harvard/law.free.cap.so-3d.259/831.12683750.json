We quash the circuit court's October 26, 2018, judgment of direct criminal contempt. Our disposition is without prejudice to institute contempt proceedings under Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.840.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   KELLY, SLEET, and LUCAS, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
