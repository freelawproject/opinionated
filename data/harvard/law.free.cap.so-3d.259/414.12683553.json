(Lanie Farms), filed suit against CLECO Power, LLC (CLECO) and Utility Lines Construction Services, Inc. d/b/a Highlines Construction Company, Inc. (Highlines), seeking damages for the economic losses and remediation expenses it incurred as a result of Defendants' construction and installation of new electrical poles and power lines along a servitude that traversed property farmed and leased by Lanie Farms. During trial, Defendants moved for involuntary dismissal. The trial court denied the motion and ultimately ruled in Lanie Farms' favor, awarding $38,000.00 in damages plus interest and costs. Lanie Farms then moved for a new trial on the issue of damages only. After the trial court denied the motion, Lanie Farms filed its appeal to this court, challenging the trial court's general damage award as well as its failure to grant a new trial. CLECO and Highlines answered the appeal, assigning as error the trial court's denial of their motion for involuntary dismissal and its casting Defendants in judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After reviewing the record evidence, we find no manifest error or abuse of discretion in the trial court judgment.

The 1600 acres it farms are leased from Young Industries, Inc., and from Michaela Bourque LaPoint, Cynthia B. Duhon, William C. Burley, Brenda J. Burley, Benjamin F. Burley, and M. F. Burley, III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In December 2009, Benjamin F. Burley and his wife, Debbie Burley, along with Francis Marion Burley, III, entered into a servitude agreement with CLECO. In March 2010, Young Industries, Inc., entered into an electric power line right-of-way easement with CLECO (the Agreement). Both agreements granted CLECO the right to construct and install new electrical poles and power lines on designated rights-of-way that traversed the land leased and farmed by Lanie Farms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior thereto, in May 2009, CLECO contracted with Ampirical Solutions, LLC to provide general contracting services to construct and install power lines on land around Youngsville, Louisiana, including the property upon which Lanie Farms conducted its farming operations. Thereafter, Ampirical Solutions entered into a subcontract with Highlines to perform the actual work of constructing and installing the new electrical poles and lines along the designated rights-of-way. Highlines conducted its operations on the farmland leased by Lanie Farms from October 2010 until May 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Lanie Farms subsequently filed suit against CLECO and Highlines, seeking damages for the economic losses and remediation expenses it incurred as a result of Defendants' construction operations. In its petition, Lanie Farms alleged Defendants' negligence but also recited the provision in the Agreement whereby CLECO agreed to \"pay for any and all damages to property or crops caused [by its] activities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   All parties stipulated that 6.6 acres of plant cane and 1.5 acres of first stubble cane were destroyed within the right-of-way. They also stipulated to the acreage outside the right-of-way-15 acres-that Lanie Farms further claimed were damaged, but the parties did not stipulate as to whether there was damage to those 15 acres or to the cause of any alleged damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Prior to trial, CLECO and Highlines filed their motion for declaratory relief, acknowledging the servitude agreements created a stipulation pour autrui in favor of Lanie Farms and requesting a declaration on the proper measure of damages-cost or investment (gross value) versus market (net value), for loss of growing crops. They also sought a declaration that Lanie Farms was not entitled to costs or attorney fees under the agreements. In its opposition to the motion, Lanie Farms stated that its cause of action sounded solely in negligence, not contract. Agreeing with Lanie Farms' classification of its own action, Defendants then withdrew their motion for declaratory judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The matter proceeded to a bench trial, and after Lanie Farms rested its case, CLECO and Highlines moved for involuntary dismissal, arguing that Lanie Farms had failed to prove Defendants' negligence or to establish damages. The trial court denied the motion and ultimately ruled in Plaintiff's favor, awarding $38,000.00 in damages plus interest and costs. In so ruling, the trial court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   At any rate, the Court was impressed with the testimony of Mr. Mclean; quite impressive, and the Court will note that during the photographs that there were no damages outside of the right-of-way to the plaintiff's property. The only damage that was done was to the areas where the right-of-way was granted. So at any rate, the Court realizes that Mr. Viator - - Dr. Viator assessed the possible damage, the $346,000.96. I just think\n   that's unreasonable after reviewing the photographs. I didn't see any damage at all, other than to the area of the servitude. Having said that, Dr. - - Mr. Mclean arrived at a figure of $30,827, which I think is - - is way more in line than what Dr. Viator had.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Lanie Farms then moved for a new trial solely on the issue of damages, which the trial court denied, reasoning, \"The Court does not see where our ruling does not support a fair interpretation of the evidence presented.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On appeal, Lanie Farms now assigns as error the trial court's general damage award and failure to award a new trial. In their answer to the appeal, Defendants assign as error the trial court's denial of their motion for involuntary dismissal as well as trial court's casting them in judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In light of the \"much discretion\" afforded to the judge or jury in the assessment of damages, an appellate court reviews general damage awards under an abuse of discretion standard.

In support of its position, Lanie Farms cites the report and testimony of its expert, Dr. Calvin Viator, who was tendered and accepted as \"an expert in the field of agronomy, sugarcane, economics, and basic cane operations.\" Dr. Viator itemized Lanie Farms' damages as follows: (1) $63,755.00 for right-of-way mitigation efforts; (2) $36,750.00 for land leveling; (3) $85,121.00 for crop damages on the right-of-way; (4) $82,608.00 for crop damages off the right-of-way; (5) $49,572.00 for tissue culture seed replacement; and (6) $252.00 for soybean losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   However, Defendants' expert, Mr. Paul Mclean, disputed those valuations as well as the measure of damages employed in their calculation. Mr. Mclean, who was tendered and accepted as an expert in land management and business operations, crop damage evaluation, land damage evaluation, restoration activities at the surface operations, and right-of-way practices, opined that Lanie Farms' damages totaled $30,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Though much is made by the parties regarding the proper measure of damages,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , either gross value or net value, the record evidence demonstrates that while gross value may very well be the \"standard\" method for calculation in pre-construction settlement negotiations or in leases, this case was not the standard case, nor was the measure of damages contractually agreed to by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, in the present case, the expert evidence revealed that the net value, which includes\n   the expenses incurred in farming and marketing the cane, was actually a better depiction of the losses sustained; whereas the gross value, which discounted expenses and cost, would amount to a windfall recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   What resulted was a conflict in expert testimony, which the trial court resolved in favor of Defendants' expert. There were two equally plausible evaluations of the extent of damages and the method for valuation of those damages. While Lanie Farms recites for this court the testimony and report of its expert and its witnesses, it fails to recite evidence which either discredited the testimony provided by Defendants' expert or demonstrated how his testimony was so internally inconsistent as to render it implausible on its face. Given the much discretion afforded the trial court in assessing and calculating damages and Mr. Mclean's testimony, we cannot say that the trial court abused its vast discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Having found the general damage award was reasonable, we likewise find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling on Lanie Farms' motion for new trial as the trial court's award was clearly not, as Plaintiff alleged, \"contrary to the law and the evidence.\" La.Code Civ.P. art. 1972.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Motion for Involuntary Dismissal\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A trial court possesses much discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a motion for involuntary dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Mott v.

When such a motion is made, the court must evaluate all of the evidence that has been presented and grant the motion if the plaintiff has failed to establish his case by a preponderance of the evidence.

While the record does show that Lanie Farms did not present evidence as to Defendants' negligence, Lanie Farms did submit into evidence the servitude agreements that obligated CLECO to pay for any damages resulting from its construction activities. The Agreement specifically provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Grantee shall pay for any and all damages to property or crops caused as a result of Grantee's activities and, upon completion of the work, Grantee agrees to restore the surface of the ground and any roads on the land used by Grantee, as nearly as is reasonably practicable to as good a condition as exists at the time of commencement of the work, at Grantee's sole cost and expense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, in its petition, Lanie Farms recited verbatim this contractual provision, which was sufficient enough notice to prompt Defendants' filing of their motion for declaratory judgment wherein they conceded that Lanie Farms was a third-party beneficiary of the agreements and was entitled to damages resulting from their construction activities. Simply because Lanie Farms, in its opposition to that motion, argued its petition did not sound in contract does not render it so. By contractual agreement, CLECO obligated itself to pay for any and all damages resulting from its construction activities. The parties stipulated to the acres of plant cane and first stubble destroyed by Defendants' activities. Therefore, although Lanie Farms did not present evidence of negligence, the agreement along with the parties'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   stipulations, the witnesses' testimony, and evidence submitted into the record were sufficient to carry Plaintiffs' burden to withstand a motion for involuntary dismissal at the close of its case. Accordingly, we find no manifest error in the trial court's ruling denying the motion for involuntary dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As to Defendants' argument that the trial court erred in casting them in judgment, the evidence at trial clearly established that CLECO agreed to \"pay for any and all damages to property or crops\" resulting from its construction activities. This agreement by its very language \"stipulate[d] a benefit for a third person\"-in this case the lessee whose crops were destroyed by Defendants' activities for which damage CLECO contractually agreed to pay. La.Civ.Code art. 1978. As the lessee of the property, shown through the admission of the leases, Lanie Farms was entitled to \"any and all damages to property or crops caused by\" Defendants' activities. Again, the stipulation of the parties to the acreage destroyed as well as the expert testimony and evidence, coupled with the agreements, established by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendants were obligated to pay Lanie Farms for the damages it sustained. Therefore, we find that the trial court did not manifestly err in casting CLECO and Highlines in judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Costs of this appeal are assessed to CLECO and Highlines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The following cases have been recited to this court wherein the various parties, pursuant to the \"industry standard,\" contractually agreed to a gross valuation for crop loss:\n    <em>\n     Campesi v.
