Atkinson (\"Atkinson\"). In his affidavit, Atkinson explained that Highland, which dissolved in\n   2009, was acquired in the mid-1960s by his father, who is now deceased, and Atkinson began working at Highland in 1966, moving up through the ranks of the company until he became the vice-president in 1972, and the president approximately twenty years later. The affidavit provides that, among other things, Highland is not and has never been a resident of the state of Florida, and at all times has been a resident of the state of California with its principal place of business in California; had no owners, agents, or employees in Florida; never owned or operated a facility outside of Southern California; never transacted any business in Florida; never negotiated, entered into, or performed a contract in Florida; never owned, used, or possessed real or personal property in Florida; never maintained a place of business in Florida; was never registered to conduct business in Florida; never maintained any bank accounts, offices, post office boxes, telephone numbers, or any other business facility in Florida; never advertised in any Florida publication or on any Florida radio or television station; did not directly solicit business in Florida; never manufactured, distributed, sold, supplied, or installed any asbestos-containing products in Florida; and had no connection with Florida arising from any action or conduct Highland purposely directed towards Florida. The affidavit further states that \"[t]he overwhelming majority of HIGHLAND's business was conducted in California. During the time period when HIGHLAND used asbestos, its products were primarily sold to building supply dealers within a 60 mile radius of its Van Nuys, California plant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response to Highland's motion, the plaintiffs submitted the following: (1) excerpts from Onorato's deposition wherein he testified that Highland's products were commercially available for purchase in Florida during the time of his exposure; (2) a 1959 trade journal advertisement for Highland's \"Hi-Sorb\" acoustical plaster that was distributed by Highland Stucco and Lime Products of Florida, Inc. (\"Highland of Florida\"); (3) an article from the same trade journal that references a plant in Fort Lauderdale operated by Highland of Florida; and (4) an excerpt from Atkinson's deposition which was taken in connection with a 2000 California lawsuit. Highland replied with documentation demonstrating that\n   <strong>\n    Highland of Florida was dissolved in 1964, approximately eight years prior to Onorato's alleged exposure\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court conducted a non-evidentiary hearing on the motion. At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court denied Highland's motion to dismiss. In its order, the trial court concluded that the plaintiffs had alleged sufficient jurisdictional facts to support the trial court's exercise of specific jurisdiction over Highland pursuant to section 48.193(1)(a), Florida Statutes, and to satisfy the constitutional due process requirements because Onorato \"testified to his use of and exposure to Highland Stucco products within the state of Florida,\" and that \"[the] product was purchased through distributors in Florida.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This Court reviews a trial court's ruling on a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Wendt v.

Section 48.193(1)(a) provides, in part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   A person, whether or not a citizen or resident of this state, who personally or through an agent does any of the acts enumerated in this subsection thereby submits himself or herself ... to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state for any cause of action arising from any of the following acts:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   1.

Because the complaint alleges that Highland committed a tortious act in Florida, thus satisfying specific jurisdiction under section 48.193(1)(a)(2), the burden shifted to Highland to contest the allegations by affidavit or other proof, or to claim that the federal minimum contacts requirement was not satisfied.\n   <em>\n    S. Wall Prods. Inc. v.

In his affidavit, Atkinson averred that Highland never transacted any business in Florida; never negotiated, entered into, or performed a contract in Florida; never owned, used, or possessed real property in Florida; never contracted to insure any person, property, or risk in Florida; never maintained a place of business in Florida; never registered to do business in Florida; never had a registered agent in Florida; never obtained bank accounts, offices, post office boxes, telephone numbers, or any other business facilities in Florida; and never advertised in any Florida publication, radio station, or television station. Atkinson's affidavit also states that Highland did not directly solicit business within Florida; had no connection with Florida arising from any action or conduct; never purposely directed conduct toward Florida; and never manufactured, distributed, sold, supplied or installed any asbestos-containing products in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because Highland adequately contested the allegations, the burden then shifted back to the plaintiffs to refute the evidence submitted by Highland.\n   <em>\n    Venetian Salami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7521612\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/554/499/#p502\">\n    554 So.2d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs conducted no jurisdictional discovery and the only evidence they submitted to rebut Atkinson's affidavit was: (1) an unauthenticated advertisement from a 1959 trade journal for Highland Hi-Sorb acoustical plaster distributed by Highland of Florida; (2) an unauthenticated article in the same 1959 trade journal that references a plant in Fort Lauderdale operated by Highland of Florida; and (3) testimony given by Atkinson in a 2000 California case. In the 2000 California case, Atkinson specifically testified that all of Highland's sales were made to building material dealers who would usually pick the products up at the plant. However, on occasion, Highland would deliver the products to the dealers, but this did not occur often because the company had only one truck and primarily sold to dealers within a sixty-mile radius of its plant in Van Nuys, California. Highland contends that nothing in Atkinson's testimony serves to refute the affidavit that Atkinson filed in this case. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Highland, the named defendant in this action, was a California corporation that dissolved in 2009. Highland of Florida, at best, was a Florida corporation that dissolved in 1964, approximately eight years before Onorato's alleged exposure to stucco products containing asbestos, and Onorato has failed to show any connection or relationship between the two corporations. Nothing in the record suggests that the two corporations shared a corporate identity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Further, even if the plaintiffs had established that the Florida entity was a subsidiary of Highland, the mere presence\n   of a subsidiary in Florida, without more, is insufficient to subject a non-Florida corporate parent to Florida's long-arm jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walt Disney Co. v.

More importantly, even if the plaintiffs had satisfied specific jurisdiction under Florida's long-arm jurisdiction, they still failed to establish that Highland, not Highland of Florida, had sufficient minimum contacts with Florida, such that extending jurisdiction does not offend constitutional due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Constitutional Due Process\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   While the statutory prong of the analysis is applied broadly, the constitutional prong is controlled by United States Supreme Court precedent interpreting the Due Process Clause and imposes a more restrictive requirement.\n   <em>\n    Execu-Tech Bus.

We, therefore, conclude that even if specific jurisdiction under Florida's long-arm jurisdiction was established, the plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of overcoming Highland's sworn affidavit and submitting evidence demonstrating that Highland's contacts with Florida are sufficient under the constitutional due process prong of the jurisdictional analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Highland submitted a very detailed affidavit in support of its motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction. Because the plaintiffs failed to satisfy their burden by presenting evidence as to how Highland's product(s) may have made their way to Florida and in what quantity, or that Highland directed its product into Florida for distribution, and it was undisputed that Highland was at all times a resident of California, with its principal place of business in California, and has never conducted business in Florida, advertised in a Florida publication, nor manufactured, sold, distributed, or supplied any products containing asbestos in Florida, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that Highland purposefully availed itself of the privilege of conducting business within the state such that it reasonably could have anticipated being haled into court in this state. The plaintiffs, therefore, failed to meet their burden of satisfying the constitutional due process prong of the personal jurisdiction analysis. Accordingly, we reverse the trial court's order denying Highland's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Reversed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    During the time of Onorato's alleged exposure, the statute was numbered as section 48.182, Florida Statutes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
