Cf. Munn v. Fla. Parole Comm'n,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9399622,9399599\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/807/733/\">\n    807 So. 2d 733\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1st DCA 2002). This denial is without prejudice to the petitioner to file a new petition for writ of mandamus if the postconviction court has not entered a final order on the motion within 90 days of the date of this order, provided that the petitioner is unrepresented by counsel in the postconviction proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <judges id=\"p-7\">\n   NORTHCUTT, CASANUEVA, and SALARIO, JJ., Concur.\n  </judges>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
