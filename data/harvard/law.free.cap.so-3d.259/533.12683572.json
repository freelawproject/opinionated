R.S. 14:43.1. For the reasons that follow, we affirm defendant's conviction and sentence, grant appellate counsel's motion to withdraw as counsel of record for defendant, and remand the matter for correction of the habitual offender Uniform Commitment Order as noted herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 11, 2015, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney filed a bill of information charging defendant, Howard Jackson, with one count of indecent behavior with a juvenile under thirteen years of age, in violation of La. R.S. 14:81. Defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment on December 14, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 22, 2017, the State amended the bill of information to charge defendant with one count of sexual battery, in violation of La. R.S. 14:43.1. Immediately following the amendment, defendant withdrew his plea of not guilty, and after being advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rights, pled guilty to the amended charge. In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced to ten years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court further advised defendant of his sex offender registration requirements, including his obligation to register as a sex offender for the remainder of his life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On that same day, the State filed a habitual offender bill of information alleging that defendant was a second felony offender. Defendant stipulated to the habitual offender bill after being advised of his rights. The trial court then vacated defendant's original sentence, and pursuant to the habitual offender bill stipulation, resentenced defendant as a second felony offender under La. R.S. 15:529.1 to twenty years imprisonment at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 19, 2018, defendant filed a motion to reconsider sentence which was denied by the trial court on January 25, 2018. On March 23, 2018, defendant filed a Uniform Application for Post-Conviction Relief (APCR), which the trial court construed as a request for an out-of-time appeal, which was granted on April 4, 2018. Defendant's appointed appellate counsel has now filed an appellate brief pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Anders v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    386 U.S. 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    87 S.Ct. 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182629\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/738/\">\n    18 L.Ed.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1967), and has further filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for defendant. Additionally, defendant has filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief challenging the charge brought against him, the voluntariness of his guilty\n   plea, and the alleged ineffectiveness of his counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because defendant's conviction was the result of a guilty plea, the facts underlying the crime of conviction are not fully developed in the record. Thus, the facts were gleaned from the factual basis provided by the State at the guilty plea proceeding where the State alleged that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   If the State proceeded to trial it would show beyond a reasonable doubt that on or between September 14th, 2015 and September 15, in the Year of Our Lord, Two Thousand and Fifteen, Mr. Jackson, while within the confines of Jefferson Parish did violate Louisiana Revised Statute 14:81, in that he, being over the age of seventeen and there being an age difference of greater than two years between the two, did commit a lewd and lascivious act upon or in the presence of a known juvenile, date of birth December 6, 2005, where the victim is under the age of thirteen, by fondling on the victim's breasts and/or pubic area with the intention of arousing or gratifying the sexual desires of either person.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   However, Judge, as I've already put on the record, we did, pursuant to a plea negotiation, amend the bill to 14:4[3].1, sexual battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <em>\n      ANDERS\n     </em>\n     BRIEF\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under the procedure adopted by this Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The request must be accompanied by \"a brief referring to anything in the record that might arguably support the appeal\" so as to provide the reviewing court \"with a basis for determining whether appointed counsel have fully performed their duty to support their clients' appeals to the best of their ability\" and to assist the reviewing court \"in making the critical determination whether the appeal is indeed so frivolous that counsel should be permitted to withdraw.\"\n   <em>\n    McCoy v.

The Supreme Court explained that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief must demonstrate by full discussion and analysis that appellate counsel \"has cast an advocate's eye over the trial record and considered whether any ruling made by the trial court, subject to the contemporaneous objection rule, had a significant, adverse impact on shaping the evidence presented to the jury for its consideration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11870799\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/241/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When conducting a review for compliance with\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   , an appellate court must conduct an independent review of the record to determine whether the appeal is wholly frivolous.\n   <em>\n    Bradford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n    676 So.2d at 1110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If, after an independent review, the reviewing court determines\n   there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, it may grant counsel's motion to withdraw and affirm the defendant's conviction and sentence. However, if the court finds any legal point arguable on the merits, it may either deny the motion and order the court-appointed attorney to file a brief arguing the legal point(s) identified by the court, or grant the motion and appoint substitute appellate counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436533\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/676/1108/#p1110\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant's appellate counsel asserts that after a detailed review of the record, she could find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal. Appellate counsel submits that defendant entered an unqualified guilty plea to the amended charge of sexual battery after being advised of his constitutional rights to a jury trial, to confront witnesses, and against self-incrimination. She indicates that defendant understood his rights and knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily waived them. She further maintains the trial court advised defendant of the sentencing range for the offense, as well as the sentence that would be imposed. Appellate counsel avers that defendant was sentenced pursuant to the plea agreement, precluding him from challenging his sentence on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Appellate counsel has filed a motion to withdraw as counsel of record for defendant which states she has made a conscientious and thorough review of the trial court record and can find no non-frivolous issues to raise on appeal and no rulings of the trial court which would arguably support the appeal. She further indicates that defendant has been notified regarding the filing of her motion to withdraw, as well as his right to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief in this appeal. Additionally, this Court sent defendant a letter by certified mail informing him that an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief had been filed and that he had until August 9, 2018 to file a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief. Defendant filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   supplemental brief signed on August 8, 2018 raising three assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State agrees with appellate counsel that, as shown by the record, the trial court conducted a\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy with defendant during which the rights he waived were thoroughly explained. The State asserts that defendant was fully advised of the sentence that would be imposed and that defendant's sentence was within the statutory limits. Finally, the State agrees with appellate counsel that defendant voluntarily and intelligently entered a plea of guilty and that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An independent review of the record supports appellate counsel's assertion that there are no non-frivolous issues to be raised on appeal. The amended bill of information properly charged defendant and plainly and concisely stated the essential facts constituting the charged offense. It also sufficiently identified defendant and the crime charged.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   La. C.Cr.P. arts. 464 - 466. As reflected by the minute entries, defendant appeared at each stage of the proceedings against him. As such, defendant's presence does not appear to present any issues that would support an appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Further, defendant pled guilty as charged to the amended bill of information; he also stipulated to being a second felony offender as alleged in the habitual offender bill. If a defendant pleads guilty, he normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    State v. Turner\n   </em>\n   , 09-1079 (La. App. 5 Cir. 7/27/10),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7038467\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/47/455/#p459\">\n    47 So.3d 455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459. Additionally, an unconditional plea, willingly and knowingly made, waives any and all non-jurisdictional defects and bars a defendant\n   from later asserting on appeal that the State failed to produce sufficient proof at the habitual offender hearing.\n   <em>\n    State v. Schaefer\n   </em>\n   , 97-465 (La. App. 5 Cir. 11/25/97),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11871677\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/704/300/#p304\">\n    704 So.2d 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 304.

Once a defendant is sentenced, only those guilty pleas that are constitutionally infirm may be withdrawn by appeal or post-conviction relief. A guilty plea is constitutionally infirm if it is not entered freely and voluntarily, if the\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   colloquy is inadequate, or when a defendant is induced to enter the plea by a plea bargain or what he justifiably believes was a plea bargain and that bargain is not kept.\n   <em>\n    State v. McCoil\n   </em>\n   , 05-658 (La. App. 5 Cir. 2/27/06),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8449925\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/924/1120/#p1124\">\n    924 So.2d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The record shows that defendant was aware that he was pleading guilty to one count of sexual battery in violation of La. R.S. 14:43.1. Defendant was also properly advised of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights. On the waiver of rights form and during the guilty plea colloquy, defendant was advised of his right to a jury trial, his right to confrontation, and his privilege against self-incrimination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant placed his signature at the end of the waiver of rights form indicating that he\n   understood he was waiving these rights and further affirmatively stated to the trial court during the colloquy that he understood that by pleading guilty he was waiving these rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant was also informed that his guilty plea could be used to enhance a penalty for any future conviction. Defendant indicated that he understood the possible legal consequences of pleading guilty and confirmed that he had not been forced, coerced, or intimidated into entering his guilty plea. Further, defendant was informed during the colloquy of the sentencing range for the offense, as well as the actual penalty that would be imposed upon acceptance of his guilty plea. He was also advised by the trial court and on the waiver of rights form that he must comply with all sex offender registration requirements provided by law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, a factual basis was given by the State for the charged offense, after which defendant confirmed that the factual basis provided was true and correct and was the reason for his guilty plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   After his colloquy with defendant, the trial judge accepted defendant's guilty plea as knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, a review of the habitual offender proceeding reveals that defendant was sufficiently advised of his habitual offender rights. The waiver of rights form, in conjunction with the colloquy between the trial judge and defendant, indicate that defendant understood that by stipulating to the allegations in the habitual offender bill, he was giving up his right to a hearing and his right to remain silent throughout the hearing. Defendant was also advised of the potential sentencing range as a second felony offender, as well as the actual sentence that would be imposed. Defendant indicated that he was satisfied with the way his attorney and the court had handled his case and that he had not been forced, coerced, or threatened into \"pleading guilty.\" Defendant further indicated that he understood the possible legal consequences of \"pleading guilty\" and wished to \"plead guilty.\" His stipulation was accepted by the judge as knowingly, intelligently, freely, and voluntarily made. By stipulating to the habitual offender bill, defendant waived his right to a hearing and to any possible non-jurisdictional defects. Defendant is barred from asserting on appeal that the State failed to produce sufficient proof at the habitual offender hearing when he waived the hearing.\n   <em>\n    Schaefer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, defendant's original sentence and enhanced sentence are within the sentencing ranges prescribed by the statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. R.S. 14:43.1 ; La. R.S. 15:529.1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, defendant's original and\n   enhanced sentences were imposed pursuant to and in conformity with the plea agreements. La. C.Cr.P. art. 881.2(A)(2) precludes a defendant from seeking review of his sentence imposed in conformity with a plea agreement, which was set forth in the record at the time of the plea.\n   <em>\n    State v.

R.S. 15:529.1, would resentence him to \"twenty years at hard labor in the Department of Corrections without benefit of probation, parole or suspension of sentence.\" Later, after defendant's guilty plea was accepted by the trial court and defendant's original sentence was imposed, during the stipulation to the habitual offender bill, the trial court informed defendant that if his stipulation was accepted, he would be sentenced to \"twenty years without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence\"-neglecting to state the requisite parole restriction previously advised with respect to the enhanced sentence. The transcript further reflects that after accepting defendant's stipulation to the habitual offender bill, the trial court vacated defendant's original sentence and resentenced him to twenty years at hard labor without the benefit of probation, parole, or suspension of sentence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant did not object to the restriction of parole when the trial judge sentenced him as a habitual offender. Moreover, the habitual offender waiver of rights form additionally provides, \"the sentence I will receive is 20 years without benefit of probation or suspension of sentence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Because defendant was advised at least once regarding the parole restriction required by law on his enhanced sentence, which was then ultimately imposed by the trial court, we find the trial court's failure to advise him a second time of the parole restriction that would be imposed on his enhanced sentence does not affect the voluntariness of his stipulation. Moreover, this Court, in conducting its\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   review, has consistently held that the failure of the trial court to advise a defendant that their sentence would be required to be served without benefits does not affect the voluntariness of the guilty plea or habitual offender stipulation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

However, the court went on to also note that the defendant was advised at the plea hearing of the correct sentencing range by the court and was actually sentenced to the minimum penalty under the statute. Thus, the court held defendant received a legal sentence and was not prejudiced by the error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Here, as previously discussed, the record reflects that the trial court advised defendant of his\n   <em>\n    Boykin\n   </em>\n   rights as well as his habitual offender rights and that defendant indicated his willingness to plead guilty and stipulate to the habitual offender bill throughout the colloquy. Based on the record as a whole, there was no inducement regarding the restrictions of benefits in this case on the enhanced sentence, nor were there any assurances regarding the restrictions of benefits that were crucial to defendant's stipulation. Also, unlike\n   <em>\n    Burford\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    LaFleur\n   </em>\n   , defendant was informed by the trial court during the colloquy that his enhanced sentence would be without benefits and the sentence imposed was in conformity with the trial court's advisal, which did not draw an objection by defendant at the plea hearing or in a motion to withdraw guilty plea.

He claims that he should have been charged with violating his \"registration order for being around juveniles\" and then later should have been charged with sexual battery. He maintains that it was impermissible for the State to\n   charge him with sexual battery without first charging him with \"breaking the law for being around juveniles at his home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, as previously noted, defendant pled guilty as charged to the amended bill of information which properly charged him. No motions to quash were lodged by defendant. If a defendant pleads guilty, he normally waives all non-jurisdictional defects in the proceedings leading up to the guilty plea, and precludes review of such defects either by appeal or post-conviction relief.\n   <em>\n    Turner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .

La. C.Cr.P. art. 61 provides, in pertinent part: \"[T]he district attorney has entire charge and control of every criminal prosecution instituted or pending in his district, and determines whom, when, and how he shall prosecute.\" Thus, under La. C.Cr.P. art. 61, the State has the discretion to decide the cases to prosecute. Accordingly, there is no support for defendant's contention that the State should have charged him with a violation of his \"registration order\" prior to instituting prosecution for the amended offense of sexual battery.

Additionally, at the conclusion of the colloquy, the trial court confirmed with defense counsel that he had in fact advised defendant of his rights, including his right against self-incrimination, and whether he was satisfied that defendant entered his plea of guilty knowing all of the consequences.
