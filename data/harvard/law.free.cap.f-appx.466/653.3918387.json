(\u201cSeagate\u201d) appeals and its insurers, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, PA (\u201cNational\u201d), American International Underwriters Insurance Company (\u201cAIU\u201d), and American International Specialty Lines Company (\u201cAISLIC\u201d), cross appeal the district court\u2019s September 2, 2010 Judgment Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) and the orders that underlie the judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We reverse the district court\u2019s rulings that AIU owed a duty to defend and that the other insurers\u2019 duty to defend terminated. We affirm all remaining issues appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-17\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo.\u201d <em>Hudson Ins. Co. v. Colony Ins. Co., </em>624 F.3d 1264, 1266 (9th Cir.2010). In addition, a district court\u2019s interpretation of state law is reviewed de novo. <em>Trishan Air, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>635 F.3d 422, 426-27 (9th Cir.2011). \u201cWhen interpreting state law, federal courts are bound by decisions of the state\u2019s highest court. In the absence of such a decision, a federal court must predict how the highest state court would decide the issue using intermediate appellate court decisions, decisions from other jurisdictions, statutes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>treatises, and restatements as guidance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 427 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">1. \u201c[A] liability insurer owes a broad duty to defend,\u201d which arises under California law when \u201ca suit [ ] <em>potentially </em>seeks damages within the coverage of the policy.\u201d <em>Horace Mann Ins. Co. v. Barbara B., </em>4 Cal.4th 1076, 17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d 792, 795 (1998) (citation omitted). In fact, the duty to defend is so broad that it only requires \u201ca bare \u2018potential\u2019 or \u2018possibility\u2019 of coverage as the trigger of a defense duty.\u201d <em>Montrose Chem. Co. v. Superior Court, </em>6 Cal.4th 287, 24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d 1153, 1160 (1993). \u201cThe determination whether the insurer owes a duty to defend usually is made in the first instance by comparing the allegations of the complaint with the terms of the policy.\u201d <em>Horace Mann, </em>17 Cal.Rptr.2d 210, 846 P.2d at 795. Any doubt, as to whether a duty to defend is triggered, is resolved in favor of the insured. <em>See id. </em>at 796. Here, the complaint in the underlying action alleges that Seagate falsely claims that its technology is equivalent to Convolve Inc.\u2019s technology. Because the duty to defend is broad and the complaint creates a bare potential of coverage for disparagement, the district court did not err in concluding that the underlying complaint potentially created liability for disparagement thereby giving National and AISLIC a duty to defend Seagate.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">2. \u201c[W]e generally will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal, although we have discretion to do so.\u201d <em>In re Am. W. Airlines, Inc., </em>217 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2000). Here, the issue, whether AIU had a duty to defend even though it is an excess (or secondary) insurer, was considered by the district court and not waived by AIU. In the district court, Seagate argued that, even though the primary insurers\u2019 policy limits were not exhausted, AIU still owed a duty to defend. The district court also acknowledged the issue by specifically explaining why AIU had a duty to defend even though (a) it was a secondary insurer; (b) the primary insurers did not defend; and (c) the prayer for relief in the underlying action exceeds the policy limits of both primary insurers.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">AIU is an excess insurer. Even if the underlying complaint potentially creates liability for an insurer, an excess or secondary insurer has no duty to defend if the primary insurer\u2019s policy limits have not been exhausted. <em>Cmty. Redevelopment Agency v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>50 Cal.App.4th 329, 57 Cal.Rptr.2d 755, 759-60 (Ct.App.1996). This rule holds true even if the potential liability exceeds the policy limits, <em>Diamond Heights Homeowners Ass\u2019n. v. Nat\u2019l Am. Ins. Co., </em>227 Cal.App.3d 563, 277 Cal.Rptr. 906, 914 (Ct.App.1991), or the primary insurer refuses to defend, <em>see Ticor Title Ins. Co. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>40 Cal.App.4th 1699, 48 Cal.Rptr.2d 368, 374 (Ct.App.1995). Thus, the district court erred in concluding that AIU owed a duty to defend to Seagate, because it is a secondary insurer and the primary insurers\u2019 (National and AISLIC) policy limits have not been exhausted. Further, even though Sea-gate\u2019s potential liability exceeds the primary insurers\u2019 policy limits and the primary insurers refused to defend, AIU owes no duty to defend. For these reasons, the claims against AIU are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">3. The duty to defend continues \u201cuntil [the insurers] can conclusively refute th[e] potential\u201d that liability will arise under the policies. <em>Montrose, </em>24 Cal.Rptr.2d 467, 861 P.2d at 1160. Here, the insurers did not meet their high burden. While this is a close issue, the district court erred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>in ruling that the duty to defend terminated, because, while Convolve made representations to prevent Seagate\u2019s insurers from intervening in the underlying action, the statements did not conclusively refute the potential for a disparagement claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">4. An insurer acts in bad faith only when \u201cthe reason for withholding\u201d a defense was \u201cunreasonable or without proper cause.\u201d <em>Love v. Fire Ins. Exch., </em>221 Cal.App.8d 1186, 271 CaL.Rptr. 246, 255 (Ct.App.1990). \u201cThe mere denial of benefits, however, does not demonstrate bad faith.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>783 F.2d 762, 766 (9th Cir.1985). Here, although a duty to defend existed (based on the allegations in the complaint), that alone does not make the insurers\u2019 denial of a defense unreasonable. Moreover, the insurers investigated the claims, compared the allegations to the insurance policy, and concluded that there was no potential liability. This conclusion is not unreasonable. The district court accurately described the case as a close case regarding the duty to defend. The district court held that the complaint did not trigger a duty to defend, but later reconsidered and held that the complaint did trigger a duty to defend. The district court thereafter terminated the same duty based on facts alleged to have happened after the complaint was filed. Thus, although the insurers\u2019 denial of a defense was erroneous, the insurers did not withhold a defense unreasonably or without proper cause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">5. Seagate argues that it is entitled to punitive damages; however, because there is no bad faith denial of a defense, an argument for punitive damages does not need to be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">6. \u201cWhere there is a duty to defend, there <em>may </em>be a duty to indemnify; but where there is no duty to defend, there <em>cannot </em>be a duty to indemnify.\u201d <em>Certain Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s of London v. Superior Court, </em>24 Cal.4th 945, 103 Cal.Rptr.2d 672, 16 P.3d 94, 102 (2001). Because we have concluded that the duty to defend did not terminate, there may be a duty to indemnify. Accordingly, the district court properly concluded that the question of indemnity is not ripe for consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">7. Prejudgment interest under California Civil Code \u00a7 3287 is appropriate when the amount owed is certain or capable of calculation. Invoices allow damages to be capable of being made certain by calculation. <em>See Marine Terminals Corp. v. Paceco, Inc., </em>145 Cal.App.3d 991, 193 Cal. Rptr. 687, 690 (Ct.App.1983). Thus, the district court did not err in determining that interest is to be calculated from the invoice dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">8. Because the complaint tendered by Seagate triggered the duty to defend, the district court did not err in finding AISLIC liable for interest related to the period prior to Seagate\u2019s tender of Convolve\u2019s interrogatory response.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">The parties shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>AFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b678-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b678-18\">. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b680-5\">. Seagate sought additional discovery regarding bad faith in order to identify its insurers\u2019 subjective intent and to prevent summary judgment. However, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying discovery under Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedures. See <em>VISA Intern. Serv. Ass'n v. Bankcard Holders of Am., </em>784 F.2d 1472, 1475 (9th Cir.1986). First, the subjective intent of the insurer is irrelevant for determining bad faith. <em>Bosetti v. U.S. Life Ins. Co., </em>175 Cal.App.4th 1208, 96 Cal.Rptr.3d 744, 769 (Ct.App.2009). Second, Seagate failed to show how additional discovery would preclude summary judgment. <em>See Qualls v. Blue Cross of Cal, Inc., </em>22 F.3d 839, 844 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
