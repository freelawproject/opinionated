Burchett argues the district court improperly weighed his direct testimony evidence \u2014 that Bromps violated the Establishment Clause by imposing an improper oral condition on Burchett\u2019s parole (limiting the denomination of church Burchett could attend) \u2014 against contrary evidence produced by Bromps. Burchett argues that the district court should have treated his testimony as true in considering Bromps\u2019 motion for summary judgment. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-15\">Ordinarily a district court may not weigh direct evidence presented by the nonmoving party against evidence presented by the moving party. <em>T.W. Elec. Serv., Inc. v. Pacific Elec. Contractors Ass\u2019n, </em>809 F.2d 626, 631 (9th Cir.1987). It must accept a non-moving party\u2019s direct evidence as true, <em>id, </em>and generally may not disregard direct evidence on the basis that it is implausible or incredible. <em>See McLaughlin v. Liu, </em>849 F.2d 1205, 1207-08 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-16\">Nonetheless, \u201c[c]onclusory allegations unsupported by factual data will not create a triable issue of fact\u201d allowing a party to survive a summary judgment motion. <em>Marks v. United States, </em>578 F.2d 261, 263 (9th Cir.1978). \u201cThe mere existence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiffs position will be insufficient.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Here, Burchett merely averred, in a single statement in a deposition, that Bromps told him he could not attend a Seventh Day Adventist church while on parole. Burchett did not bolster this bare allegation with any supporting facts or evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Self-serving affidavits may be cognizable on motions for summary judgment if they go beyond conclusions and include facts that would be admissible in evidence, <em>see United States v. Shumway, </em>199 F.3d 1093, 1103-04 (9th Cir.1999), but \u201ca conclusory, self-serving affidavit, lacking detailed facts and any supporting evidence, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact,\u201d <em>FTC v. Publ\u2019g Clearing House, Inc., </em>104 F.3d 1168, 1171 (9th Cir.1997); <em>see also Rodriguez v. Airborne Express, </em>265 F.3d 890, 902 (9th Cir. 2001) (summary judgment inappropriate where plaintiff set forth facts directly relevant to claim with \u201cgreat specificity\u201d); <em>McLaughlin, </em>849 F.2d at 1206 (nonmoving party survived summary judgment where he relied on sworn affidavit that included specific factual averments, sworn answers to interrogatories, and payroll documentation supporting his factual allegations).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Thus, Burchett could not survive summary judgment without setting forth some detailed facts or other evidence to support his conclusory claim, <em>see Taylor v. List, </em>880 F.2d 1040, 1045 (9th Cir.1989), especially where he bore the burden of proof on that claim at trial, <em>cf. T.W. Elec. Serv., </em>809 F.2d at 632 n. 3 (\u201cthe [summary judgment] inquiry focuses on whether the non-moving party has come forward with sufficiently \u2018specific\u2019 facts from which to draw reasonable inferences about other material facts that are necessary elements of the nonmoving party\u2019s claim,\u201d in light of that party\u2019s burden of proof).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">Accordingly, because we may affirm on any basis fairly supported by the record, <em>Corrie v. Caterpillar, Inc., </em>503 F.3d 974, 979 (9th Cir.2007), the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-6\">. For example, Burchett has never alleged he was denied permission to attend church on the basis of the church\u2019s denomination, and undisputed records show that the condition he claims was placed on him was never made a part of his official parole conditions. Further, Burchett has not alleged he was actually deterred in any way from attending a church of his choosing. Nor could he, as he does not dispute that he attended church services at locations he chose on several occasions \u2014 albeit without the lawfully required permission of his parole officer \u2014 and that he was not disciplined for attending any particular church rather than another. Nor has Burchett ever sought additional discovery, and he has never argued \u2014 to the district court or to us \u2014 that he had or expected to find any additional facts supporting his claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\">. Accordingly, we do not reach Burchett\u2019s only remaining argument \u2014 that remand to a different judge is necessary \u2014 nor Bromps\u2019 contention that his actions in imposing parole conditions were entitled to quasi-judicial immunity. We also deny as moot Burchett\u2019s motion for supplemental briefing on the question of damages sustained.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b631-11\">BEA, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AfC\">concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-12\">I agree with the Memorandum Disposition\u2019s result affirming the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Robert Bromps. I write separately to emphasize that I believe summary judgment was properly granted solely because of the absence of a <em>genuine </em>issue of material fact in this case, a ground accented as additional and secondary by the majority\u2019s disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>This case is properly resolved solely on the grounds that Burchett relates a statement of Bromps which makes no sense. Bromps\u2019s alleged statement is contrary to common sense and, indeed, counterintuitive, since the purpose of limiting Burchett\u2019s visits were to prevent Burchett from being near children. Since both the Seventh Day Adventist church and the Assembly of God church have children present, the statement does not make sense. Put another way, no reasonable jury could have believed the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The only reasonable basis upon which such a statement would be made is that Bromps disfavored Seventh Day Adventists and favored the Assembly of God. However, there is absolutely no evidence of that attitude and a great deal of evidence showing the absence of any such attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">If \u201cgenuine\u201d under <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, </em>477 U.S. 242, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986), is to have any meaning as a limiting concept, it must be to require there be <em>some </em>reasonable explanation supporting that the claimed fact \u2014 in this case, Bromps\u2019s statement \u2014 existed. Here, there is not only no reasonable explanation why Bromps might have said what Burchett testified to, but every reason to think he would <em>not </em>say that.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Therefore, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
