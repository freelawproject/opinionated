Schoppert, which denied his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>See In re Chao Chen, </em>No. A094 915 895 (B.I.A. February 23, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A094 915 895 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 25, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-13\">Under the circumstances of this case, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-14\">For asylum applications governed by the amendments made to the Immigration and Nationality Act by the REAL ID Act of 2005, an IJ may base a credibility finding on the applicant\u2019s \u201cdemeanor, candor, or responsiveness,\u201d the plausibility of the applicant\u2019s account, and inconsistencies in the applicant\u2019s statements, without regard to whether they go \u201cto the heart of the applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>see Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008). We will \u201cdefer ... to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make\u201d such a finding. <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">In this case, the IJ reasonably found Chen to lack credibility based on inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s asylum application and testimony, inconsistencies within Chen\u2019s testimony, and inconsistencies between Chen\u2019s testimony and the testimony of his corroborating witness. Chen indicated in his asylum application that he was born on April 7,1987, then testified that he was born on April 8, 1987. Chen stated in his asylum application that he was questioned by police about his uncle in February 2006, initially testified that he was questioned in February 2005, and later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>revised his testimony to state that he was questioned in February 2006. Chen initially testified that he was baptized on April 8, 2006, but later indicated that he was baptized in April 2007. Chen testified that he had last seen his corroborating witness several weeks before his hearing, while the witness testified that he had spoken with Chen at church the day before the hearing. These were all proper grounds for an adverse credibility finding. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(12)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">The IJ also properly based his adverse credibility finding on Chen\u2019s demeanor at the hearing. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii). Specifically, the IJ found that Chen appeared to be \u201creciting a story that he had memorized and not testifying about events that he had actually lived through.\u201d Addendum to Pet\u2019s\u2019s Br. at 32. We generally defer to such a demeanor finding and do so here. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The BIA\u2019s decision addressed both the inconsistencies and Chen\u2019s demeanor. The BIA also properly concluded that Chen failed to introduce sufficient corroborating evidence to rehabilitate his credibility. <em>See Biao Yang v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir.2007). Given the totality of the circumstances, including the inconsistencies, Chen\u2019s demeanor, and the lack of sufficient corroborating evidence, we conclude that the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(B)(iii); <em>Xiu Xia Lin, </em>534 <em>F.3d </em>at 167. As the only basis for Chen\u2019s withholding of removal and CAT claims also depended on his credibility, the adverse credibility determination is also dispositive of those claims. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, 444 </em>F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
