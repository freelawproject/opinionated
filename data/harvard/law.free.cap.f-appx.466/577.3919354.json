As the facts and procedural history are familiar to the parties, we do not recite them here except as necessary to explain our disposition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">The district court correctly dismissed Hill\u2019s claims under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, codified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-2000d-7, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 for a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Hill has failed to \u201cshow that actions of the defendants had a discriminatory impact, and that defendants acted with an intent or purpose to discriminate based upon [Hill\u2019s] membership in a protected class.\u201d <em>Darensburg v. Metro. Transp. Comm\u2019n, </em>636 F.3d 511, 522 (9th Cir.2011) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The decision not to renew Hill\u2019s subcontract was part of a larger plan to improve the financial performance of the airport\u2019s concessions. SER 52-60. Similarly, defendants rejected Hill\u2019s request for an advertising sign out of concern for public safety. SER 48, 323-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Nor has Hill demonstrated that the defendants violated her equal protection rights under the California Constitution. California\u2019s \u201cconstitutional guarantee of equal protection is substantially similar to that contained in the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Pro-Family Advocates v. Gomez, </em>46 Cal.App.4th 1674, 1685 n. 13, 54 Cal.Rptr.2d 600 (1996). For the reasons stated above, Hill\u2019s state equal protection claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The district court also correctly rejected Hill\u2019s claim for a writ of mandate under Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1085 to compel the defendants to comply with federal regulations involving disadvantaged business enterprises in airports, 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 23.1-23.79, 26.7. Cal.Civ.Proc.Code \u00a7 1085 authorizes only state courts to issue writs of mandate. Moreover, Hill has not demonstrated that the county\u2019s Airport Concession Disadvantaged Business Enterprises program fails to comply with the federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">Because we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to all defendants, we need not decide whether the county is liable for the actions of defendant G. Hardy Aeree.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b602-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
