TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b780-17\">Teodor Marian appeals the dismissal of his pro se suit against Socorro Electric Cooperative of New Mexico and the denial of his application to proceed in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-18\">Socorro turned off the electricity to Marian\u2019s summer home in New Mexico for failure to pay his electric bill, and Marian sued Socorro; a number of the company\u2019s employees; the New Mexico Housing Department; employees of that department; and employees of the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program: He alleges violations of: (1) the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) the Freedom of Information Act; (3) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 8624, governing the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program; (4) the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution; and (5) the New Mexico Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-19\">The district court denied Marian\u2019s application and his claims, finding that he had failed to allege a federal claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s decision to dismiss an IFP complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Kay v. Bemis, </em>500 F.3d 1214, 1217 (10th Cir.2007). \u201cIn determining whether a dismissal is proper, we must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and construe those allegations, and any reasonable inferences that might be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Gaines v. Stenseng, </em>292 F.3d 1222, 1224 (10th Cir.2002). \u201c[I]n order to succeed on a motion to proceed IFP, the movant must show a financial inability to pay the required filing fees, as well as the existence of a reasoned, non-frivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised in the action.\u201d <em>Lister v. Dep\u2019t. of the Treasury, </em>408 F.3d 1309, 1312 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">On appeal, Marin argues the district court violated his right to due process and followed improper procedures in undertaking a review of his complaint \u201csua sponte\u201d to determine whether it was frivolous. He appears to be confusing the procedural rules governing the imposition of sanctions for frivolous complaints under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 38 with the procedural rules governing motions to proceed IFP under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii). A motion to proceed IFP requires the court to determine \u201cthe existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised in the action.\u201d <em>Lister, </em>408 F.3d at 1312. The district court\u2019s inquiry was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">After conducting our own review of the record, we agree with the district court for substantially the same reasons. Marian has no valid claim based on his California residency or based on any of the statutes identified in his complaint. <em>Marian v. Socorro Electric Cooperative of New Mexico, </em>No. 11cv970 RB/WDS (D. New Mexico, Nov. 29, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">The Appellant\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED. The Appellant\u2019s Motion for recusal of Judge Robert C. Brack and Appellant\u2019s Motion to Recall the Improper Final Judgment are likewise DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-21\">. Marian argues that we have diversity jurisdiction over his state law contract claims because he is a citizen of California and Socorro is a New Mexico utility cooperative. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>amount in controversy in this suit, however, is far under the required $75,000, which is more than the New Mexico property is worth and far more than Marian owes on his electric bill. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
