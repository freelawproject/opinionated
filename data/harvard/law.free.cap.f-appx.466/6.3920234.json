R.App. P. 34(f); D.C. Cir. R. 34(j). The Court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. R. 36(d). For the reasons stated below, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">Central Iowa Hospital Corporation submitted a claim for reimbursement of losses resulting from the merger of two predecessor entities, Iowa Lutheran Hospital and Iowa Methodist Medical Center. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395f(b)(1); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.134(a). The Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services denied the claim in an order dated December 8, 2006. The Administrator\u2019s order became the final decision of the Secretary, which the district court upheld. <em>Cent. Iowa Hosp. Corp. v. </em>Sebelius, 762 F.Supp.2d 49 (D.D.C.2011). Central Iowa appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-12\">Binding precedent forecloses all but one of Central Iowa\u2019s arguments. <em>See Forsyth Mem\u2019l Hosp., Inc. v. Sebelius, </em>639 F.3d 534 (D.C.Cir.2011), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>652 F.3d 42, <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 132 S.Ct. 1107, 181 L.Ed.2d 980 (2012); <em>St. Luke\u2019s Hosp. v. Sebelius, </em>611 F.3d 900 (D.C.Cir.2010). The sole remaining question is whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(f). We have no doubt that it is. Medicare regulations state that losses arising from a statutory merger, like the one at issue here, are reimbursable only if the transaction is a \u201cbona fide sale\u201d for \u201creasonable consideration.\u201d <em>St. Luke\u2019s, </em>611 F.3d at 903. Iowa Lutheran exchanged more than $60 million in assets for $28.1 million in debt relief when it merged with Iowa Methodist. Further, Iowa Lutheran did not secure a pre-merger appraisal of its property or place its assets for sale on the open market. The Secretary\u2019s conclusion that the merger was not a \u201cbona fide sale\u201d therefore is supported by substantial evidence. None of Central Iowa\u2019s arguments to the contrary have merit. <em>See Forsyth, </em>639 F.3d at 538-39 (rejecting similar evidentiary claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">Because the Secretary\u2019s \u201cbona fide sale\u201d determination was a sufficient ground for denying Central Iowa\u2019s reimbursement claim, we do not reach the parties\u2019 additional contentions regarding arm\u2019s length bargaining and related party status.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
