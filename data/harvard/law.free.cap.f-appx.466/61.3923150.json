POOLER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b85-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">Sayed Nooralishah Shenghur appeals from his conviction following a jury trial in district court. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts of the case and the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-19\">\u201cWe uphold a district court\u2019s finding of competence [to stand trial] unless that finding is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. Gigante, </em>166 F.3d 75, 83-84 (2d Cir.1999). \u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-20\">In light of the opinion regarding Shenghur\u2019s competence provided by the government\u2019s expert witness, we are unable to conclude that the district court\u2019s determination that Shenghur was competent to stand trial was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-21\">Furthermore, we decline to rule on Shenghur\u2019s claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (\u201c[I]n most cases a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective assistance.\u201d); <em>see also id. </em>at 505, 123 S.Ct. 1690 (\u201c[I]neffectiveassistance claims ordinarily will be litigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">While we have \u201centertained ineffective assistance claims for the first time on direct appeal when their resolution is beyond any doubt or to do so would be in the interest of justice,\u201d <em>United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 100 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted), \u201cthis court has expressed a baseline aversion to resolving ineffectiveness claims on direct review,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 99 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Here, we see no reason to deprive the district court of the opportunity to assess the merits of Shenghur\u2019s ineffective assistance claim in the first instance, if such a claim were to be brought on collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 506, 123 S.Ct. 1690 (noting that a trial \u201cjudge, having observed the earlier trial, should have an advantageous perspective for determining the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s conduct and whether any deficiencies were prejudicial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, and Shenghur\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance is DISMISSED without prejudice to his raising such a claim in a motion under Section 2255.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
