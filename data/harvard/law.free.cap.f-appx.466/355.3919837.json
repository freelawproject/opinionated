He seeks to appeal the dismissal of his complaint that O\u2019Neal Jones, Jr. committed land fraud. The district court dismissed the suit without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) because Reedom failed to appear for a docket call to report the status of his case or show good cause why his case should have remained on the district court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-24\">Reedom\u2019s IFP motion challenging the certification decision \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-25\">Reedom has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his complaint for failure to prosecute. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 41(b); <em>McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988). Additionally, Reedom has not addressed the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. Thus, he has failed to show that his appeal is taken in good faith. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
