He argues that the district court plainly erred by entering a judgment that reflected a conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) when he did not have a prior conviction that qualified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). Although he concedes that his sentence does not exceed the applicable statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and was within the applicable guidelines range, Romero-Sanchez argues that the district court\u2019s mistaken belief that the statutory maximum sentence was 20 years of imprisonment may have influenced the selection of a sentence. He requests that the matter be remanded for resentencing. The Government concedes error but seeks to have the judgment modified to reflect a conviction under \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Because Romero-Sanchez did not object in the district court on this ground, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, a defendant must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). We have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Romero-Sanchez\u2019s previous Florida conviction for which he received a sentence of two years of probation is not an aggravated felony for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). As both parties agree, the district court erred in entering a judgment reflecting that Romero-Sanchez was convicted under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 368-69 (5th Cir.2009). However, there is no evidence in the record that the district court\u2019s sentence was influenced by an incorrect understanding of the statutory maximum sentence. Additionally, Romero-Sanchez\u2019s sentence was below the 10-year statutory maximum of \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and was within the correct guidelines range. He does not show that his substantial rights were affected by the district court\u2019s error. <em>See MondragonSantiago, </em>564 F.3d at 369.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The judgment is the district court is AFFIRMED but REFORMED to reflect a conviction and sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b364-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
