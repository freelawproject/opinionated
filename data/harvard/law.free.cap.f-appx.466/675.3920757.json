We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1056 (9th Cir.2009). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-21\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Kurniawan\u2019s experiences of mistreatment, including incidents of robbery and assault, rose to the level of persecution. <em>See id. </em>at 1059-60 (\u201cdiscriminatory mistreatment\u201d of Indonesian Chinese Christian, including beatings and robberies and being accosted by a hostile mob, did not compel a finding of past persecution); <em>Nagoulko v. INS, </em>333 F.3d 1012, 1016-18 (9th Cir.2003) (finding it \u201csignificant\u201d in circumstances of case that petitioner \u201cnever suffered any significant physical violence\u201d and concluding record did not compel a finding of past persecution). Further, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Kurniawan failed to establish an individualized risk of persecution, even under disfavored-group analysis. <em>See Halim v. Holder, </em>590 F.3d 971, 979 (9th Cir.2009) (petitioner failed to show he was individually targeted or likely to be individually targeted where he \u201cfailed to offer any evidence that distinguishes his exposure from those of all other ethnic Chinese Indonesians\u201d); <em>cf. Sael v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 922, 927-29 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>2004). Accordingly, Kurniawan\u2019s asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Because Kurniawan failed to meet the lower standard of proof for asylum, his claim for withholding of removal necessarily fails. <em>See Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1190 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b700-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
