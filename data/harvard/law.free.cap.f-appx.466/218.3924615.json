Heaphy, United States Attorney, Roanoke, Virginia, for Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b244-14\">Before NIEMEYER, GREGORY, and AGEE, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b244-15\">Affirmed by unpublished PER CURIAM opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b244-16\">Unpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b244-17\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">Douglas Stallworth and Bruce Baumgardner were convicted as participants in a large drug-trafficking conspiracy in Bristol, Virginia, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A). In addition, Baumgardner was convicted of maintaining a place for the purpose of distributing drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1). Because each defendant had two prior felony drug convictions, the district court sentenced each to life imprisonment, in accordance with 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">On appeal, Stallworth and Baumgardner challenge both their convictions and sentences, assigning numerous errors. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>i</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">At some time during the 2001-2003 period, Derek Evans, a long-time distributor of crack cocaine, moved from Johnson City, Tennessee, to the Bristol, Virginia/Bristol, Tennessee area (\u201cBristol\u201d) because the drug market in Johnson City had become \u201ctoo congested.\u201d Stallworth told Evans, it would be \u201ca lot easier\u201d in Bristol because the market was \u201cwide open\u201d and there was \u201cno territorial situation\u201d with which to contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">After Evans moved to Bristol, he together with Bryant Pride, Kerry Lee, and Oedipus Mumphrey headed up a large cocaine distribution operation. For several months in 2005 or 2006, Evans and Lee brought into the area as much as five kilograms of cocaine at a time. And during the period of 2005 to 2007, Mumphrey also supplied Evans with cocaine, making deliveries every week to ten days of up to three kilograms at a time. Evans, Pride, and Mumphrey developed networks, distribution points, and sub-distributors. Evans testified that the conspiracy would purchase a kilogram of cocaine for around $25,000 and then would cook it into crack cocaine, which members were able to sell for between $36,000 and $42,000. He also testified that the conspiracy had from 350 to 500 customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">On March 28, 2008, 51 persons were indicted and charged with conspiracy to traffic in 50 grams or more of crack cocaine and 500 grams or more of cocaine powder, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A). Stallworth and Baumgardner were named as two of the conspirators, and, in addition, Baumgardner was charged with maintaining a place for the purpose of distributing illegal drugs, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 856(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">A jury convicted Stallworth and Baumgardner of the conspiracy charge and Baumgardner of the charge of maintaining a place for drug distribution. Because each defendant had at least two previous felony drug convictions, the court sentenced each to the statutorily mandated minimum sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">Stallworth and Baumgardner filed appeals, each challenging aspects of their convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">Stallworth and Baumgardner contend that the evidence was insufficient to convict them of conspiracy. They acknowledge that the evidence shows that they were addicts and customers of the conspiracy, but they argue that a buyer/seller relationship between them and members of the conspiracy does not establish participation in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">We agree that evidence of a simple buyer/seller relationship is insufficient to support a conspiracy conviction. More is required. As we stated in <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc), to be part of a conspiracy a defendant must knowingly and voluntarily become part of the conspiracy. \u201cOnly a slight connection need be made linking a defendant to the conspiracy to support a conspiracy conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">In this case, Stallworth and Baumgardner do not take issue with the fact that Evans, Pride, Lee, and Mumphrey headed up a large cocaine distribution conspiracy in the Bristol area. Rather, they argue that the evidence shows only that they were simply customers of that operation and not co-conspirators. In making that argument, however, they overlook several items that were proved at trial. It was Stallworth who persuaded Evans to bring his drug distribution business to Bristol because the market was wide open there. Once Evans established his operation in Bristol, he saw Stallworth virtually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>every day that the two were out of prison. More importantly, Stallworth assisted Evans by arranging drug transactions and also acted as a street-level distributor. Evans testified, \u201c[Stallworth] called me up. I mean, you know, I seen him about every day. I talked to him, you know, we kick it. He knows people that wants something, wants to get high, I got what they need to get high, so that\u2019s the kind of relationship we had. He would come see me, holler at me, I hit him, and that\u2019s it.\u201d Summarizing the arrangement Evans stated, \u201cWhen people wanted to get high, they would call [Stallworth] and he would call me, and I would hook-up with [Stallworth], and then he goes serve them.\u201d Moreover, the record shows a continuous stream of transactions in which Stallworth bought from Evans three to seven days a week, frequently in distribution quantities. Further, several witnesses testified to buying drugs from Stallworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">The record reflects much of the same involvement on the part of Baumgardner. He too was a street-level distributor, perhaps selling even more extensively than Stallworth. One of the conspirators, Paul Vaughn, testified that Baumgardner bought a quarter-ounce of crack (roughly 7 grams) from Mumphrey three-to-four times per <em>day </em>in 2007. He was moving so much cocaine that he was known as \u201cVIP.\u201d Numerous witnesses testified to buying drugs from Baumgardner, especially at his residence, which was used as a distribution point for cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">As the district court concluded, \u201cIn sum, the evidence showed that Baumgardner and Stallworth frequently bought crack from high-level members of the Evans drug organization and sold it to various users on multiple occasions. This certainly qualifies as more than \u2018evidence of a buy-sell transaction.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>United States v. Mills, </em>995 F.2d 480, 485 n. 1 (4th Cir.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">In addition, Stallworth contends that the evidence did not support the jury\u2019s finding that he was involved in distributing at least 50 grams of crack cocaine. But again, this overlooks the evidence. Evans testified that he sold half-gram, gram, and \u201ceight-ball\u201d (roughly 3.5 grams) quantities to Stallworth three times a week whenever the two were both out of jail. Vaughn testified that he witnessed Stallworth purchasing a quarter-ounce from Mumphrey, and Lee testified that he witnessed Stallworth buy from \u201can eight-ball to a quarter.\u201d In view of the testimony that Stallworth was buying and reselling eight-balls and quarter-ounces of crack cocaine regularly over a period of years, the jury had ample evidence from which to conclude that the amount totaled at least 50 grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">While it is not clear whether Baumgardner is challenging the sufficiency of evidence to support his distribution of 50 grams, the evidence was yet stronger than that for Stallworth. Conspirator Paul Vaughn testified that Baumgardner bought a quarter-ounce three to four times per <em>day </em>during a period in 2007. At that rate, 50 grams was achieved in only three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">Finally, Baumgardner contends that the evidence was insufficient to show that he maintained a place for the purpose of distributing controlled substances. Baumgardner concedes that crack cocaine was sold from his residence, but he contends that the evidence does not establish that \u201cthe sole, primary and/or exclusive \u2018purpose\u2019 for maintaining the residence ... was for the \u2018purpose\u2019 of distribution of illegal drugs.\u201d The case law, however, unanimously construes \u00a7 856(a)(1) as not requiring that a residence be maintained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number><em>exclusively </em>for the distribution of drugs. Obviously, if the defendant lives in the residence, it also has the purpose of housing him. Rather, the defendant must have the distribution of drugs as a specific purpose for the residence, which is more than a mere collateral purpose. <em>See United States v. Soto-Silva, </em>129 F.3d 340, 346 n. 4 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Verners, </em>53 F.3d 291, 295 (10th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Roberts, </em>913 F.2d 211, 220 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In this case, evidence shows that Baumgardner maintained his residence for the specific purpose of assisting in the distribution of crack and cocaine. He maintained it as a place for crack addicts to gather, purchase, and use crack cocaine. Three co-conspirators testified that Baumgardner\u2019s house was a gathering place and that crack was readily available in the back room of the house, where multiple dealers, including Baumgardner himself, often sold crack cocaine. Moreover, when the police executed a search warrant at the house during the early morning of April 30, 2008, Baumgardner was in his bedroom and four to five others were in the living room. They all appeared to be in a drug-induced state, and several admitted to being \u201cdrug sick.\u201d Police observed syringes and hypodermic needles throughout the house, as well as crack pipes and other drug paraphernalia. Digital scales were found under the mattress of the bed in which Baumgardner was lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In sum, we conclude that there was ample evidence to support the conviction of both defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Stallworth and Baumgardner next contend that they are entitled to a new trial because co-conspirators Evans and Vaughn later recanted testimony they gave against Stallworth and Baumgardner at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">A motion for a new trial based on the recantation of testimony by a material government witness may be granted when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-11\">(a) The court is reasonably well-satisfied that the testimony given by a material witness is false;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">(b) That without it the jury might have reached a different conclusion; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-13\">(c) That the party seeking the new trial was taken by surprise when the false testimony was given and was unable to meet it or did not know of its falsity until after the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-14\"><em>United States v. Wallace, </em>528 F.2d 863, 866 (4th Cir.1976). And \u201c[t]he failure to meet any one of the <em>Wallace </em>test\u2019s three prongs is fatal.\u201d <em>United States v. Lighty, </em>616 F.3d 321, 374-75 (4th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-15\">In this case, following a hearing on the witnesses\u2019 efforts to recant, the court found that the defendants had failed to meet the first prong. It found the recantations \u201cnot credible,\u201d and stated that it did \u201cnot believe that either Vaughn or Evans fabricated their prior trial testimony.\u201d The court concluded that while these witnesses\u2019 testimony at trial was consistent, \u201cthe recantations [were] overwhelmingly inconsistent and unreliable,\u201d and that the claims made \u201cfluctuated from one [recantation] letter to the next and in their testimony.\u201d The court pointed out that other witnesses corroborated Vaughn\u2019s and Evans\u2019 trial testimony. It found that since the recantation letters started only after Vaughn was housed in jail with Baumgardner and were written in different handwriting, they \u201cwere partly motivated by the pressure or intimidation likely exerted on them by their codefendants in prison, and partly motivated by the misguided and self-created illusion ... they would somehow avoid punishment for their crimes.\u201d Finally, another co-conspir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ator, Kerry Lee, testified that co-conspirator Charles King \u201chad forced him to write [a recanting letter] while they were jailed together.\u201d The court concluded that Evans and Vaughn were trying \u201cto game the system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">We have reviewed the evidence carefully and find that the district court\u2019s findings are amply supported by the record and that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Stallworth and Baumgardner contend that they are entitled to a new trial also because the government failed to disclose evidence to them that could have been used to impeach Vaughn, in violation of <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 768, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). They claim that the government failed to disclose that Detective Majors had promised Vaughn that he would not be charged with drug offenses in state court. While the record is not totally clear about whether the statement was made or who made it, the district court nonetheless concluded that the failure to disclose such statement was not material inasmuch as the result of the trial would not have been any different.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">First of all, Vaughn was cross-examined on the fact that his substantial assistance could be recognized in his own federal prosecution. And second, Vaughn\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Evans, who also sold cocaine to Baumgardner and Stallworth; by Calhoun and Mead who bought from Baumgardner; and by co-conspirator Norton who bought from Stall-worth. The district court concluded, \u201cunder these circumstances, the presumed failure to disclose was not material,\u201d and we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">Finally, the defendants challenge their sentences. Stallworth challenges the district court\u2019s finding as to drug weight, and both defendants challenge the life sentence as disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment bar against cruel and unusual punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">With respect to Stallworth\u2019s argument about the drug weight, we conclude that it is irrelevant. Stallworth\u2019s Guideline range was not determined by drug weight but by the statutory mandatory minimum sentence required by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A), prescribing a life sentence for a defendant who has \u201ctwo or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense.\u201d In this case there is no dispute that Stallworth had two prior felony drug convictions. Accordingly, any recalculation of his drug amount would be immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Finally, we reject the argument that the statutorily mandated life sentence for a third felony conviction for drug distribution is cruel and unusual, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United States v. D\u2019Anjou, </em>16 F.3d 604, 613 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Kratsas, </em>45 F.3d 63 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Accordingly, the convictions and sentences of Stallworth and Baumgardner are</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
