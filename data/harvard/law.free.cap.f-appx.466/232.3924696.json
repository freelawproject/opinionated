On appeal, Jones alleges that the district court erred by denying her motion to withdraw the guilty plea she had entered before a magistrate judge.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-18\">We discern no abuse of discretion by the district court in its denial of Jones\u2019 motion to withdraw her guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000) (providing review standard). After a thorough hearing on the matter and consideration of the six factors set out in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991), the district court found that Jones failed to establish a fair and just reason to support her request to withdraw as required under Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-19\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b257-15\"> Jones waived her right to plead guilty before a district court judge and had her plea hearing conducted by a magistrate judge. (J.A. 5; R. 39).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
