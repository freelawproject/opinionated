No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Snipes\u2019s conviction arose from the following undisputed facts. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) received information that a person \u2014 later identified as Snipes \u2014 had posted various messages on an internet website threatening to shoot members of the Florida National Guard at a weekend drill scheduled to begin the next day. The FBI also learned that Snipes himself was a member of the Florida National Guard and was scheduled to attend the drill. In response to this information, several senior officers of the Florida National Guard met to assess the threat level and to determine the appropriate course of action. Because it was unclear whether Snipes planned on targeting members of his own guard unit or another guard unit, the senior officers increased security measures statewide at all facilities that were hosting scheduled drills that weekend. This included posting at least 30 additional soldiers at security checkpoints to conduct identification and baggage checks of all personnel entering the designated facilities. Various state law enforcement officers were also pulled from their regular assignments to provide additional security to the guardsmen throughout the weekend. Police arrested Snipes a few hours before the drills were scheduled to begin.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">On appeal, Snipes argues that the district court erred in applying a four-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4)(B), based on the court\u2019s determination that Snipes\u2019s offense had substantially disrupted government functions. We review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and a district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Lopez, </em>363 F.3d 1134, 1137 (11th Cir.2004). To conclude that a factual finding is clearly erroneous, we \u201cmust be left with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, \u201c[a]s long as the district court\u2019s findings are plausible, we may not reverse the district court even if we would have decided the case differently.\u201d <em>United States v. McPhee, </em>336 F.3d 1269, 1275 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Under section 2A6.1(b)(4), a defendant convicted of a threatening or harassing communications offense receives a four-level enhancement if the offense resulted in a \u201csubstantial disruption of public, government, or business functions or services.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A6.1(b)(4)(A). For purposes of this subsection, we interpret the phrase \u201csubstantial disruption\u201d using the plain meaning of those words. <em>See United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1226 (11th Cir.2006). Thus, using dictionary definitions, we interpret \u201csubstantial\u201d to mean \u201cof ample or considerable amount, quantity, size, etc.\u201d and interpret \u201cdisrupt\u201d to mean \u201cto cause disorder or turmoil in.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In <em>Dudley, </em>we concluded that a \u201csubstantial disruption\u201d of government functions occurred when the defendant\u2019s threatening letter resulted in the closure of half a floor of a state courthouse for two hours, the interruption of judicial business for two judges for several hours, and the quarantine of two court staff members following their exposure to a white powder. <em>Id. </em>In addition, law enforcement officers were \u201cdiverted from their other duties to provide around-the-clock security for the judge\u201d for 24 hours and the targeted judge was required to spend many hours away from her judicial duties discussing the details of the offense with the FBI and the prosecution. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>Upon a review of the record, we are unconvinced that the district court clearly erred in concluding that Snipes\u2019s threats caused a \u201csubstantial disruption\u201d of government functions. Several senior officers of the Florida National Guard had to interrupt their daily business to assess Snipes\u2019s threats and to decide how to respond. At least 30 soldiers were then pulled from their regular assignments and were stationed at various security checkpoints throughout the state. This increased security measure not only disrupted completely the operations of those 30 soldiers, but also delayed those guardsmen entering each facility to attend drills. Several law enforcement officers were also \u201cdiverted from their other duties\u201d to provide additional security at the Florida National Guard facilities. <em>See Dudley, </em>463 F.3d at 1226. It is true that Snipes\u2019s threats \u2014 unlike Dudley\u2019s \u2014 did not result in the suspension of the Florida National Guard\u2019s scheduled drills or the closure of a facility. But Snipes\u2019s threats also caused more widespread disruption than the threat in <em>Dudley </em>because Snipes\u2019s threats disrupted many members of the Florida National Guard and state law enforcement units across several facilities over a two-day period.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We agree that this disruption was \u201csubstantial\u201d enough to warrant a section 2A6.1(b)(4) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Next, we address Snipes\u2019s argument that the district court erred in applying a six-level enhancement, pursuant to section 3A1.2(b), based on the district court\u2019s conclusion that Snipes\u2019s threats targeted guardsmen based on their status as government officers or employees. Snipes contends that his threats were directed at members of his unit because of personal issues, not because of their status as guardsmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">Under section 3A1.2, a defendant receives a six-level enhancement if the victim of his offense was \u201ca government officer or employee\u201d and \u201cthe offense of conviction was motivated by such status.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(a), (b). But \u201c[t]his adjustment will not apply ... where both the defendant and victim were employed by the same government agency and the offense was motivated by a personal dispute.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2, comment, (n.3).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Nothing evidences that Snipes\u2019s threats were motivated by personal disputes with members of his guard unit. Instead, in his written threats, he asserted that he hoped that his acts would result in his discharge or transfer out of his unit. After his arrest, Snipes also told law enforcement officers that he resented his First Sergeant and his other commanding officers because they transferred a fellow soldier out of the unit to undergo an extensive mental health evaluation. Based on Snipes\u2019s own statements, he targeted his victims because of their past official acts and because of their authority to grant him a discharge or transfer. Thus, we see no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Snipes targeted members of his guard unit because of their status as government officers or employees. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>961 F.2d 180, 182 (11th Cir.1992) (concluding that a section 3A1.2 enhancement applied when the robbery victim possessed the sought-after money orders and money order validation machine solely be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>cause of her status as a government employee).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b826-5\"> We reject Snipes's argument that he should not be held responsible for increased security measures performed after his arrest, which took place a few hours before the weekend drills were scheduled to begin. We agree with the district court\u2019s assessment that \u2014 because the exact nature and scope of Snipes\u2019s threats were unclear and because it was unknown whether Snipes would be released on bond. \u2014 -it was reasonable for the Florida National Guard to maintain a heightened level of security throughout the weekend.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
