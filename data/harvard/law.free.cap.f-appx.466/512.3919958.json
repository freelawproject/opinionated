Valle filed an application for asylum in 1995, and an immigration officer referred her application to an immigration judge in 2003. Subsequently, Valle withdrew her application for asylum and sought relief only under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act (NACARA), Pub.L. No. 105-100, 111 Stat. 2160 (1997), and alternatively, requested voluntary departure. Fol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>lowing an evidentiary hearing, an Immigration Judge issued an oral decision in which he denied Valle\u2019s requests for relief. The Board of Immigration Appeals dismissed Valle\u2019s subsequent appeal as without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Valle did not petition this court for judicial review of the Board\u2019s decision. Rather, Valle filed before the Board a motion to reconsider or to reopen her removal proceedings to seek an adjustment of her status. The request was made, in part, because an application for a visa filed for her by her spouse had been approved. The Board denied Valle\u2019s motion, and this timely petition followed. We denied Valle\u2019s motion to stay her removal. <em>Valle v. Holder, </em>No. 10-4475 (6th Cir. Dec. 14, 2010) (unpublished order).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Valle contends that: 1) she established eligibility for NACARA relief; 2) she was of good moral character for seven years preceding her application; 3) the Immigration Judge abused his discretion in denying her request for voluntary departure; and 4) she was eligible for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i). The government responds that we lack jurisdiction to review the underlying denial of voluntary departure, and that the Board properly denied Valle\u2019s motion to reconsider or to reopen. Upon consideration, the petition for review is denied because the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Valle\u2019s motion to reconsider or to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Valle devotes most of her brief to challenges to the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision to deny her voluntary departure and relief under NACARA. The government correctly notes that we lack jurisdiction to review the underlying agency decision to deny Valle relief. Generally, an alien may file a motion to reconsider within thirty days of the entry of an order of removal and a motion to reopen within ninety days of the order. <em>Gor v. Holder, </em>607 F.3d 180, 184 (6th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 3058, 180 L.Ed.2d 887 (2011). However, neither a motion to reconsider nor a motion to reopen tolls the thirty-day time period for seeking judicial review of the underlying decision. <em>Id. </em>at 185. Therefore, we have no jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s order that dismissed Valle\u2019s appeal from the Immigration Judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Furthermore, the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Valle\u2019s motion to reconsider or to reopen her removal proceedings. The legal authority for motions to reopen comes solely from regulations promulgated by the Attorney General. <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 322, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). The regulations provide that a motion to reopen is \u201cwithin the discretion of the Board,\u201d and that the \u201cBoard has discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a); <em>see also Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. 719. The Board has \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to grant or deny a motion to reopen, Gor, 607 F.3d at 187, and the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider or to reopen is reviewed only for an abuse of that discretion. <em>Gordillo v. Holder, </em>640 F.3d 700, 702 (6th Cir.2011); <em>Denko v. INS, </em>351 F.3d 717, 723 (6th Cir.2003). An abuse of discretion occurs where a denial was without rational explanation, was an inexplicable departure from established policies, or was based on invidious discrimination. <em>Mezo v. Holder, </em>615 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir.2010); <em>Denko, </em>351 F.3d at 723.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Valle cannot show that the Board abused its discretion. The Board correctly concluded that Valle was not eligible for adjustment of her status because she was not \u201cinspected and admitted or paroled into the United States.\u201d <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(a). Further, Valle was also ineligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ble for adjustment of her status on the basis of an approved visa petition because the petition was filed after April 30, 2001. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(1)(B)(i). Therefore, the Board\u2019s decision is not an abuse of its broad discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The petition for review is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
