Eaddy appeals the district court\u2019s 120-month sentence following his guilty plea to two counts of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2006), and one count of possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 (2006). On appeal, Eaddy contends that his sentence was unreasonable because the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>trict court erred in converting cash recovered from his pockets following his arrest to cocaine base equivalent for the purpose of calculating his base offense level. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">In reviewing a sentence, we must ensure that the district court did not commit any \u201csignificant procedural error,\u201d such as failing to properly calculate the applicable Guidelines range. The district court is permitted to convert cash to its drug equivalent if the cash can be \u201clinked credibly to the defendant\u2019s purchase or sale of narcotics.\u201d <em>United States v. Sampson, </em>140 F.Sd 585, 592 (4th Cir.1998). The Government must establish by a preponderance of the evidence the connection between the money seized and the drug-related activity. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez-Sanchez, </em>953 F.2d 1184, 1187 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Applying these standards to the record before us, we conclude that the Government proved by a preponderance of the evidence the connection between the cash seized from Eaddy\u2019s pockets and his drug activity. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>913 F.2d 1111, 1117-18 (4th Cir.1990) (holding that possession of large amount of cash may be circumstantial evidence of drug trafficking). Therefore, the district court did not clearly err by converting the seized cash into its cocaine base equivalent for the purpose of calculating Eaddy\u2019s base offense level. <em>See United States v. Hicks, </em>948 F.2d 877, 881 (4th Cir.1991) (stating standard of review). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
