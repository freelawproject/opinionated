Merritt sued Hub for negligence, tortious interference, breach of contract, and breach of fiduciary duty. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-13\">Merritt was injured while working on a stamping press at Campana Technology, and Merritt filed a complaint that alleged his injuries were the result of negligent repairs made by Campana. Campana failed to submit a timely claim to its insurer, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company, purportedly because of the advice of its insurance agent, Hub. Hub also did not notify Fireman\u2019s Fund about the lawsuit. Fireman\u2019s Fund refused to defend or indemnify Campana, and Campana withdrew its answer to Merritt\u2019s complaint. After a Georgia court entered a default judgment of more than $14 million in favor of Merritt, Campana assigned its claims against Fireman\u2019s Fund and Hub to Merritt.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-14\">Fireman\u2019s Fund filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment that the insurance policy issued to Campana as a manufacturer of wooden cabinets did \u201cnot provide coverage\u201d for repairing machinery and that Merritt could not \u201cexecute or collect the judgment or prosecute any claims or causes of action owned by [Campana].\u201d Fireman\u2019s Fund alleged that Campana had made misrepresentations and concealed facts that had been material to \u201cacceptance of the risk or hazard\u201d and that \u201cwould have prevented ... issu[ance] [of] the policy\u201d had the \u201ctrue facts [been] known.\u201d Fireman\u2019s Fund also alleged that Campana and Merritt had \u201ccollud[ed] to defraud\u201d Fireman\u2019s Fund. Later, the parties entered a settlement, and Fireman\u2019s Fund dismissed its complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-15\">Merritt filed in a Georgia court a complaint against Hub, and Hub removed the action to the district court. Hub moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. The district court ruled that Merritt\u2019s claims failed for lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>proof of proximate cause and because Hub could not interfere tortiously with an insurance contract that it had brokered and could not breach a contract to which it was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">We review a summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Still-well v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>668 F.3d 1329, 1335 n. 4 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment should be entered when there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The district court correctly entered summary judgment in favor of Hub. Merritt contends that Hub lacked standing to argue lack of coverage, but Merritt confuses the issue. The uncontroverted evidence established that Hub was not the proximate cause of the damages incurred by Campana and assigned to Merritt. Under Georgia law, which the parties agree applies, the alleged wrongdoing of an insurance agent is not the proximate cause of the insured\u2019s denial of coverage unless coverage would have been available but for the agent\u2019s wrongdoing. <em>Conner Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Strauch, </em>198 Ga.App. 536, 402 S.E.2d 129, 130 (1991); <em>Peagler and Manley Ins. Agency, Inc. v. Studebaker, </em>156 Ga.App. 786, 275 S.E.2d 385, 386 (1980). Hub established that Campana would have been denied coverage because misrepresentations in its application for insurance voided the insurance policy. <em>See </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 33\u201424\u20147(b); <em>Nappier v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>961 F.2d 168, 170 (11th Cir.1992). Hub introduced the application for insurance in which Campana stated that it was in the business of manufacturing cabinets, and Hub introduced the declaration of Joanne Padavano, the underwriter for the Campana policy, that Fireman\u2019s Fund would not have issued the policy had it known that Campana also repaired machinery. <em>See Celtic Life Ins. Co. v. Monroe, </em>220 Ga.App. 38, 467 S.E.2d 360, 362 (1996); <em>Graphic Arts Mut. Ins. Co. v. Pritchett, </em>220 Ga.App. 430, 469 S.E.2d 199, 202 (1995) (affirming summary judgment on uncontradicted affidavit of underwriter). Merritt argues, for the first time on appeal, that Padavano\u2019s declaration is opinion testimony insufficient to support a summary judgment, Hub is es-topped from asserting rescission as a defense, and Fireman\u2019s Fund waived its right of rescission, but this Court will not consider arguments raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines, Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">We AFFIRM the summary judgment in favor of Hub.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
