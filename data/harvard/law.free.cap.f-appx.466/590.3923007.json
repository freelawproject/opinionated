Printex Industries, Inc. (\u201cL.A.Printex\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment order in favor of Aeropostale, Inc. and Ms. Bubbles, Inc. (\u201cDefendants\u201d) in L.A. Printex\u2019s action for copyright infringement. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because there is a genuine dispute of material fact related to the validity of L.A. Printex\u2019s copyright registration, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Ellison v. Robertson, 357 </em>F.3d 1072, 1075 (9th Cir. 2004). Summary judgment is appropriate if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>see also Ellison, 357 </em>F.3d at 1075.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">The district court erred when it granted summary judgment for Defendants on the ground that L.A. Printex did not produce sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact on its compliance with the Copyright Act\u2019s registration requirement. <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a). Concluding that there was \u201cno-evidence\u201d in the record that the designs in Geometric (Group 04) \u201cwere offered to [L.A. Printex]\u2019s customers, for the first time, as a collection, in December of 2005,\u201d the district court held that L.A. Printex could not prove at trial that it had a valid copyright registration in G70132. <em>See 37 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 202.3(b)(4)(i)(A) (requiring that multiple works registered as a single published work be \u201cincluded in a single unit of publication\u201d). But a certificate of registration is \u201cprima facie evidence of the validity of the copyright and of the facts stated in the certificate.\u201d 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(c). Here, L.A. Printex\u2019s certificate of registration for Geometric (Group 04) explicitly states that the work was first published on December 7, 2005. Moreover, L.A. Printex\u2019s president, Jae Nah, gave deposition testimony that L.A. Printex\u2019s general business practice is to offer for sale together designs in groups such as Geometric (Group 04), and in a declaration Nah stated that \u201cG70132 was duly registered with the United States Copyright Office on December 19, 2005 as part of a group of designs published together.\u201d \u201cThe offering to distribute copies [of a work] ... to a group of persons for purposes of further distribution ... constitutes publication\u201d under the Copyright Act. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 101. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to L.A. Printex, we conclude that the record contains at least some evidence that L.A. Printex first published the collection of designs as a single unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">Though a copyright infringement defendant can rebut \u00a7 410(c)\u2019s presumption of validity at the summary judgment stage, we conclude that Defendants did not do so here. <em>Cf. Entm\u2019t Research Grp., Inc. v. Genesis Creative Grp., Inc., </em>122 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir.1997). The district court reasoned that Defendants had produced \u201csome evidence\u201d to rebut the presumption of single unit publication attaching to the certificate of registration. The district court cited Nah\u2019s declaration statement that \u201c[b]y February of 2006, L.A. Printex began offering G70132 extensively to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>customers,\u201d and sales records of G70132 starting in February of 2006, as evidence that L.A. Printex published G70132 separately from the other twelve designs in Geometric (Group 04).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">L.A. Printex contends that its separate sales of G70132 beginning in February of 2006 are not inconsistent with its concurrent offering for sale of the Geometric (Group 04) collection in December of 2005. We agree. That L.A. Printex first sold G70132 in February of 2006 does not conclusively establish that L.A. Printex did not first publish G70132 and the other twelve designs together before that date, by offering samples for sale to its customers. A reasonable juror could believe that L.A. Printex, per its general business practice and the statement on the certificate of registration, in fact first offered the collection for sale on December 7, 2005. In our view, L.A. Printex did not have to submit additional evidence to survive summary judgment. <em>Cf. United Fabrics Int\u2019l, Inc. v. C &amp; J Wear, Inc., </em>630 F.3d 1255, 1257-58 (9th Cir.2011). Because the issue of single unit publication \u2014 and hence valid registration \u2014 \u201ccould reasonably be resolved in favor of either party,\u201d on the current record, there is a genuine dispute of material fact that a jury should decide. <em>Ellison, </em>357 F.3d at 1075. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b616-7\">. Defendants\u2019 other arguments are not persuasive. Because L.A. Printex offered G70132 for sale on paper as well as fabric, deposit of a paper copy of the design \"sufficient to show all elements of the work in which copyright is claimed\u201d satisfies the Copyright Act\u2019s deposit requirement. <em>See </em>37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.20(c)(2)(x); <em>see also Three Boys Music Corp. v. Bolton, </em>212 F.3d 477, 486 (9th Cir.2000). Further, the Adobe End User License Agreement does not prohibit L.A. Printex from claiming copyright ownership of a derivative work based on Photoshop clip art. Finally, dismissal of the case due to any omission from the excerpts of record is not warranted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
