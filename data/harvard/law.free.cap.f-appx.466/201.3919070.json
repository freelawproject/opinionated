Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), a notice of appeal in a civil case must be filed with the district court within thirty days after judgment is entered. \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007). The district court may, however, extend the filing time if \u201ca party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by ... Rule 4(a) expires\u201d and the party shows excusable neglect or good cause. Fed. R-App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i)\u2014(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-24\">Heyward filed a notice of appeal in the district court shortly after the expiration of the appeal period but within the excusable neglect period. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). In a letter accompanying the notice of appeal, Heyward stated that his original notice of appeal was returned to him as undeliverable. We construe Heyward\u2019s letter as a timely request for an extension of the thirty-day appeal period.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-25\">Accordingly, we remand this case to the district court for the limited purpose of enabling the court to determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Heyward has shown excusable neglect or good, cause warranting an extension of time to appeal. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
