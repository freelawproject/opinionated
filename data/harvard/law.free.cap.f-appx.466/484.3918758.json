On appeal, King alleges three errors. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">On July 28, 2009, Lakewood Police Detectives Terry Miller and John Guzik were in a Detective Bureau vehicle on a \u201csexual registration follow up.\u201d R. 53, Suppression Transcript, p. 20. Detective Guzik observed a black Cadillac driven by a large African-American man in his fifties pass through the intersection of Detroit Road and Clarence Avenue. <em>Id. </em>Guzik testified that the driver matched a reliable confidential source\u2019s description of an individual suspected of drug activity at an apartment on Clarence Avenue. <em>Id. </em>at 16-17. Further, Clarence Avenue was \u201cdeemed a high-drug location within [Lakewood].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Because Guzik and Miller were in a bureau car, Guzik exited the vehicle, asked Miller to drive away, \u201cand proceeded to do a foot surveillance just to see where this vehicle was going or what might happen at that point in time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">The Cadillac subsequently parked \u201calong the east curb, probably 50 feet north of Detroit Avenue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Guzik observed the driver sit in the Cadillac from approximately 40 yards away. <em>Id. </em>The driver remained in the vehicle for approximately three minutes before exiting the Cadillac, at which point the driver stood by his Cadillac\u2019s open door and looked around for twenty to thirty seconds. <em>Id. </em>at 22. Guzik watched the driver cross the street while \u201cconstantly looking in all directions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23. The driver entered the suspect apartment building on Clarence Avenue and remained inside for four minutes. <em>Id. </em>at 26. When the driver emerged from the building, he returned to his car. <em>Id. </em>at 26-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">Guzik believed that the driver matched the physical description given by the confidential informant. <em>Id. </em>at 22-23. Guzik also considered the driver\u2019s brief visit to the Clarence Avenue on the apartment to be indicative of a drug sale based on his training and experience. <em>Id. </em>at 22. Accordingly, Guzik intended to stop the driver based on \u201c[r]easonable and articulable suspicion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27. Consequently, Guzik arranged for a uniformed officer to proceed to the area to provide assistance while he continued to monitor the situation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">The individual in the Cadillac then began to drive away, <em>Id. </em>at 28-29, and Guzik \u2014 still on foot \u2014 returned to Miller\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 29. Guzik and Miller followed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the Cadillac in their bureau car as it proceeded eastbound on Detroit Avenue. <em>Id. </em>at 29. By this point, Guzik\u2019s back-up had arrived, and Lakewood Police Officer Romanello was driving immediately behind the Cadillac, followed by Lieutenant Ciresi\u2019s vehicle. <em>Id. </em>When the Cadillac reached the border of the City of Lakewood and the City of Cleveland, Ciresi instructed Romanello to stop the vehicle. <em>Id. </em>Because Romanello wanted to avoid stopping the vehicle at \u201ca very busy intersection,\u201d Romanello waited to activate his flashing light until the cars were one city block inside of Cleveland, and the Cadillac immediately pulled over. <em>Id. </em>at 63-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">Romanello approached the driver, and obtained his driver\u2019s license. <em>Id. </em>at 66. The license identified the driver as Dennis King. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67. While Romanello was running King\u2019s license, Romanello heard \u201csquealing tires, looked up and the vehicle fled from the stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Romanello conducted a high-speed chase of King\u2019s vehicle until King\u2019s Cadillac crashed into another car. <em>Id. </em>at 69-72. During the chase, Romanello witnessed King commit the following violations, all of which were also recorded by the dashboard camera in Romanello\u2019s vehicle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">(1) failure to use a turn signal before pulling from the curb;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">(2) operating a vehicle to the left of the center line and into oncoming traffic;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">(3) failure to stop at a red traffic light;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">(4) exceeding seventy miles per hour in a twenty-five miles per hour zone;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">(5) operating a vehicle in a reckless manner or with willful, wanton disregard for the safety of others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">(6) fleeing the scene of an accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">(7) felony flight from the police.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">Appellee Br. at 11; <em>see also </em>R. 55 at 69-72. When Romanello arrived at the scene of the accident, he observed King fleeing on foot. R. 55 at 73. Romanello chased King on foot while another officer arrived and attempted to block King with his vehicle. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-15\">Once King was caught, he was arrested for felony fleeing and eluding. <em>Id. </em>at 39. Detectives Guzik and Miller searched King incident to his arrest and uncovered 101 individually wrapped rocks of crack cocaine weighing approximately thirty-two grams, a cellular phone, and approximately $250.00. <em>Id. </em>at 40. Guzik then returned to King\u2019s Cadillac and, on the ground near the vehicle, found a brown paper bag that contained a black bag with 139 unit doses of heroin which exceeded 60 grams in weight. <em>Id. </em>at 41. Finally, Guzik observed a loaded .380 semi-automatic Beretta pistol unobstructed from view on the floorboard of the passenger\u2019s front seat. <em>Id. </em>The police seized the evidence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-16\">On August 19, 2009, King was charged with possession to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B), possession with intent to distribute heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(C), and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). R. 7, Indictment. On October 6, 2009, King filed a motion to suppress the evidence, claiming that the crack cocaine, heroin and firearm were obtained as the result of an illegal seizure \u201cwithout probable cause in violation of his constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d R. 19, Motion to Suppress, p. 2. The Government filed both a response and a supplemental response opposing King\u2019s motion. <em>See </em>R.22; R. 23. In its responses, the Government argued that the first stop was justified by reasonable suspicion that King was involved in criminal activity. Additionally, the Government argued that \u201c[ajssuming <em>arguendo </em>that ... the initial stop was not based on reasonable suspi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>cion, any taint would have dissipated when King fled the scene and proceeded to commit numerous law violations.\u201d R. 22, pp. 11-12. The district court denied King\u2019s motion to suppress after finding that, although the initial traffic stop was not supported by reasonable suspicion, King\u2019s intervening decision to flee the scene and break numerous laws \u2014 all witnessed by police \u2014 provided probable cause for his subsequent arrest and search. R. 24, Opinion and Order, pp. 7-12. King filed a motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress, and the government filed its response in opposition. <em>See </em>R. 26, Motion for Reconsideration; R. 28, Government Response. The district court again denied King\u2019s motion to suppress. R. 29, Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">On December 15, 2009, a superceding indictment was filed containing the same three counts but amending the quantity of the drugs. R. 31, Superceding Indictment. King pleaded guilty to all three counts pursuant to a plea agreement. R. 42, Plea Agreement. King\u2019s plea agreement contained an appellate waiver provision that reserved his right to appeal: (1) any punishment in excess of the statutory maximum; (2) any sentence higher than the advisory Sentencing Guideline range deemed applicable by the court; and (3) the denial of his motion to suppress. <em>Id. </em>at 7. After the district court accepted King\u2019s guilty plea, the United States Probation Office prepared a Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSR\u201d). On May 14, 2010, King objected to the PSR on the following grounds: (1) the PSR\u2019s recommendation that he receive a two-level increase for obstruction of justice; (2) the PSR\u2019s inclusion in his criminal history of a fifth-degree felony over ten years old; and (3) the enhancement for possession of a firearm. R. 46, Objections to the Presentence Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">At sentencing, however, King withdrew his objections after the parties stipulated to a base offense level of 24 rather than the PSR\u2019s recommended base level of 28. R. 55, Sentencing Transcript, pp. 2-3. The district court then determined the base offense level of 24 should be increased by four levels: two for possession of a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), and two for recklessly creating a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury while fleeing from a police officer pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2. <em>Id. </em>The district court then applied a downward adjustment of three levels for King\u2019s acceptance of responsibility, thereby arriving at an offense level 25 with a criminal history category IV. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Although King\u2019s advisory sentencing range was 84 to 105 months, Count 1 carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months. Accordingly, the district court sentenced King to the mandatory minimum of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by an eight-year term of supervised release, a $300 assessment and a $1,000 f\u00edne. <em>Id. </em>pp. 9-10. King timely appealed. R. 48, Notice of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">On appeal, King asserts three errors. First, King argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress. Second, King contends the district court abused its discretion by imposing a $1,000 fine. Finally, King argues that his 120-month sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">A. KING\u2019S MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s determination on a motion to suppress, this Court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its ultimate legal conclusion de novo. <em>See United States v. Al-Cholan, </em>610 F.3d 945, 953 (6th Cir.2010). \u201cA factual finding will only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>clearly erroneous when, although there may be evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Navarro-Camacho, </em>186 F.3d 701, 705 (6th Cir.1999). Where, as here, \u201ca district court has denied a motion to suppress, this Court reviews the evidence in the light most likely to support the district court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Adams, </em>583 F.3d 457, 463 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">King appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress for two reasons. First, King asserts that the Lakewood City Police lacked jurisdiction to arrest him because the relevant criminal conduct occurred in Cleveland rather than Lakewood. Second, King argues that his arrest was insufficiently attenuated from the Lakewood Police\u2019s improper <em>Terry </em>stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">King\u2019s first argument is unavailing because, even assuming the Lakewood City Police lacked jurisdiction to arrest King, jurisdictional defects do not amount to per se violations of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Virginia v. Moore, </em>553 U.S. 164, 172, 128 S.Ct. 1598, 170 L.Ed.2d 559 (2008) (explaining that the legality of a seizure under the Fourth Amendment \u201chas never depended on the law of the particular State\u201d in which the seizure occurs) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also State v. Weideman, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 501, 764 N.E.2d 997, 1001-02 (2002) (holding that an officer\u2019s violation of Ohio\u2019s jurisdictional law did \u201cnot rise to the level of a constitutional violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">King next argues that, because the Lakewood Police\u2019s initial <em>Terry </em>stop was improper, his subsequent arrest and search incident to arrest should be suppressed as \u201cfruits of the poisonous tree.\u201d <em>See </em>Appellant Br. at 15; <em>see also Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). In particular, King notes that there were \u201conly a few minutes between the unlawful police activity and the defendant\u2019s actions. That lapse could not in any way dissipate the taint.\u201d Appellant Br. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">Generally, \u201c[i]n order to make effective the fundamental constitutional guarantees of sanctity of the home and inviolability of the person,\u201d the United States Supreme Court requires that \u201cevidence seized during an unlawful search [can] not constitute proof against the victim of the search\u201d and must therefore be excluded from trial. <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 484, 83 S.Ct. 407. There are, however, exceptions to this exclusionary rule. Evidence obtained following an unlawful search or seizure will not be excluded if its discovery results from \u201can intervening independent act of a free will sufficient to purge the primary taint of the unlawful invasion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 486, 83 S.Ct. 407.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">In this Circuit, fleeing or otherwise resisting an unlawful search or seizure constitutes an intervening independent act of free will that purges the taint from the initial unlawful search or seizure. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>619 F.3d 518 (6th Cir.2010) (finding that \u201cit is widely recognized that if a suspect\u2019s response to an illegal stop is itself a new, distinct crime, then the police constitutionally may arrest the suspect for that crime\u201d) (internal alterations omitted). According, we find that the district court properly denied King\u2019s motion to suppress. The district court first held that Detective Guzik lacked reasonable suspicion to support his initial <em>Terry </em>stop of King\u2019s vehicle. R. 24, Order Denying Defendant\u2019s Motion to Suppress, p. 9. Nonetheless, the district court denied King\u2019s motion because \u201cDefendant\u2019s flight cannot be said to have resulted from an exploitation of the illegality of the initial traffic stop, but was instead an intervening act of free will that is sufficient to purge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the taint of the illegal stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 (quoting <em>Wong Sun, </em>371 U.S. at 488, 83 S.Ct. 407). Assuming without deciding that the district court\u2019s <em>Terry </em>stop holding was correct, we wholeheartedly agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that King\u2019s flight constituted an intervening act that purged any taint from the initial traffic stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">As the district court noted, \u201c[d]uring the course of the high-speed chase that ensued from his flight, the Defendant committed numerous violations, including felony fleeing, which ... provided probable cause for arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. Accordingly, \u201cthe evidence collected post-flight need not be suppressed based upon the illegality of the initial traffic stop, so long as there was a legitimate basis for its seizure following the capture and arrest of the Defendant subsequent to his flight.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When King was finally apprehended, he was arrested and the search incident to arrest uncovered approximately thirty-two grams of crack cocaine. <em>Id. </em>The district court found that because \u201cthe arrest of the Defendant was lawful, the evidence recovered from his person was lawfully obtained and need not be suppressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">B. THE $1000 FINE</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">King next argues that the district court abused its discretion by fining King $1,000. In particular, King asserts that \u201c[b]eing indigent[,] the court should not have imposed a fine,\u201d and that doing so violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a). Appellant Br. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s factual finding as to whether King is capable of paying a fine for clear error. <em>United States v. Hickey, </em>917 F.2d 901, 906 (6th Cir.1990). The United States Sentencing Guidelines provide that \u201c[t]he court shall impose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(d). Section 3572 provides that: \u201cIn determining whether to impose a fine, and the amount, time for payment, and method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider, in addition to the factors set forth in section 3553(a),\u201d eight additional factors, including: the defendant\u2019s income; the burden the fine will impose upon the defendant; pecuniary loss inflicted upon others as a result of the offense; and the expected costs to the government of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(a). This Court\u2019s gloss on the \u00a7 3752(a) factors requires the district court to assess: \u201c(1) the defendant\u2019s income and earning capacity, (2) his financial resources, (3) the burden on the defendant and his dependents, (4) whether restitution is ordered and the amount of restitution, (5) the need to deprive the defendant of illegal gains, and (6) the need to promote respect for the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson-Randolph, </em>282 F.3d 369, 387 (6th Cir.2002). Ultimately, \u201cthe defendant has the burden of establishing that he or she is not able and, even with the use of a reasonable installment schedule, is not likely to become able to pay all or part of the fine.\u201d <em>United States v. Tosca, </em>18 F.3d 1352, 1354 (6th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Ukomadu, </em>236 F.3d 333, 340 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">Because King\u2019s total offense level was 25, his Guidelines fine range was between $10,000 and $100,000. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3). At sentencing, the court acknowledged that King \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the ability to pay a fine, a guideline fine. However, because of the length of the sentence and the fact that Mr. King can participate in the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Financial Program, I am going to impose a $1,000 fine.\u201d R. 55, Sentencing Transcript, p. 10. In doing so, the district court implicitly considered the 3752(a) factors. Further, King failed to satisfy his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>burden of proving that he is unable to pay his below-Guidelines f\u00edne; aside from asserting his indigence, King never addresses the district court\u2019s point that King can work off his fine through the Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Financial Program. Consequently, even though the district court didn\u2019t explicitly walk through each of \u00a7 8752(a) factors, King\u2019s argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">C. KING\u2019S SENTENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">King argues that the district court erred by \u201cimposing what it believed to be a mandatory sentence ... without consideration of the \u00a7 3553 factors.\u201d Appellant Br. at 20. Toward that end, King relies on the dissent in <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>which reasoned that \u201cthe district court should be able to consider the mandatory seven-year sentence for brandishing a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) when the court evaluates the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in fashioning the additional appropriate sentence to be imposed for the other counts of conviction.\u201d 622 F.3d 650, 658 (6th Cir.2010) (Moore, J., dissenting), <em>vacated on other grounds,</em>\u2014U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1675,179 L.Ed.2d 611 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s sentence for procedural and substantive reasonableness under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Alexander, </em>543 F.3d 819, 821 (6th Cir.2008). A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if, inter alia, the district court failed to properly calculate the Guidelines range, treated the Guidelines range as mandatory, failed to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors, used clearly erroneous facts in imposing the sentence, or failed to adequately explain the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 822. A sentence is substantively unreasonable if the district court arrives at a sentence arbitrarily, uses impermissible sentencing factors, fails to consider relevant sentencing factors, or gives unreasonable weight to any one factor. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>559 F.3d 443, 448 (6th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-9\">Section 3553(a) factors do not apply to mandatory minimums in the Sixth Circuit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Penney, </em>576 F.3d 297, 317 (6th Cir.2009) (holding that \u201c \u00a7 3553(a) factors do not apply to congressionally mandated sentences\u201d); <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>546 F.3d 394, 397 (6th Cir.2008) (observing that \u201ca sentencing court must determine an appropriate sentence for the underlying crimes without consideration of the mandatory sentences for firearm offenses\u201d); <em>United States v. Lockett, </em>359 Fed.Appx. 598, 611 (6th Cir.2009) (recognizing that sentencing courts are \u201cconstrained by the mandatory minimums Congress prescribed\u201d); <em>United States v. Wimbley, </em>553 F.3d 455 (6th Cir.2009) (observing that while <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), explicitly allows the sentencing court to take into account the Guidelines\u2019 disparate treatment of crack versus powder cocaine, <em>Kimbrough </em>is inapposite where the sentence is set by a statutory mandatory minimum rather than subject to the advisory Sentencing Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">Because the district court was not allowed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors to arrive at a sentence less than the mandatory minimum, King\u2019s sentence is both procedurally and substantively reasonable. Procedurally, the district court correctly calculated King\u2019s 120-month mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B) with an enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. Further, King ignores the extensive Sixth Circuit ease law that makes clear that 3553(a) factors do not apply to mandatory minimums. Accordingly, we find no error in the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>III.
