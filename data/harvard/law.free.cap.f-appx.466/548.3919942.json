The district court granted the motion, but Beserra argues here that the court erroneously thought it could not further reduce his sentence. We affirm the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">After Beserra pleaded guilty to distribution, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), the district court found him responsible for 87 grams of crack, which corresponded to a base offense level of 30 under the guidelines then in effect, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(e)(5) (2009). The court added 2 levels each for possession of a gun, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1), and leadership role, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3B 1.1(c), and subtracted 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 31. Beserra\u2019s 7 criminal history points\u2014including 2 \u201crecency\u201d points for committing the distribution offense within 2 years of his release \u2014 placed him in a criminal history category of IV. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(a), (e) (2009). Together, his offense level and criminal history category yielded an imprisonment range of 151 to 188 months. The court noted, however, that the Sentencing Commission had proposed an amendment to do away with \u201crecency\u201d points because studies had found no connection between the speed of reoffense and the likelihood of future recidivism. Without those recency points Beserra\u2019s criminal history category would have been III, and his imprisonment range would have been 135 to 168 months. With that in mind, the court exercised its discretion, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and imposed a below-guidelines sentence of 138 months. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The following year, the Sentencing Commission retroactively amended \u00a7 2D1.1 to implement the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220,124 Stat. 2372, which increased the quantities of crack mandating minimum prison terms under \u00a7 841(b)(1). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amends. 748, 750, 759. Consequently, Beserra moved to reduce his prison sentence based on a revised range of 100 to 125 months, and he requested a further reduction to 87 months to mirror the sentencing court\u2019s original below-guidelines sentence. The district court granted the motion in November 2011 but reduced Beserra\u2019s sentence only to 100 months after concluding that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) did not authorize a below-guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Beserra makes two arguments for the first time on appeal: first, he argues that the district court erred in concluding for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) that his criminal history category at sentencing was IV. He argues that the sentencing court actually placed him in criminal history category III, giving him an original imprisonment range of 135 to 168 months and, thus now, a revised range of 87 to 108 months. But, in fact, as evidenced by the transcript of the sentencing hearing, the district court stated that Beserra was \u201cin criminal history category IV, so the sentencing guidelines recommend a sentence of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment.\u201d Beserra\u2019s confusion arises from the court\u2019s exercise of discretion under \u00a7 3553(a), <em>see Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 110-12, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), to disagree as a matter of policy with the then-existing guidelines\u2019 inclusion of \u201crecency\u201d points, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(a), (e) (2009). The court determined that the imprisonment range would have been 135 to 168 months without the recency points and, on that basis, imposed a sentence of 138 months with the explanation that a higher sentence would \u201covervalue[ ] the \u2018recency\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>point.\u2019? Yet, it is the actual imprisonment range, not the term imposed, that governs a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10; <em>United States v. Guyton, </em>636 F.3d 316, 319 (7th Cir.2011). The district court\u2019s analysis is not undermined by the Sentencing Commission\u2019s recent repeal of the use of recency points, as that repeal did not become effective until four months after Beserra was sentenced and is not retroactive. <em>See id. &amp; </em>app. C, amend. 742.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Second, Beserra asserts that the district court was nevertheless empowered to impose a below-guidelines sentence because, quoting from <em>Freeman v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 2693, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), he argues that \u201cthe original sentence was itself a downward departure.\u201d That characterization is mistaken. A sentence reduction under 3582(c)(2) is permitted only to the extent consistent with the Sentencing Commission\u2019s implementation of that provision through \u00a7 1B1.10. <em>See Dillon v. United States,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2688-89, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Beserra\u2019s original sentence was not a downward departure but rather, in the language of \u00a7 1B1.10 as it existed when Beserra was sentenced, \u201ca non-guideline sentence determined pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2)(B) (2009). Under that version of \u00a7 1B1.10, a further reduction below the bottom of the revised imprisonment range \u201cgenerally would not be appropriate\u201d when granting a motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), though the government concedes that a new sentence below the revised range would have been authorized if the defendant originally received a below-guidelines prison term. <em>See id.; United States v. Cunningham, </em>554 F.3d 703, 705 (7th Cir.2009). But Beserra\u2019s motion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was granted after the Sentencing Commission had cabined the district court\u2019s discretion by adopting Amendment 759, which took effect on November 1, 2011, twenty days before the ruling from which Beserra appeals. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 759; 76 Fed.Reg. 41332-34 (July 13, 2011). Under the amended version of \u00a7 1B1.10, a district court shall not reduce a term of imprisonment below the revised guidelines range unless the court originally imposed a below-guidelines term of imprisonment \u201cpursuant to a government motion to reflect the defendant\u2019s substantial assistance.\u201d <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(b)(2) &amp; cmt. n. 3. That narrow exception excludes Beserra.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">Beserra points out in his reply brief that Amendment 759 is not retroactive and therefore, he argues, the district court should have applied the version of \u00a7 1B1.10 in effect at the time of his sentencing. But Application Note 6 to \u00a7 1B1.10 explicitly instructs the court to apply the version in effect on the date that the court reduces a term of imprisonment, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 cmt. n. 6 (2011); <em>United States v. Rivera, </em>662 F.3d 166, 186 n. * (2d Cir.2011) (Katzmann, J., concurring), and an application note is authoritative unless its interpretation violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is plainly erroneous, <em>see Stinson v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993); <em>United States v. Katalinic, </em>510 F.3d 744, 746 (7th Cir.2007). As important, Amendment 759 is also the amendment that made portions of Amendment 750 retroactive and empowered the court to reduce Beserra\u2019s term of imprisonment. Not until the 2011 version of \u00a7 1B1.10 took effect did the district court have authority t\u00f3 reduce Beserra\u2019s term of imprisonment <em>at all, </em>let alone to below 100 months. Accordingly, the district court was correct not to further reduce Beser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>ra\u2019s term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
