We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because Mkhitaryan\u2019s testimony that she sought a visa after her release from the hospital is inconsistent with the record evidence, <em>see Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1043 (an inconsistency goes to the heart of a claim if it concerns events central to the alien\u2019s version of why she was persecuted and fled), and the agency reasonably rejected her explanations, <em>see Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1275 (9th Cir.2007). In the absence of credible testimony, Mkhitaryan\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">Because Mkhitaryan\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same testimony found to be not credible, and she does not point to any other evidence that shows it is more likely than not she would be tortured if returned to Armenia, her CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b704-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
