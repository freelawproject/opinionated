We vacate in part and affirm in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order upholding a decision by the Social Security Commissioner that denies benefits to an applicant. <em>Batson v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1193 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Samples challenges the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (ALJ) assessment of her residual functional capacity (RFC), specifically his failure to incorporate a finding made by Dr. James Wahl on a \u201ccheck-off\u2019 form that Samples is moderately to markedly limited in her \u201cability to accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors.\u201d \u201c[A]n RFC that fails to take into account a claimant\u2019s limitations is defective.\u201d <em>Valentine v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>574 F.3d 685, 690 (9th Cir.2009). The ALJ must determine a claimant\u2019s limitations on the basis of \u201call relevant evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Robbins v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>466 F.3d 880, 883 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">Here, the ALJ erred by not including all of Samples\u2019 limitations in his assessment of her RFC. In particular, the ALJ\u2019s assessment improperly ignored Dr. Wahl\u2019s description and diagnoses of a functional limitation on Samples\u2019 ability to accept instructions from supervisors and to respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors, rendering the RFC defective. <em>See Valentine, </em>574 F.3d at 690. This limitation was not covered by the language in the RFC discussing Samples\u2019 general difficulty with taking criticism in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-10\">Because the RFC was defective, the hypothetical question that the ALJ posed to the vocational expert regarding Samples\u2019 ability to find work in the national economy was also defective and must be reformulated on remand to include all of Samples\u2019 limitations. <em>See, e.g., id.; Embrey v. Bowen, </em>849 F.2d 418, 422 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">The ALJ was required to consider Samples\u2019 impairments in combination throughout the disability determination process and determine if her impairments met or equaled one of the listed impairments at 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, Appendix 1. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1523; <em>see also Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 828 (9th Cir.1995). The record reflects that the ALJ did so, even if he did not discuss explicitly the interaction between her physical impairments and her mental impairments. The ALJ not only noted that he was required to consider her impairments in combination, but stated explicitly in two places that he had done so. Additionally, Samples did not meet her burden of showing that her impairments, alone or in combination, equal or meet one of the listed impairments. <em>See Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.1999). Therefore, the ALJ was not required to discuss how the combined effects of Samples\u2019 impairments might meet or equal a listing. <em>See Burch v. Barnhart, </em>400 F.3d 676, 683 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Lewis v. Apfel, </em>236 F.3d 503, 514 (9th Cir.2001). We affirm the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>district court\u2019s holding that this argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">The district court is directed to remand this case to the Commissioner for proceedings consistent with this memorandum disposition. The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
