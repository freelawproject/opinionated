Plaintiff challenged that decision in a lawsuit, but the district court compelled arbitration pursuant to the parties\u2019 agreement, and the arbitrator dismissed Plaintiffs claims on the merits. Plaintiff appeals the district court\u2019s orders confirming the arbitration award and compelling arbitration in the first place, and we review de novo. <em>Bridge Fund Capital Corp. v. Fastbucks Franchise Corp., </em>622 F.3d 996, 1000 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Aramark Facility Servs. v. SEIU, Local 1877, </em>530 F.3d 817, 822 (9th Cir.2008). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-19\">1. We affirm the district court\u2019s order compelling arbitration because the arbitration provision is not unconscionable under Washington law,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> either procedurally or substantively.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">2. The issue of systemic bias \u2014 like other issues \u2014 had to be raised before the arbitrator but was not. Even assuming that the issue was properly preserved, and properly presented to the district court, the claim was not proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-21\">3. Plaintiff did not meet any of the statutory standards for refusing to enforce a binding arbitration award. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4); <em>Comedy Club, Inc. v. Improv West Assocs., </em>553 F.3d 1277, 1290 (9th Cir.2009) (\u201cWe have stated that for an arbitrator\u2019s award to be in manifest disregard of the law, \u2018[i]t must be clear from the record that the arbitrator ] recognized the applicable law and then ignored it.\u2019 \u201d (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Mich. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Unigard Sec. Ins. Co., </em>44 F.3d 826, 832 (9th Cir.1995))).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>4. We need not reach any issues related to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, June 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, 330 U.N.T.S. 38 (\u201cthe Convention\u201d), implemented by 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201-208. Plaintiff failed to raise his objections to the Convention\u2019s applicability in his opening brief; regardless, its applicability would not change the outcome in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-22\">.
