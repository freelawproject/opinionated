In 1998, Engers brought a class action against AT &amp; T, alleging that changes to its Management Employees\u2019 Pension Plan (the Plan) in April 1997 disproportionately harmed older employees in violation of the ADEA, and violated ERISA\u2019s disclosure, anti-backloading, and anti-cutback rules. After extensive discovery and over a decade of litigation, the District Court granted summary judgment to AT <em>&amp; </em>T on all of Engers\u2019s claims. Engers contends on appeal that the District Court misinterpreted the ADEA and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>several ERISA provisions and mistakenly concluded that certain of his claims had not been adequately pleaded. For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">II. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Because we write for the parties, we assume familiarity with the facts in this case as set out in previous opinions of the District Court, and only briefly summarize them here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to its amendment in April 1997, the Plan provided participants with a pension based on their average pay over a \u201cpay base averaging period\u201d and in each subsequent year. The Plan also provided generous early retirement subsidies, which permitted participants to retire as early as age 55 and receive their full pensions. In April 1997, AT <em>&amp; </em>T amended the Plan to phase out the early retirement subsidy and replace the pay-average formula -with a cash balance system, under which each participant would be assigned a hypothetical cash balance which would be increased by pay and interest credits for each year of service.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, there were no generous early retirement subsidies for benefits accruing under the cash balance plan \u2014 instead early retirement benefits were actuarially reduced to account for the fact that the participant\u2019s cash balance was being distributed over a longer period of time. To mitigate the effect of these changes on older plan participants, the Plan amendments created a frozen \u201cspecial update\u201d benefit, which provided a significant, one-time increase to each participant\u2019s benefits, and was also subject to the generous early retirement subsidies available under the old Plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To ensure that participants\u2019 benefits were not reduced, the amended Plan provided that retiring participants were entitled to the greater of (1) their benefits accrued under the old Plan, (2) the frozen special update benefit (both of which had generous early retirement subsidies) or (3) their gradually increasing cash balance benefits (which did not have any early retirement subsidy).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">One implication of the Plan amendments was that many older Plan participants experienced 7-8 years of \u201cwear-away,\u201d a period during which their cash balance would grow, but their early retirement benefits would not increase because the actuarially discounted value of the cash balance account would be less than the subsidized early retirement benefit from the frozen special update benefit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although AT &amp; T was concerned that wear-away would be poorly received by employees, it distributed several documents explaining the Plan amendments and created a website so that each participant could calculate his or her benefits, and determine when his wear-away period would end, which AT &amp; T called \u201ccrossover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">Engers and several other AT &amp; T management employees brought a class action against AT &amp; T, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that (a) the wear-away periods were disproportionately longer for older plan participants, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>violating the ADEA; (b) key features of the new Plan had not been included in the Plan amendments, in violation of the written instrument requirement of ERISA \u00a7 402(a)(1); (c) AT &amp; T had not adequately disclosed the implications of the Plan amendments to plan participants, in violation of its fiduciary duties and ERISA \u00a7\u00a7 102 and 204(h); (d) the shift to a cash balance formula violated the anti-backloading rule of ERISA \u00a7 204(g)(2); and (e) the discounting of early retirement benefits received before age 50 violated the anti-cutback rule of ERISA \u00a7 204(b). Over the course of 12 years of litigation, the District Court granted summary judgment on all of Engers\u2019s claims, resulting in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u201cWe review de novo district court orders granting or denying summary judgment,\u201d <em>Elassaad v. Independence Air, Inc., </em>613 F.3d 119, 124 (3d Cir.2010), \u201capplying] the same test required of the district court and view[ing] inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Bayer v. Monroe Cnty. Children &amp; Youth Servs., </em>577 F.3d 186, 191 (3d Cir.2009). Our review is not limited to the reasoning of the court below and we \u201cmay affirm the district court on grounds different from those relied on by the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>In re Mushroom Transp. Co., </em>382 F.3d 325, 344 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">A. The ADEA Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Engers\u2019s ADEA claim is that the 1997 amendments discriminated against older employees because they resulted in longer wear-away periods for older employees. ADEA \u00a7 4(i)(1) sets out specific rules governing age discrimination relating to retirement benefits and Engers does not contest the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the Plan amendments complied with these rules. <em>Engers, </em>2010 WL 2326211 *4-5 (citing <em>Register v. PNC Fin. Servs. Grp., Inc., </em>477 F.3d 56, 68 (3d Cir.2007)). The court found that Engers\u2019 wear-away claims related to benefit accrual, and were therefore barred by ADEA \u00a7 4(i)(4), which provides\u2014both now and in 1997\u2014 that \u201c[c]ompliance with the requirements of this subsection with respect to an employee pension benefit plan shall constitute compliance with the requirements of this section relating to benefit accrual under such plan.\u201d <em>Engers, </em>2010 WL 2326211, *4 (quoting 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(i)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">On appeal, Engers argues that the District Court erred in treating compliance with ADEA \u00a7 4(i) as a complete defense to his ADEA claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He contends that amendments in 1990 changing the scope of ADEA \u00a7 4(a)(1) brought his wear-away claims within that subsection and outside the scope of ADEA \u00a7 4(i). We agree with the Tenth Circuit\u2019s careful analysis of this argument and its conclusion that the 1990 amendments do not affect the scope of ADEA \u00a7 4(i). <em>See Jensen v. Solvay Chemicals, Inc., </em>625 F.3d 641, 660-61 (10th Cir.2010). Engers does not seriously contest the District Court\u2019s ruling that his wear-away claims \u201crelat[e] to benefit accrual\u201d and we conclude that this ruling was correct. <em>See Hurlic v. S. Cal. Gas Co., </em>539 F.3d 1024, 1037 (9th Cir.2008) (wear-away claims relate to benefit accrual). Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ingly, Engers\u2019s wear-away claims are barred by the plain language of ADEA \u00a7 4(i)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">B. The Plan Amendment Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Some procedural background is necessary to understand Engers\u2019s Plan amendment claims. In October 2004, Engers moved for summary judgment on these claims, arguing that two key changes to the Plan were not included in the Plan amendments and had not been validly adopted until they were included by AT &amp; T in a restatement of the Plan in October of 2000. As a result, these changes could not be retroactively applied to determine benefits during 1997-2000. Engers therefore interpreted the 1997 amendments as entitling participants to (1) the sum of their benefits payable under the special update and the cash balance formula, and (2) additional benefit payment options \u2014 a lump sum payment and a joint and 100% survivor annuity \u2014 for their special update benefits as well as their cash balance benefits. The District Court found that these claims were unexhausted claims for plan benefits and dismissed them without prejudice. <em>Engers, </em>428 F.Supp.2d at 227-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In 2006, Engers presented his claim to AT &amp; T\u2019s Benefits Committee, which denied it. In a detailed opinion, the Committee explained that the text of the amendments and related documents were inconsistent with Engers\u2019s proposed interpretation. Concerning Engers\u2019s first argument, the Committee pointed out that, because the initial amount in each participant\u2019s cash balance account is based on the special update, awarding Engers the sum of his special update and cash balance benefits would essentially give him double benefits. Additionally, presentations to AT &amp; T\u2019s Board when it was considering the Plan amendments and disclosures to employees immediately following the amendments made clear that participants were entitled to the greater of their cash balance and special update benefits. Regarding Engers\u2019s second argument, the Committee noted that the plain language of the amendments indicates that the new benefit payment options apply only to the cash balance benefit, and that communications to employees immediately following the amendments made this point explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">In October 2007, Engers was permitted to file an amended complaint reasserting his Plan amendment claims because they had been properly exhausted. AT &amp; T moved for summary judgment on these claims and Engers argued, again, that key features of the new Plan were not validly adopted by the Plan amendments. The District Court dismissed Engers\u2019s claims, finding that his arguments represented an \u201centirely new legal theory\u201d that had not been pleaded in the complaint. <em>Engers, </em>2010 WL 2326211, *5-6. We agree with Engers that his arguments did not present an entirely new theory and that, in any case, he was not required to plead his legal theory in his complaint. <em>See Skinner v. Switzer, </em>562 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1289, 1296, 179 L.Ed.2d 233 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">As it is not clear whether the District Court reached the merits of Engers\u2019s amendment claims, we address them here. Engers does not contest that the Plan amendments were validly adopted and thus part of the Plan \u2014 rather, he argues that the amendments are not properly construed as establishing the greater-of rule and limitations on certain benefit options. Because the Committee had discretionary authority to construe the Plan, we review its interpretation of the Plan amendments for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Miller v. Am. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Airlines, Inc, </em>632 F.3d 837, 844-45 &amp; n. 2 (3d Cir.2011). We find that the Committee did not abuse its discretion in denying either of Engers\u2019s claims. First, the Committee reasonably concluded that the Plan amendments did not provide participants with double benefits. The only evidence Engers offers in support of his reading of the amendments is the testimony of Brian Byrnes, AT &amp; T\u2019s Human Resources director, who acknowledged that, regarding whether participants could receive the sum of their special update and cash balance benefits, the board \u201cdidn\u2019t say you could. They didn\u2019t say you couldn\u2019t.\u201d He later clarified that providing the sum of the two benefits was inconsistent with the Plan\u2019s design. This testimony shows at most that the language of the Plan amendments was ambiguous. It does not show that the Committee resolved that ambiguity incorrectly, and Engers does not address the Committee\u2019s arguments for its interpretation, which are eminently reasonable. Engers offers no evidence for his second claim regarding benefit payment options, and we agree with the Committee that the plain language of the Plan amendments precludes his claim. Accordingly, AT &amp; T was entitled to summary judgment on Engers\u2019s Plan amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">C. The Disclosure Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Engers claims that AT &amp; T\u2019s disclosures regarding the amended Plan violated three different ERISA provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\"><em>1. Disclosure of Bene\u00f1t Reduction Under ERISA \u00a7 204(h). </em>Engers\u2019s first claim is that AT &amp; T failed to provide adequate advance notice to participants that the Plan amendments \u201cprovide[d] for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual\u201d as required by ERISA \u00a7 204(h), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(h). The District Court found that this claim was governed by Treasury regulations interpreting ERISA \u00a7 204(h), which provide that \u201can amendment to a defined benefit plan affects the rate of future benefit accrual only if it is reasonably expected to change the amount of the future annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age.\u201d 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.411(d)-6T, Q <em>&amp; </em>A-5, 60 Fed. Reg. 64,320, 64,322 (1995). Because even Engers\u2019s expert calculated that retirement benefits available at normal retirement age would be higher under the cash balance formula or special update formula than under the prior plan formula, the court found that AT &amp; T had complied with the regulation and was entitled to summary judgment. <em>Engers, 428 </em>F.Supp.2d at 221-22; <em>Engers, </em>2006 WL 3359722, *2-3. Engers argues that the District Court should not have considered the combined effect of the special update and cash balance formulae when determining whether the Plan amendments resulted in a significant reduction in benefit accruals. Even if this were true, Engers does not show that either formula considered separately would result in lower normal age retirement benefits than those under the old Plan, and his own expert\u2019s report shows the opposite.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The District Court therefore correctly granted summary judgment on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>2. Adequacy of Summary Plan Description Under ERISA \u00a7 102(a). </em>Engers\u2019s next claim is that AT &amp; T\u2019s disclosures explaining the Plan amendments and summary plan description (SPD) describing the amended plan violated ERISA \u00a7 102(a) because they were not \u201cwritten in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant, and ... sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to reasonably apprise such participants and beneficiaries of their rights and obligations under the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. 1022(a). The District Court found that Engers could not recover on this claim because he had failed to show \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d such as \u201c \u2018circumstances ... where the employer has acted in bad faith, or has actively concealed a change in the benefit plan, and the covered employees have been substantively harmed by virtue of the employer\u2019s actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Engers, </em>428 F.Supp.2d at 239 (quoting <em>Ackerman v. Warnaco, Inc., </em>55 F.3d 117, 125 (3d Cir.1995)). Engers contends on appeal that he offered sufficient evidence that AT &amp; T actively concealed certain features of the Plan amendments and that the District Court did not properly apply the summary judgment standard to consider the evidence in the light most favorable to him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">We disagree. At most, Engers\u2019s evidence shows that AT &amp; T was concerned that the possibility of crossover or wear-away would \u201cundercut[] Cash Balance if highlighted or placed in front\u201d and did not want to \u201ctell the bad parts upfront.\u201d But regardless of any reluctance, AT &amp; T provided multiple disclosures describing clearly and in detail the possibility of wear-away. For example, a letter sent to participants only weeks after the Plan amendments were adopted illustrated wear-away by providing examples of the benefits that two hypothetical employees retiring in 1997 \u2014 one under age 55 and one over age 55 \u2014 would receive under the amended Plan, and informed employees that \u201cif you are within 7 years of retirement eligibility under the current plan, your special update will most likely provide a greater benefit than the cash balance feature.\u201d Additionally, AT &amp; T created a pension website that enabled participants to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>their cash balance accounts and identified their \u201ccrossover year \u2014 when your single life annuity (SLA) under Cash Balance exceeds your SLA under your prior accrued pension benefit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Engers also points to evidence that AT &amp; T deliberately avoided comparing benefits under the new Plan to benefits under the old Plan. But as the District Court explained, the comparison insisted upon by Engers would have been misleading. <em>Engers, </em>428 F.Supp.2d at 242-43. As it stood prior to amendment in April 1997, the old Plan would provide fewer benefits to employees than the new Plan. The comparison that Engers contends would show that the new Plan reduced benefits was based on the assumption that AT &amp; T would continue its prior practice of amending the old Plan\u2019s pay average formula to allow employees to benefit from larger salaries (which AT &amp; T was under no obligation to do). But AT &amp; T did not intend to continue that practice \u2014 that was why it adopted the Plan amendments. Even if AT &amp; T should have compared benefits under the old and new plans (a comparison favorable to the new Plan), it certainly was not required to compare benefits under the new Plan to what they might have been had AT &amp; T decided to keep updating the pay average formula.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We conclude that AT &amp; T\u2019s disclosures were adequate and that no reasonable jury could conclude that AT &amp; T actively concealed wear-away or other key plan features from participants. Summary judgment for AT <em>&amp; </em>T on this claim was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\"><em>3. Breach of Fiduciary Duty to Inform Participants. </em>Engers\u2019s final disclosure claim is that AT &amp; T breached its fiduciary duty to provide material information to participants, and specifically that it failed to inform participants of the differing values of optional benefit forms available under the Plan. The District Could held that because Engers had \u201cthe ability to proceed under [ERISA] \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) for Defendants\u2019 alleged violation of [ERISA] \u00a7 102,\u201d he not could not obtain \u201cappropriate equitable relief\u2019 under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). <em>Engers, </em>428 F.Supp.2d at 235-36 (citing <em>Varity Corp. v. Howe, </em>516 U.S. 489, 515, 116 S.Ct. 1065, 134 L.Ed.2d 130 (1996)). AT &amp; T does not defend this conclusion and we agree with Engers that the District Court erred. As we have explained above, Engers\u2019s allegations that AT &amp; T\u2019s 1998 SPD did not comply with ERISA \u00a7 102 cannot support a claim for benefits under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B) because he does not seek benefits promised to him in the SPD. <em>See supra </em>n. 9. Rather, Engers can only obtain equitable relief under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3) for AT &amp; T\u2019s alleged breach of ERISA \u00a7 102. The District Court did not consider whether the availability of one type of equitable relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3) should preclude other types of equitable relief under the same subsection, and our precedent suggests the contrary. <em>See, e.g., Bur-stein </em>334 F.3d at 370-71, 385-87 (considering merits of fiduciary duty claim after affirming dismissal of equitable estoppel claim). Accordingly, Engers\u2019s fiduciary duty claim was not barred under <em>Varity.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">However, we will affirm judgment for AT <em>&amp; </em>T on Engers\u2019s fiduciary duty claim because it has not been adequately pleaded. The Complaint alleges only that AT &amp; T breached its fiduciary duty by failing to disclose \u201cthe disadvantages of the \u2018new\u2019 cash balance features and transitional provisions, compared to the \u2018old\u2019 defined benefit plan,\u201d and contains no allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>regarding the relative value of various benefit options that are available under the cash balance plan. But in this appeal and at least since 2003, Engers has advanced a different argument that AT &amp; T failed to disclosed the \u201crelative values\u201d of benefit payment options <em>(ie., </em>different types of annuities, or a lump sum payment) available from the cash balance benefit, and that AT &amp; T \u201cmisrepresent[ed] ... that the \u2018overall value\u2019 of the options was the same.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This argument \u201cfails at the most basic level because it finds no support in the plain language of [Engers\u2019s] complaint.\u201d <em>Horvath v. Keystone Health Plan E., Inc., </em>333 F.3d 450, 459 (3d Cir.2003). Engers has amended his complaint several times during the decade of litigation before the District Court but has never sought leave to include a claim concerning AT <em>&amp; </em>T\u2019s disclosure of the relative value of benefit options. Because Engers has failed to plead this claim, we will not now consider it on appeal. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">D. The Anti-Backloading Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Engers claims that wear-away resulting from the Plan amendments violates the anti-backloading rule of ERISA \u00a7 204(b), because participants\u2019 benefit accrual rates in later plan years are more than 133 1/3% of the benefit accrual rate during the wear-away period, which he claims was zero. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(b)(1)(B). The District Court rejected this argument because even though early retirement benefits do not increase during wear-away, participants\u2019 cash balance accounts continue to increase. <em>Engers, </em>2010 WL 2326211, *7-9 (citing <em>Register, </em>477 F.3d at 72). Engers argues that accrual of early retirement benefits rather than cash balance amounts should be considered in applying the anti-backloading rule. He points out that the anti-backloading rule applies to the accrual rate of benefits that are \u201cpayable,\u201d which in his view refers to benefits that are immediately payable to a plan participant, <em>ie., </em>early retirement benefits. But the plain language of ERISA \u00a7 204(b) refutes this argument: the anti-backloading rule applies to \u201cthe annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits <em>payable at normal retirement age </em>under the plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(b)(1)(B) (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1054(b)(1)(B)(iii) (in applying antibackloading rule \u201cthe fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded\u201d). Additionally, the statute provides that, in applying the antibackloading rule, \u201cany amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years,\u201d which means that the transition between the old and new plans and resulting wear-away must be disregarded. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1054(b)(1)(B)(i). The District Court therefore correctly rejected Engers\u2019s antibackloading claim premised on the accrual rate of participants\u2019 early retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">E. The Anti-Cutback Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Engers\u2019s final claim is that the amended Plan violates the anti-cutback rule of ERISA \u00a7 204(g)(2), which prohibits the reduction of accrued benefits or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>imposition of greater restrictions on the receipt of accrued benefits. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1054(g)(2); <em>Cent. Laborers\u2019 Pension Fund v. Heinz, </em>541 U.S. 739, 744, 124 S.Ct. 2230, 159 L.Ed.2d 46 (2004). Under the old, pre-1997 Plan, participants retiring between ages 50-55 were entitled to receive their age-55 early retirement benefits, reduced by 6% for each year they were retiring prior to age 55. But the Plan\u2019s age and service requirements did not permit participants to receive benefits before age 50. The Plan amendments removed the age and service restrictions on receipt of benefits prior to age 50, but provided that, like early retirement benefits taken between ages 50-55, benefits taken before age 50 would be also be reduced by 6% for each year a participant retired before age 55. Engers argues that extension of the 6% per year benefit reduction \u2014 which he claims is \u201cactuarially unreasonable\u201d \u2014 to benefits available when retiring before age 50 constitutes the imposition of an additional restriction on benefits in violation of the anti-cutback rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Engers\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, prior to the 1997 amendments, participants could not receive any benefits before age 50 and thus had no \u201c \u2018early retirement benefit\u2019 that was earned by service before the amendment was passed\u201d and then was improperly reduced. <em>Heinz, </em>541 U.S. at 744, 124 S.Ct. 2230. Rather, the Plan amendments simultaneously conferred a right to benefits before age 50 and provided that such benefits would be reduced by 6% for each year that participants retired before age 55. Second, even if participants are considered to have, in some sense, \u201cearned\u201d early retirement benefits before age 50, the Plan amendments did not \u201cimpose materially greater restrictions on the receipt of\u2019 these benefits and did not reduce benefits payable before age 50. Rather such benefits were increased from nothing to a percentage of the age-55 early retirement benefit. We do not see how \u201cin any practical sense\u201d this change could be \u201cviewed as shrinking the value\u201d of participants\u2019 benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 745, 124 S.Ct. 2230. Summary judgment on Engers\u2019s anti-cutback claim was therefore proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">For the reasons set out above, we will affirm the orders of the District Court granting summary judgment to AT &amp; T on all of Engers\u2019s claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">. <em>See Engers v.

The Plan amendments actually made early retirement benefits more generous in some respects by eliminating age and service requirements that had prevented employees from receiving early retirement benefits before age 50.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-15\">. Recall that participants are entitled to the greater of their special update or cash balance benefits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b102-8\">.

We reject Enters\u2019s argument that he pleaded a disparate treatment claim and that this claim is not precluded by ADEA \u00a7 4(i)(4). Even if this claim was properly pleaded, it would arise under ADEA \u00a7 4(a), and thus be barred by ADEA \u00a7 4(f)(4), which by its terms applies to any claim under section 4. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 623(i)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b103-8\">. Because Engers's claim arose in the context of litigation, an argument can be made that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the Committee had conflicting interests when ruling on the claim, which is a factor relevant to the abuse-of-discretion analysis. <em>See Miller, </em>632 F.3d at 845 &amp; n. 3. But Engers does not press this point and, in any case, taking this factor into account would not affect the outcome in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b104-9\">. The expert\u2019s calculation of the special update benefit inaccurately states the value of the special update benefit because it is based on his mistaken view that the special update benefit should not be frozen but should be treated as an increasing benefit. However, the Plan amendments and Plan document make clear that the special update benefit is frozen and does not increase.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b105-6\">. Engers also argues that he was not required to establish extraordinary circumstances under <em>Burstein v. Retirement Account Plan, </em>because in that case we permitted an employee to recover benefits misleadingly promised by an SPD without requiring a showing of extraordinary circumstances. 334 F.3d 365, 376-80 (3d Cir.2003). This confuses two different claims considered in <em>Burstein. </em>We did not require the plan participant in <em>Burstein </em>to show extraordinary circumstances to recover benefits promised in the SPD under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(1)(B). <em>See id. </em>But we did require the participant to show extraordinary circumstances to recover on a separate equitable estoppel claim under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). <em>See id. </em>at 383. Because Engers seeks equitable relief, and not a benefit promised him in his SPD, he must show extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\"><em>CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, </em>562 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1866, 179 L.Ed.2d 843 (2011), does not alter this conclusion. There the Court held that a showing of \u201cdetrimental reliance\u201d is not necessary for all forms of equitable relief under \u00a7 502(a)(3). <em>Id. </em>at 1880-82 (\"Information-related circumstances, violations, and injuries are potentially too various in nature to insist that harm must always meet that more vigorous 'detrimental harm\u2019 standard when equity imposed no such strict requirement.\u201d) However, the Court expressly declined to address \"other prerequisites\u201d for equitable relief, <em>id. </em>at 1883, and thus we see no reason to depart from our longstanding rule that an equitable estoppel claim under \u00a7 502(a)(3) cannot be based merely on \"simple ERISA reporting errors or disclosure violations, such as a variation between a plan summary and the plan itself, or an omission in the disclosure documents,\u201d without a showing of extraordinary circumstances. <em>Burstein, </em>334 F.3d at 383 (quoting <em>Kurz v. Philadelphia Elec. Co., </em>96 F.3d 1544, 1553 (3d Cir.1996)) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b106-6\">. Moreover, AT &amp; T's practice of updating the formula was inconsistent, and we see no objective way for AT &amp; T to predict how it would have made changes to the formula that it did not intend to make.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\">. Engers does not mention on appeal his original breach of fiduciary duty claim predicated on AT &amp; T\u2019s alleged failure to adequately inform plan participants about wear-away and provide a comparison between benefits under the old Plan and the new Plan. Even if these claims are not waived, for the reasons we have set out above, there is no genuine issue of material fact about the adequacy of AT &amp; T\u2019s disclosures on these points, and summary judgment on this claim was proper.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b108-5\">. Engers\u2019s argument that the 6% per year discount rate is \"actuarially unreasonable\" has no bearing on the anti-cutback rule. <em>Berger v. Xerox Corp. Ret. Income Guar. Plan, </em>338 F.3d 755, 762 (7th Cir.2003), on which Engers relies, concerns the requirements of ERISA \u00a7 204(c)(3), not \u00a7 204(g)(2), and Engers has not appealed the District Court's (correct) conclusion that the 6% yearly reduction does not violate ERISA \u00a7 204(c)(3). <em>See Engers, </em>2010 WL 2326211, *9-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
