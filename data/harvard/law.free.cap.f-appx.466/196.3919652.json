Based on our review of the record, we agree that Dacier\u2019s waiver was knowing and voluntary. We therefore deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. See <em>In re: Dacier </em>(B.I.A. May 6, 2011). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
