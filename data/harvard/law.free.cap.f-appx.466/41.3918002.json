(\u201cAirgas\u201d) to enforce a settlement agreement that the parties entered into in May 2010. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-19\">As an initial matter, although the district court did not enter a separate judgment in this case after issuing its order granting Airgas\u2019s motion, this Court nonetheless has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because the order clearly indicated the district court\u2019s intent that the order be the final decision in this case. <em>See Bankers Trust Co. v. Mollis, </em>435 U.S. 381, 387-88, 98 S.Ct. 1117, 55 L.Ed.2d 357 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-20\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s decision whether to enforce a settlement agreement, we review its findings of fact with respect to the agreement for clear error and its legal conclusions <em>de novo. See Omega Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. Omega, S.A., </em>432 F.3d 437, 443 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-21\">Under Connecticut law, a contract is unambiguous where \u201cits language is clear and conveys a definite and precise intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). If a contract does not define a given term, the court should \u201clook to the plain meaning of the language to ascertain whether there is ambiguity\u201d and may refer to \u201cwidespread custom or usage\u201d to define the term. <em>Lee v. BSB Greenwich Mortg. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>267 F.3d 172, 178 (2d Cir.2001)(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>Kumar argues on appeal that the district court erred in finding that Airgas had satisfied its obligation under the settlement agreement to change Kumar\u2019s record in its Human Resource Management System (\u201cHRMS\u201d) to \u201creflect a voluntary quit as opposed to an involuntary termination\u201d because the screen shot of Kumar\u2019s record provided by Airgas indicates that the reason for Kumar\u2019s termination was \u201cResignation-Other Position.\u201d Kumar contends that \u201cResignation-Other Position\u201d does not mean the same thing as \u201cvoluntary quit.\u201d According to Kumar, the notation \u201cResignation-Other Position\u201d falsely indicates that he took another position in the same company (Airgas).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Kumar\u2019s argument is without merit. A \u201cvoluntary\u201d act is one that is \u201cperformed, made, or given of one\u2019s free will,\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary Unabridged </em>2564 (3d ed.1961), and to \u201cquit\u201d means \u201cto give up employment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1867. Thus, a voluntary quit means to \u201cgive up employment\u201d \u201cof one\u2019s free will.\u201d \u201cResignation\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]he act ... of surrendering or relinquishing an office,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1336 (8th ed.2004), and \u201cquit\u201d is a synonym of the verb \u201cresign,\u201d <em>see Roget\u2019s Int\u2019l Thesaurus </em>at entry 448.02 (6th ed.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Kumar has provided no support for his contention that \u201cResignation-Other Position\u201d suggests a transfer within the same company, and in any event, interpreting the phrase in that manner is not inconsistent with a finding that he left his original position voluntarily. <em>See Omega Eng\u2019g, </em>432 F.3d at 446. Thus, the district court correctly held that Airgas had satisfied its obligation to modify Kumar\u2019s HRMS record to \u201creflect a voluntary quit\u201d by changing the reason for Kumar\u2019s termination to \u201cResignation-Other Position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Kumar also argues that the district court erred in finding that Airgas had provided Kumar with \u201cproper documentation\u201d of its modification of Kumar\u2019s HRMS record because the screen shot provided by Airgas was allegedly \u201ctruncated,\u201d as evidenced by the location of the \u201cscroll thumb\u201d on the scroll bar in the screen shot.- However, as Kumar has conceded, the settlement agreement merely requires Airgas to provide Kumar with \u201cdocumentation\u201d of the change, and does not mandate that the documentation be in a specific form. Therefore, the district court did not err in finding that Airgas\u2019s screen shot satisfied the terms of the settlement agreement. <em>See Lee, </em>267 F.3d at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">We have considered all of Kumar\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the order of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
