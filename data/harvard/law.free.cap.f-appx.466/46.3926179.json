WALKER, JR., GERARD E. LYNCH, CHRISTOPHER F. DRONEY, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b70-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b70-16\">Defendant-appellant Pearce Cuthbert appeals from a November 22, 2010, judgment of conviction, entered following a bench trial on stipulated facts, for unlawfully possessing ammunition after having been convicted of a felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Cuthbert argues that the district court erred by denying his motion to suppress the contents of the brown bag that he discarded while fleeing police officers after what he describes as an unlawful seizure. The bag contained 36 rounds of ammunition and a loaded magazine for a handgun. In addition, Cuthbert argues that his sentence \u2014 30 months\u2019 imprisonment, three years\u2019 supervised release, and a $100 mandatory special assessment \u2014 was substantively unreasonable and thus requires resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-17\">Neither argument has merit. Cuthbert was not \u201cseized\u201d for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the police officers initially asked him to stop. No Fourth Amendment seizure occurred until the officers pulled Cuthbert from the fence over which he was attempting to climb. Before that point, no \u201cphysical force\u201d had been used against Cuthbert, nor had he \u201csubmi[tted] to the assertion of authority.\u201d See <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-18\">Our Court has \u201cunderstood the import of <em>Hodari D. </em>to be that \u2018an order to stop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>must be obeyed or enforced physically to constitute a seizure.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Baldwin, </em>496 F.3d 215, 218 (2d Cir.2007), quoting <em>United States v. Swindle, </em>407 F.3d 562, 572 (2d Cir.2005). \u201c[T]o comply with an order to stop \u2014 and thus to become seized \u2014 a suspect must do more than halt temporarily; he must submit to police authority, for there is no seizure without actual submission.\u201d <em>Baldwin, </em>496 F.3d at 218 (internal quotation marks omitted). By momentarily pausing and glancing at the police officers for \u201ca second or two\u201d before continuing to walk away and then taking flight, Cuthbert plainly did not obey the officers\u2019 order to stop or submit himself to their authority. Cuthbert\u2019s seizure argument is therefore unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The parties also debate whether Cuthbert\u2019s eventual arrest after the chase was supported by probable cause. But that issue is immaterial. No evidence was seized from Cuthbert\u2019s person at the time of his arrest, and no incriminating statement resulted. He was convicted on the basis of the contents of the bag that he threw during the chase. Thus, even though the officers seized the bag after subduing and arresting Cuthbert, the district court properly ruled that the bag was seized as abandoned property, not as the fruit of a search incident to arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Finally, Cuthbert argues that 30 months\u2019 imprisonment is an unreasonably long sentence, despite its being seven months below the Guidelines range, because \u201cthe court failed to adequately consider appellant\u2019s extensive efforts at rehabilitation,\u201d which, \u201ccombined with his pro-active substantial assistance to the government,\u201d Cuthbert contends, \u201cdemonstrated a significant basis for the [district court] to find that [Cuthbert\u2019s] change in lifestyle greatly diminished the likelihood of recidivism.\u201d The district court carefully considered these factors in calculating Cuthbert\u2019s sentence. That the court did not weigh them as heavily in Cuthbert\u2019s favor as he would have liked does not make the sentence substantively unreasonable, nor does it transform this case into one of the \u201cexceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>United States v. Cavera, </em>550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). On the contrary, we have no trouble concluding that Cuthbert\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">We have considered Cuthbert\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
