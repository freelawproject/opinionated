O\u2019BRIEN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b783-22\">Everett Brakeman appeals from the district court\u2019s dismissal of his nominal 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition, which it properly characterized as a second 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. His arguments here, as with those presented to the district court, are contrived and frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-23\">In 2005, a federal jury convicted Brakeman of two counts of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(e)(1) and (g)(1); one count of possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (B)(1)(C); and one count of carrying a firearm in relation to a drug-trafficking crime, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(I). He was sentenced to 248 months imprisonment. We affirmed his convictions and sentence on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Brakeman, </em>475 F.3d 1206,1214 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Brakeman filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate his convictions and sentence. He claimed his trial and appellate lawyers had rendered ineffective assistance by failing to object to errors in the presentence report (PSR) regarding his criminal history and his status as a career offender. The district court denied the motion. He did not request a certificate of appealability from this Court. Rather, two years later, he filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in which he raised two grounds for habeas relief: the sentencing court wrongly classified him as a career offender, and the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) was unlawfully using a fabricated PSR. Brakeman sought an order directing the BOP to correct the PSR. He also asked the court to vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">The district court issued an order to show cause why Brakeman\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition should not be dismissed as an unauthorized successive motion under \u00a7 2255. <em>See Caravalho v. Pugh, </em>177 F.3d 1177, 1178 (10th Cir.1999) (noting that a \u00a7 2241 petition is not an alternative remedy to \u00a7 2255 relief). In his response brief, Brakeman insisted the petition arose from the BOP\u2019s execution of the sentence rather than the district court\u2019s imposition of it. The essence of the challenge, he asserted, was that the BOP was using the flawed PSR in determining his rights and privileges as an inmate. He asserted the BOP relied on the PSR to make \u201cadverse determinations regarding custody and security, job opportunities and denial of other rehabilitative programs that is adverse to the Applicant.\u201d (R. 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Several months later, following briefing on the issue of administrative exhaustion, the district court denied the \u00a7 2241 petition because Brakeman had an adequate remedy to challenge his criminal judgment under \u00a7 2255. \u201cMr. Brakemen clearly attempts to make an end run around the gate-keeping requirements of \u00a7 2255 by characterizing his claim as a challenge to his presentence report,\u201d the Court said. (R. at 87). Brakemen was required to request permission to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, a necessary step he has omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The district court was correct: this is as an unauthorized second \u00a7 2255 motion masquerading as a \u00a7 2241 petition. Brakeman\u2019s arguments concerning the propriety of his sentencing, which dominate the petition, are \u00a7 2255 matters, and he admits that sentencing errors form the \u201ccrux\u201d of his challenge. (R. at 33). Although the complaint includes allegations about the BOP\u2019s use of the PSR during Brakeman\u2019s incarceration, the allegations are conclusory and appear to have been contrived to wedge the complaint into a category in which it does not belong.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Brakeman\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition. The district court denied Brakeman\u2019s request to proceed on appeal without prepayment of fees because his appeal was not taken in good faith. He has reapplied here. To qualify, he \u201cmust show a financial inability to pay the required filing fees and the existence of a reasoned, nonfrivolous argument on the law and facts in support of the issues raised on appeal.\u201d <em>DeBardeleben v. Quinlan, </em>937 F.2d 502, 505 (10th Cir.1991). Brakeman has failed to present nonfrivolous arguments. We DENY his request. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>He must pay the filing and docket fees in full to the clerk of the district court. <em>See Kinnell v. Graves, </em>265 F.3d 1125, 1129 (10th Cir.2001).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b783-7\"> Oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.
