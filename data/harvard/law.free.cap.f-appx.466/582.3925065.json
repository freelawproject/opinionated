We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-26\">Chanley moved to disqualify the magistrate judge for bias, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 455(a) and (b)(1). We review the denial of a recusal motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>610 F.3d 1138, 1147 (9th Cir.2010). Chanley\u2019s allegations regarding the magistrate judge\u2019s prior rulings in his criminal case are not such as to demonstrate the requisite bias or prejudice to warrant recusal. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 551, 553, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474; <em>Johnson, </em>610 F.3d at 1147-48; <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>718 F.2d 315, 321 (9th Cir.1983) (even erroneous \u201c[a]dverse rulings do not constitute the requisite bias\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s application of collateral estoppel to dismiss Chanley\u2019s section 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim. <em>See McQuillion v. Schwarzenegger, </em>369 F.3d 1091, 1096 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Matthews v. Macanas, </em>990 F.2d 467, 468 (9th Cir.1993) (per curiam) <em>(abrogated on other grounds as recognized by Papa v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 1004, 1009 n. 12 (9th Cir.2002)). In his criminal case, Chanley moved to suppress evidence on the ground that there were misrepresentations or omissions in the affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant, and that the warrant consequently lacked probable cause. <em>See Matthews, </em>990 F.2d at 468. The district court denied the motion to suppress, Chanley was convicted of receipt and possession of child pornography, and his conviction has been affirmed by this court. <em>United States v. Chanley, </em>445 Fed.Appx. 936, 2011 WL 3290388 (9th Cir.2011). Because the district court in the criminal case already rejected Chanley\u2019s arguments regarding the warrant, Chanley is collaterally es-topped from re-litigating the issue here. <em>See Allen v. McCurry, </em>449 U.S. 90, 91, 105, 101 S.Ct. 411, 66 L.Ed.2d 308 (1980); <em>Matthews, </em>990 F.2d at 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b606-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
