On appeal, he raises two issues: (1) whether the district court abused its discretion by rejecting his contention that a fifteen-year sentence was sufficient because his age had reduced his likelihood of reoffending; and (2) whether the district court\u2019s sentencing enhancement under US. <em>Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) (2010) was invalid because the enhancement was promulgated directly by Congress and therefore contrary to <em>Mistretta v. United States, </em>488 U.S. 361, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-22\">We find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s rejection of Hamby\u2019s contention that his age would significantly reduce his likelihood of reoffending, such that he only needed a fifteen-year sentence. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (stating review standard); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (same). Moreover, we note that Hamby\u2019s 324-month sentence was within his properly-calculated advisory sentencing range of 324-405 months and is therefore entitled to an appellate presumption of reasonableness. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Abu Ali, </em>528 F.3d 210, 261 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-23\">Next, we note that USSG \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(7)(D) increases a defendant\u2019s base offense level by five if the offense involved 600 or more images. That Congress, rather than the Sentencing Commission, promulgated this enhancement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>without moment. Contrary to Hamby\u2019s arguments, <em>Mistretta </em>does not assist him. <em>Mistretta </em>considered whether Congress\u2019 delegation to an independent Federal Sentencing Commission of the authority to promulgate the Sentencing Guidelines violated the separation-of-powers doctrine; the Court held that it did not. <em>Mistretta, </em>488 U.S. at 371, 109 S.Ct. 647. Rather, <em>Mistretta </em>states that \u201cthe Commission is fully accountable to Congress, which can revoke or amend any or all of the Guidelines as it sees fit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 109 S.Ct. 647. The Seventh and Eight Circuits have specifically rejected Hamby\u2019s argument. <em>United States v. Rodgers, </em>610 F.3d 975, 977-78 (7th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Bastian, </em>603 F.3d 460, 464-65 (8th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Hamby\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument as the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before this court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
