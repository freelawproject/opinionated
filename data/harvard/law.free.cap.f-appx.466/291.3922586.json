Coleman also seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of her motions to reconsider. We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because the notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-21\">When the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal must be filed no more than sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). \u201c[T]he timely filing of a notice of appeal in a civil case is a jurisdictional requirement.\u201d <em>Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-22\">The district court\u2019s judgment was entered on September 13, 2010. The district court\u2019s order denying Coleman\u2019s motions to reconsider was entered on November 11, 2010. The notice of appeal was filed on August 5, 2011. Because Coleman failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
