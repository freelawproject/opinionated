On appeal, Olawepo argues that the district court\u2019s 24-month above-Guidelines sentence was substantively unreasonable because it placed too much weight on his prior criminal history and was longer than necessary to comply with the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal, and we discuss these only where necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-9\">Our standard of review for \u201call sentencing decisions \u2014 whether inside or outside the Guidelines range\u201d\u2014is abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 49, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cOur review of challenged sentences is limited to reasonableness, a concept that applies both to the sentence itself and to the procedures employed in arriving at the sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 127 (2d Cir.2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Olawepo asserts only that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. He advances several arguments in support of his position. Turning to Olawepo\u2019s argument that the district court put too much weight on his prior criminal history, \u201cwe have never held that a district court\u2019s particular reliance on one factor to justify departing from the Guidelines is suggestive of unreasonableness; we have only said that <em>\u2018unjustified </em>reliance upon any one factor\u2019 suggests unreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>554 F.3d 240, 246 (2d Cir.2009) (quoting <em>United States v. Rattoballi, </em>452 F.3d 127, 137 (2d Cir.2006)). Olawepo\u2019s argument that the district court erroneously treated a single arrest in 1989 as though it involved multiple arrests and sentences is without merit. Trial counsel made the same argument to the district court, arguing that the court gave too much weight to Olawepo\u2019s 1989 arrest in considering it to cover conduct that spanned six years when it related to only one incident. In response, the district court stated, \u201cI understand that this is all based on the 1989 arrest. I understand that completely.\u201d In any event, the district court considered not just the 1989 arrest, but the fact that Olawepo\u2019s criminal history involved fraudulent conduct, including his use of numerous Social Security numbers and more than 16 different names</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">Olawepo claims that his sentence was longer than necessary to comply with Section 3553(a) because the district court ig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>nored the alternative Guidelines calculation that he presented and never indicated why an above-Guidelines sentence was more appropriate than the Guideline sentence. These claims are belied by the record. Rather than ignore Olawepo\u2019s proposed alternative sentence, the district court stated that it had reviewed and taken into account what Olawepo proposed. The district court had contemplated a 36-month sentence, but \u201c[b]ased on the submissions made after that point\u201d that included Olawepo\u2019s proposed 15 to 21 month sentence, it decided to impose a 24-month sentence. The court indicated at length why it sentenced Olawepo to an above-Guidelines sentence. The district court\u2019s stated reasons included Olawepo\u2019s repeated use of false information to secure his naturalization, his failure to appear for deportation in 1992, and his conflicting statements given during the presentence investigation regarding his personal history. We conclude that the sentence was reasonable. The district court did not exceed its considerable discretion when imposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Accordingly, for the reasons stated, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
