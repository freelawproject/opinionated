Evans appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing her employment discrimination action under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). On appeal, Evans contends that she made plausible allegations of adverse employment action on her disparate treatment and Equal Pay Act claims and that the court erred in dismissing her hostile work environment claim for lack of jurisdiction. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-20\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>Philips v. Pitt Cnty. Mem\u2019l Hosp., 512 </em>F.3d 176, 179-80 (4th Cir.2009). To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a complaint\u2019s \u201c[factual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level,\u201d with \u201cenough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Generally, when <em>ruling on </em>a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a judge must \u201caccept as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>551 U.S. 89, 94, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007). A court is not, however, required \u201cto accept as true allegations that are merely conclusory, unwarranted deductions of fact, or unreasonable inferences\u201d or \u201callegations that contradict matters properly subject to judicial notice or by exhibit.\u201d <em>Veney v. Wyche, </em>293 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">We have reviewed the transcript of the Rule 12(b)(6) hearing, the joint appendix, and the parties\u2019 briefs and find no error in the district court\u2019s decision. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s order dismissing the action on the reasoning of the district court. <em>Evans v. Napolitano, </em>No. 5:10-cv-00036-D, 2011 WL 52438 (E.D.N.C. Jan. 6, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
