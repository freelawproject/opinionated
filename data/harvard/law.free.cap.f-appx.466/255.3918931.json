Counsel for Mason has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising seven issues on Mason\u2019s behalf and questioning the district court\u2019s denial of a competency evaluation requested by the government and its denial of Mason\u2019s suppression motion. Counsel states, however, that he has found no meritorious grounds for appeal. Mason has filed a pro se supplemental brief raising four constitutional issues, which he states he wishes to reserve for a later motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 (West Supp.2011). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">To the extent that the validity of Mason\u2019s guilty plea is before us, we are satisfied that it was a knowing and voluntary plea. Because Mason did not seek to withdraw his plea, any error in the Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 hearing is reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525-26 (4th Cir.2002). We have reviewed the record of the Rule 11 colloquy before the magistrate judge, to which Mason consented, which occurred after a jury had been empanelled for Mason\u2019s trial. We conclude that the magistrate judge adequately complied with Rule 11. Mason\u2019s remaining claims are without merit. He was correctly sentenced as a career offender, which was the determining factor in setting his Guidelines range. The district court\u2019s decision not to depart below the Guidelines range is not renewable. <em>United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 371 (4th Cir.2008). The court\u2019s denial of a three-level adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, USSG \u00a7 3E1.1, which Mason did not request, is not plain error. The record does not establish conclusively that Mason\u2019s attorney was ineffective; therefore this claim is not properly raised on direct appeal. <em>United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). By pleading guilty, Mason waived his right to contest any pre-indictment delay in his prosecution. <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973). No error appears in the district court\u2019s decision, following a hearing, that Mason was competent to stand trial and its consequent denial of the government\u2019s motion for a psychological evaluation. The court\u2019s denial of Mason\u2019s motion to suppress all evidence obtained during his search and arrest is an issue that Mason waived when he entered his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence imposed by the district court. In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and the ripe issues raised in Mason\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
