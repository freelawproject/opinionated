R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b588-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-17\">Matthew Descamps was found guilty of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He had five previous felony convictions. The Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) requires a sentence of at least fifteen years if the defendant has three prior convictions for violent felonies. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The statute defines a violent felony as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year ... that has as an element the ... threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or is burglary ____\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2). At sentencing, the district court concluded that Descamps had three predicate violent felonies \u2014 robbery, burglary, and felony harassment \u2014 and sentenced Descamps to 262 months in custody and five years of supervised release, under the ACCA. Descamps appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-18\">Descamps first argues that all prior convictions that are used to enhance his sentence must be charged in the indictment and submitted to a jury for a finding beyond a reasonable doubt. The Supreme Court has held that prior convictions that increase a sentence beyond a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>maximum do not have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (holding that any fact <em>other than the fact of a prior conviction </em>must be charged in an indictment, submitted to a jury, and proven beyond a reasonable doubt); <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L89.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (prior convictions need not be presented in an indictment). Our circuit precedent follows the Supreme Court\u2019s precedent. <em>United States v. Grisel, </em>488 F.3d 844, 846-47 (9th Cir.2007) (stating that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is still good law and holding the ACCA does not require the government to plead and prove beyond a reasonable doubt a defendant\u2019s prior convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Descamps also argues that his pri- or felonies of burglary and felony harassment do not qualify as violent felonies under the ACCA. Descamps pled guilty to the crime of burglary in violation of California Penal Code (\u201cCPC\u201d) \u00a7 459. The generic definition of burglary is \u201can unlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or other structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 598, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). CPC \u00a7 459 defines burglary as when a \u201cperson ... enters [various structures] ... with intent to commit grand or petit larceny or any felony.\u201d Burglary under \u00a7 459 is categorically broader than generic burglary both because it includes burglary of a tent and because \u201cCalifornia\u2019s definition of \u2018unlawful or unprivileged entry,\u2019 unlike the generic definition, permits a conviction for burglary of a structure open to the public and of a structure that the defendant is licensed or privileged to enter if the defendant enters the structure with the intent to commit a felony.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguila-Montes de Oca, </em>655 F.3d 915, 944 (9th Cir.2011) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">We therefore apply the modified categorical approach. <em>Id. </em>We look at the \u201cstatutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u201d <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). The information charged that Descamps did \u201cwilfully, unlawfully and feloniously enter a building, to-wit: CentroMart.\u201d During the plea colloquy, the prosecutor said that the factual basis for the crime was the \u201cbreaking and entering of a grocery store.\u201d Descamps made no objection to this statement of factual basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">We hold that the guilty plea and conviction necessarily rested on facts that satisfy the elements of the generic definition of burglary. The charging document shows that Descamps pled guilty to entering a building, and the plea colloquy establishes that he did so in an unlawful way (by \u201cbreaking and entering\u201d) in the generic sense. We reject as fanciful Descamps\u2019s argument that \u201cbuilding\u201d could have meant a tent. The combination of facts stated in the information and plea colloquy show that Descamps\u2019s conviction necessarily rested on facts identifying the burglary as generic. <em>See Aguila-Montes, </em>655 F.3d at 937.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-9\">We also reject Descamps\u2019s claim that his Washington state conviction for felony harassment is not a violent felony. The amended information charged Descamps with knowingly threatening to kill a judge in violation of the Revised Code of Washington \u00a7 9A.46.020(1)(a). Descamps pled guilty. Descamps argues that a threat to kill does not necessarily have as an element a threatened use of physical force. We reject this argument. A finding that a person threatened to kill neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>sarily requires a finding of \u201cthreatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">The district court correctly held that Descamps had three prior violent felonies and correctly applied the ACCA to Descamps.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b590-18\">. Descamps has filed a supplemental brief with our permission in addition to those filed by his attorney. Construing the pleading liberally, Descamps has asserted a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. But this type of claim is more properly raised by collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, because in such a proceeding facts concerning the representation can be developed, and not on direct appeal, so we decline to address the claim. <em>United States v. Pino, </em>104 F.3d 297, 299 (9th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
