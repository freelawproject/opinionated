R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b605-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In these consolidated appeals, Francisco Javier Duarte-Sabori appeals from the 63-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for re-entry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and from the consecutive four-month sentence imposed following revocation of supervised release. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Duarte-Sabori contends that the district court erred by failing to explain its decision to deny a departure for cultural assimilation. He also contends that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors and the district court\u2019s decision to impose a consecutive sentence for the supervised release violation. The district court did not procedurally err, and Duarte-Sabori\u2019s below-Guidelines sentence is reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a) and 3583(e). <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.3(f) (recommending that a supervised release revocation sentence be ordered to be served consecutively to \u201cany sentence of imprisonment that the defendant is serving\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">Duarte-Sabori also contends that the government acted arbitrarily by refusing to move for a third point reduction for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(b). His argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>581 F.3d 994, 1002-04 (9th Cir.2009) (district court did not err in declining to grant additional one-level reduction because defendant\u2019s refusal to waive appellate rights was rational basis for the government\u2019s decision not to file a section 3E1.1(b) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b605-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
