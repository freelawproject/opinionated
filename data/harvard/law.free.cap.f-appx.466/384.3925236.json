He now appeals, arguing that the district court erred by ordering that his federal sentence run consecutively to any sentence that might be imposed in pending state criminal cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal based on a waiver contained in Bramlett\u2019s plea agreement, or for summary affirmance on the basis of binding circuit precedent. Alternatively, the Government seeks an extension of time to file a brief. Bramlett has not addressed the effect of the waiver provision on his pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">We need not reach the waiver issue because, as Bramlett concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Brown, </em>920 F.2d 1212, 1216-17 (5th Cir.1991), <em>abrogated on other grounds by United States v. Candia, </em>454 F.3d 468, 472-73 (5th Cir.2006), in which we held that a district court may order a term of imprisonment to run consecutively to a yet-to-be-imposed state sentence. Despite Bramlett\u2019s arguments that <em>Brown </em>was incorrectly decided, <em>Brown </em>remains the law of this circuit. <em>See Setser v. United States,</em>-U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 1463,1466-74, 182 L.Ed.2d 455 (2012). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motions to dismiss and, alternatively, for an extension of time are DENIED. Further, defense counsel is WARNED that failing to address a waiver-of-appeal provision in a reply after the Government has raised it wastes judicial resources and will invite sanctions. <em>See United States v. Gaitan, </em>171 F.3d 222, 223-24 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
