Webster is serving a life sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">By moving to proceed IFP, Webster is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a Rule 36 motion and a motion for reconsideration under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See United States v. Mueller, </em>168 F.3d 186,188 (5th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>128 F.3d 885, 892 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Webster argues that the district court erred in finding that it did not need to amend the original Statement of Reasons for his sentence to reflect that his offense level was 41. He also argues that, because the Statement of Reasons stated that his criminal history category was I, not III, the district court erred in sentencing him based upon a criminal history category of III. Finally, he states that the district court erred in imposing written conditions in the written judgment that were not orally pronounced at sentencing. He asks that the case be remanded to the district court so it can sentence him based upon a criminal history category of I and a base offense level of 41 and that he be resentenced so he can contest the additional conditions of supervised released imposed by the written judgment. He alternatively asks that those conditions be removed from the written judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">Webster\u2019s Rule 36 motion and motion for reconsideration did not seek to correct an error that was the result of oversight or omission such that it may be corrected pursuant to Rule 36. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36; <em>United States v. Slanina, </em>359 F.3d 356, 357 (5th Cir.2004). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-16\">Because the appeal lacks any arguable merit, Webster\u2019s IFP motion is DENIED, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Webster is WARNED that the filing of frivolous pleadings in the future may subject him to sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court and any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
