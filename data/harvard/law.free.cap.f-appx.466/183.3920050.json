On appeal, Gay argues that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence, erring in applying three Guidelines enhancements and in failing to explain its chosen sentence. We vacate Gay\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">We review a sentence imposed by a district court under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Lynn, </em>592 F.3d 572, 578 (4th Cir.2010) (abuse of discretion standard of review applicable when defendant properly preserves a claim of sentencing error \u201c[b]y drawing arguments from [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553 [ (2006) ] for a sentence different than the one ultimately imposed\u201d). We must first review the sentence for significant procedural error, including such errors as improperly calculating the Guidelines range, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Layton, </em>564 F.3d 330, 334 (4th Cir.2009). In applying a sentencing enhancement, the district court must find by a preponderance of the evidence that the conduct underlying the enhancement occurred. <em>See United States v. Grubbs, </em>585 F.3d 793, 803 (4th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Gay contends that the district court erred in applying enhancements pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1 (b)(6), 3A1.2 (c)(1), and 3C1.2 (2010), because the court adopted the presentence report\u2019s (\u201cPSR\u201d) calculations without requiring the Government to present additional evidence at sentencing to support the PSR\u2019s factual findings. When a defendant disputes information contained in a PSR, he has \u201can affirmative duty to make a showing that the information ... is unreliable, and articulate the reasons why the facts contained therein are untrue or inaccurate.\u201d <em>United States v. Terry, </em>916 F.2d 157, 162 (4th Cir.1990). Without such an affirmative showing, a district court is free to adopt the PSR\u2019s factual findings. <em>Id. </em>Because Gay did not present any evidence other than his own conclusory allegations to contradict the reports on which the PSR\u2019s findings were based, we conclude that he failed to make an affirmative showing that the PSR\u2019s findings were untrue or inaccurate, and the district court did not err in adopting those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">Because Gay preserved his challenge to the district court\u2019s explanation of his sentence by requesting a sentence different than the 120-month sentence he received, we review the explanation for abuse of discretion. <em>See Lynn, </em>592 F.3d at 578. \u201cWhen rendering a sentence, the district court \u2018must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>564 F.3d 325, 328 (4th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586) (emphasis omitted). Accordingly, a sentencing court must apply the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the particular facts presented and must \u201cstate in open court\u201d the particular reasons that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>support its chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). The court\u2019s explanation need not be exhaustive; it must be \u201csufficient \u2018to satisfy the appellate court that [the district court] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decision-making authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Boulware, </em>604 F.3d 832, 837 (4th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)) (alterations in <em>Boulware). </em>Moreover, the explanation must be sufficient to allow for \u201cmeaningful appellate review\u201d such that the appellate court need \u201cnot guess at the district court\u2019s rationale.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>564 F.3d at 329-30 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Here, in announcing the judgment, the district court did not state any reasons to support its chosen sentence or make any reference to the Guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or the arguments of the parties. The court did not otherwise indicate that it had made an individualized assessment; for example, the court did not address defense counsel\u2019s argument that, at the time of the offense, Gay had suffered from a mental infirmity rendering him less culpable for his conduct. Contrary to the Government\u2019s argument, the error was not harmless, as we cannot conclude from the record before us that the district court\u2019s consideration of Gay\u2019s arguments would not have affected the sentence imposed. <em>See Boulware, </em>604 F.3d at 838. Given the lack of explanation for the 120-month sentence, we conclude that the district court erred in imposing a procedurally unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We therefore vacate Gay\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
