Except for Mona\u2019s sentence, which we VACATE and REMAND for re-sentencing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-17\">The six appellants were all associated, in varying degrees, with the Barrio Azteca (BA) criminal enterprise.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BA is a prison gang that was founded in 1985 by inmates originally from El Paso, Texas, who were incarcerated in the Texas Department of Corrections (TDC) prison sys<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>tem. At the time of the appellants\u2019 trial in 2008, the BA\u2019s criminal operations and influence had grown to encompass various TDC and federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facilities, certain West Texas cities, and the city of Juarez, Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The BA\u2019s primary criminal activity involved the extortion of p\u00e1yments (known as <em>\u201ccuotas </em>\u201d) from narcotics traffickers (known as <em>\u201ctiendas </em>\u201d) who sold illegal drugs in BA territory. The BA ensured that the <em>tiendas </em>would pay the requisite <em>cuotas </em>through the threat and, if necessary, use, of violence, including murder. Once collected from the <em>tiendas, cuotas </em>would be converted into money orders so that they could be funneled into the prison commissary accounts of incarcerated BA leaders and senior members.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">In addition to collecting <em>cuotas, </em>the BA also acted as a facilitator and enforcer of the illegal narcotics trade by: (1) serving as a source for <em>tiendas </em>to obtain additional supplies of narcotics; (2) collecting delinquent payments owed to <em>tiendas; </em>(8) restraining others from selling drugs in competition with the BA\u2019s CMoia-paying <em>tiendas; </em>(4) engaging in sales of narcotics; (5) importing and transporting drugs for the <em>La Linea </em>drug cartel, which operates in Juarez, Mexico; and (6) committing assaults and other violent crimes on behalf of the <em>La Linea </em>cartel.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The BA was organized in a hierarchical, paramilitary manner. The most senior BA position was captain <em>(\u201ccapo\u201d), </em>then lieutenant, sergeant, soldier <em>(\u201csoldado </em>\u201d), and, finally, prospective member (\u201cesquina\u201d). The <em>capos, </em>most of whom were incarcerated, ran the organization by directing orders, often through direct communication or coded letters known as <em>\u201cwhilas </em>\u201d or <em>\u201cestucas,\u201d </em>to lieutenants and sergeants, who would then carry out the <em>capos\u2019 </em>instructions or delegate the tasks to more junior members.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">The appellants have all been convicted of illegal acts that occurred in association with the BA criminal enterprise between 2003 and 2008. Specifically, Manuel Cardoza, Benjamin Alvarez, and Carlos Perea, who were all <em>capos, </em>each received multiple life sentences for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1956(h), 1962(c), and 1962(d), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. Eugene Mona, who was a lieutenant, received a life sentence for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d). Said Francisco Herrera, who was a sergeant, received multiple life sentences for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951, 1962(c), and 1962(d), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846. Arturo Enriquez, who was either a <em>soldado </em>or an <em>esquina, </em>received 180 months\u2019 imprisonment for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">Collectively, the appellants raise fifteen issues on appeal. Cardoza, Alvarez, Mona, Herrera, and Enriquez challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their respective convictions. Cardoza, Mona, and Herrera contend that the district court sentenced them to life imprisonment in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cardoza and Alvarez argue that the district court\u2019s sentencing procedures ran afoul of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Cardoza, Alvarez, and Perea challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for a new trial based on the allegedly extreme jury protection measures imposed by the district court. Cardoza and Perea maintain that the district court erred in denying their motion for a new trial based on the government\u2019s alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>suppression of evidence in contravention of <em>Brady v. Maryland.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>Alvarez argues that the district court\u2019s admission of Government\u2019s Exhibits 358 and 354 violated the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause. Perea contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for an evidentiary sentencing hearing. Herrera and Enriquez appeal the district court\u2019s alleged reliance on improper information contained in the pre-sentence report. Enriquez maintains that the district court erred in denying Enriquez\u2019s motion to suppress and motion for severance. Finally, Herrera claims that the district court erred in admitting various unspecified exhibits into evidence because such exhibits lacked the proper foundation.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Cardoza, Alvarez, Mona, Herrera, and Enriquez appeal the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their respective convictions. Where, as in this case, the appellant moved for judgment of acquittal before the district court, we review the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction by considering whether any \u201crational jury could have found the essential elements of the offenses beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>453 F.3d 252, 256 (5th Cir.2006). This review is \u201chighly deferential to the verdict.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno-Gonzalez, </em>662 F.3d 369, 372 (5th Cir.2011) (quoting <em>United States v. Hams, </em>293 F.3d 863, 869 (5th Cir.2002)). \u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every rational hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except guilt, provided a reasonable trier of fact could find the evidence establishes guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Valdez, </em>453 F.3d at 256 (quoting <em>United States v. Pruneda-Gonzalez, </em>953 F.2d 190, 193 (5th Cir.1992)). We, therefore, do not consider whether the jury\u2019s verdict was correct, but instead focus upon the verdict\u2019s reasonableness. <em>Moreno-Gonzalez, </em>662 F.3d at 372 (citing <em>United States v. Williams, </em>264 F.3d 561, 576 (5th Cir.2001)). Finally, in conducting this inquiry, we view the evidence and the inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the verdict, and resolve all conflicts in the evidence in favor of the verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\n<em>1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Cardoza and Alvarez challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), which prohibits, among other things, participation in a conspiracy to engage in money laundering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(a). In order to prove a conspiracy under \u00a7 1956(a), the government must show that the defendant knew of the money laundering scheme, voluntarily joined it, and possessed the requisite intent to commit the underlying \u00a7 1956(a) offense. <em>United States v. Ismoila, </em>100 F.3d 380, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Cardoza and Alvarez argue that the evidence was insufficient to show that they knew the money they admittedly received into their prison commissary accounts constituted the proceeds of unlawful activity. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">Through the testimony of multiple law enforcement and BA witnesses, the government established Cardoza\u2019s and Alvarez\u2019s positions as two of the leaders of a criminal enterprise designed to funnel extorted <em>cuotas </em>into the prison commissary accounts of high ranking BA members. This system involved two basic stages. First, the non-incarcerated BA members would extort weekly <em>cuotas </em>from narcotics traffickers operating in the BA\u2019s territory. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Once collected, they would then transfer the <em>cuota </em>funds to the prison commissary accounts of senior BA members, generally in the form of money orders. These money orders would typically be sent under fictitious names and addresses in order to conceal the senders\u2019 identities and the illicit source of the funds. The evidence sufficiently demonstrated that Cardoza and Alvarez knowingly and voluntarily participated in this CM,oia-funneling enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">In Cardoza\u2019s case, the evidence showed that he directed the distribution of <em>cuota </em>funds into the commissary accounts of other BA members and also personally received <em>cuota </em>money into his own commissary account. Cardoza transmitted directions regarding <em>cuota </em>deposits through heavily-coded messages, which were introduced by the government at trial. The government also introduced conversations between Cardoza and Mona, who served as Cardoza\u2019s \u201cbridge\u201d to the outside world, wherein Cardoza ordered that a certain BA member should no longer receive a share of the <em>cuota </em>collections due to the member\u2019s upcoming release from prison. Furthermore, a former BA member, Gerardo Hernandez, testified that Cardoza ordered him, upon his release from prison in 2003, to investigate the cause of a decrease in <em>cuota </em>transfers to commissary accounts. Cardoza later wrote a letter ordering the BA to put David Merez \u201con ice\u201d because Merez was responsible for this <em>cuota </em>shortfall.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">similarly, in Alvarez\u2019s case, Gustavo Gallardo \u2014 a former BA member who testified extensively about the structure of the BA and his involvement in collecting cuotas\u2014 stated that he previously sent <em>cuota </em>money to Alvarez\u2019s commissary account. Gallardo\u2019s transfer of the funds was not a random act of benevolence; Gallardo specifically sent the money to Alvarez because Alvarez was a BA <em>capo.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Another BA member, Roberto Duran, testified that Alvarez once sent him a letter ordering that he send money to Alvarez, and that Duran eventually obtained the funds that he was ordered to send to Alvarez. Officer Sanchez similarly testified about a letter, which was admitted into evidence, that Alvarez sent to his \u201cbridge\u201d informing her. how to properly send money . orders to prisoners.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">Given this evidence, we hold that a rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Cardoza and Alvarez knowingly and voluntarily engaged in a conspiracy to funnel <em>cuota </em>payments, and also knowingly received <em>cuota </em>funds into their commissary accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">Cardoza, Alvarez, and Herrera challenge the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions of conspiracy to traffic in narcotics under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To convict a defendant of conspiring to traffic in narcotics, the \u201cgovernment must prove: 1) the existence of an agreement between two or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>more persons to violate federal narcotics laws; 2) the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the agreement; and 3) the defendant\u2019s voluntary participation in the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>79 F.3d 413, 423 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>United States v. Gallo, </em>927 F.2d 815, 820 (5th Cir.1991)). These elements \u201cmay be inferred from the development and collocation of circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). However, a defendant\u2019s \u201c[m]ere presence at the scene of the crime or close association with co-conspirators will not alone support an inference of conspiracy but are factors that the jury may consider in finding conspiratorial activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Gallo, </em>927 F.2d at 820).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u25a0 Cardoza and Alvarez argue that there was no evidence indicating that they were aware of or participated in the BA\u2019s drug trafficking activity. They contend that the drug trafficking activities of other BA members were unilateral endeavors by individual members, which lacked any connection to the BA criminal enterprise. Cardoza supports this contention by pointing out that he was incarcerated throughout the drug trafficking conspiracy. Cardoza and Alvarez also point out that the record is devoid of evidence directly connecting the incarcerated <em>capos </em>to the drug trafficking activities of free BA members.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We nevertheless hold that a rational jury could have reasonably inferred\u2014 based on the BA\u2019s structure and objectives, and the evidence linking the two appellants to the BA \u2014 that Cardoza and Alvarez were aware of and encouraged the BA\u2019s narcotics trafficking. For instance, the record indicates that the free BA members who collected and sent the <em>cuotas </em>were generally not permitted to keep any portion of the <em>cuota </em>collections for themselves. Instead, all of the <em>cuotas </em>were generally funneled to the incarcerated BA leadership. This raises the question of how the free rank-and-file BA members (as well as some free members of the BA leadership) earned any money. The evidence indicated that they did so, at least in part, through narcotics trafficking. Furthermore, there was evidence showing that, unlike <em>tiendas, </em>BA members who sold drugs were not required to pay any <em>cuotas </em>to the BA leadership. BA members could keep the proceeds of their drug sales for themselves. Given the existence of this <em>cuota </em>exemption, which incentivized free BA\u2019s to deal in narcotics, and the practical need for free BA members to earn money, it could be inferred that Cardoza and Alvarez had knowledge of, encouraged, and thus participated in, a narcotics trafficking conspiracy that was essential to the survival of the BA\u2019s overall <em>cuota </em>laundering scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">Moreover, the evidence indicated that BA members would supply <em>tiendas </em>with drugs if they lacked a sufficient supply. Thus, the BA would support the businesses of drug dealers, who would then regularly pay <em>cuotas </em>to the BA, which would then be funneled to Cardoza, Alvarez, and other BA leaders. Given this arrangement, the jury could have reasonably inferred that Cardoza and Alvarez, who benefitted from BA drug sales to <em>tiendas, </em>participated in a conspiracy to traffic narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">With regard to Herrera, his brief indicates that he challenges the sufficiency of the evidence underlying all of his convictions; however, the brief fails to actually discuss Herrera\u2019s conviction pursuant \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. We therefore hold that, to the extent Herrera intended to appeal this conviction, his claim is waived as inadequately briefed. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 438 (5th Cir.2001) (\u201cGenerally speaking, a defendant waives an issue if he fails to adequately brief it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Nonetheless, because it bears upon Herrera\u2019s substantive RICO conviction, discussed <em>infra, </em>we briefly note our conclusion that the evidence sufficiently supported Herrera\u2019s conviction under \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. The jury heard testimony from at least two BA members who discussed Herrera\u2019s drug trafficking activities. For instance, Jose Martin Garcia testified that Herrera owned his own <em>tienda, </em>known as Jaguars, where BA members would sell cocaine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> BA member Josu\u00e9 Aguirre, who referred to Herrera as his \u201cright hand man,\u201d similarly testified that he used to accompany Herrera while Herrera sold drugs at various bars, including Jaguars. Thus, the evidence sufficiently demonstrated that Herrera engaged in narcotics trafficking in association with the BA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Cardoza, Alvarez, and Herrera conspired to traffic in narcotics in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a) and 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">8.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">Herrera and Enriquez challenge the sufficiency of the evidence supporting their convictions of conspiracy to commit extortion under the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To prove a violation of the Hobbs Act, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that a defendant induced, or attempted or conspired to induce, a person to part with property; (2) while acting knowingly and willfully by means of extortion; and (3) that the extortionate transaction delayed, interrupted, or adversely affected interstate commerce. <em>United States v. Mann, </em>493 F.3d 484, 494 (5th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Snyder, </em>930 F.2d 1090, 1093 (5th Cir.1991). To establish a conspiracy under the Hobbs Act, the government must prove \u201can agreement between two or more persons to commit a crime, and an overt act by one of the conspirators to further the conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Box, </em>50 F.3d 345, 349 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>United States v. Stephens, </em>964 F.2d 424, 427 (5th Cir.1992)). However, \u201c[p]roof of a conspiracy does not require direct evidence of an actual agreement between the co-conspirators, but may be inferred from circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Wright, </em>797 F.2d 245, 253 (5th Cir.1986) (citing <em>United States v. Reed, </em>715 F.2d 870, 874 (5th Cir.1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The government presented evidence indicating that Herrera was a BA member who would assist the BA with opening <em>tiendas </em>and collecting <em>cuotas. </em>Herrera eventually obtained the rank of BA sergeant and was placed in charge of <em>cuota </em>collections for the east side of El Paso. The jury also heard evidence that Herrera was involved in multiple assaults, including at least one assault on a drug dealer who had not been paying <em>cuotas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">With regard to Enriquez, the evidence showed that he admitted to El Paso detectives that he collected <em>cuotas </em>for the BA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>BA member Eric Saucedo also testified about an instance where Enriquez accompanied Saucedo and another BA member, Serio Munoz, on a visit to threaten a drug dealer named Jose Luis Oviedo for failing to pay <em>cuotas. </em>Enriquez acted as a \u201clookout\u201d on this visit, which ended when Munoz shot and killed Oviedo. Detective Yvette Nevarez also testified that Enriquez, while being interviewed for a second time by police, stated that he went to Oviedo\u2019s home to collect <em>cuotas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Based on the foregoing evidence, the jury could have determined that Herrera and Enriquez were knowing and willful conspirators in an enterprise designed to extort <em>cuotas </em>from drug traffickers in contravention of the Hobbs Act. The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the BA\u2019s extortion of <em>cuotas </em>affected interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Our caselaw provides that illegal activity need only \u201cslightly\u201d affect interstate commerce to fall under the purview of the Hobbs Act, and that this inquiry is made on a \u201ccase-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Box, </em>50 F.3d at 351. Similarly, in <em>Mann, </em>we stated that our prior decision in <em>\u201cBox </em>demonstrates that a generalized connection between the alleged criminal activity and interstate commerce is sufficient to sustain a conviction of <em>conspiracy </em>to violate the Hobbs Act.\u201d <em>Mann, </em>493 F.3d at 495. Furthermore, with regard to Hobbs Act cases involving drug trafficking, we have held that \u201cinterfering with or facilitating narcotics trafficking [is] sufficient to create an effect on interstate commerce, since drugs are traded on an interstate market.\u201d <em>United States v. Villafranca, </em>260 F.3d 374, 378 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Box, </em>50 F.3d at 353).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">In this case, the evidence indicated that Herrera and Enriquez interfered with the drug trade by participating in the BA\u2019s conspiracy to extort <em>cuotas </em>from drug traffickers through the threat and, if necessary, use, of violence. Given this activity \u2014 which also involved coordination between free BA members and prisoners incarcerated in different states, and between individuals on both sides of the United States-Mexico border \u2014 a rational jury could have found that the BA\u2019s extortion conspiracy affected interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Herrera and Enriquez engaged in a conspiracy to commit extortion in violation of the Hobbs Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-12\">Cardoza, Alvarez, and Herrera appeal the sufficiency of the evidence underlying them convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(c), which prohibits engaging in the affairs of an enterprise through a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To establish a \u00a7 1962(c) violation, the \u201cgovernment must prove (1) the existence of an enterprise that affects interstate or foreign commerce, (2) that the defendant was employed by or associated with the enterprise, (3) that the defendant participated in the conduct of the enterprise\u2019s affairs, and (4) that the participation was through a pattern of racketeering activity.\u201d <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>401 F.3d 290, 297 (5th Cir.2005) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Cardoza, Alvarez, and Herrera only dispute the last two elements of their respective \u00a7 1962(c) convictions, arguing that the evidence was insufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>to demonstrate that: (1) they \u201cparticipated\u201d in the BA; and (2) their alleged participation was through a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In order to satisfy \u00a7 1962(c)\u2019s third element, the \u201cdefendant must have participated in the operation or management of the enterprise itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Reves v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>507 U.S. 170, 185, 113 S.Ct. 1163, 122 L.Ed.2d 525 (1993)). However, \u201c[a]n enterprise is \u2018operated\u2019 not just by upper management but also by lower rung participants in the enterprise who are under the direction of upper management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Reves, </em>507 U.S. at 184, 113 S.Ct. 1163). We can easily conclude that the government presented ample evidence, some of which is discussed <em>supra, </em>that Cardoza and Alvarez, as BA <em>capos, </em>and Herrera, as a BA sergeant under the direction of the upper management (i.e., the capos), participated in the BA, thus satisfying \u00a7 1962(c)\u2019s third element.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">With regard to \u00a7 1962(c)\u2019s fourth element, RICO defines a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity\u201d as requiring \u201cat least two [predicate] acts of racketeering activity.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(5). Section 1961(1) sets forth numerous criminal statutes that can constitute predicate acts of \u201cracketeering activity,\u201d including 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 1956. It also provides that racketeering activity includes the \u201cbuying, selling, or otherwise dealing in a controlled substance or listed chemical (as defined in section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act), punishable under any law of the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1)(D). Thus, racketeering activity includes conduct proscribed by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. This court has also explained that in order to \u201cshow the existence of a pattern of racketeering activity, the government must establish (1) that the racketeering acts are related and (2) that they amount to or pose a threat of continued criminal activity.\u201d <em>Delgado, </em>401 F.3d at 298 (citing <em>H.J. Inc. v. Nw. Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 239, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Section 1962(c)\u2019s fourth element was sufficiently established in all three appellants\u2019 cases. At trial, Cardoza and Alvarez were both convicted of conspiring to launder <em>cuotas </em>to prison commissary accounts in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). Cardoza, Alvarez, and Herrera were all convicted of conspiring with the BA to traffic narcotics in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. And Herrera was convicted of conspiring to commit extortion in contravention of the Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Thus, all three appellants committed two predicate racketeering acts. All of these predicate racketeering acts were also related as they were committed in furtherance of the BA\u2019s business. <em>See id. </em>(providing that RICO\u2019s \u201crelated acts\u201d prong is satisfied when the acts were committed in furtherance of the criminal enterprise\u2019s business).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">Furthermore, the government sufficiently demonstrated that the appellants\u2019 racketeering acts posed a threat of continued criminal activity. In <em>Delgado, </em>we held that a criminal enterprise\u2019s regular collection of \u201cthe dime\u201d from drug dealers \u201cevidenced a \u2018specific threat of repetition extending indefinitely into the future.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Nw. Bell, </em>492 U.S. at 242, 109 S.Ct. 2893). Similar to \u201cthe dime\u201d in <em>Delgado, </em>the BA regularly collected <em>cuotas </em>from drug dealers operating in the BA\u2019s territory and, absent RICO prosecution, would likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>have continued to do so into the future. Thus, based on <em>Delgado, </em>the continuity requirement is met in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">We hold that the evidence was sufficient for a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Cardoza, Alvarez, and Herrera engaged in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of \u00a7 1962(c) of RICO.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">5.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Cardoza, Alvarez, Herrera, and Mona appeal the sufficiency of the evidence underlying their convictions for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d), which prohibits, among other things, conspiring to engage in the affairs of an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u201cTo prove a RICO conspiracy, the government must establish (1) that two or more people agreed to commit a substantive RICO offense and (2) that the defendant knew of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296 (quoting <em>United States v. Posadar-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 857-58 (5th Cir.1998)). The government may establish these elements with circumstantial evidence. <em>Id. </em>Critically, unlike a \u00a7 1962(c) conviction, which requires a showing of two predicate acts constituting a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity,\u201d a \u00a7 1962(d) conspirator \u201cneed not have committed or agreed to commit the two predicate acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Salinas v. United States, </em>522 U.S. 52, 61-66, 118 S.Ct. 469, 139 L.Ed.2d 352 (1997)). Instead, the conspirator \u201cneed only have known of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Based on our discussion in the preceding subsections, we hold that there was sufficient evidence for a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that Cardoza, Alvarez, and Herrera knowingly agreed to engage in the BA\u2019s criminal enterprise in violation of \u00a7 1962(d) of RICO. Therefore, we must only discuss Mona\u2019s remaining claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Mona\u2019s challenge is unique because, unlike the other three appellants, he did not commit any predicate RICO offenses. Mona was only convicted of conspiring to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity. Nevertheless, <em>Delgado </em>makes clear that a co-conspirator need not commit a predicate RICO act to violate \u00a7 1962(d): he \u201cneed only have known of and agreed to the overall objective of the RICO offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We hold that the evidence sufficiently indicated that Mona knew of and agreed to further the overall objectives of the BA enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">For instance, the evidence established that Mona was a BA lieutenant who served as the \u201cbridge\u201d (i.e. the communication link) between <em>capo </em>Cardoza and other BA members. Mona would communicate with Cardoza through heavily-coded letters, telephone calls, and prison visits, and then Mona would either forward the communications onward or personally direct Cardoza\u2019s orders to other BA members. Also, on behalf of <em>capo </em>David Merez, Mona delivered messages, provided transportation to other BA members, and served as a conduit for transferring <em>cuota </em>money. This evidence sufficiently demonstrated that Mona knowingly and intentionally assisted in the perpetuation of the BA\u2019s extortion and money laundering scheme. Accordingly, the evidence was sufficient to enable a rational jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mona knew of and agreed to further the objectives of the BA.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Cardoza, Mona, and Herrera challenge their sentences to life imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d) because the sentences aEegedly exceeded the statutory maximum authorized by the jury\u2019s verdict in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Cotton</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we hold that Cardoza\u2019s and Herrera\u2019s claims lack merit. Conversely, as the government does not dispute that Mona\u2019s sentence contravenes <em>Apprendi </em>we vacate Mona\u2019s sentence and remand Mona\u2019s case for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">When, as here, the appellant failed to raise an objection to his sentence at the district court level, we apply a plain error standard of review, \u201cwhich requires considerable deference to the district court.\u201d <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391 (5th Cir.2007). Under the plain error standard, the appellant must demonstrate: \u201c(1) there was error, (2) that was plain, (3) the error affects substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Blocker, </em>612 F.3d 413, 415-16 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. This paradigm shifts, however, when a sentence is reviewed on appeal for plain error. <em>Cotton, </em>535 U.S. at 627-33, 122 S.Ct. 1781. In such instances, even if the court failed to instruct the jury to make specific findings justifying an increase in the maximum sentence imposed upon a defendant, the sentence will nevertheless be upheld where the evidence justifying the increased sentence was \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633,122 S.Ct. 1781.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The <em>Cotton </em>decision is dispositive of Cardoza\u2019s and Herrera\u2019s claims in this case. In <em>Cotton, </em>the operative indictment charged the defendants with conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute a \u201cdetectable amount\u201d of cocaine; however, the indictment did not allege any threshold quantities of drugs to enable enhanced penalties under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 628, 122 S.Ct. 1781. The jury found the defendants guilty of the alleged conspiracy but did not make any findings regarding the specific amounts of cocaine that the defendants conspired to possess and distribute. <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, at sentencing, the district court increased the statutory m\u00e1ximums of the defendants\u2019 sentences by finding that their respective offenses involved specific quantities of cocaine, ranging from 500 grams to 1.5 kilograms of cocaine base. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Relying on <em>Apprendi, </em>the defendants appealed the district court\u2019s decision because \u201cthe issue of drug quantity was neither alleged in the indictment nor submitted to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the petit jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628-29, 122 S.Ct. 1781. The Fourth Circuit vacated the defendants\u2019 convictions and the government appealed to the Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 629,122 S.Ct. 1781.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Reviewing the district court\u2019s sentence for plain error, the Supreme Court essentially held that, despite the district court\u2019s <em>Apprendi </em>violation, the defendants\u2019 convictions should not have been vacated by the Fourth Circuit. <em>Id. </em>at 632-34, 122 S.Ct. 1781. The Court explained that the sentence enhancements survived plain error review because they were based on \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted\u201d evidence adduced at trial regarding the amount of cocaine involved in the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>at 633,122 S.Ct. 1781.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In this case, the jury found Cardoza and Herrera guilty of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(d), which carries a maximum prison sentence of \u201cnot more than 20 years (or for life if the violation is based on a racketeering activity for which the maximum penalty includes life imprisonment). ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1963(a). Without obtaining specific sentence enhancement findings from the jury, the district court increased Cardoza\u2019s and Herrera\u2019s sentences for violating \u00a7 1962(d) from 20 years to life. Such an enhancement would have been permissible if it had been based on Cardoza\u2019s and Herrera\u2019s predicate RICO offenses of conspiring to traffic in narcotics in violation 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, which carries a life sentence when sufficient amounts are involved. However, Cardoza correctly notes that such an enhancement would not have been permissible if the jury had based his \u00a7 1962(d) conviction entirely on his predicate RICO offense of conspiracy to commit money laundering under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). Cardoza and Herrera contend that the district court plainly erred when it imposed life sentences without receiving specific findings from the jury regarding the underlying basis for their increased sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">We conclude that the appellants\u2019 theories are without merit because the jury did return the requisite special findings on Cardoza\u2019s and Herrera\u2019s \u00a7 1962(c) RICO convictions. The jury specifically found beyond a reasonable doubt that Cardoza and Herrera both conspired to possess with intent to distribute either one kilogram or more of heroin or five kilograms or more of cocaine. This finding, which established one of the predicate acts for their \u00a7 1962(c) convictions, also provides \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cessentially uncontroverted\u201d support for the district court\u2019s life sentence under \u00a7 1962(d). <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b) (providing a maximum sentence of life for trafficking in one kilogram or more of heroin or five kilograms or more of cocaine); <em>see also United States v. Warneke, </em>310 F.3d 542, 549 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201cThe maximum penalty following a RICO conviction depends on the maximum penalty for the most serious predicate offense.\u201d). The district court simply used the jury\u2019s specific findings on the \u00a7 1962(c) count as the basis for enhancing the convictions for violating \u00a7 1962(d). Thus, we hold that, in light of <em>Cotton, </em>the district court did not plainly error when sentencing Cardoza and Herrera to life imprisonment for violating \u00a7 1962(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">On the other hand, the foregoing discussion does not support affirmance of Mona\u2019s sentence, as Mona was only convicted for his role in the RICO conspiracy and not for any predicate RICO offenses. The government also does not dispute that remand for re-sentencing is appropriate in Mona\u2019s case. Accordingly, we vacate Mona\u2019s sentence and remand Mona\u2019s case for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Cardoza and Alvarez claim that the district court erred proeedurally when it allegedly sentenced them without considering the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, thus contravening the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where, as here, the appellant did not object to the district court\u2019s alleged failure to consider the \u00a7 3553 factors, we review the district court\u2019s decision for plain error. <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 364 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Although the district court stated that the appellants were sentenced for their roles in the BA criminal enterprise, the district court did not explicitly address the \u00a7 3553 factors when sentencing the appellants.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On two occasions, the court stated that \u201cif I didn\u2019t have the guidelines, as really they\u2019re advisory only, the sentence would still be life on the proper counts.\u201d The district court also stated that it was imposing the sentences based on its acceptance of the information in the pre-sentence report. The district court then sentenced Cardoza and Alvarez to life imprisonment, which fell within the appropriate Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Assuming <em>arguendo, </em>that the district court erred in failing to explicitly address the \u00a7 3553 factors, we conclude that there was no plain error. In order to prove plain error, the appellants must show that the error \u201caffected the outcome in the district court: To meet this standard the proponent of the error must demonstrate a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the appellants merely highlight the court\u2019s failure to explicitly address the \u00a7 3553 factors and they offer nothing to indicate that a discussion of the factors would have affected their within-Guidelines sentences. <em>See also id. </em>at 365 (\u201cMondragon-Santiago\u2019s sentence is within the Guidelines, and he fails to show that an explanation would have changed his sentence.\u201d). Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not plainly err when sentencing Cardoza and Alvarez.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Cardoza, Alvarez, and Perea contend that the district court erroneously denied their motions for a new trial because the court\u2019s juror anonymity and other security measures created an atmosphere of guilt that prevented them from receiving a fair trial. This contention is meritless as the district court did not abuse its discretion in implementing the security measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to empanel an anonymous jury and implementation of security measures for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Edwards, </em>303 F.3d 606, 615 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Nicholson, </em>846 F.2d 277, 279 (5th Cir.1988). \u201c[A] district court does not abuse its discretion to empanel an anonymous jury if the \u2018evidence at trial supports the conclusion that anonymity was warranted.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>74 F.3d 562, 564 (5th Cir.1996) (quoting <em>United States v. Krout, </em>66 F.3d 1420, 1427 (5th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>We condone the use of anonymous juries only \u201cwhen needed to ensure against a serious threat to juror safety, if the courts also protect the defendants\u2019 interest in conducting effective voir dire and maintaining the presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>Sanchez, </em>74 F.3d at 564 (internal quotation marks omitted). The following factors may justify a district court\u2019s decision to empanel an anonymous jury: (1) the defendants\u2019 involvement in organized crime; (2) the defendants\u2019 participation in a group with the capacity to harm jurors; (3) the defendants\u2019 past attempts to interfere -with the judicial process or witnesses; (4) the potential that, if convicted, the defendants will suffer a lengthy incarceration and substantial monetary penalties; and (5) extensive publicity that could enhance the possibility that jurors\u2019 names would become public and expose them to intimidation and harassment. <em>Krout, </em>66 F.3d at 1427.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On October 8, 2008, the district court issued a <em>sua sponte </em>order directing that the selected jury remain anonymous and that the U.S. Marshals Service provide secure off-site parking and transportation to-and-from the courthouse for the jury members. The court explained that it was implementing these measures \u201c[bjecause of the nature of the case, as well as the probability of greater than usual media attention, the Court [had] concern for the safety and privacy of the jurors before, during, and after the conduct of the trial, as well as for their continued objectivity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">There was significant evidence presented at trial that justified the court\u2019s decision to implement the anonymity and security measures. In fact, all of the above factors, save factor 3, clearly support the court\u2019s action. <em>See also United States v. Perea, </em>625 F.Supp.2d 327, 337-38 (W.D.Tex.2009) (district court\u2019s post-trial memorandum opinion further explaining its reasoning for implementing the safety precautions, including its concern for media attention). Furthermore, although the appellants\u2019 attorneys did not know the names and addresses of the jurors, the attorneys were nevertheless able to conduct effective voir dire as they had access to a sufficient amount of information concerning each of the prospective jurors and were also given the opportunity to question the venire.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Likewise, during its voir dire, the district court carefully queried the venire to ensure that no prospective jurors would be influenced by the anonymity and security measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in implementing the juror anonymity and safety measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">Cardoza and Perea challenge the district court\u2019s denial of their motions for a new trial based upon the government\u2019s alleged suppression of evidence in violation of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brady v. Maryland.</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Specifically, Cardoza and Perea argue that certain pieces of information contained in the pre-sentence report were withheld during discovery. We disagree with the appellants because there is nothing in the record indicating that the government suppressed any evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>In <em>Brady, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201csuppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or punishment.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194. A defendant seeking a new trial based on a <em>Brady </em>violation must prove that: \u201c(1) evidence was suppressed; (2) the suppressed evidence was favorable to the defense; and (3) the suppressed evidence was material to either guilt or punishment.\u201d <em>United States v. Runyan, </em>290 F.3d 223, 245 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The district court determined that Cardoza and Perea failed to provide any evidence indicating that the government suppressed evidence. <em>See Perea, </em>625 F.Supp.2d at 330-31 (\u201cUndoubtedly, the Government at no time suppressed the evidence \u2014 the 302 reports \u2014 that formed the basis of the [pre-sentence report].\u201d). Upon our review of the record and the district court\u2019s detailed opinion, we agree with the district court that the information contained in the pre-sentence report was previously disclosed to the appellants. Accordingly, we hold that Cardoza\u2019s and Per-ea\u2019s contentions under <em>Brady </em>are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Alvarez appeals the district court\u2019s admission of his prison bank records (Exhibit 353) and a summary of those records (Exhibit 354) on the theory that the admission of those documents violated his right to confront witnesses under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Specifically, Alvarez objects to the court\u2019s admission of Exhibit 353 without first allowing him the opportunity to cross-examine the custodian of Alvarez\u2019s prison records. Alvarez objects to Exhibit 354 because it summarized the allegedly inadmissible information found in Exhibit 353. We hold that Alvarez\u2019s claim under the Confrontation Clause is without merit.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause is violated when the prosecution introduces \u201ctestimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). However, the Court also stated that some statements are non-testimonial and, therefore, fall outside of the Confrontation Clause\u2019s protection. <em>Id. </em>at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. These statements include \u201cbusiness records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After <em>Crawford, </em>we held that records kept in the ordinary course of business are non-testimonial; whereas \u201cthose that are specifically produced for use at trial ... are \u2018testimonial\u2019 and are at the heart of statements triggering the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>United States v. Martinez-Rios, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>595 F.3d 581, 586 (5th Cir.2010) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Alvarez\u2019s bank records were kept in the ordinary course of business; they were not specifically prepared for use at trial. Thus, under <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Martinez-Rios, </em>the bank records were non-testimonial business records that fell outside of the purview of the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Exhibit 354, on the other hand, was prepared specifically for trial by Special Agent Mikeska for the purpose of simplifying the information found in Exhibit 353. There is no Confrontation Clause issue regarding Exhibit 354, however, because:</p>\n<p id=\"Abr\">(1) it contained only a summary of admissible information found in Exhibit 353; and</p>\n<p id=\"A5\">(2) Special Agent Mikeska testified extensively at trial and Alvarez had ample opportunity to address the exhibit on cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not err in admitting Exhibits 353 and 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">G.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">Perea argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion for an evidentiary hearing during the trial\u2019s sentencing phase. Perea argues that the 97-page pre-sentence report \u201cattempted to hold Perea accountable for the collection of $960,000.00 in <em>cuota </em>(taxes), a large volume of illicit drugs, and the murders of eight individuals.\u201d According to Perea, a hearing was necessary \u201cso that the government could establish a nexus between the alleged crimes and Perea before he could be held accountable for such.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">We review the denial of an evidentiary hearing for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Henderson, </em>19 F.3d 917, 927 (5th Cir.1994). We have held that a defendant is <em>not </em>automatically entitled to a sentencing hearing that amounts to a \u201cmini-trial, complete with exhibits, expert witnesses, character witnesses, and an opportunity to cross examine the government\u2019s witnesses.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Maurer, </em>226 F.3d 150, 151 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u201cThe district court is not required, by either the Due Process Clause or the federal Sentencing Guidelines, to hold a full-blown evidentiary hearing in resolving sentencing disputes.... \u201d). A \u201csentencing court must be given deference to determine whether a hearing is needed on particular sentencing issues.\u201d <em>Henderson, </em>19 F.3d at 927. However, \u201c[wjhen a hearing is necessary to protect a convicted defendant\u2019s due process rights, then the failure to hold a hearing\u201d constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to hold an evidentiary hearing because Perea has failed to show the utility of conducting such a hearing. Perea did not present any evidence to the district court to rebut the information contained in the pre-sentence report,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and he concedes before us that \u201cthe trial court had more than sufficient evidence, based upon the 4000 pages of testimony,\u201d to adequately rule without any additional evidence from Per-ea. This concession undermines Perea\u2019s claim as it demonstrates that a full blown <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>evidentiary hearing would have been a pointless exercise in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Perea\u2019s motion for an evidentiary sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">H.</p>\n<p id=\"Azd1\">Herrera and Enriquez argue that the district court sentenced them while relying on improper information contained in the pre-sentence report. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"Afam\">In making factual findings for sentencing purposes, the district court may consider any evidence \u201cwhich bears sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy, including hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 455 (5th Cir.2002) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We consider whether the district court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous, remaining mindful that such findings \u201care not clearly erroneous if they are plausible in light of the record reviewed in its entirety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, a district court may adopt the facts in a pre-sentence report \u201cwithout further inquiry if those facts have an adequate evidentiary basis with sufficient indicia of reliability and the defendant does not present rebuttal evidence or otherwise demonstrate that the information\u201d contained in the report is unreliable. <em>Valdez, </em>453 F.3d at 262 (quoting <em>United States v. Cabrera, </em>288 F.3d 163, 173-74 (5th Cir.2002)).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">In this case, there is no indication that the information contained in the pre-sentence report was implausible in light of the record reviewed in its entirety. The appellants simply posit that the report\u2019s findings are incorrect but fail to point to the existence of any evidence in rebuttal to cast doubt upon the reliability of the presentence report. Accordingly, we conclude that this issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-12\">Enriquez contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress statements made to the El Paso Police Department when he was brought to the department for questioning in the year preceding his indictment. Enriquez argues that his statements to police were non-consensual and involuntarily obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-13\">When reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, the district court\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and its conclusions of law are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Charles, </em>469 F.3d 402, 405 (5th Cir.2006). A finding of fact \u201cis clearly erroneous when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Sch. Bd. of Madison Cnty., </em>517 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">On September 30, 2008, the district court issued a detailed opinion regarding Enriquez\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Enriquez, </em>2008 WL 4600557 (W.D.Tex. Sept.30, 2008). Upon thorough review of the district court\u2019s underlying factual and legal analysis, we conclude that the court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous and that the court applied the correct legal standards. Accordingly, for the reasons articulated by the district court, we affirm the denial of Enriquez\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>See id. </em>at *3-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">J.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">Enriquez argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>14 motion for severance.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We disagree.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u201cAs a general rule, persons indicted together should be tried together, particularly when the offense is conspiracy.\u201d <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>874 F.3d 313, 317 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam) (citing <em>United States v. Pofahl, </em>990 F.2d 1456, 1483 (5th Cir.1993)). \u201cIn ruling on a motion to sever, a trial court must balance potential prejudice to the defendant against the \u2018public interest in joint trials where the case against each defendant arises from the same general transaction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Kane, </em>887 F.2d at 571). \u201cTo demonstrate reversible error, even where initial joinder was improper, a defendant must show \u2018clear, specific and compelling prejudice that resulted in an unfair trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Posada-Rios, </em>158 F.3d 832, 863 (5th Cir.1998)). \u201cThis prejudice must be of a type \u2018against which the trial court was unable to afford protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Mann, </em>161 F.3d 840, 863 (5th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">We conclude that Enriquez has not demonstrated that clear, specific, and compelling prejudice resulted at trial from the district court\u2019s denial of his severance motion. Nor could he do so as the outcome of the trial indicates that he was not unfairly prejudiced by the crimes of the other BA members. The district court, for example, granted Enriquez\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the charge of narcotics trafficking in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846. Likewise, the jury acquitted Enriquez on the charge of murder in aid of racketeering in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1). Enriquez was only convicted of the crime that he actually confessed to participating in: conspiring to extort <em>cuota </em>payments. There is no indication that granting the motion for severance would have improved Enriquez\u2019s chances of obtaining a judgment of acquittal on that count. Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Enriquez\u2019s motion for severance. <em>See Kane, </em>887 F.2d at 571 (\u201cIn order to prevail on appeal, the appellant must show <em>more than </em>that a separate trial offered a better chance of acquittal.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">K.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">Herrera contends that the district court erred in admitting unauthenticated handwritten BA letters and transcripts of recorded BA conversations. Herrera provides virtually no support for his argument. He instead relies on broad, generalized statements to make his point. For instance, Herrera alleges that \u201cthe numerous and voluminous evidence introduced by the Government in this case was improperly admitted based on improper foundation and over objection.\u201d We conclude that Herrera has failed to adequately brief this issue and it is, therefore, waived. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Martinez, </em>263 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">For the foregoing reasons, save for Mona\u2019s sentence, which we VACATE and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>REMAND for re-sentencing, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b436-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
