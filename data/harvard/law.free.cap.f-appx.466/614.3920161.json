R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b639-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Appellant Rhonda L. O\u2019Neal (O\u2019Neal) was successful in a previous appeal to this court, receiving an award of social security benefits. <em>See O\u2019Neal v. Astrue, </em>391 Fed.Appx. 614 (9th Cir.2010) (unpublished decision). O\u2019Neal now challenges the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d). O\u2019Neal argues that the district court erred in finding that the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified. We review a district court\u2019s finding that the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified for abuse of discretion. <em>See Hardisty v. Astrue, </em>592 F.3d 1072, 1079-80 (9th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2443, 179 L.Ed.2d 1215 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-12\">Where the Commissioner defends \u201cbasic and fundamental errors,\u201d his defense often lacks substantial justification. <em>Corbin v. Apfel, </em>149 F.3d 1051, 1053 (9th Cir.1998). Defense of an administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ\u2019s) failure to comply with laws or regulations also lacks substantial justification. <em>See Gutierrez v. Barnhart, </em>274 F.3d 1255, 1259-60 (9th Cir.2001). On the other hand, where resolution of the case turns on the weight and evaluation of the evidence, as in this case, the Commissioner\u2019s defense of the ALJ\u2019s findings ordinarily is substantially justified. <em>See Lewis v. Barnhart, </em>281 F.3d 1081, 1084, 1086 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-15\">The prior panel did not conclude that the ALJ had violated governing laws or regulations in resolving O\u2019Neal\u2019s claim, as in <em>Corbin </em>and <em>Gutierrez. See O\u2019Neal, </em>391 Fed.Appx. at 618. The panel simply disagreed with the ALJ\u2019s reasoning that evidence of O\u2019Neal\u2019s other activities discredited the treating physicians\u2019 assessments and the daughter\u2019s testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 617-18. In sum, the panel held that the ALJ weighed the evidence incorrectly. <em>See id. </em>at 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-16\">Additionally, the fact that the panel was divided, while not conclusive, supports the conclusion that the Commissioner\u2019s position was substantially justified. <em>See Gonzales v. Free Speech Coalition, </em>408 F.3d 613, 619 (9th Cir.2005) (acknowledging the \u201csignificance of a split decision\u201d in the reasonableness analysis) (citation omitted). Thus, because the previous panel reversed the ALJ\u2019s decision based on a differing interpretation of the evidence, and because the judicial views on the Commissioner\u2019s position were not unanimous, it was not an abuse of discretion for the district court to find the Commissioner\u2019s position substantially justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b639-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
