Wahl\u2019s complaint alleged that he had been subject to a discriminatory maternity leave policy that provided benefits to women but not to men in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and to retaliation in violation of the First Amendment and the Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) for complaining about this policy. The district court dismissed all of Wahl\u2019s claims, finding, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) the defendants\u2019 maternity leave policy complies with the equal protection clause; and (2) Wahl\u2019s retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>claims under the First Amendment and the FMLA should be dismissed because Wahl failed to allege a causal connection between his speech and the adverse employment actions he experienced. Wahl appeals each of the district court\u2019s holdings. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the remaining facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo </em>to determine \u2018whether genuine disputes over material fact exist ... which should properly be submitted to a jury or whether, where no issues of material fact are found, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nagle v. Marron, </em>663 F.3d 100, 104-05 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting <em>Byrnie v. Town of Cromwell Bd. of Educ., </em>243 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir.2001)). \u201cWe resolve all ambiguities and draw all inferences in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">We first consider Wahl\u2019s argument that the district court erred in finding that the defendants\u2019 maternity leave policy does not violate the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This argument lacks merit. \u201cFor a gender-based classification to withstand equal protection scrutiny, it must be established at least that the [challenged] classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\u201d <em>Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, </em>533 U.S. 53, 60, 121 S.Ct. 2053, 150 L.Ed.2d 115 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, it is undisputed that protecting women in the workplace is an important governmental objective. Wahl, however, contends that the Suffolk County Police Department\u2019s maternity leave policy is unconstitutional because it is not substantially related to this legitimate goal. Specifically, Wahl argues that the policy, which permits parents of both genders to take time off following the birth of a child, but allows only wom\u00e9n who have given birth to use accrued sick days before being taken off payroll, is \u201cnot attributable to any different physical needs of men and women\u201d because \u201ca woman can take the leave even if she is perfectly capable of working.\u201d PI. Br. 10. As the district court found, this argument is unavailing because it overlooks the physical reality of childbirth, which entails \u201ca number of medical procedures and recovery time, [and] which require[s] repeated visits to specialized doctors and time to address and investigate a variety of possible complications.\u201d App. 281. Thus, as the district court held, the contested policy is \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to address the government\u2019s valid interest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">We turn next to Wahl\u2019s claim that the district court erred by dismissing his First Amendment retaliation claim due to his failure to allege a causal connection between his protected speech and the adverse employment actions he experienced. \u201cA plaintiff can establish a causal connection that suggests retaliation by showing that protected activity was close in time to the adverse action.\u201d <em>Espinal v. Goord, </em>558 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir.2009). Even if the plaintiff demonstrates such a causal connection, the \u201cdefendant can still prevail ... if it can show that it would have taken the same adverse employment action even in the absence of the protected conduct.\u201d <em>Cotarelo v. Vill. of Sleepy Hollow Police Dep\u2019t, </em>460 F.3d 247, 251-52 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Wahl relies principally on temporal proximity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>establish causation. He emphasizes that in March 2007, just two days after he requested maternity leave and asserted his view that the maternity leave policy was discriminatory, he was switched from a steady night tour to rotating tours and, the following month, the defendants initiated an investigation of his use of sick time. As the district court explained, the flaw in this argument is that prior to his request for maternity leave in March 2007, Wahl had already been officially advised three times that the defendants were concerned about his misuse of sick time. Moreover, as the lower court noted, even if Wahl could demonstrate that his protected speech was a motivating factor in the defendants\u2019 decision making, the defendants offered ample unrebutted evidence indicating that they would have taken the same steps to discipline Wahl even if he had not complained about the maternity leave policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">Finally, we consider and reject Wahl\u2019s claim for FMLA retaliation. To state a <em>prima facie </em>case of FMLA retaliation, a plaintiff must demonstrate, <em>inter alia, </em>that he \u201cexercised rights protected under the FMLA\u201d and that he \u201csuffered an adverse employment action\u201d that \u201coccurred under circumstances giving rise to an inference of retaliatory intent.\u201d <em>Potenza v. City of New York, </em>365 F.3d 165, 168 (2d Cir.2004) (per curiam). The record here clearly shows that on several occasions Wahl was counseled that he could take child care leave under the FMLA, but he chose not to because he wanted to use his accrued sick time.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">We have considered Wahl\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-7\">. Because we find that the County's maternity leave policy is constitutional, it is not necessary to address Wahl\u2019s argument that the Police Benevolent Association could not waive his claim by consenting to the policy in the Police Benevolent Association Contract.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
