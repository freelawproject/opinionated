R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b775-19\">ORDER AND JUDGMENT<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b775-20\">BOBBY R. BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b775-21\">A jury convicted Defendant Sergio Javier Rodriguez of possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms and more of marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B). Rodriguez filed this appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>challenging the legality of the search which produced the marijuana. The Government, in its brief, asserted Defendant waived the suppression issue in the district court because of his trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress the evidence pursuant to our decision in <em>United States v. Burke, </em>683 F.3d 984 (10th Cir.2011). In reply, Defendant agreed trial counsel\u2019s failure constituted waiver of the suppression issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Defendant further acknowledges in his reply that although Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure (Rule) 12(e) provides for a narrow exception to the waiver rule where a party shows good cause for the failure, the exception is rare. And in this case, Defendant recognizes any claim of ineffective assistance is not ripe for review and must await a ruling in post-conviction proceedings. Defendant expressly concedes that the suppression issue raised on appeal was not raised to the district court and that whether ineffective assistance of counsel constitutes good cause in this case is a matter to be addressed in post-conviction collateral proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Defendant requests his conviction be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The parties are correct that Rule 12(b)(3)(C) requires a motion to suppress evidence to be made before trial. Rule 12(e) states a party who does not file a timely suppression motion \u201cwaives any Rule 12(b)(3) defense, objection, or request____\u201d \u201cWhen a motion to suppress evidence is raised for the first time on appeal, we must decline review.\u201d <em>Burke, </em>633 F.3d at 987 (quoting <em>United States v. Brooks, </em>438 F.3d 1231, 1240 (10th Cir.2006)). Rule 12(e)\u2019s \u201csingle narrow exception to the waiver rule\u201d allows relief for good cause. <em>Id. </em>at 988 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe rarely, however, grant relief under the good-cause exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Defendant has not attempted to demonstrate good cause for the failure to raise the issue to the district court other than to allege his trial counsel was ineffective. But as Defendant admits, we consider \u201cineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal in limited circumstances,\u201d and \u201conly where the issue was raised before and ruled upon by the district court <em>and </em>a sufficient factual record exists.\u201d <em>United States v. Flood </em>635 F.3d 1255, 1260 (10th Cir.2011). Defendant correctly notes the absence of those factors in this case. Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b775-23\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-7\">. We commend Defendant's appellate counsel for his forthrightness in making these concessions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
