Bomar appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his discrimination suit under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e and the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101 against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, Labor Commissioner Deborah Moore-Carter, Margaret B. Martin, Khalil Zaied, and Reginia Grande-Brown of the Department of General Services, as well as Doctors Keith Lee and Amy Espy-Smith, and Lisa Conic of the Mercy Medical Clinic. The district court dismissed with prejudice Bomar\u2019s claims under the ADA for failure to state a cause of action. The district court further dismissed with prejudice Bomar\u2019s claims under Title VII, except those claims against the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error as to the district court\u2019s dismissal of these claims with prejudice. We affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>Bomar v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>No. 1:11-cv-00507-RDB, 2011 WL 5150278 (D.Md. Oct. 27, 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2006) and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2006); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b). Because the district court dismissed Bomar\u2019s Title VII claims against the Mayor and City of Baltimore without prejudice, the district court\u2019s dismissal of Bomar\u2019s case is interlocutory and not appealable. Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-18\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-19\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
