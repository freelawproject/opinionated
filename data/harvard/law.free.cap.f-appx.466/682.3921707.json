We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-10\">Hernandez Lopez testified he was threatened because he refused to testify as an eyewitness to a crime. Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s conclusion that Hernandez Lopez failed.to establish past persecution or a fear of future persecution on account of his political opinion, political neutrality, ethnicity, or membership in a particular social group. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-82, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Accordingly, in the absence of a nexus to a protected ground, Hernandez Lopez\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1172 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-13\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Hernandez Lopez failed to establish it is more likely than not that he would be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of the government if returned to Guatemala. <em>See Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </em>542 F.3d 738, 747-48 (9th Cir.2008). Accordingly, Hernandez Lopez\u2019s CAT claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b707-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
