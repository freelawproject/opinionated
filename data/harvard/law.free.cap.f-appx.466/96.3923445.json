Astrue, </em>No. 10-0093, 2011 WL 1321674 (D.N.J. Mar. 30, 2011). O\u2019Connor argues to this Court that the ALJ\u2019s decision is not supported by substantial evidence and, further, that the ALJ committed errors of law. We will affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-23\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b121-24\">\n<em>A. Medical Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-25\">O\u2019Connor is a fifty-two year old male who was forty-seven on the date that he alleges he became disabled. O\u2019Connor worked as an assistant public defender from September of 1985 until the alleged onset of his disability on June 18, 2007. O\u2019Connor has a history of chronic heart problems, specifically ventricular dysplasia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>and ventricular tachycardia, and he had an antitachycardia defibrillator implanted in 1995 to control his arrhythmia. For years, his condition was controlled by medication and the defibrillator, until the summer of 2007, when O\u2019Connor was twice hospitalized after the defibrillator discharged several times in one day. O\u2019Con-nor underwent an ablation procedure, and his treating physicians opined that they were generally satisfied with the results.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">The following summer, O\u2019Connor was once more hospitalized for defibrillator discharges. In December of 2008, as a result of O\u2019Connor\u2019s application for disability benefits, two state medical consultants, Drs. Morris Feman and Howard Goldblas, examined O\u2019Connor and concluded that despite his heart problems, he could engage in activities at the sedentary level, including light chores and occasional lifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">\n<em>B. Psychiatric Evaluations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In July of 2008, Dr. Ronald Silikovitz conducted an independent psychological evaluation of O\u2019Connor, observing that he was not overtly anxious or depressed. Dr. Francis Hecker also completed a psychiatric review of O\u2019Connor and reported that O\u2019Connor had a mild anxious mood, but retained adequate memory and concentration. Dr. Hecker thus concluded that O\u2019Connor\u2019s anxiety was not severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\n<em>C. Procedural History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">O\u2019Connor filed an application for disability benefits on June 5, 2008, alleging an onset date of June 18, 2007. The application was denied, and a hearing was held before the Honorable James Andres, Administrative Law Judge, on April 15, 2009. Both O\u2019Connor and an independent medical examiner, Dr. Martin Fechner, testified. On June 1, 2009, the ALJ issued a decision denying O\u2019Connor\u2019s claim, and the Appeals Council denied O\u2019Connor\u2019s request for review. Plaintiff filed a Complaint with the District Court on January 7, 2010. The Honorable Dennis M. Cavanaugh issued an opinion affirming the ALJ\u2019s decision, finding that it was supported by substantial evidence, and on May 20, 2011, O\u2019Connor filed a timely Notice of Appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">A Social Security disability benefits claimant must demonstrate that he is unable \u201cto engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than [twelve] months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A). The claimant bears the burden of establishing that he has such a disability. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 423(d)(5)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-12\">The Social Security Administration employs a five-part procedure to determine whether an individual has met this burden. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520. First, the ALJ determines whether the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful employment; if so, the claimant is ineligible for benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(a). Next, the ALJ decides whether the claimant suffers from a \u201csevere\u201d impairment; if it is not, the claimant is not eligible for benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(c). At the third step, the ALJ determines whether the claimant\u2019s impairment meets or equals a Listing in Appendix 1 to 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520(d). If it does, the claimant is automatically entitled to benefits; if it does not, the ALJ proceeds with the analysis. <em>Id. </em>In step four, the ALJ decides whether the claimant retains the residual functional capacity (RFC) to perform past relevant work; if so, the claimant is ineligible for benefits. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(e). Finally, in the fifth step, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the ALJ considers whether any work exists which accommodates the claimant\u2019s medical impairment, age, education, work experience, and RFC. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 404.1520(f). If so, the claimant is ineligible for benefits. <em>Id. </em>The ALJ found that O\u2019Connor has a severe impairment, namely \u201cheart disorder, including congestive heart failure, ventricular tachycardia, and status post heart surgery with implantation of a defibrillator,\u201d but determined that it does not meet or equal a Listing and that O\u2019Connor retains an RFC for sedentary work. The ALJ concluded that O\u2019Connor could perform his past relevant work as an attorney and, accordingly, did not reach step five.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Where the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, it must be upheld. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is a deferential standard of review and \u201c \u2018means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Barnhart, </em>364 F.3d 501, 503 (3d Cir.2004) (quoting Je<em>surum v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>48 F.3d 114, 117 (3d Cir.1995)). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla ... but may be less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>Woody v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>859 F.2d 1156, 1159 (3d Cir.1988). In determining whether the ALJ\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence, we review the record as a whole. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">O\u2019Connor raises several issues on appeal. He first contends that the ALJ erred in not fully crediting his subjective complaints or the conclusion of his treating physician. O\u2019Connor suggests that the ALJ should have adopted entirely Dr. Mehta\u2019s conclusion that he was totally and permanently disabled. He next argues that the ALJ erred in finding that neither his heart condition nor his anxiety disorder meets or equals a Listing. Finally, O\u2019Con-nor challenges the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that he retains the RFC to perform his past work as a public defender. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">\n<em>A. Weight of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">O\u2019Connor first posits that the ALJ erred in discrediting his subjective complaints and the ultimate conclusion of his treating physician to the extent that both were inconsistent with the remainder of the objective medical evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">This Court has long held that \u201c[a] cardinal principle guiding disability eligibility determinations is that the ALJ accord treating physicians\u2019 reports great weight, especially \u2018when their opinions reflect expert judgment based on a continuing observation over a prolonged period of time.\u2019\u201d <em>Morales v. Apfel, </em>225 F.3d 310, 317 (3d Cir.2000) (citations omitted). Indeed, \u201cin the absence of contradictory medical evidence, an ALJ ... must accept the medical judgment of a treating physician.\u201d <em>Jones v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 125, 128-29 (3d Cir.1991). Similarly, \u201c[a]n ALJ must give great weight to a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony ... when this testimony is supported by competent medical evidence.\u201d <em>Schaudeck v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec., </em>181 F.3d 429, 433 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">O\u2019Connor contends that his subjective complaints are consistent with the testimony of his treating physician and thus entitled to deference. This conclusion would be correct if it did not ignore the important inquiry of whether other objective medical evidence contradicts his testimony. <em>See id. </em>at 433. While O\u2019Connor argues the contrary, his subjective testimony was in fact contradicted by medical evidence, specifically, the conclusions of Drs. Fechner, Feman, Goldblas, Hecker, and Silikovitz, all of whom concluded that O\u2019Connor retains the physical and mental ability to engage in sedentary work. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>the ALJ did not err in limiting the extent to which he credited O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">The same is true of the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit Dr. Mehta\u2019s conclusion. Where the opinions of a claimant\u2019s treating physician are inconsistent with the physician\u2019s own records and contradicted by the opinions of other examiners, the ALJ may decide to give limited weight to the testimony and reports of the treating physician. <em>Brown v. Astrue, </em>649 F.3d 193, 196-97 (3d Cir.2011). The ALJ correctly noted that Dr. Mehta was the only examiner among several to so expansively, and without explanation, conclude that O\u2019Connor was totally disabled. This broad conclusion is inconsistent with Dr. Mehta\u2019s own records and the conclusions of every other physician that has examined the claimant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, we find that the ALJ appropriately weighed the evidence and adequately explained his reasoning for partially discrediting O\u2019Connor and Dr. Mehta.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\n<em>B. The Physical Impairment Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">O\u2019Connor next contends that the ALJ erred in finding that his impairment does not meet or equal a Listing in Appendix 1 to 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P. O\u2019Connor asserts that the ALJ failed to address whether O\u2019Connor met or equaled Listing 4.05 and cites to <em>Livingston v. Califano, </em>614 F.2d 342 (3d Cir.1980), for its holding that where an ALJ fails to evaluate the <em>per se </em>disability Listings, he has not adequately developed the record and the case must be remanded. <em>See id. </em>at 345-46. Both the hearing transcript and the ALJ\u2019s decision evince, however, that the ALJ did inquire whether O\u2019Con-nor falls within any of the <em>per se </em>categories and, with specific reference to Listings 4.02, 4.04, and 4.05, concluded that he did not. <em>See </em>App. at A4.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">We further find that the ALJ\u2019s conclusion as to Listing 4.05 is supported by substantial evidence. The ALJ concluded that because the medical evidence fails to demonstrate episodes of syncope, or near syncope, O\u2019Connor does not meet Listing 4.05, related to recurrent arrhythmias.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> O\u2019Connor asserts that he has had a defibrillator since 1995 and has since \u201csuffered continual and frequent episodes of arrhythmias.\u201d This contention is supported by the medical evidence. However, as Appellees note, his medical record is devoid of documented arrhythmia accompanied by uncontrolled cardiac syncope or even near syncope as required by the Listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, \u00a7 4.00F3(b) defines \u201csyncope\u201d as a loss of consciousness or a faint and \u201cnear syncope\u201d as a period of altered consciousness not reaching the level of fainting or unconsciousness. <em>Id. </em>Near syncope requires more than \u201cmerely a feeling of light-headedness, momentary weakness, or dizzi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>ness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To wit, during treatment and follow-up visits after the 2007 and 2008 hospitalizations, O\u2019Connor never complained of, and his doctors never observed, any coincident syncope; indeed, on at least one occasion, O\u2019Connor denied any syncope. <em>See </em>Tr. at 410-11, 454-57, 700-01. Critically, \u201c[f]or a claimant to show that his impairment matches a listing, it must meet <em>all </em>of the specified criteria. An impairment that manifests only some of those criteria, no matter how severely, does not qualify.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Zebley, </em>498 U.S. 521, 530-31, 110 S.Ct. 885, 107 L.Ed.2d 967 (1990) (citation omitted). Thus, the ALJ did not err in finding that O\u2019Connor does not meet a Listing.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>C. The Mental Impairment Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">O\u2019Connor also asserts that the ALJ erred in finding that his anxiety is not severe. He contends that the ALJ\u2019s reliance on Drs. Hecker and Silikovitz was misplaced in light of his own testimony. We find these arguments to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">As previously noted, while a claimant\u2019s testimony must be awarded greater weight, if consistent with the evidence, an ALJ may just as readily award it less weight, or reject it entirely, where the claimant\u2019s complaints are contradicted by or greatly exceed those documented by objective evidence. <em>See Schaudeck, </em>181 F.3d at 433. Notably, O\u2019Connor presented no medical evidence supporting his complaints as to the severity of his anxiety; he testified, however, that it prohibits him from working at all. The reports of Drs. Hecker and Silikovitz, both concluding that O\u2019Connor\u2019s anxiety results in only a mild limitation on his functioning, are the only medical evidence related to this claim. Because O\u2019Connor\u2019s subjective complaints are inconsistent with that evidence, the ALJ appropriately exercised his discretion in discrediting O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">We further find that the ALJ\u2019s ultimate conclusion as to the severity of the mental impairment is supported by substantial evidence. A mental impairment may require a finding of disability if the claimant\u2019s ability to engage in substantial gainful activity is substantially affected thereby. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A); <em>see </em>Social Security Ruling 85-28. Inherent in such a determination is a finding that the claimant\u2019s mental impairment significantly limits his ability to engage in basic work activities, including his abilities to use judgment, respond to supervision, deal with changes in the routine work setting, and understand, carry out, and remember simple instructions. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1521.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">The ALJ considered all of these factors and, relying on Drs. Hecker and Silikovitz, concluded that O\u2019Connor\u2019s anxiety is not a significant limitation. Dr. Silikovitz reported that O\u2019Connor had a fair prognosis, finding no substantial limitations on his daily life, and noted that his anxiety was controlled and improved by medication. Tr. at 559-63. Dr. Hecker likewise found that O\u2019Connor had only mild limitations on his ability to engage in daily living activities or to maintain concentration and, accordingly, found his condition \u201cnot severe.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564, 574. These two medical opinions offer substantial evidence for the ALJ\u2019s finding, and accordingly, we will affirm the ALJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">\n<em>D. The Sedentary Work Finding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">Lastly, we address O\u2019Connor\u2019s arguments with respect the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that, despite his physical impairment, O\u2019Connor retains an RFC for sedentary work and is thus capable of performing his past relevant work as a public defender. As the District Court accurately summa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>rized, an RFC is an \u201cassessment of a claimant\u2019s capacity to perform in a work setting despite his impairments\u201d and said assessment must \u201cfirst, determin[e] whether there is an underlying medically determinable physical or mental impairment that could reasonably be expected to produce the claimant\u2019s symptoms; and second, evaluate] the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of the claimant\u2019s symptoms.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor v. Astrue, </em>No. 10-0093, 2011 WL 1321674, at *14 (D.N.J. Mar. 30, 2011) (citing 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1529). The ALJ found that O\u2019Connor does suffer from medical impairments that could be expected to cause his symptoms, but concluded that O\u2019Connor\u2019s testimony with respect to the intensity, persistence, and limiting effects of his symptoms was not credible to the extent it was inconsistent with the objective evidence. After finding that the conclusions of O\u2019Connor\u2019s treating physician were not credible as they related to the extent of his impairment, a conclusion we have already found to be appropriate <em>supra, </em>the ALJ turned to the opinions of three other physicians in arriving at O\u2019Connor\u2019s RFC. Specifically, the ALJ relied upon the opinions of Drs. Fechner, Feman and Goldblas, each of whom concluded that O\u2019Connor retains an RFC for sedentary work. Accordingly, the ALJ\u2019s calculation of O\u2019Connor\u2019s RFC is amply supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">Finally, O\u2019Connor apparently contends that employment as a public defender is not sedentary work. He argues that his career required \u201chigh levels of reasoning, math and language skills, beyond the scope of [his] ability,\u201d and that his anxiety prohibits him from managing the high stress levels associated with a career as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Fatal to O\u2019Connor\u2019s argument is the indisputable point that the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, which this Court has permitted and encouraged ALJs to consult in making their RFC determinations, <em>see Burnett v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec., </em>220 F.3d 112, (3d Cir.2000), lists both prosecutors and defense attorneys as sedentary work.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Dictionary of Occupational Titles, \u00a7\u00a7 110.107-014, -117-010. As the District Court aptly noted, the duties of a lawyer listed in the Dictionary include \u201c[r]epresent[ing][ a] client in court and before quasi-judicial or administrative agencies of government\u201d and said description \u201cplainly encompasses [O\u2019Connor\u2019s] responsibilities as an assistant public defender.\u201d <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>No. 10-0093, 2011 WL 1321674 at *16. While O\u2019Connor is undoubtedly correct that his profession requires particular reasoning and language skills, he has failed to produce credible evidence evincing that he suffers from an impairment which significantly limits his capacity for these skills. Thus, we will affirm the ALJ\u2019s finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>O\u2019Connor is able to perform his past relevant work as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the decision of the ALJ. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\">. Dr. Mehta's conclusion within an unsigned, undated disability form that O'Connor is completely and permanently disabled is internally inconsistent with Dr. Mehta\u2019s own notations that O'Connor had \"no ventricular tachycardia events since [August 2007] catheter ablation\u201d and that Dr. Mehta is \u201cquite happy with the results of the catheter ablation and ... hope[s] he would not have any further ventricular arrhythmias.\u201d Tr. at 743. His conclusions are also inconsistent with those of Drs. Fechner, Goldblas, and Feman, each of whom evaluated O\u2019Connor and concluded that he was able to perform sedentary work.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-12\">. The listing includes \"[r]ecurrent arrhythmias, not related to reversible causes, such as electrolyte abnormalities or digitalisglycoside or antiarrhythmic drug toxicity, resulting in uncontrolled, recurrent episodes of cardiac syncope or near syncope, despite prescribed treatment, and documented by resting or ambulatory (Holter) electrocardiography, or by other appropriate medically acceptable testing, coincident with the occurrence of syncope or near syncope.\u201d Appendix 1 to 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P, \u00a7 4.05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-4\">.
