On appeal, Martinez argues that his 52-month sentence for Count One is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We ordinarily expect a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-13\">The weight to be given any particular factor is left to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007). We reverse only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-14\">As to procedural error, Martinez argues that the district court applied a presumption that the applicable guidelines range of 46 to 57 months was reasonable. A sentencing court may not automatically presume that the applicable guidelines range is reasonable. <em>Nelson v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 350, 352, 129 S.Ct. 890, 892, 172 L.Ed.2d 719 (2009). Instead, after calculating the guidelines range, the sentencing court must \u201cconsider what sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>tence is appropriate for the individual defendant in light of the statutory sentencing factors, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), explaining any variance from the former with reference to the latter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 129 S.Ct. at 891-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We reject Martinez\u2019s contention that the district court merely applied a presumption of reasonableness. The district court stated that it \u201cbelieve[d] a sentence within the guidelines <em>for this case </em>constitutes a reasonable sentence <em>based on the factors under 3553 factors.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) This statement reflects that the district court found, \u201cbased on\u201d the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the circumstances of \u201cthis case,\u201d that a sentence within the guidelines range was reasonable and did not apply a presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">This conclusion is even more apparent when the statement is read in context. Before making this statement, the district court heard extensive argument from the parties about whether to impose a sentence within the guidelines range as to Count One or to grant Martinez\u2019s request for a downward variance on that count to 24 months. After making the challenged statement, the district court proceeded to discuss some of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Martinez\u2019s young age and disadvantaged life, his criminal history, and some of the circumstances of the charged offense. The district court then concluded that a downward variance to 24 months on Count One \u201cwould not be appropriate.\u201d The district court imposed a 52-month sentence as to Count One, within the applicable guidelines range, and then the mandatory-minimum 84-month consecutive sentence as to Count Two, for a total 136-month sentence. The record belies Martinez\u2019s contention that the district court committed procedural error.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-11\">We also cannot say Martinez\u2019s 52-month sentence as to Count One was substantively unreasonable. During the offense, Martinez pointed a shotgun at three juveniles while his codefendant ordered them out of their vehicle. Martinez and his codefendant then drove away in the vehicle, taking it to a \u201cchop shop,\u201d where Martinez received $300 and helped dismantle the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">At the time of the carjacking, Martinez and his codefendant belonged to the West Side Via Locos Gang. Martinez\u2019s codefendant admitted he committed the carjacking with Martinez because he feared \u201cgetting a \u2018violation\u2019 (punishment from the gang for not following orders).\u201d Moreover, the victims of Martinez\u2019s carjacking were unwilling to press state charges because they feared retaliation by Martinez\u2019s gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">Although Martinez was only 22 when he committed the carjacking, he already had several adult convictions, including convictions for robbery, affray, shoplifting, and possession of prescription controlled substances. In fact, at the time of the carjacking, Martinez was still on probation for the robbery offense, during which Martinez used a knife to rob the victim of a cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">In declining to give the requested downward variance, the district court stressed that Martinez\u2019s criminal history was \u201cnot good\u201d and that Martinez was on probation for a crime of violence when he committed the instant crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">Martinez points out that no one was injured during the carjacking. However, we do not second guess the weight the district court gives to the various factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>so long as the sentence ultimately imposed is reasonable in light of totality of the circumstances. <em>See United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir.2010). Here, the district court acknowledged Martinez\u2019s arguments in mitigation, including his claim that the shotgun he brandished was not loaded. However, the district court also noted that the carjacking victims did not know the shotgun was unloaded and lost their car. In light of the seriousness of Martinez\u2019s offense, his criminal history and involvement in a violent gang, we cannot say the district court\u2019s 52-month sentence, within the applicable guidelines range for Count One, was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">. Martinez does not challenge the reasonableness of his mandatory-minimum 84-month sentence on Count 2, which the district court was required to impose consecutive to the sentence for Count 1. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) &amp; (D)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b828-11\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b829-7\">. The government argues that Martinez did not claim procedural error in the district court, and we should review only for plain error. Martinez disagrees. We need not resolve that issue because there is no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
