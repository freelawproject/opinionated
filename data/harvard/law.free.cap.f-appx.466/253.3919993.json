Hunsberger appealed, and counsel has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting that in his view there are no meritorious issues for appeal and alleging no error by the district court, but questioning whether, by operation of enhancements contained in USSG \u00a7 2G2.2, Hunsberger\u2019s sentence was unduly severe under the circumstances. Hunsberger was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-25\">We have thoroughly reviewed the record and conclude that Hunsberger\u2019s claim is without merit, and that his sentence is not procedurally unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Morace, </em>594 F.3d 340, 346-51 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>307, 178 L.Ed.2d 199 (2010). Additionally, in accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. Finally, we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
