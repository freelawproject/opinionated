Breyer, United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b665-23\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-24\">Plaintiff-Appellant Basevi, Inc. (\u201cBasevi\u201d) appeals from the district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to DefendantAppellee The Acorn Company (\u201cAcorn\u201d), following Acorn\u2019s successful defense of Basevi\u2019s copyright action. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-25\">Basevi argues that the district court abused its discretion in granting attorneys\u2019 fees to Acorn, because Acorn did not settle the case, instead filing a successful motion to dismiss and a motion for summary judgment. That argument has no merit. The Copyright Act gives the district court the discretion to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees \u201cto the prevailing party as part of the costs.\u201d <em>See </em>17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505. The district court properly exercised this discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>and followed <em>Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., </em>510 U.S. 517, 535, 114 S.Ct. 1023, 127 L.Ed.2d 455 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">That Acorn did not settle is no reason to deny it fees. Although Basevi blames Acorn for not accepting Basevi\u2019s offer to settle \u201cwith a simple affidavit,\u201d that offer was not made until Basevi was \u2014 late\u2014 opposing summary judgment. At that point, Acorn had already spent considerable money defending itself. It might well have believed that it was likely to prevail on the summary judgment motion it had already filed, and recover its attorneys\u2019 fees \u2014 a benefit not included in Basevi\u2019s offer. Acorn\u2019s declination to settle was therefore reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Nor does Basevi\u2019s characterization of Acorn as being \u201coverzealous,\u201d and unwilling \u201cto negotiate or enter into settlement discussions\u201d ring true. The parties\u2019 26(f) Report states that, early on, Acorn \u201coffered to settle this matter for a lower nominal amount [than that proposed by Basevi],\u201d but that Basevi would only settle if Acorn paid Basevi\u2019s attorneys\u2019 fees. Acorn also participated in a settlement conference with Basevi. Acorn therefore demonstrated a willingness to settle. Basevi points to no authority supporting its suggestion that Acorn was obligated to settle at any cost. Nor can Acorn\u2019s decision to defend itself against a meritless suit, rather than settling at any cost, fairly be deemed \u201coverzealous[ness].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">In light of the district court\u2019s thorough and reasonable application of <em>Fogerty, </em>this Court has no \u201cdefinite and firm conviction\u201d that the district court committed \u201cclear error\u201d in weighing the relevant factors. <em>See Wall Data Inc. v. L.A. Cnty. Sheriff's Dept., </em>447 F.3d 769, 787 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"ASe\">Finally, Basavi argues that the amount of fees sought by Acorn was unreasonable. Basevi did not raise the issue of the reasonableness of Acorn\u2019s fees before the district court. Nor has Basevi made any showing that this Court must review the reasonableness of the fee award in order to prevent a manifest injustice. He has therefore waived this issue. <em>See Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied Craftsman Local Union No. 20, AFL-CIO et al. v. Martin Jaska, Inc., 152 </em>F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cWe will not ... review an issue not raised below unless necessary to prevent manifest injustice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b665-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
