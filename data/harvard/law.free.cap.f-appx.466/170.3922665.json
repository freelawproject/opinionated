Pursuant to rights reserved by his plea agreement, Lewis bases this appeal on the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the firearm and Lewis\u2019 incriminating statements. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">When considering a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we review the district court\u2019s legal conclusions de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Foster, </em>634 F.3d 243, 246 (4th Cir.2011). When a suppression motion has been denied by the district court, this court construes the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-13\">Lewis first argues that the district court erred in finding that the firearm was lawfully seized during a protective search of his vehicle. A temporary detention of an automobile, even if only for a limited time or purpose, constitutes a Fourth Amendment seizure. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996). Because a routine \u201ctraffic stop is ... more like an investigative detention than a custodial arrest,\u201d its limitations must be evaluated under the \u201cdual inquiry\u201d set out in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). <em>United States v. Guijon-Ortiz, </em>660 F.3d 757, 764 (4th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this analysis, we determine whether the stop \u201cwas justified at its inception\u201d and \u201cwhether the continued stop was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of an investigative seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-14\">Regarding the first <em>Terry </em>inquiry, if an officer has probable cause or reasonable suspicion to believe a suspect has violated a traffic law, the officer\u2019s decision to stop the suspect\u2019s car is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the officer\u2019s subjective motivation for the stop. <em>See Whren, </em>517 U.S. at 813, 116 S.Ct. 1769; <em>United States v. Hassan El, </em>5 F.3d 726, 730 (4th Cir.1993). In evaluating the second inquiry, we must consider whether the officers \u201c \u2018diligently pursue[d] the investigation of the justification for the stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Guijon-Ortiz, </em>660 F.3d at 768 (quoting <em>United States v. Digiovanni, </em>650 F.3d 498, 509 (4th Cir.2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">A lawful routine traffic stop justifies detaining the vehicle\u2019s occupants for the time necessary to request a driver\u2019s license and registration, run a computer check, and issue a citation. <em>Digiovanni, </em>650 F.3d at 507. The officer also is permitted to request passenger identification or inquire <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>into unrelated matters, as long as doing so does not measurably prolong the length of the traffic stop. <em>Guijon-Ortiz, </em>660 F.3d at 765. However, the officer may not \u201c \u2018definitively abandon[ ] the prosecution of the traffic stop and embark[ ] on another sustained course of investigation\u2019 \u201d absent additional justification. <em>Id. </em>at 766 (quoting <em>United States v. Everett, </em>601 F.3d 484, 495 (6th Cir.2010)).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Because a defective tag light violates N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 20-129(d) (2011), we conclude that the district court did not err in finding the initial stop of Lewis\u2019 vehicle lawful. Additionally, we conclude that the officers promptly and diligently pursued the purpose of the traffic stop, and neither the scope nor the duration of the traffic stop violated Lewis\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Turning to whether the protective search of the car violated Lewis\u2019 Fourth Amendment rights, officers are not permitted to \u201cconduct automobile searches <em>whenever </em>they conduct an investigative stop.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 1049 n. 14,103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983). However, the Supreme Court has held that an officer may search the passenger compartment of an automobile if he \u201cpossesses a reasonable belief based on specific and articulable facts which, taken together with the rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant the officer in believing that the suspect is dangerous and the suspect may gain immediate control of weapons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1049, 103 S.Ct. 3469 (internal quotation marks omitted). We must evaluate whether the officer possessed a reasonable belief of (1) the suspect\u2019s dangerousness, and (2) the possibility that the suspect might gain control of weapons inside the vehicle. <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>376 F.3d 270, 277 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">We conclude that the officer\u2019s search of the car was lawful. Given the totality of the circumstances-including Lewis\u2019 evasive behavior and visible nervousness; his presence in a high-crime area at a late hour; the vehicle\u2019s missing tag light; Lewis\u2019 inability to articulate clear answers to simple questions; his numerous prior arrests for breaking and entering and drug and firearms violations; and the officer\u2019s knowledge that Lewis and his passenger generally matched the description of robbery suspects and carried tools consistent with robbery \u2014 the officer reasonably believed that Lewis could be armed and dangerous. Moreover, Lewis\u2019 lack of restraint and close proximity to the driver\u2019s side door permit the conclusion that Lewis could access any weapons within the vehicle. <em>See Long, </em>463 U.S. at 1051-52, 103 S.Ct. 3469; <em>United States v. Elston, </em>479 F.3d 314, 320 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Lewis argues that the limitations on an automobile search incident to arrest established by <em>Arizona v. Gant, </em>556 U.S. 332, 129 S.Ct. 1710, 173 L.Ed.2d 485 (2009), should apply to his case because the officer exceeded the scope of the traffic stop and his seizure was a de facto arrest. Contrary to Lewis\u2019 assertion, the subjective reasoning of neither the officer nor the defendant is sufficient to convert a <em>Terry </em>stop into an arrest. <em>See Elston, </em>479 F.3d at 319. We therefore conclude that the limited restraint placed on Lewis prior to the search did not amount to a formal arrest that would trigger <em>Gant\u2019s </em>protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Lewis also argues that his incriminating statements were taken following an involuntary waiver of rights pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 475, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Any incriminating statement made during a custodial interrogation is presumed involuntary and inadmissible unless preceded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>by <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>See id. </em>at 467-73, 86 S.Ct. 1602; <em>Oregon v. Elstad, </em>470 U.S. 298, 307, 105 S.Ct. 1285, 84 L.Ed.2d 222 (1985). A defendant may validly waive the rights conveyed by <em>Miranda </em>warnings, including the right to remain silent, if, under the totality of the circumstances, (1) the defendant voluntarily relinquished his rights as \u201cthe product of free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception\u201d by law enforcement; and (2) \u201cthe waiver [was] made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\u201d <em>United States v. Cristobal, </em>293 F.3d 134, 139-40 (4th Cir.2002). Under the first prong, the relevant inquiry \u201cis whether the defendant\u2019s will has been overborne or his capacity for self-determination critically impaired because of coercive police conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 140 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">A confession may be involuntary if \u201cobtained by any direct or implied promises, however slight, or by the extension of any improper influence.\u201d <em>United States v. Shears, </em>762 F.2d 397, 401 (4th Cir.1985). Police officers are permitted to \u201cmake some representations to a defendant,\u201d including \u201cpromise[s] to make a defendant\u2019s cooperation known to the prosecutor,\u201d without effectively coercing a confession. <em>Id. </em>at 401-02. However, promises by government agents must be viewed from the perspective of the defendant to determine whether they are involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 402 &amp; n. 5. Where a defendant reasonably perceives that he has been promised his charges will be dropped in exchange for his confession, the promise is not kept, and the promise constituted the driving force behind his confession, the confession is involuntary. <em>See id. </em>at 401-03 &amp; n. 2, 4, 5; <em>Grades v. Boles, </em>398 F.2d 409, 412-13 (4th Cir.1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">We conclude that Lewis knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and that his statements were not the product of coercion or specific guarantees of leniency. Although Lewis felt substantial pressure to confess in exchange for possible leniency, this pressure was internal and not the result of the officers\u2019 actions. Thus, we conclude the district court did not err in denying Lewis\u2019 suppression motion. <em>See United States v. Mashburn, </em>406 F.3d 303, 309-10 (4th Cir.2005); <em>Shears, </em>762 F.2d at 401-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Lewis\u2019 conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
