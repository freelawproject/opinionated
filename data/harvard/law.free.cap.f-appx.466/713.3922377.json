GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">Like many Americans James Moser hoped to make a few dollars in real estate. Unlike most, Mr. Moser eventually found himself convicted of four counts of bank fraud and one count of conspiracy. On appeal Mr. Moser argues that the evidence the government produced against him at trial is legally insufficient to support his convictions. But under our governing standard of review, Mr. Moser faces a serious challenge. This court\u2019s precedents require us to examine the trial evidence against Mr. Moser in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict and we may only reverse if we are persuaded no rational jury could have found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Rakes, </em>510 F.3d 1280, 1284 (10th Cir.2007). Here we cannot say so much.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">Beginning with the substantive bank fraud counts, Mr. Moser contends that he lacked an intent to deceive a bank or knowledge of any misrepresentation made to a bank. <em>See United States v. Rackley, </em>986 F.2d 1357, 1360-61 (10th Cir.1993) (bank fraud requires proof, among other things, \u201c(1) that the defendant knowingly executed or attempted to execute a scheme ... to obtain property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses ... (2) that the defendant did so with the intent to defraud\u201d). The trial record, however, contains ample circumstantial evidence suggesting the presence of both elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">The record shows that Mr. Moser partnered with Joseph Frey (now deceased) to secure bank loans in order to buy a large number of homes from a Kansas City builder, Jeffrey Miller. At the same time, the pair secretly arranged for Mr. Miller to return some of the loan proceeds to Mr. Moser and his company. These \u201ckickbacks\u201d provided substantial income to Mr. Moser and were either never disclosed to the lending banks or were disguised as bogus fees. <em>See, e.g., </em>Exhibit 44L-1. To obtain the bank loans needed to purchase Mr. Miller\u2019s properties and the kickbacks that came with them, Mr. Frey, assisted by Mr. Moser, engaged in still more decep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>tions, misrepresenting himself and his assets to the lending banks in a variety of ways. On three loans, for example, Mr. Frey represented that he worked for and received a substantial income from Mr. Moser\u2019s company, this despite Mr. Frey\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony that he never did so. Tr. at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Of course, Mr. Moser denies knowing Mr. Frey misrepresented his employment status. But even assuming he wasn\u2019t in on this particular aspect of the scheme the jury easily could have found he was in on many others. To win the bank loans needed to purchase the Miller properties, for example, Mr. Frey submitted paperwork purporting to show he already had a signed lease with a prospective renter who promised to provide a steady stream of income from one of the homes. Tr. at 1193 <em>et seq. </em>The lease purported to be between Mr. Frey \u2014 repeatedly misspelled \u201cFry\u201d \u2014 and Tony Hilger, and a copy of it was submitted with each of the loan applications underlying Mr. Moser\u2019s convictions. Tr. at 1335-37, 1195-98, 1208-1212; Exhibits 30T, 41E, 44E, 45E. At trial, however, Mr. Hilger testified that he never entered into a lease with Mr. Frey and that the signature on the lease was not his. Tr. at 1702-04. Neither, it turns out, did Mr. Hilger even know Mr. Frey. Tr. at 1703. Mr. Hilger, however, did know Mr. Moser. And Mr. Frey\u2019s wife testified that it was Mr. Moser\u2019s job to find purported renters to lease the properties for Mr. Frey. Tr. at 1390. Consistent with Mrs. Frey\u2019s testimony, three copies of the lease bore the fax tag line of Mr. Moser\u2019s company. Exhibits 41E, 44E, 45E.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">This evidence is enough to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Moser was knowingly involved in the scheme to defraud the banks and that he intended to defraud them. From Mr. Hilger\u2019s testimony the jury could have concluded that the leases were intentional lies aimed at deceiving the banks into thinking Mr. Frey had at least one property rented and with it a steady income stream that might help justify a loan. Mr. Moser\u2019s knowing involvement likewise reasonably follows from Mrs. Frey\u2019s testimony about his role, from Mr. Hilger\u2019s testimony that he knew Mr. Moser but not Mr. Frey, from the fax tag line on three copies of the lease, and perhaps from the evidence that Frey\u2019s name was consistently misspelled in the lease (arguably suggesting Mr. Frey didn\u2019t author it). The jury likewise had reason to believe that Mr. Moser had a motive for helping to mislead the banks as he stood to profit from the scheme, including through the kickbacks his company received. <em>See United States v. Archer, </em>671 F.3d 149, 160-61 (2d Cir.2011) (sufficient evidence that defendant attorney, and not solely his office manager, knowingly filed false visa applications for clients where clients spoke little English and did not provide the false information, they did not know the program\u2019s requirements, they spoke with defendant, and defendant responded \u201cso what?\u201d when confronted with one false application).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Mr. Moser intimates that no adverse inferences should be drawn from Mrs. Frey\u2019s testimony because it was called into question on cross-examination. But cross-examination didn\u2019t call into question Mrs. Frey\u2019s testimony that Mr. Moser was responsible for obtaining leases on the partners\u2019 properties; to the contrary, this testimony was elicited on cross. Even if cross-examination did call into question <em>other </em>aspects of Mrs. Frey\u2019s testimony, moreover, the jury was permitted to find her credible in <em>this </em>respect, the only respect necessary to sustain Mr. Moser\u2019s conviction. Under our governing standards of review, a jury\u2019s credibility determination may be overturned \u201conly if the testimony is inherently incredible \u2014 that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>only if the events recounted by the witness were impossible \u2018under the laws of nature\u2019 or the witness \u2018physically could not have possibly observed\u2019 the events at issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Cardinas Garcia, </em>596 F.Sd 788, 794 (10th Cir.2010) (quoting <em>United States v. Oliver, </em>278 F.3d 1035, 1043 (10th Cir.2001) (further quotation omitted)).. And neither of those conditions is present here because no one disputes that Mrs. Frey was at least possibly in a position to know something about her husband\u2019s business partners and activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">Separate and apart from whether he knowingly participated in the scheme and intended to deceive lenders, Mr. Moser contends that his substantive bank fraud convictions fail because the government didn\u2019t prove that any of his deceptive conduct was material to the banks\u2019 decisions to lend Mr. Frey money. A false statement is material for purposes of a bank fraud conviction, however, so long as it is (merely) <em>\u201ccapable </em>of influencing a bank\u2019s actions.\u201d <em>See United States v. Akers, </em>215 F.3d 1089, 1101-02 (10th Cir.2000) (quotation omitted) (emphasis added). And here again the Hilger lease supplies sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. Loan officers testified that the leases were normally submitted with loan applications in order show that the borrower could guarantee a reliable stream of rental income. Tr. 1209-10; 1336-37. From this evidence a reasonable jury could conclude that the Hilger lease appended to Mr. Frey\u2019s loan applications was at least capable of influencing a bank\u2019s loan decision. Mr. Moser\u2019s reply to all this \u2014 that the government failed to prove other material impacts flowing from the fraudulent scheme \u2014 is beside the point. The government proved all the materiality it was required to prove when it showed Mr. Mos-er\u2019s participation in the creation of the Hilger lease was \u201ccapable of influencing\u201d the banks\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We also conclude sufficient evidence existed to sustain Mr. Moser\u2019s conviction of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. For this charge, the jury had to find that \u201c(1) two or more persons agreed to violate the law, (2) the defendant knew the essential objectives of the conspiracy, (3) the defendant knowingly and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy, and (4) the alleged coconspirators were interdependent.\u201d <em>United States v. Yehling, </em>456 F.3d 1236, 1240 (10th Cir.2006). Mr. Moser contends the evidence produced against him was legally insufficient on the first three elements \u2014 that he did not agree with Mr. Frey to defraud lenders, he did not know their business venture was aimed at doing so, and he did not knowingly or voluntarily participate in any fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">But Mr. Moser\u2019s involvement with the Hilger lease alone once again suffices to satisfy each of these elements. From it a rational jury was free to conclude that Mr. Moser agreed to commit bank fraud with Mr. Frey \u2014 that Mr. Frey was the borrower on the loans for which Mr. Mos-er contributed the false Hilger lease to help bolster Mr. Frey\u2019s loan applications. A rational jury was also free to conclude from the lease that Mr. Moser knew he and Mr. Frey intended to misrepresent Mr. Frey\u2019s credit-worthiness by purporting to show lease income Mr. Frey didn\u2019t have. And, finally, from the document a rational jury was able infer that Mr. Mos-er knowingly and voluntarily participated in the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
