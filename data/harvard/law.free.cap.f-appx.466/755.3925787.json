GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A_q\">Before us is George Sisneros\u2019s appeal from a grant of qualified immunity to Officer Ronald Oreskovich and Sheriff Kirk Taylor, as well as the district court\u2019s denial of Mr. Sisneros\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint. The injuries Mr. Sisneros suffered are serious and saddening. But the district court thoroughly and carefully surveyed the relevant facts and law in four separate orders spanning more than forty pages before concluding that governing precedent required it first to grant qualified immunity and then to dismiss the case. After our own independent and searching review of the briefs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>record in this case, we are able to discern no reversible error in the district court\u2019s analysis. Neither are we able to see anything we might usefully say that has not been said already. Accordingly, we affirm for substantially the reasons the district court provided in its extensive opinions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
