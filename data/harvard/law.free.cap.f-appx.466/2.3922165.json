The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. R. 36(d). It is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b26-20\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the decision of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-21\">Appellant Terry Carter enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1974. He experienced severe abdominal pain for which he eventually received a splenectomy, but the pain did not go away. In 1978, Carter was honorably discharged; the National Naval Medical Center deemed him \u201cunfit for duty\u201d because of medical conditions, and assigned him a disability rate of 40%, which reflects \u201cthe average impairment in earning capacity resulting from ... injuries [suffered as a result of or incident to military service] ... in civil occupations,\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-22\">Following consultation with a doctor at the Department of Veterans Affairs, Carter filed an application with the Board for Correction of Naval Records seeking to have his disability rating increased from 40% to 100% and to be retroactively promoted as of May 1, 1977. The Board wrote Carter a letter explaining that \u201c[i]n order to properly evaluate [his] application,\u201d it needed his \u201cnaval medical record, which is in the custody of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA),\u201d and that because it had \u201cbeen unable to obtain [Carter\u2019s] records from that agency, [his] case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>has been closed administratively,\u201d but that \u201c[i]t will be reopened upon our receipt of [his] records from the VA.\u201d Letter from W. Dean Pfeiffer, Exec. Dir., Bd. for Correction of Naval Records, to Terry Carter (Apr. 29, 2003). When Carter inquired about the status of his application, the Board again explained that it \u201chas not ... yet received a copy\u201d of his VA files and suggested that he \u201ccontact the appropriate VA officials and demand that they forward the requested records to the Board as soon as possible.\u201d Letter from W. Dean Pfeiffer to Terry Carter (Jan. 28, 2005). And in a third letter, the Board explained that it \u201chas made several requests\u201d for those documents but that \u201cthe VA has not responded,\u201d and reiterated that the Board could not proceed until Carter \u201cauthorize[d] the release\u201d of his entire file. Letter from W. Dean Pfeiffer to Terry Carter 1 (Mar. 8, 2005). The letter concluded that if Carter was dissatisfied, he \u201cshould consider instituting an action in a court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">Carter filed suit in the district court seeking an order requiring the Board to review his application. The district court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction under the APA for want of final agency action.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">As the government acknowledges, the district court erred in holding that absence of final agency action under the APA constituted a jurisdictional defect. <em>See Trudeau v. FTC, </em>456 F.3d 178, 183-84 (D.C.Cir.2006). In such instances, depending on the particular case, we can consider whether to affirm on other grounds. <em>See, e.g., Sierra Club v. Jackson, </em>648 F.3d 848, 857 (D.C.Cir.2011). On appeal, Carter argues that (1) the Board\u2019s delay in responding to his application was unreasonable, and, alternatively, (2) the Board engaged in final agency action by closing his file and that Carter had no obligation to provide the medical files sought by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">The burden is on Carter to demonstrate that his files need correcting. There is no basis \u2014 in statute, regulation, or reason \u2014 to fault the Board for requesting his VA files. Indeed, the statute provides that the Secretary of the Navy <em>\u201cmay </em>correct any military record of the Secretary\u2019s department when the Secretary considers it necessary to correct an error or remove an injustice.\u201d 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1552(a)(1) (emphasis added). The regulations fleshing out this discretion expressly and reasonably allow the Board to demand more information \u201cas it may consider essential to a complete and impartial determination.\u201d 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 723.6(a)(2); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 723.4(e)(1) (\u201cIt is the responsibility of the applicant to procure such evidence not contained in the official records of the Department of the Navy as he/she desires to present in support of his/her case.\u201d). Carter provides us with no reason to believe the Board\u2019s request was unreasonable. Thus, any delay in this case was caused by Carter\u2019s own failure to provide the necessary documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s holding on the ground that on these facts, the agency need not act until Carter provides it with the necessary documents. In doing so, we express our gratitude to amicus curiae, the Appellate Litigation Clinic at the University of Georgia School of Law and Amanda S. Bersinger, for a job well done.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-10\">The Clerk is directed to withhold the issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en bane. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir.R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
