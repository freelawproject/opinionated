Benitez argues that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines by denying him a minor role adjustment because he served as the driver of a single load of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-20\">The defendant has the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his role was minor in the offense. <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>242 F.3d 593, 598 (5th Cir.2001). The district court\u2019s denial of the adjustment based on the particular facts of a case is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 204 (5th Cir.2005). Benitez has not shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his role was peripheral to the advancement of the illicit activity. <em>See United States v. Miranda, </em>248 F.3d 434, 446-47 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court did not clearly err by denying him the minor role adjustment. <em>See Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d at 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">Benitez also argues, for the first time on appeal, that the district court denied him a minor role reduction because it believed that such a reduction was categorically inappropriate for the driver of a load. \u201cA party must raise a claim of error with the district court in such a manner so that the district court may correct itself and thus, obviate the need for our review.\u201d <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because Benitez failed to raise his \u201cfixed policy\u201d argument in the district court, his argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>ment is reviewed for plain error only. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">A defendant may show that a district court is guilty of \u201cmechanical sentencing\u201d by showing that the court used terms indicating a predisposition, such as \u201croutinely\u201d or \u201chabitually.\u201d <em>See United States v. Clements, </em>634 F.2d 183, 187 (5th Cir.1981). In the instant case, the district court\u2019s remarks do not indicate that it \u201calways\u201d denied a minor role reduction to drug couriers. Rather, the court\u2019s statement that \u201cthe driver here of the load here, it\u2019s not a situation for role adjustment\u201d suggests that the court was considering the facts specifically before it. Accordingly, no plain error is shown. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
