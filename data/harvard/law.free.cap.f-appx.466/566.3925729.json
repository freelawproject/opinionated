Smith, a California state prisoner, appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo. <em>Wyatt v. Terhune, </em>315 F.3d 1108, 1117 (9th Cir.2003). We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-23\">The district court concluded that Smith\u2019s June 5, 2005 grievance could not serve to exhaust administrative remedies with respect to his First Amendment retaliation claim because Smith did not properly present his retaliation claim until October 20, 2005, four months after his grievance was filed. However, it appears that the handwritten pages signed June 5, 2005, appended to the grievance form and complaining that Davis\u2019s conduct was a \u201cdirect reprisal\u201d against him, predated the October 20, 2005 allegations. Thus, we are in doubt as to exhaustion. Accordingly, we vacate and remand for further proceedings to allow the district court to reexamine whether Smith properly exhausted his retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>The parties shall bear their own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b590-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
