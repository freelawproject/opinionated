Terry\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in her opinion, that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but raising the issues of whether Terry\u2019s appeal falls within the scope of his appellate waiver and whether the district court abused its discretion by sentencing him as a career offender and ordering that his sentence run consecutively to his undischarged state sentence. The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal as barred by Terry\u2019s waiver of the right to appeal included in the plea agreement. Terry was notified of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-20\">Upon review of the plea agreement and the transcript of the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, we conclude that Terry knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal, and the issues he seeks to raise fall within the scope of the waiver. Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-21\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeal. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-22\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
