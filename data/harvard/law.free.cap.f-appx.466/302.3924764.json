This court reviews an order granting or denying a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Munn, </em>595 F.3d 183, 186 (4th Cir.2010). A district court abuses its discretion if it relies on an erroneous factual or legal premise. <em>DIRECTV, Inc. v. Rawlins, </em>523 F.3d 318, 323 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-16\">In the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d), Adkins was held responsible for 31.59 grams of crack cocaine. At sentencing, the district court purported to adopt the PSR. It determined, however, that the drug amount in the PSR should be reduced by approximately seven grams. It nonetheless stated merely that Adkins was responsible for at least twenty but less than thirty-five grams of crack cocaine. The precise amount of crack cocaine for which Adkins was held responsible is thus ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">Under the Guidelines as amended pursuant to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, the base offense level for an offender responsible for twenty grams of crack cocaine is twenty-two, the base offense level for an offender responsible for at least 22.4 grams of crack cocaine is twenty-four, and the base offense level for an offender responsible for at least twenty-eight grams of crack cocaine is twenty-six. USSG \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(7)-(9). It is therefore unclear from the current record whether Adkins is eligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to the recently-amended Guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because the record is insufficient to determine Adkins\u2019 eligibility for a sentence reduction, we remand with instructions for the district court to make additional find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>ings as to the amount of crack cocaine attributable to Adkins and, based on that finding, determine anew whether Adkins can or should benefit from Amendment 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for reconsideration of the \u00a7 8582 motion. The Clerk is directed to issue the mandate forthwith. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b327-12\">. Adkins was originally sentenced to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment after pleading guilty to distribution of cocaine base (\"crack cocaine\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2006). In 2008, the district court reduced her sentence to eighty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-18\">. The sentence reduction in 2008 resulted in an amended offense level of twenty-eight under the Guidelines, which included a two-level enhancement for Adkins' use of a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b327-19\">. Amendment 750, which amended the Guidelines in accordance with the FSA, became retroactive on November 1, 2011. USSG \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
