The district court granted summary judgment to defendants Cox, Spain, and the City and County of San Francisco. It dismissed with prejudice the claims against defendants Buckley, Fong, and Stuwe.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It dismissed without prejudice Mclnerney\u2019s state law claims, and his claims against unserved defendants Tides Center, Dish, Hughes, and Gary. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-12\">Mclnerney contends that the district court improperly excluded evidence of an unlawful search of his backpack, but he does not identify \u2014 and we could not locate \u2014 any motion seeking to offer that evidence, nor any order excluding it. Because this contention was not accompanied by sufficient reasons or argument, we deem it waived. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A); <em>Katie A., ex rel. Ludin v. L.A. Cnty., </em>481 F.3d 1150, 1161 n. 21 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">Mclnerney contends that the district court should not have required him to show excusable neglect for his failure to serve some of the defendants. We review a dismissal for failure to effect service under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(m) for abuse of discretion. <em>Puett v. Blandford, </em>912 F.2d 270, 273 (9th Cir.1990). It was Mclnerney\u2019s responsibility to provide the marshal with information sufficient to identify the defendants. <em>See Walker, </em>14 F.3d at 1422. Because Mclnerney did not establish that he did so, and did not explain his failure to do so, the district court properly dismissed without prejudice his claims against unserved defendants Tides Center, Dish, Hughes, and Gary. <em>See Lemoge v. United States, </em>587 F.3d 1188, 1198 n. 3 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Walker, </em>14 F.3d at 1422.</p>\n<p id=\"A14\">We review a summary judgment de novo. <em>See Brodheim v. Cry, </em>584 F.3d 1262, 1267 (9th Cir.2009). The district court properly entered judgment on Mcln<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>erney\u2019s false arrest claim because the officers had probable cause to arrest him for trespassing in violation of California Penal Code \u00a7 602(o). <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code \u00a7 886(a)(1); <em>Edgerly v. City and Cnty. of S.F., </em>599 F.3d 946, 953 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Blankenhom v. City of Orange, </em>485 F.3d 463, 474-75 (9th Cir.2007). Mclnerney acknowledged that he refused to leave the LeNain after being asked to do so by both Hughes, who was in charge, and the police officers; he also acknowledged that access to the LeNain was regulated by a door buzzer. <em>See Blankenhom, </em>485 F.3d at 474-75. Mclnerney cannot defeat summary judgment when he presented no evidence that the LeNain was open to the public, and likewise presented no evidence that Hughes did not have authority, as the owner\u2019s agent, to bar him from the premises. <em>See </em>CaLPenal Code \u00a7 602(o); <em>Soremekun v. Thrifty Payless, Inc., </em>509 F.3d 978, 984 (9th Cir.2007) (\u201c[c]onclusory, speculative testimony in affidavits and moving papers\u201d cannot defeat summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Mclnerney failed to provide sufficient evidence that the officers used unreasonable force in arresting him, as required for his excessive force claim. <em>See Arpin v. Santa Clara Valley Transp. Agency, </em>261 F.3d 912, 921-22 (9th Cir.2001). Mclnerney testified at his deposition that the handcuffs were merely uncomfortable, and were removed at his request. He did not claim that they were excessively tight or caused him injury. <em>Cf. Wall v. Cnty. of Orange, </em>364 F.3d 1107, 1109-10, 1112 (9th Cir.2004). According to Mclnerney, after he was handcuffed, an officer \u201ctried to strongarm [him]\u201d and grabbed his arm as he led Mclnerney to the police van. The officer removed his hand at Mclnerney\u2019s request. To the extent any force was used, it \u201cwas patently reasonable and commensurate with what was needed,\u201d especially in light of Mclnerney\u2019s earlier, repeated refusals to leave the premises. <em>See Johnson v. Cnty. of L.A., </em>340 F.3d 787, 793 (9th Cir.2003); <em>Arpin, </em>261 F.3d at 921-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The district court properly granted summary judgment to San Francisco because Mclnerney failed to demonstrate that he was deprived of any of his constitutional rights. <em>See Jackson v. City of Bremerton, </em>268 F.3d 646, 653-54 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to decline supplemental jurisdiction for abuse of discretion. <em>Trs. of the Constr. Indus, and Laborers Health and Welfare Trust v. Desert Valley Landscape &amp; Maint., Inc., </em>333 F.3d 923, 925 (9th Cir.2003). There was no abuse of discretion because the district court had dismissed or granted judgment on all of Mclnerney\u2019s federal claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Camegie-Mellon Univ. v. Cohill, </em>484 U.S. 343, 350 n. 7, 108 S.Ct. 614, 98 L.Ed.2d 720 (1988); <em>Acri v. Varian Assocs., Inc., </em>114 F.3d 999, 1000 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-11\">. Buckley, Fong and Stuwe were not served, but the district court dismissed the federal claims against them with prejudice in light of the court\u2019s conclusions with respect to the motion for summary judgment. On appeal, Mclnerney does not challenge that dismissal. Instead, he claims that the marshal should have served Buckley. This argument fails because Mclnerney never showed that he requested that Buckley be served. <em>See Walker v. Sumner, </em>14 F.3d 1415, 1422 (9th Cir.1994), <em>overruled on other grounds by Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
