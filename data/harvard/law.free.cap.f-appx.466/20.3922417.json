Kravitz of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b46-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">Plaintiff Robert Spira appeals from the dismissal of his complaint alleging that J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (\u201cChase\u201d) and Mait, Wang &amp; Simmons (\u201cMait\u201d) violated state and federal law in restraining and executing against his bank account which allegedly contained only Social Security funds. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). In reviewing the dismissal <em>de novo, </em>we assume the truth of all facts alleged in the complaint, as well as in public state-court records on which Spira relied in his original pleading, and we draw all reasonable inferences in Spira\u2019s favor. <em>See Mortimer Off Shore Sens., Ltd. v. Fed. Republic of Ger., </em>615 F.3d 97, 113-14 (2d Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 1502, 179 L.Ed.2d 360 (2011); <em>Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 153 (2d Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">1. <em>\u201cAnti-attachment\u201d Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"An6\">The district court dismissed Spira\u2019s first claim against Chase, alleging a direct violation of the Social Security Act\u2019s anti-attachment provision, <em>see </em>42' U.S.C. \u00a7 407(a), as time-barred under the three-year New York State statute of limitations for the state-law claim it found most analogous to his federal claim. <em>See </em>N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(2) (pertaining to actions brought \u201cto recover upon a liability, penalty or forfeiture created or imposed by statute\u201d). On appeal, Spira renews his argument that no limitations period applies to his claim because \u00a7 407 specifies no limitations period and because the application of any limitations period would violate \u00a7 407(b)\u2019s provision that \u201c[n]o other provision of law ... be construed to limit, supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of [\u00a7 407].\u201d Although the district court did not address this argument, we conclude that it is without merit and, accordingly, affirm dismissal of Spira\u2019s anti-attachment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-14\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that \u00a7 407 even creates a private cause of action to enforce its anti-attachment provisions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 407(b) does not preclude the application of a statute of limitations to such an action because limitations periods do not \u201climit, supersede, or otherwise modify,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 407(b), a person\u2019s substantive right that his Social Security funds not \u201cbe subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 407(a). As we have noted in the retroactivity context, limitations periods generally do not modify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>underlying substantive rights. Rather, they govern secondary conduct, <em>ie., </em>a party\u2019s filing of a lawsuit to enforce the underlying right. <em>See Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., </em>49 F.3d 886, 890 (2d Cir.1995) (holding application of amended limitations period to conduct pre-dating enactment not impermissibly retroactive because \u201c[t]he conduct to which the statute of limitations applies is not the primary conduct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but is instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the filing of their suit\u201d); <em>see also P. Stolz Family P\u2019ship v. Daum, </em>355 F.3d 92, 102 (2d Cir.2004) (distinguishing statutes of repose, which define and limit rights, from statutes of limitations, which \u201cbear on the availability of remedies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Further, a federal statute\u2019s failure to reference a limitations period does not compel the conclusion that no limitations period applies. Where Congress creates a cause of action without specifying a limitations period, federal courts generally borrow a limitations period or other timeliness rule from the most analogous souree-ordinarily state law. <em>See Muto v. CBS Corp., </em>668 F.3d 53, 56-57 (2d Cir.2012).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This doctrine flows from the assumption that \u201cabsent some sound reason to do otherwise, Congress would likely intend that the courts follow their previous practice of borrowing state provisions.\u201d <em>DelCostello v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, </em>462 U.S. 151, 158 n. 12, 103 S.Ct. 2281, 76 L.Ed.2d 476 (1983); <em>see also Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, </em>501 U.S. 350, 356, 111 S.Ct. 2773, 115 L.Ed.2d 321 (1991) (\u201cRooted as it is in the expectations of Congress, the \u2018state-borrowing doctrine\u2019 may not be lightly abandoned.\u201d). Section 407(b) evinces no congressional intent to override federal courts\u2019 practice of borrowing analogous timeliness rules. The text of \u00a7 407(b) says nothing regarding a Social Security beneficiary\u2019s enforcement remedies and the legislative history indicates that the purpose of \u00a7 407(b) was to prevent subsequent legislative enactments from implicitly superseding \u00a7 407(a) rights, not remedies. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 98-25(1), at 82-83 (1983), <em>reprinted in </em>1983 U.S.C.C.A.N. 219, 301-02 (noting concern that provisions of Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978 had led bankruptcy courts to treat Social Security benefits as income, and stating that \u00a7 407(b) was \u201cspecifically\u201d intended to ensure that such benefits \u201cmay not be assigned notwithstanding any other provisions of law,\u201d including the \u201cBankruptcy Reform Act of 1978\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">Thus, we identify no merit in Spira\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s application of New York\u2019s three-year limitations period. <em>See </em>N.Y. C.P.L.R. 214(2).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b47-10\">2. <em>Remaining Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-11\">Because Spira \u201cdevotes only a single conclusory sentence\u201d to the dismissal of his Fair Debt Collection Practices Act claim against Mait, we deem that claim abandoned on appeal. <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Norton v. Sam\u2019s Club, </em>145 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.1998). Further, Spira\u2019s failure to argue in the district court (1) that state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>courts have enforced New York\u2019s Exempt Income Protection Act retroactively notwithstanding its effective date, and (2) that his breach-of-contract and NY. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7 349 claims against Chase are timely because they involved continuing violations and because of Chase\u2019s allegedly \u201cegregious\u201d behavior, renders those arguments un-preserved for appellate review. <em>See Allianz Ins. Co. v. Lerner, </em>416 F.3d 109, 114 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Aslanidis v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>7 F.3d 1067, 1077 (2d Cir.1993) (holding that party must raise all arguments against summary disposition in trial court and may not raise them for first time on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b46-12\">. Although Spira purports to act <em>pro se </em>in this appeal, he was represented by his wife, a licensed attorney, in the district court, and Spira has not contested Chase\u2019s assertion that she is responsible for ghostwriting his appellate briefs. Under these circumstances, Spira is not entitled to \"claim the special consideration which the courts customarily grant to <em>pro se </em>parties.\u201d <em>Holtz </em>v. <em>Rockefeller &amp; Co., Inc., </em>258 F.3d 62, 82 n. 4 (2d Cir.2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b46-16\">. The parties have not briefed and we have no occasion to decide whether \u00a7 407 creates a private cause of action, or whether a third-party garnishee who complies with one of the forms of \"legal process\u201d covered by \u00a7 407(a) violates its anti-attachment provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b47-6\">. Because \u00a7 407 was enacted before December 1, 1990, any action under that statute would not be subject to the catch-all limitations period in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1658(a) (providing that, except as otherwise indicated, four-year limitations period applies to all civil actions arising under statutes enacted after December 1, 1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b47-12\">. To the extent Spira faults the district court's determination that his anti-attachment claims accrued when his account was first restrained because the restraint was a continuing violation of his \u00a7 407(a) rights, Spira waived this argument by failing to raise it before the district court. <em>See In re Literary Works in Elec. Databases Copyright Litig., </em>654 F.3d 242, 255 n. 8 (2d Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
