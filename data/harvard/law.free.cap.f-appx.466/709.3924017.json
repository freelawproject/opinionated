On appeal, Mr. Gregor claims that the violation of his confrontation clause rights under <em>Craw</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number><em>ford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), was not harmless, and that he received ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel based on the <em>Crawford </em>'violation. Aplt. Br. at 3, 6. The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) held that the Sixth Amendment post-conviction <em>Crawford </em>claim was procedurally barred for failure to raise the claim on direct appeal, a holding not challenged in this appeal. 1 R. 311; <em>Gregor v. Franklin, </em>No. 5:09-cv00464-W, 2011 WL 4401611 at *6 n. 5 (WD.Okla. Aug.5, 2011). Nevertheless, the OCCA did consider the <em>Crawford </em>claim in the context of Mr. Gregor\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim, and concluded that no confrontation clause violation occurred because the statements in question did not expressly inculpate Mr. Gregor. 1 R. 311-12. To the contrary, on collateral review, both the magistrate judge and the district court concluded that a <em>Crawford </em>violation occurred \u2014 for the purposes of assessing the ineffective assistance of counsel claim \u2014 when the state trial court admitted testimonial statements to a police officer by a non-testifying co-defendant. <em>Gregor, </em>2011 WL 4401611 at *6; <em>Gregor v. Franklin, </em>No. 5:09-cv00464-W, 2011 WL 4006576 at *3, n.3 (W.D.Okla. Sept. 8, 2011). Ultimately, however, both the magistrate judge and the district court concluded that the result reached by the OCCA on the ineffective assistance claim was entitled to deference.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While we reach the same result, I conclude that the OCCA did not misapply clearly established Supreme Court precedent in determining that there was no <em>Crawford </em>violation, and therefore Mr. Gregor does not succeed on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim under <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">On March 29, 2007, a jury convicted Mr. Gregor of attempted grand larceny for attempting to steal several pieces of equipment from the Western Equipment yard near Clinton, Oklahoma, on April 16, 2006. None of the five persons charged testified at trial. At trial, the investigator for the Custer County Sheriffs Department testified as to statements made by a co-defendant, Mr. Rackley, during his interrogation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-8\">I basically asked him what had happened earlier in the morning, and he told me that they had been at Lake Thunderbird all evening and they were on their way to Woodward because Mr. Gregor had to take a urine test for his job. They had stopped in Weatherford and got something to eat and after they left there, the Gregors got into an argument, and she kicked them out. I then asked him what was he doing around Western Equipment, and he then denied being around Western Equipment. I said, \u201cWell, what if I said your footprints were found on the Western Equipment yard?\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I walked through there, but I didn\u2019t steal nothing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">2 Trial Tr. 325. On direct appeal, the OCCA held that the statements of Mr. Gregor\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant did not deny him his confrontation rights because those statements did not \u201cexpressly implicate\u201d him in the crime. 1 R. 315; <em>see Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 137, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968). Mr. Gregor sought post-conviction relief on the theory that introduction of the above statement (1) denied him his rights under <em>Crawford, </em>and (2) should have been raised on direct appeal (ineffective assistance of appellate counsel). The OCCA held that the former was procedurally barred, and the latter lacked merit because the codefendant\u2019s statement still must expressly implicate the defendant to amount to a <em>Crawford </em>violation. Therefore, there was no <em>Crawford </em>violation and counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue was not deficient. 1 R. 312.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Mr. Gregor must prove (1) deficient performance and (2) prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A federal habeas court must defer to the state court\u2019s proceedings on Mr. Gregor\u2019s ineffective assistance claims unless those proceedings \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (2). Section 2254(d) contains difficult standards to satisfy\u2014a defendant must show that a state court\u2019s ruling is \u201cso lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\u201d <em>Harrington v. Richter,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014,\u2014-\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786-87, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011). Moreover, factual findings made by state courts are presumed correct unless the presumption is rebutted by clear and convincing evidence. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">Applying these deferential standards, it is clear that Mr. Gregor\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of counsel fails under the first requirement of <em>Strickland. </em>Although the magistrate judge concluded that the statements above were \u201cclearly testimonial\u201d under <em>Crawford </em>because they were the product of police interrogation, 541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, we have observed that \u201cnot every statement made in response to an interrogation is testimonial\u201d for purposes of confrontation clause analysis, <em>United States v. Smalls, </em>605 F.3d 765, 779 (10th Cir.2010). Rather, the emphasis must be on the responses generated. <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822 n. 1, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). Moreover, <em>Crawford </em>itself deals with witnesses against the accused bearing <em>inculpatory </em>testimonial statements. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354. Thus, the OCCA could reasonably conclude (as it did with Mr. Gregor\u2019s <em>Bruton </em>claim raised on direct appeal) that Mr. Rackley\u2019s statement to the officer simply did not inculpate Mr. Gregor in criminal activity, and therefore its introduction did not amount to a <em>Crawford </em>violation. \u201cFederal courts may no longer extract clearly established law from the general legal principles developed in factually distinct contexts----[Wjhether the law is clearly established is dispositive of the \u00a7 2254(d)(1) analysis.\u201d <em>See Lambert v. Workman, </em>594 F.3d 1260, 1263 (10th Cir.2010). Accordingly, Mr. Gregor cannot prove deficient performance of counsel under <em>Strickland. </em>Therefore, it is unnecessary to reach <em>Strickland\u2019s </em>prejudice requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">We DENY a COA, and DISMISS this appeal. We GRANT Mr. Gregor IFP status.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-4\">. The magistrate judge so held because it was reasonable to conclude that the confrontation clause violation was harmless error and did not prejudice Mr. Gregor under the <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>test, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Gregor </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>2011 WLf 4401611 at *7-8. The district court concluded that Mr. Gregor could not show that the OCCA\u2019s rejection of his ineffective assistance claim was unreasonable given Supreme Court precedent. <em>Gregor v. Franklin, </em>2011 WL 4006576 at *3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b735-13\">HARTZ, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"At1E\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b735-14\">I concur in the result. I join the district court in believing that the magistrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>judge got it right. In my view, the statement by the codefendant was testimonial evidence offered for the truth of the matter asserted. But, after reviewing the trial evidence, I believe that it would not be unreasonable (in fact, I think it would be quite reasonable) to decide that admission of the evidence was harmless error.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b736-4\">HOLMES, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AE5\">concurring in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">I respectfully concur in the decision to deny Petitioner David Gregor a Certif\u00edcate of Appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Specifically, I would hold that reasonable jurists could not debate the district court\u2019s conclusion that the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cOCCA\u201d) did not unreasonably apply <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in rejecting Mr. Gregor\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. However, I respectfully disagree with the reasoning of my esteemed colleague, Judge Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">In my view, it was clearly established law under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), that testimonial statements may implicate the protections of the Sixth Amendment, even if they do not directly inculpate or expressly implicate the defendant. The critical inquiry under <em>Crawford </em>focuses on whether a declarant could have objectively perceived that the primary purpose of his or her statement was for use in a criminal investigation or prosecution\u2014 irrespective of whether that statement could incriminate the defendant. <em>See </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (discussing \u201c[v]arious formulations of this core class of \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements\u201d); <em>see also Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (noting that statements made \u201cin response to police interrogation\u201d are \u201ctestimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate ... that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d); <em>United States v. Smalls, </em>605 F.3d 765, 778 (10th Cir.2010) (\u201cSynthesizing <em>Crawford </em>and <em>Davis, </em>we might today formulate a definition of a testimonial statement which reads: a formal declaration made by the declarant that, when objectively considered, indicates the primary purpose for which the declaration was made was that of establishing or proving some fact potentially relevant to a criminal prosecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">Therefore, the OCCA unreasonably interpreted <em>Crawford, </em>when it held: <em>\u201cCrawford </em>did not change the principle recognized in <em>Bruton </em>that a codefendant\u2019s statements must directly inculpate the defendant before a confrontation clause violation occurs.\u201d R., Vol. 1, at 312 (Order Affirm. Den. of Appl. for Post-Conviction Relief, dated Oct. 7, 2010). In effect, in rejecting Mr. Gregor\u2019s distinct <em>Crawford </em>claim, the OCCA rendered the rule of <em>Crawford </em>conterminous with that of <em>Bruton, </em>and concluded that if, as it had previously held, the latter was not violated, then neither could the former have been. However, this reading of <em>Crawford </em>defies logic because <em>Bruton </em>arises in the narrow context of joint trials of co-defendants and is predicated on the Confrontation Clause principles of <em>Crawford; </em>it cannot be read to delimit <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>scope. <em>See, e.g., Smalls, </em>605 F.3d at 768 n. 2 (\u201c[T]he <em>Bruton </em>rule, like the Confrontation Clause <em>upon which it is premised, </em>does not apply to nontestimonial hearsay statements.\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>581 F.3d 320, 326 (6th Cir.2009) (noting that \u201cthe <em>Bruton </em>rule guards against a risk that arises in joint trials\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Nonetheless, in my view, the OCCA still reasonably concluded under <em>Strickland </em>that Mr. Gregor\u2019s appellate counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>to present a <em>Crawford </em>claim because such a claim would have been without merit. In his supplemental brief before the district court, Mr. Gregor focused his <em>Crawford </em>arguments on the testimony of co-defendant Rackley. I agree with the district court (as well as the magistrate judge) that co-defendant Rackley\u2019s statements were \u201cclearly testimonial\u201d under <em>Crawford. </em>R., Vol. 1, at 871 n. 3 (Dist. Ct. Order, dated Sept. 8, 2011). However, when statements are not admitted for a hearsay purpose (i.e., to prove the truth of the matter asserted), they do not fall within the protective ambit of <em>Crawford. See </em>541 U.S. at 59 n. 9, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (noting that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Pablo, </em>625 F.3d 1285, 1291 (10th Cir.2010) (\u201cA defendant\u2019s confrontation rights are implicated by the admission of testimonial statements against him, however, only when they are admitted to establish the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\u201d). As the State has repeatedly asserted in this litigation, the co-defendants\u2019 statements \u201cwere not offered to establish the truth of what the co-defendants said,\u201d R., Vol. 1, at 254 (Resp. to Suppl. Br. of Pet\u2019r, dated Nov. 19, 2010), and, in particular, co-defendant Rackley\u2019s statements were \u201coffered only to show that the statements were made, and that they were inconsistent,\u201d <em>id. </em>Accordingly, the admission of those statements \u2014 in particular, co-defendant Rackley\u2019s statements \u2014 did not implicate the protections of <em>Crawford </em>and, consequently, Mr. Gregor\u2019s appellate counsel could not be deemed constitutionally ineffective for failing to assert a <em>Crawford </em>claim. The OCCA\u2019s rejection of Mr. Gregor\u2019s claim for ineffective assistance of appellate counsel was thus not an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland, </em>and reasonable jurists could not debate this outcome. Accordingly, on this claim, I would deny Mr. Gregor a COA.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
