R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b686-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">Richard Hutasoit, a native and citizen of Indonesia, petitions pro se for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 order dismissing his appeal from an immigration judge\u2019s decision denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings. <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006). We deny in part and grant in part the petition for review, and we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">The record does not compel the conclusion that Hutasoit established changed circumstances to excuse his untimely asylum application. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.4(a)(4); <em>Ramadan v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 657-58 (9th Cir.2007). Accordingly, his asylum claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Hutasoit\u2019s experiences in Indonesia, even considered cumulatively, did not rise to the level of past persecution. <em>See Hoxha v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2003). In addition, the record does not compel the conclusion that there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Christians in Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary v. Holder, </em>558 F.3d 1049, 1061 (9th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">In assessing Hutasoit\u2019s individualized risk of future persecution, however, the agency did not have the benefit of our opinions in <em>Wakkary </em>or <em>Tampubolon v. Holder, </em>610 F.3d 1056 (9th Cir.2010). Accordingly, we grant the petition with respect to Hutasoit\u2019s withholding of removal claim and remand for the agency to consider it under a disfavored group analysis. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-15\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief because Hutasoit failed to demonstrate it is more likely than not he will be tortured if returned to Indonesia. <em>See Wakkary, </em>558 F.3d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-16\">Each party shall bear their own costs on this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b686-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
