Cutter (\u201cJohn\u201d), as guardian ad litem for Trip Cutter (\u201cTrip\u201d), Edward\u2019s son, appeal from the opinion of the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel (\u201cBAP\u201d) affirming the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that certain real property located on Thurston Circle, Los Angeles, was conveyed to Edward rather than Trip and therefore is within the bankruptcy estate. David Seror, the Chapter 7 Trustee, cross-appeals from the BAP\u2019s affirmance of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination that Trip has a one-third interest in certain property located on Whipple Street in North Hollywood. We affirm the Bankruptcy Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-15\">In <em>Weisman v. Peters (In re Weisman), </em>5 F.3d 417, 421 (9th Cir.1993), we stated that \u201c[w]hether the circumstances are sufficient to require inquiry as to another\u2019s interest in property for the purposes of [California Civil Code] section 19 is a question of fact, even where there is no dispute over the historical facts,\u201d thus invoking a clear error standard of review. In <em>Murray v. Bammer (In re Bammer), </em>131 F.3d 788, 791-92 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc), we reiterated that the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s determination of historical facts are reviewed for clear error, but held that mixed questions concerning the selection of the applicable legal rules and the application of the facts to those rules are reviewed de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-16\">1. Edward and John assert that the Bankruptcy Court failed to give proper weight to the Declaration of John J. Ermatinger, which sets forth his intent to name Trip as a grantee of the Thurston Circle property. The record shows that the Bankruptcy Court properly considered Ermatinger\u2019s declaration, but reasonably determined that the property was conveyed to Edward based on a number of relevant factors. The court noted that the name on the title was \u201cEdward W. Cutter, a Single Man\u201d which coincides with Edward\u2019s name and marital status. In addition, the court considered that: (a) Trip was a minor, (b) the California Uniform Transfer to Minors Act was not used to attempt to convey an interest to Trip, (c) Edward financed the purchase of the property, and (d) Edward treated the Thurston property as his own. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Edward and John have not shown that the Bankruptcy Court erred in determining that the Thurston Circle property was conveyed to Edward.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">2. Seror, the Chapter 7 Trustee, cross-appeals alleging that the Bankruptcy Court erred in awarding a one-third interest in the Whipple property to Trip. Specifically, the Trustee argues that the use of the language \u201cEdward Williams Cutter, Fils\u201d did not place him on inquiry notice and that in any event, an inquiry would not have revealed that Trip was the owner of a one-third interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree with the BAP that the evidence before the Bankruptcy Court presented \u201ctwo plausible interpretations of the facts, and its choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>In re Cutter, </em>2010 WL 6467694, at *16 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.2010) (unpublished) (citing <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N.C., </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985)). Seror has not demonstrated that the Bankruptcy Court erred in determining that Trip has a one-third interest in the Whipple property.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">As neither appellants nor cross-appellee have shown that the Bankruptcy Court erred in its rulings, its Judgment After Trial, filed and entered on October 30, 2009, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b642-9\">. Seror\u2019s request for judicial notice is granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b642-7\">N.R. SMITH, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"As0\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">I agree with the outcome of the majority\u2019s Memorandum Disposition. However, I write separately to highlight the appropriate standard of review. The BAP applied the correct clearly erroneous standard of review and correctly found that the bankruptcy court did not clearly err in its decisions. <em>Cutter v. Seror (In re Cutter), </em>2010 WL 6467694, *15-16 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.2010). In their briefs, the parties agree, proposing the clearly erroneous standard as the appropriate standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">This court has specifically addressed the proper standard of review when California Civil Code Section 19 is determinative, and we face such a situation here. \u201cWhether the circumstances are sufficient to require inquiry as to another\u2019s interest in property for the purposes of section 19 is a question of fact, even where there is no dispute over the historical facts.\u201d <em>Weisman v. Peters (In re Weisman), </em>5 F.3d 417, 421 (9th Cir.1993). Questions of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Hinkson, </em>585 F.3d 1247, 1259-60 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc); <em>Murray v. Bammer (In re Bammer), </em>131 F.3d 788, 791 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc); <em>In re Weisman, </em>5 F.3d at 419. Therefore, the proper standard of review in this case is the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See In re Cutter, </em>2010 WL 6467694, *7,15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">In <em>In re Weisman, </em>the court emphasized the underlying facts that must be determined in order to decide if the trustee was on inquiry or constructive notice. 5 F.3d at 421 (\u201cThe essential dispute between the parties is whether Peters\u2019 and Neergaard\u2019s possession of the house was consistent or inconsistent with the record title in Peters\u2019 and Weisman\u2019s names.\u201d). Similarly, here, the central dispute involves the actions by the debtor and others and their consistency with the names on the deeds. <em>See </em>Maj. Memo, at 617-18. Therefore, <em>In re Weisman </em>held that the specific situation we face in this appeal is a question of fact, and thus any presumption that this case should be reviewed de novo is overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">While language from <em>In re Bammer </em>may suggest that a de novo review is appropi\u2019iate in certain situations, its holding is narrow and does not overrule <em>In re Weisman </em>here. <em>In re Bammer </em>considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>whether the debtor\u2019s fraudulent conduct qualified as \u201cmalicious\u201d under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 528(a)(6) and did not suggest that mixed questions are always reviewed de novo. 131 F.3d at 791-92. Thus, because the question at hand is essentially factual and <em>In re Weisman </em>recognized the factual nature of this determination, <em>see </em>5 F.3d at 421, the language in <em>In re Bammer </em>is inapplicable.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
