His conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>508 F.3d 1321, 1330 (10th Cir.2007). Proceeding <em>pro se, </em>Baker sought habeas-corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, maintaining he was convicted of a nonexistent offense in the light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>District of Columbia v. Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 128 S.Ct. 2783, 171 L.Ed.2d 637 (2008), and <em>McDonald v. City of Chicago,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3020, 177 L.Ed.2d 894 (2010), concerning the Second Amendment \u201cright ... to keep and bear arms\u201d. The district court ruled Baker could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his claim did not satisfy the requirements of the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e) and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Section 2255 provides the main vehicle to present a collateral challenge to a federal sentence. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Section 2255 relief is the remedy for \u201cerrors that occurred at or prior to sentencing\u201d. <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Detention Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). In contrast, \u00a7 2241 is used to present a challenge to \u201cthe manner in which a sentence is executed\u201d. <em>Tolliver, </em>211 F.3d at 877. A \u00a7 2241 petition raising errors \u201cthat occurr[ed] at trial or sentencing is properly construed [as arising] under \u00a7 2255\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 877-78. Baker challenges the legality of his conviction and sentence. As such, Baker\u2019s claim must be presented under \u00a7 2255. <em>Cox, </em>911 F.2d at 1113.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">If prisoner can demonstrate that the \u00a7 2255 remedy would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [the prisoner\u2019s] detention\u201d, he may be permitted to pursue a claim pursuant to \u00a7 2241 under \u00a7 2255\u2019s \u201csavings clause\u201d. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 901 (5th Cir.2001). That clause applies to a claim that: (i) \u201cis based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that ... petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense\u201d; and (ii) \u201cwas foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in ... petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 904. Our court has rejected Baker\u2019s contentions. <em>E.g., United States v. Anderson, </em>559 F.3d 348, 352 (5th Cir.2009); <em>Dority v. Roy, </em>420 Fed.Appx. 401, 402 (5th Cir.2011) (affirming dismissal of \u00a7 2241 petition because claim based on <em>Heller </em>did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause). Therefore, Baker has not shown that he is entitled, through \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause to proceed under \u00a7 2241.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-35\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
