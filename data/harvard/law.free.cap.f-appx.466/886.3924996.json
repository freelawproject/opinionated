Wade (\u201cWade\u201d) petitions for review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d), <em>Wade v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>No. SF-0831-11-0045-I-1 (M.S.P.B. July 1, 2011) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>The Board found Wade ineligible to make a redeposit or receive an annuity under the Civil Service Retire<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>ment System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). <em>See id.; Wade v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>No. SF-0831-11-0045-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 4, 2011) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision </em>\u201d). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">Wade was employed by the Department of the Navy from 1971 until his resignation in April 1988. On the day of his resignation, Wade executed Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) Form 1425, \u201cApplication for Refund of Retirement Deductions,\u201d requesting a refund of his retirement deductions. In May 1988, OPM authorized and paid a refund in the amount of $23,086.59. Wade has not been reemployed in the federal service.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-7\">In July 2010, Wade submitted OPM Standard Form 2803, \u201cApplication to Make Deposit or Redeposit: Civil Service Retirement System,\u201d requesting that he be allowed to redeposit his retirement deductions; and in August 2010, Wade submitted OPM Form 1496A, \u201cCivil Service Retirement System: Application for Deferred Retirement,\u201d requesting an annuity through the CSRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-8\">In October 2010, OPM issued a final decision finding that because Wade was not a current federal employee and had received a refund of his retirement deductions, he was not eligible to redeposit his funds or to receive CSRS annuity benefits. The administrative judge affirmed this decision, <em>Initial Decision, </em>slip op. at 7, and the Board denied Wade\u2019s petition for review, making the decision of the administrative judge the final decision of the Board, <em>Final Order, </em>slip op. at 3. The Board agreed that Wade was ineligible to make a redeposit because he did not meet the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. <em>Id., </em>slip op. at 2. The Board also found that it need not consider Wade\u2019s argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that OPM Form 1425 failed to provide adequate notice of the consequences of securing a refund, but noted that even considering this argument, Form 1425 was \u201cclear enough\u201d and that \u201cOPM cannot be estopped from denying the appellant\u2019s application for redeposit based on an alleged lack of clarity in OPM Form 1425.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b911-10\">Wade timely petitioned for review. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-11\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b911-12\">Our review of Board decisions is limited. We may only set aside agency actions, findings, or conclusions that we find to be \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>see also Bennett v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>635 F.3d 1215, 1218 (Fed.Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">Wade raises two arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the Board erred in finding that he is not an \u201cemployee\u201d eligible to redeposit his retirement deductions under the applicable statute and regulations. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8342(a) specifies that the receipt of a \u201clump-sum credit\u201d for retirement benefits \u201cvoids all annuity rights ... until the employee ... is reemployed,\u201d except as provided in section 8343a (which governs alternative forms of annuities and' is not relevant to this case) or 8334(d)(2). Section 8334(d) states that an employee \u201cwho has received a refund of retirement deductions ... may deposit the amount received, with interest\u201d if the employee left government service before March 1,1991, and \u201cis entitled to an annuity [under the CSRS] which is based on service of such employee ... and which commences on or after December 2, 1990.\u201d OPM is charged with implementing this paragraph, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(d)(2)(C), and the agency has issued regulations stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>that \u201c[a] person may make a deposit or redeposit under section 8334 ... if he or she is an \u2018employee,\u2019 \u201d where \u201cemployee\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-4\">(1) A person currently employed in a position subject to the civil service retirement law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">(2) A former employee (whose annuity has not been finally adjudicated) <em>who retains civil service retirement annuity rights </em>based on a separation from a position in which retirement deductions were properly withheld and remain (or have been redeposited in whole or in part) in the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.112(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Wade is not \u201ccurrently employed\u201d in the federal service, but he argues that the inclusion of \u201cformer employee[s]\u201d in this definition \u201csupports redeposit by separated employees who have covered service.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 5. However, the text of this regulation does not support his interpretation. We have previously interpreted 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.112(a) to \u201callow[] a \u2018former employee\u2019 to make a deposit only if that former employee is already covered by the CSRS.\u201d <em>Dela Rosa v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>583 F.3d 762, 765 (Fed.Cir.2009). Thus, the Board did not err in concluding that Wade is not an \u201cemployee\u201d within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(d) and 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.112(a), and that Wade is currently ineligible to redeposit his retirement deductions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">Wade\u2019s second argument, which was raised for the first time before the full Board, is that he did not receive proper notice of the loss of future annuity rights when he requested a lump-sum payment of his retirement benefits in 1988. In particular, he argues that \u201cOPM form 1425 was defective\u201d because the statement about forfeiture appeared on the back of the form, rather than \u201cin or above the signature block.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Br. 6, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">This argument is without merit. Only in unusual circumstances will lack of notice void an election. <em>See Collins v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>45 F.3d 1569, 1573 (Fed.Cir.1995). The front of OPM Form 1425 clearly states, \u201cSee the back of this form for important information concerning your application for refund of retirement deductions and for a Privacy Act statement,\u201d as well as <em>\u201cSEE BACK FOR MORE INFORMATION.\u201d </em>The back of the form contains a bolded \u201cNotice to Applicant,\u201d and the first note reads: \u201cIf you have more than 5 years of service, you may be entitled to annuity rights which will be forfeited by payment of this refund unless you are later reemployed subject to the Civil Service Retirement System law.\u201d As in <em>Whit-by v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>417 Fed.Appx. 967, 971 (Fed.Cir.2011), the form explicitly provided the relevant information, and was sufficiently clear to apprise Wade of the consequences of his refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-9\">. Wade also argues that he is entitled to make a redeposit based on the text of OPM Standard Form 2803, which states that \u201c[djeposits and redeposits can be made by ... separated employees who are entitled (or would be entitled after paying for service) to an annuity.... \u201d We agree that this language is confusing, and OPM would be well advised to revise this form to more accurately track the statute, but we see no reason to alter the result based on this. There is no evidence that Wade relied on this form when making his initial decision to secure a lump-sum refund.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
