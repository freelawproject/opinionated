R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. R. 34(j). The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. R. 36(d). For the following reasons, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b36-19\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-20\">Plaintiff Lymar Curry, a mortgage-loan borrower, brought suit in District of Columbia Superior Court against his lender, Bank of America, N.A., and the loan servicer, BAC Home Loans Servicing L.P. After the defendants removed the case to federal court, the United States District Court dismissed his suit pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>Curry v. Bank of America Home Loans Servicing, </em>802 F.Supp.2d 105 (D.D.C.2011). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-21\">Curry\u2019s complaint alleges that the defendants are liable to him under D.C. law for negligently handling his mortgage account in various ways. In particular, he alleges that the defendants were negligent in: (1) processing his loan-modification application; (2) failing to disclose the terms of the forbearances he sought and received from the bank; and (3) overcharging his mortgage account. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-30. He explicitly disclaims any contract-based theory, Appellant\u2019s Br. 2, 13, and instead asserts only that the defendants are liable in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-22\">The district court correctly dismissed all of these claims because, under D.C. law, there can be no tort liability for negligence unless the plaintiff shows \u201ca duty of care owed by the defendant to him.\u201d <em>Griffin v. Acacia Life Ins. Co., </em>925 A.2d 564, 575 (D.C.2007); <em>see Choharis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>961 A.2d 1080, 1087-88 (D.C.2008). To carry his burden to show such a duty, Curry\u2019s only argument is that \u201cevery legal entity owes to every other legal entity the legal duty to use reasonable care in their dealings with each other.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 5. But this argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>would render the duty requirement meaningless, and it flies in the face of the numerous cases in which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals has reiterated that \u201cduty\u201d is an independent requirement in negligence actions. <em>See, e.g., Choharis, </em>961 A.2d at 1088; <em>Griffin, </em>925 A.2d at 575. Curry\u2019s second claim \u2014 that the defendants negligently failed to disclose the terms of the forbearances \u2014 is essentially one for negligent misrepresentation, and it fails for the additional reason that such claims require detrimental reliance, which Curry nowhere alleges. <em>See Kumar v. D.C. Water &amp; Sewer Auth., </em>25 A.3d 9, 15 &amp; n. 9 (D.C.2011). Curry\u2019s third claim, that the defendants overcharged his account, relates solely to the calculation of how much he owed under the mortgage-loan contract. Under D.C. law, such claims may be raised only in a contract-based action, not in tort. <em>See Choharis, </em>961 A.2d at 1089 &amp; n. 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">The Clerk is directed to withhold the issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after the disposition of any timely petition for rehearing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41(a)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
