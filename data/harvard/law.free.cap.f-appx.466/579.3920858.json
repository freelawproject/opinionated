We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for an abuse of discretion a dismissal for failure to prosecute, <em>Ash v. Cvetkov, </em>739 F.2d 493, 495 (9th Cir.1984), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-13\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing the action without prejudice after it warned Shehee that failure to file a fourth amended complaint could result in dismissal, and granted two extensions of time to comply with its order. <em>See id. </em>at 496 (discussing factors to consider in determining whether a district court abuses its discretion by dismissing an action for failure to prosecute).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Shehee\u2019s remaining contentions, including those concerning the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his third amended complaint with leave to amend and denying his request for appointment of counsel, are unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b604-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
