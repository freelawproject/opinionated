In his notice of appeal filed on August 4, 2011, Rajani seeks to appeal five district court orders: the two orders entered on July 5, 2011, and the orders entered on July 11, 2011, July 14, 2011, and July 29, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-24\">This court may exercise jurisdiction only over final orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (2006), and certain interlocutory and collateral orders, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292 (2006); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b); <em>Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-46, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). None of the orders from which Rajani appeals are final orders nor appealable interlocutory or collateral orders. Thus, we grant Travelers\u2019 motion to dismiss in part Rajani\u2019s appeal of the first four district court orders as interlocutory. This leaves the July 29, 2011 order in which the district court granted Travelers\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. The July 29 order is also interlocutory. Thus, we dismiss the remainder of the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, We deny the parties\u2019 remaining pending motions as moot and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
