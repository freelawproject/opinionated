The district court granted summary judgment to the agency on Burgess\u2019s claims alleging discrimination and retaliation based on her termination and the denial of a transfer to another position within the agency. Viewing the record evidence in the light most favorable to Burgess, we conclude that granting summary judgment to the agency was inappropriate. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We recite the facts, with reasonable inferences drawn, in favor of Burgess, the nonmovant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">Congress created the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (\u201cSIGIR\u201d) to oversee all U.S.\u2014 funded reconstruction programs and projects in Iraq. Its chief mission is to provide audit and oversight of the use, and potential misuse, of the Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Fund, and all expenditures associated with reconstruction activities in Iraq. SIGIR is also mandated to provide Congress quarterly and semi-annual reports and maintains a separate Congressional Affairs office to fulfill these responsibilities. Additionally, SIGIR maintains an office of Public Affairs responsible for the organization\u2019s external communication. Once a stand-alone office, Public Affairs is now part of the agency\u2019s Congressional Affairs office.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Since SIGIR\u2019s inception, Stuart Bowen, Jr., has served as the head of the agency. In January 2007, Bowen recruited Burgess to join SIGIR as the Assistant Inspector General for Public Affairs (\u201cAIG-PA\u201d) through March 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this role, Burgess served as \u201cthe principal staff advisor and expert in the conduct of liaison with national and international news media, other collective and individual stakeholders, and public audiences for [SIGIR],\u201d J.A. 428. In response to Burgess\u2019s request for an administrative assistant, SIGIR hired Patricia Redmon, also an African American female, as a contract employee. Although the functions of the Public Affairs office ostensibly called for four full-time employees, Burgess and Redmon were the office\u2019s only employees during Burgess\u2019s tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Following a brief detail to the U.S. State Department, Ginger Cruz returned to SI-GIR in February 2007 as a \u201cSenior Advis- or.\u201d In June 2007, Cruz was restored to her former post as Deputy Inspector General for Policy, where she directly supervised Burgess. According to Burgess, Cruz took an immediate dislike to her and began usurping Burgess\u2019s authority and duties and making discriminatory and harassing remarks. In one such incident, Cruz \u201cout of the blue\u201d told Burgess that \u201cpeople who file discrimination complaints are weak links in the chain ... looking to excuse their own personal failing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>1850. Burgess interpreted this comment as racial bias directed against her specifically. Burgess eventually raised the issue of Cruz\u2019s general hostility toward her with SIGIR\u2019s Chief of Staff Nick Arnston, alleging that Cruz was targeting her because of her race.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>On July 19, 2007, Cruz notified Burgess that Redmon was to be terminated in two weeks\u2019 time. Burgess responded that she believed that she and Redmon were being targeted, and that the Public Affairs section \u2014 then consisting solely of two African American women \u2014 was being singled out for elimination. Burgess also expressed that it would be difficult for her to manage the section\u2019s workload without an assistant. Cruz did not respond directly to Burgess\u2019s claim that she and Redmon were being targeted, but did assure Burgess that she would have adequate administrative support going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On July 23, Burgess sent an email to Cruz in which she questioned the \u201cfairness and equality\u201d of the decision to terminate Redmon. <em>Id. </em>305. She asked to meet with Cruz to discuss the matter. Cruz in turn contacted Arnston and requested that he arrange a meeting between Cruz and Patrick Bowers, SIGIR\u2019s deputy general counsel. The purpose of that meeting was to discuss, among other topics, \u201cEEO [Equal Employment Opportunity]\u201d matters. <em>Id. </em>1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Later that day, Cruz notified Burgess in a meeting also attended by Bowers that Burgess\u2019s AIG-PA position was being eliminated because of budget constraints. When Burgess pressed for a more detailed explanation, Cruz responded that the position was being eliminated as part of a budget-driven reorganization and that SI-GIR required the \u201cright mix of people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>159. Cruz resisted Burgess\u2019s further inquiries, and informed Burgess that she was to remain on paid administrative leave until September 1, 2007, although she was not to return to work after July 27. Arnston later wrote to Burgess and explained that she was being terminated \u201c[d]ue to the reorganization of the Office of Public Affairs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>386.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">Separately, also on July 23, Cruz asked Arnston to draft a position description for a new Director of Public Affairs (\u201cDPA\u201d) position. A former SIGIR employee, Kristine Belisle, a white woman, was selected for the new position, even though performance deficiencies were in part responsible for her initial departure from SIGIR in March 2007. Cruz later explained that Belisle was hired over Burgess because the DPA role required \u201csomeone who was able to do the heavy lifting, who was not above making the phone calls, who was not above doing ... the day-to-day scheduling, management and callbacks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>65.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">It was common practice in SIGIR to reassign employees who were terminated, whether through a \u201creorganization\u201d or otherwise, to other positions within the agency. Despite Burgess\u2019s laudable work \u2014 as evidenced by her receipt of a letter of commendation for \u201cexemplary service on the job\u201d accompanied by an $8500 cash reward on May 31, 2007, and a separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>letter from Arnston in which he congratulated Burgess on her fine performance\u2014 she was not offered another position in the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Burgess was the only African American member of SIGIR\u2019s senior management at the time, the only member of senior management to be involuntarily terminated, and the only SIGIR employee terminated as part of the agency\u2019s reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">After exhausting her administrative remedies, Burgess filed a four-count complaint in the district court alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq., </em>with respect to her termination and the denial of her transfer to the DPA position or another position within the agency. SIGIR moved for summary judgment, which the district court granted. Burgess timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We review de novo a grant or denial of summary judgment, applying the same standard applied by the district court. <em>Overstreet v. Ky. Cent. Life Ins. Co., </em>950 F.2d 931, 938 (4th Cir.1991). Summary judgment is appropriate only where the record shows there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). The summary judgment inquiry turns on \u201cwhether the evidence presents a sufficient disagreement to require submission to a jury or whether it is so one-sided that one party must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 251-52, 106 S.Ct. 2505. Only in the latter case may the court grant summary judgment, but a jury must resolve the dispute if the evidence permits either of two reasonable conclusions. <em>Id. </em>at 250-51, 106 S.Ct. 2505; <em>In re French, </em>499 F.3d 345, 352 (4th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">It is not the district court\u2019s role to \u201cweigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter\u201d but instead to determine whether there are \u201cgenuine factual issues that properly can be resolved only by a finder of fact because they may reasonably be resolved in favor of either party.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505. A district court considering a motion for summary judgment must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, <em>Unus v. Kane, </em>565 F.3d 103, 115 (4th Cir.2009), and draw all inferences in favor of the nonmovant, <em>Williams v. Griffin, </em>952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">A three-step framework applies to the resolution of discrimination and retaliation claims where, as here, there is only circumstantial evidence. <em>See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973) (discrimination); <em>Lamb v. Boeing, </em>213 Fed.Appx. 175, 179 (4th Cir.2007) (\u201cRetaliation claims function in parallel.\u201d) (citing <em>Beall v. Abbott Labs., </em>130 F.3d 614, 619 (4th Cir.1997)). First, the plaintiff has the initial burden to prove her prima facie case by a preponderance of the evidence, which she may do by \u201cproving a set of facts which would enable the fact-finder to conclude, in the absence of any further explanation, that it is more likely than not that the adverse employment action was the product of discrimination [or retaliation].\u201d <em>Ennis v. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Bus. &amp; Educ. Radio, Inc., </em>53 F.3d 55, 58 (4th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 254, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981)). If such a showing is made, the burden shifts to the defendant to come forward with evidence that \u201cif believed by the trier of fact, would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>support a finding that unlawful discrimination [or retaliation] was not the cause of the employment action.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>509 U.S. at 507, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (citing <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 254-255, 101 S.Ct. 1089). If the defendant makes such a showing, the presumption created by the plaintiffs prima facie case \u201cdrops out of the picture,\u201d and the burden shifts back to the employee to present evidence from which a reasonable juror could find that the proffered reason was a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. <em>Id. </em>at 511, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (citing <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 255, 101 S.Ct. 1089). If the plaintiff can demonstrate \u201cthat the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination [or retaliation],\u201d summary judgment is not appropriate. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">The parties dispute whether the district court applied an incorrect standard in evaluating Burgess\u2019s discrimination claims. Following the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993), many district courts required plaintiffs to provide additional evidence to demonstrate racial discrimination, once the burden shifted back to the plaintiff after an employer\u2019s proffer of a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for its action. This \u201cpretext plus\u201d standard stemmed from the Court\u2019s pronouncement that, after the employer\u2019s proffer, \u201c[t]he plaintiff then has \u2018the full and fair opportunity to demonstrate,\u2019 through presentation of his own case and through cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s witnesses, \u2018that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision,\u2019 and that race was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 507-08, 113 S.Ct. 2742 (quoting <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. 1089).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">In <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000), the Supreme Court clarified that a prima facie case of discrimination, combined with evidence from which a jury could conclude that an employer\u2019s proffered justification was false, supported an inference of discrimination sufficient to defeat summary judgment. In other words, a plaintiff is not required to provide additional evidence that race was the true reason for the employment decision. The Court further explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-8\">Proof that the defendant\u2019s explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one form of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional discrimination, and it can be quite persuasive. In appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose .... Moreover, once the employer\u2019s justification has been eliminated, discrimination may well be the most likely alternative explanation, especially since the employer is in the best position to put forth the actual reason for its decision. Thus, a plaintiffs prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find the employer\u2019s asserted justification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully discriminated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 147-48, 120 S.Ct. 2097 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\"><em>Reeves </em>did allow, however, that a prima facie case of discrimination combined with evidence of pretext might fail to sustain a jury\u2019s finding of liability, in unique situations where \u201cthe record conclusively revealed some other, nondiscriminatory reason for the employer\u2019s decision, or if the plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact as to whether the employer\u2019s reason was untrue and there was abundant and uncontroverted independent evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>120 S.Ct. 2097; <em>accord Murrell v. Ocean Mecca Motel, Inc., </em>262 F.3d 253, 258-59 (4th Cir.2001) (\u201c[O]nce a plaintiff has established a prima facie case and shown the defendant\u2019s explanation to be false, the plaintiff need not submit additional evidence of discrimination unless 'no rational factfinder could conclude that the action was discriminatory.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Applying the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, the district court found with respect to all four claims that Burgess either failed to establish a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation, or failed to demonstrate pretext after SIGIR provided legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons. The district court thus granted summary judgment to SIGIR on all four of Burgess\u2019s claims. Burgess contests the district court\u2019s ruling on each claim, asserting that the district court (1) held her discrimination claims to the \u201cpretext-plus\u201d standard the Supreme Court rejected in <em>Reeves </em>and (2) erred in concluding that there was no evidence to support a causal connection between Burgess\u2019s protected activity and the agency\u2019s decision to both terminate Burgess and deny her a transfer. We address each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Burgess first contends that she suffered racial discrimination when her AIG-PA position was terminated and when a less qualified white woman was selected for the DPA position created in its place. To establish a prima facie case of discriminatory termination, a plaintiff must show that (1) she is a member of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for her job and her job performance was satisfactory; (3) in spite of her qualifications and her performance, she was fired; and (4) she was replaced by someone outside her protected class, or otherwise treated differently than similarly situated persons outside the class. <em>See McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. The district court characterized the last prong as whether \u201cthe position remained open to similarly qualified applicants after her dismissal.\u201d <em>Burgess v. Bowen, </em>No. 09-763, 2010 WL 3064307, at *8 (E.D.Va. Aug. 2, 2010) (quoting <em>Williams v. Cerberonics, </em>871 F.2d 452, 455-56 (4th Cir.1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">The district court held that Burgess had not established her prima facie case. Specifically, the court concluded that Burgess was not replaced by someone outside her protected class because the AIG-PA position had been eliminated and thereby did not remain open to similarly qualified applicants following Burgess\u2019s dismissal. Further, the district court concluded that the new DPA position was not, contrary to Burgess\u2019s assertion, the functional equivalent of the AIG-PA position. As evidence of this, the district court relied on certain differences in the written descriptions of the positions and the responsibilities thereunder. The district court further accepted SIGIR\u2019s contention that the new position was ministerial in nature involving no management or supervision of employees, in contrast to the autonomous managerial and policy functions of the AIG-PA position.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">Neither party has articulated a standard by which to properly assess whether a position remains open in the face of some changes in the written job description. Both parties do, however, draw our attention to <em>Murray v. Gilmore, </em>406 F.3d 708, 714 (D.C.Cir.2005), in which the D.C. Circuit concluded that the plaintiff offered \u201cplentiful evidence from which a jury could conclude that rather than functionally eliminating the [plaintiffs position], [the defendant] simply gave the position a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>new title and tapped [someone else] to hold it.\u201d That case offers us little guidance, however, because the defendant there acknowledged that the two positions had \u201ccomparable, dual, functionally equivalent, overlapping responsibilities,\u201d and admitted that \u201ca reasonable jury could conclude that [the defendant\u2019s proffer] was pretext.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). There has been no such admission here, nor does a straightforward comparison of the written job descriptions clearly indicate whether or not the positions are functionally equivalent.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We accept the district court\u2019s premise that there may be circumstances in which the differences between two written job descriptions are so stark such that it cannot be said that \u201cthe [first] position remained open to similarly qualified applicants,\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>2010 WL 3064307, at *8. In this case, however, the district court failed to credit Burgess\u2019s evidence tending to show that the positions were intended to be functionally equivalent and that, both involved the same managerial and oversight responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Specifically, Cruz initially sought to hire Belisle under the identical title, responsibilities, and salary as enjoyed by Burgess, but shifted gears after being alerted that her proposal was inconsistent with the agency\u2019s contention that Burgess\u2019s position was eliminated because of a reorganization. Only then did the agency revise the description, responsibilities, and salary of the DPA position. Despite the changes, however, Belisle testified that, as the DPA, she in fact \u201cwas the sole person managing public affairs, in the sense that [she] was the sole person implementing the skills and activities of the position.\u201d J.A. 1260. The new DPA position also involved the supervision of a support staff member who split time with Public Affairs and another department.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Because the district court failed to view this evidence in the light most favorable to Burgess, it erred in finding that Burgess had not established her prima facie case. Indeed, the transfer of most of the AIG-PA responsibilities to the DPA position was, in our view, itself sufficient to meet Burgess\u2019s burden. <em>See Gallo v. Prudential Residential Servs., Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>22 F.3d 1219, 1225 (2d Cir.1994) (holding that the plaintiff established a prima facie case where the employer reassigned almost all of plaintiff\u2019s duties to an employee outside of the plaintiffs protected class). Although the district court found that the \u201cAIG-PA position was eliminated\u201d and \u201crejected the contention] that it was merely \u2018renamed\u2019 as the Director of Public Affairs,\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>2010 WL 3064307, at *9, a reasonable jury could conclude otherwise. <em>See Garcia v. Pueblo Country Club, </em>299 F.3d 1233, 1239-41 (10th Cir.2002) (reversing summary judgment because whether plaintiffs position was eliminated or he was replaced was a \u201ckey\u201d material factual dispute).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">The district court\u2019s analysis nevertheless assumed that Burgess had established a prima facie case, but concluded that SIGIR had provided legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for Burgess\u2019s termination: that budgetary pressures necessitated the elimination of Burgess\u2019s position, that the entire Public Affairs section was reorganized, and that other employees were terminated or had their contract positions revoked. Accordingly, the district court found that Burgess failed to establish that SIGIR\u2019s reason for her termination was pretextual. Specifically, the district court held that \u201cPlaintiff must show there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding a connection between her race and her adverse employment action\u201d and \u201cPlaintiff has not come forward with evidence that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>acts were motivated by race discrimination.\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>2010 WL 3064807, at *11.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Viewed in the light most favorable to Burgess, however, the record evidence reveals significant inconsistencies as to whether other employee or contract positions were eliminated as part of a reorganization, whether budgetary pressures in fact necessitated the elimination of Burgess\u2019s position, when the decisions were made to execute any reorganization, whether the Public Affairs section was actually reorganized to promote savings, and whether the elimination of Burgess\u2019s position actually achieved any meaningful savings. Although the district court was not persuaded by this evidence, the proper standard is whether a reasonable jury could have found SIGIR\u2019s proffered explanation incredible and, thus, could have concluded that Burgess\u2019s termination was discriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">We hold that the district court erred in concluding, as a matter of irrebuttable fact, that the AIG-PA position had been eliminated and that the position created in its place was not sufficiently similar to present that issue to the jury. Second, the court failed to view the record evidence supporting Burgess\u2019s challenges to the credibility of SIGIR\u2019s proffered explanation in the light most favorable to her, and thus failed to apprehend that such evidence standing alone was sufficient to show pretext after SIGIR proffered its nondiscriminatory explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment to SIGIR on Burgess\u2019s first claim of discriminatory termination.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Burgess also alleges that she suffered racial discrimination when she was denied a transfer to the DPA position or a \u201cSenior Advisor\u201d position to which terminated employees were routinely assigned.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To establish a prima facie case for a discriminatory denial of transfer claim, a plaintiff must show that (1) she is a member of a protected group; (2) she applied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>for the position in question;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (3) she was qualified for the position; and (4) she was rejected for the position in favor of someone not a member of the protected group under circumstances giving rise to an inference of unlawful discrimination. <em>Lowery v. Circuit City Stores, Inc., </em>158 F.3d 742, 760 (4th Cir.1998) (vacated on other grounds).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The district court found that Burgess had established a prima facie case with respect to this claim. However, the court again found that SIGIR had proffered a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for denying Burgess the transfer: that Burgess \u201cwas not the person for the job,\u201d <em>Burgess, </em>2010 WL 3064307, at *12 (internal quotations omitted), and that \u201cCruz genuinely perceived that the new ... position should be filled by a lower level, hands-on employee,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *13, who would \u201cdo the heavy lifting, who was not above making the phone calls ... the day-to-day scheduling, management and callbacks,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *12 (internal quotations omitted). The district court concluded that Burgess had failed to present evidence to establish that this proffered reason was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">SIGIR asserts that Burgess\u2019s own complaints about lacking administrative support and resources rendered her unfit for the DPA position. While Burgess admits to complaining about being understaffed during her time as the AIG-PA, this does not necessarily compel the conclusion that she was unable to accomplish the tasks required of the DPA position. On that score, Burgess points to evidence showing that she was awarded a bonus for exemplary performance and that she routinely worked late hours to execute the functions of the Public Affairs office. This evidence, Burgess contends, demonstrates that she was fully able and willing to assume any responsibilities called for by the DPA position. Burgess further contends that Belisle \u2014 who herself had been terminated at least in part for poor performance \u2014 was in no better position to do so. Finally, Burgess argues that SIGIR\u2019s vague characterization that she \u201cwas not the person for the job,\u201d <em>id. </em>at *12 (internal quotations omitted), cannot suffice as a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for denying her the transfer; in fact, she contends that the statement could just as well reveal racial animus. We agree with Burgess that it should be up to a jury whether to credit SIGIR\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">Although we agree with the district court that \u201cthere must be a sufficient record of proof for a reasonable jury to agree [that race was the basis for denying Burgess a transfer],\u201d <em>id. </em>at *13 (citing <em>Ross v. Commc\u2019ns Satellite Corp., </em>759 F.2d 355, 364 (4th Cir.1985)), we find Burgess satisfies this standard. Burgess\u2019s evidence as to this claim reveals inconsistencies undermining the credibility of SIGIR\u2019s proffered explanation as to why it declined to offer Burgess a transfer to the DPA position. Under <em>Reeves, </em>Burgess was required to do no more to survive a motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s decision as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">Burgess also alleges that she suffered unlawful retaliation, once when she was terminated and again when she was denied a transfer. To establish a prima <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>facie case for retaliation, a plaintiff is required to prove the following: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action was taken against her; and (3) there was a causal connection between the first two elements. <em>Dowe v. Total Action Against Poverty in Roanoke Valley, </em>145 F.3d 653, 656 (4th Cir.1998). If she does so, the burden shifts to the defendant to proffer a legitimate, nonretaliatory reason for its decision, which she must then rebut. <em>Id. </em>The district court assumed that Burgess engaged in protected activity, but found that her claims failed the third prong because the decisions to terminate Burgess\u2019s position and to hire Belisle were made as part of SIGIR\u2019s reorganization plan prior to Burgess engaging in any protected activity-</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The parties first contest whether Burgess in fact engaged in protected activity. Burgess contends that she engaged in two protected acts, the first when she verbally complained to Cruz that she and Redmon were being \u201ctargeted,\u201d and the second when she questioned the \u201cfairness and equality\u201d of Redmon\u2019s termination in a subsequent email to Cruz. As to the first point, Burgess explains that her \u201cintent of using the word targeted was to alert [Cruz] in very concrete terms that there was concern on [Burgess\u2019s] part that this was racial.\u201d J.A. 1371. As to the second point, Burgess asserts that her email borrowed verbatim from language that appeared on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission website and was also contained in SIGIR\u2019s EEO policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Our cases hold that an employee\u2019s complaint constitutes protected activity when the employer understood, or should have understood, that the plaintiff was opposing discriminatory conduct. <em>Richardson v. Richland Cnty. School Dist. No. 1, 52 </em>Fed.Appx. 615, 617 (4th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Galdieri-Ambrosini v. Nat\u2019l Realty &amp; Dev. Corp., </em>136 F.3d 276, 291-92 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201c[I]mplicit in the requirement that the employer have been aware of the protected activity is the requirement that it understood, or could reasonably have understood, that the plaintiffs opposition was directed at conduct prohibited by Title VII.\u201d)); <em>Sajadian v. Am. Red Cross, </em>No. 99-1263, 1999 WL 1111455, at *1 (4th Cir. Dec.7, 1999) (same); <em>see also </em>EEOC Compliance Manual \u00a7 8-II.B.2 (2006) (\u201c[A] protest is protected opposition if the complaint would reasonably have been interpreted as opposition to employment discrimination.\u201d). Determining whether an employer should have understood a complaint to constitute protected activity requires courts to consider whether the complaint could reasonably have led the employer to understand the nature of the complaint in the context in which it was made. <em>Richardson, 52 </em>Fed.Appx. at 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">We find that SIGIR actually understood or should have understood that Burgess was complaining of discriminatory conduct. <em>See Okoli v. City of Baltimore, </em>648 F.3d 216, 224 (4th Cir.2011) (finding that it was \u201cenough for [the plaintiff] to twice complain of \u2018harassment,\u2019 even if it might have been more ideal for her to detail the sexual incidents she later relayed\u201d and that the employer \u201csurely should have known that [the plaintiffs] complaints of \u2018harassment\u2019 likely encompassed sexual harassment\u201d). Indeed, the response to Burgess\u2019s email underscores our conclusion, because Cruz almost immediately asked to consult with SIGIR\u2019s counsel after receiving Burgess\u2019s complaint, and the ensuing discussions included \u201cEEO\u201d issues. The evidence also shows that Cruz, whose former role as SIGIR\u2019s Chief of Staff made her well familiar with personnel matters, forwarded Burgess\u2019s complaint to Arnston, SIGIR\u2019s then chief of staff, who had already discussed with Burgess her concerns about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>race discrimination. Three attorneys, including one experienced in employment law, also received Burgess\u2019s complaint. On these facts, we have no trouble concluding that SIGIR either understood, or at the very least should have understood, that Burgess was complaining of discriminatory conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Turning now to the merits of the retaliation claims, we acknowledge that some of the evidence before the district court supports SIGIR\u2019s position that the decision to terminate Burgess, as well as the decision to hire Belisle for the DPA position, occurred prior to Burgess\u2019s engaging in protected activity. However, in <em>Okoli </em>we found it \u201cdeeply suspicious\u201d that an employee was fired only hours after she complained to her superiors. <em>Id. </em>at 223. Further, we found it \u201cundisputed\u201d that the employee\u2019s supervisor fired the employee \u201conly after learning of her complaint\u201d and that \u201c[e]ven assuming [the supervisor] previously contemplated firing her \u2014 [the employee\u2019s] complaint might have been an additional or superseding cause of her ultimate termination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 224. We therefore concluded that \u201c[a]ny dispute about [the employer\u2019s] alternative, legitimate basis for firing her returns to the question of mixed-motives and pretext.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">In this case, a jury could reasonably find that the decision to terminate Burgess and to hire Belisle occurred only after Burgess challenged the fairness and equality of the decision to terminate Redmon. Specifically, Burgess presented evidence that, only after Cruz received Burgess\u2019s email, did Cruz (1) telephone Belisle to offer her a contract position handling the public affairs duties (before the DPA position was finalized), (2) instruct Arnston to draft a description for the new DPA position, and (3) schedule a meeting to inform Burgess of her termination. Finally, and most probative on Burgess\u2019s retaliatory denial of transfer claim, is Cruz\u2019s own admission that she would have considered offering Burgess another position had the conversation during Burgess\u2019s termination meeting gone differently.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">We have held that \u201c[v]ery little evidence of a causal connection is required to establish a prima facie case [of retaliation],\u201d <em>Tinsley v. First Union Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>155 F.3d 435, 443 (4th Cir.1998) (overruled on other grounds); temporal proximity between the protected activity and the employer\u2019s adverse action alone will suffice, <em>see Clark Cnty. Sch. Disk v. Breeden, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001); <em>accord Price v. Thompson, </em>380 F.3d 209, 213 (4th Cir.2004). We agree with Burgess that she has established a prima facie case of retaliation. In concluding otherwise, the district court again failed to view the evidence in the light most favorable to Burgess.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">Burgess\u2019s claims may nevertheless fail if she cannot overcome SIGIR\u2019s proffer of a legitimate, nonretaliatory explanation. The district court dispensed with this analysis having found no prima facie case. We find here that the question of whether the agency proffered a nonretaliatory reason for terminating Burgess and denying her the transfer merges with our prior discussion concerning the agency\u2019s proffered reason in the context of Burgess\u2019s discrimination claims. Although we agree with the district court that the agency has proffered a legitimate nonretaliatory reason, Burgess\u2019s prima facie evidence combined with the additional evidence tending to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>undermine the credibility of that reason suffices to defeat the agency\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">In sum, the record in this case reveals an abundance of genuine factual disputes on material issues. While we have viewed and recounted the facts in the light most favorable to Burgess, we acknowledge that SIGIR\u2019s contentions also find support in the record. Be that as it may, the evidence in this case was not \u201cso one-sided\u201d as to warrant granting SIGIR\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Burgess\u2019s claims. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\">.

The parties also dispute the district court\u2019s finding of a \"same actor\" inference, which permits courts to reject discriminatory termination claims when the same actor both hired and fired the plaintiff. As we have held, \u201c[wjhen the hirer and firer are the same individual, there is a powerful inference relating to the \u2018ultimate question\u2019 that discrimination did not motivate the employer, and the early resolution of this question need not be derailed by strict fealty to proof schemes.\" <em>Proud v. Stone, </em>945 F.2d 796, 798 (4th Cir.1991). The district court found that the same actor inference applied, because Burgess was both hired and fired by Bowen. Burgess contends that she was hired by Bowen and fired by Cruz, the latter decision occurring under circumstances showing that Bowen merely rubber-stamped Burgess\u2019s termination after delegating personnel decisions to Cruz. Viewed in the light most favorable to Burgess, the evidence presents a genuine issue of fact as to who made the decision to terminate Burgess, and thus whether the same actor inference should apply. <em>See, e.g., Schmidt v. Montgomery Kone, Inc., </em>69 F.Supp.2d 706, 711 (E.D.Pa.1999) (distinguishing <em>Proud </em>and holding that reliance on the \"same actor\" inference at the summary judgment stage is misplaced where there exists a factual dispute regarding who hired and fired the plaintiff). Indeed, Cruz herself testified that she made the decision to terminate Burgess, and Bowen agreed thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b304-13\">. Burgess contends that it was SIGIR\u2019s common practice to assign underperforming employees, or those whose positions had been eliminated, to \"Senior Advisor\u201d positions. She argues that the fact that she was not offered such a position demonstrates further that she suffered discrimination. SIGIR disputes this claim, arguing that no such policy existed. Because we find for Burgess on her contention that she was denied a transfer to the DPA position, we do not address this separate argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b305-7\">. As the district court acknowledged, Burgess cannot show that she applied for or requested a transfer within the agency. Burgess did, however, file a declaration stating that she \"would have chosen to stay on at SIGIR in the Director of Public Affairs position or any other position in lieu of termination,\u201d <em>id. </em>2118 (internal quotations omitted), which the agency did not rebut.

Even if the decision to terminate Burgess had already been made, denying Burgess a transfer itself constitutes an adverse action and entitles her to present her retaliation claim to the jury. <em>See Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v.
