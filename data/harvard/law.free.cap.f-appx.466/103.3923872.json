The Government moves to dismiss Lewis\u2019s petition, arguing that we lack jurisdiction over it. For the following reasons, the Government\u2019s motion is granted, and we will dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Lewis, a native and citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, entered the United States in 1984. Administrative Record (A.R.) 193. He was served with a Notice to Appear on January 27, 2010, charging him with removability pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (aggravated felony conviction) and (B)(i) (controlled substances conviction). A.R. 300-02. These charges, in turn, were premised on two convictions: the first, from June 1994, was the result of a guilty plea to state-law charges of robbery (N.J.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 2C:15-1), for which he was sentenced to nine years of incarceration; the second, from June 2004, was the result of a guilty plea to a state charge of heroin possession (NJ.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 2C:35-10(a)(1)), for which he received a 364-day sentence and a term of probation. <em>See </em>A.R. 194-201, 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">In response to the commencement of immigration proceedings, Lewis filed an I-589 application for asylum and derivative relief on March 17, 2010, premised on the treatment of homosexuality in Trinidad and Tobago. A.R. 216-227. He also began to pursue post conviction relief (PCR) in New Jersey, attacking his convictions as constitutionally deficient due to ineffective assistance of counsel and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Padilla v. Kentucky,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 1473, 176 L.Ed.2d 284 (2010). <em>See </em>A.R. 268.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-12\">Ultimately, the presiding Immigration Judge (IJ) denied relief, finding most of Lewis\u2019s requests to be statutorily unavailable to him due to his status as an aggravated felon. She determined that asylum and withholding were not available because Lewis had been convicted of a \u201cparticularly serious crime.\u201d A.R. 108-09; <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(b) (2) (A) (ii), 1158(b)(2)(B)(i), 1231(b)(3)(B)(ii). The same bar prohibited consideration of withholding of removal under the CAT, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(d)(2), and the IJ separately found Lewis to not be entitled to deferral of removal under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.17 because he failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that he would more likely than not be tortured if removed to Trinidad and Tobago. A.R. 109-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">Lewis appealed to the BIA, which upheld the IJ\u2019s determination and denied relief. The BIA agreed that Lewis was an aggravated felon, that his offense was \u201cparticularly serious\u201d (thus barring him from most relief), and that he had not shown a likelihood of torture in Trinidad and Tobago. A.R. 62-63. In addition, the late filing of Lewis\u2019s 1-589 \u201cwould also present a statutory bar to [his] asylum claim.\u201d A.R. 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-15\">This petition for review followed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Lewis moved to stay removal. The Government filed a response and a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. We denied the stay motion on October 6, 2011, but declined to rule on the motion to dismiss pending briefing. The case is now ripe for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">This Court has the power of judicial review over final orders of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Our jurisdiction, however, is subject to several important statutory limitations. Subsection (2) lists \u201c[mjatters not subject to judicial review,\u201d a category that includes \u201c[ojrders against criminal aliens.\u201d Pursuant to that subsection, we lack jurisdiction over BIA decisions \u201cordering removal based on the commission of an aggravated felony or a controlled substance offense.\u201d <em>Leslie v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>611 F.3d 171, 174 (3d Cir.2010); <em>Pierre v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>528 F.3d 180, 184 (3d Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). Even in those cases, we do still retain jurisdiction over \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law,\u201d \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), but as we have emphasized, \u201c[t]he jurisdictional grant of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) is narrowly circumscribed,\u201d applying to \u201cpurely legal questions\u201d and \u201ccolorable violation[s] of the United States Constitution.\u201d <em>Jarbough v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>483 F.3d 184, 188-89 (3d Cir.2007). \u201cTo determine whether a claim is colorable, we ask whether \u2018it is immaterial and made solely for the purpose of obtaining jurisdiction or is wholly insubstantial and frivolous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pareja v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>615 F.3d 180, 186 (3d Cir.2010) (citing <em>Arbaugh v. Y &amp; H Corp., </em>546 U.S. 500, 513 n. 10, 126 S.Ct. 1235, 163 L.Ed.2d 1097 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In his opening brief, Lewis accuses the BIA of \u201csid[ing] with [the IJ] without properly reviewing evidence and testimonies presented\u201d in support of withholding of removal and CAT relief. Inf. Br. 1. While evocative of language implicating due process, it is clear that Lewis intends to argue that the BIA \u201cincorrectly weighed evidence, failed to consider evidence[,] or improperly weighed equitable factors,\u201d which are neither questions of law nor constitutional errors falling within the purview of \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). <em>Jarbough, </em>483 F.3d at 189. Lewis cites cases in which Circuit Courts found agency errors made in petitions for review with homosexual claimants, <em>e.g., Bromfield v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 1071 (9th Cir.2008), but none of those cases addressed an order of removal made in connection with aggravated-felony status.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">Lewis also argues that the agency should have exercised its prosecutorial discretion in his case and declined to pursue an order of removal. But \u201cno court [has] jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). We therefore do not have jurisdiction to hear Lewis\u2019s challenge to the exercise of prosecutorial discretion. <em>See Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm., </em>525 U.S. 471, 485 n. 9, 119 S.Ct. 936, 142 L.Ed.2d 940 (1999); <em>Chehazeh v. Att\u2019y Gen, </em>666 F.3d 118, 134 (3d Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">As Lewis proceeds pro se, we are obliged to read his opening brief liberally. <em>Higgs v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>655 F.3d 333, 339 (3d Cir.2011). At the same time, issues not briefed on appeal\u2014even by parties proceeding pro se\u2014are deemed waived or abandoned. <em>Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008). Having carefully scrutinized Lewis\u2019s brief, we detect no arguments that would allow us to exercise jurisdiction over his petition via \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we will grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss. Lewis\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>motion to supplement the record is denied as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\">. Lewis\u2019s PCR application was pending throughout the entirety of the removal proceedings. He has not informed us of its ultimate resolution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b128-16\">. While the petition attached, and was timely filed from, a BIA order denying a change in custody status, <em>see </em>A.R. 2, Lewis has not attacked that order in any of his submissions before this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
