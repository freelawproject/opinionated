We have jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Because this appeal does not present a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-23\">Green is a prisoner currently incarcerated in the United States Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. In July 2006, he pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota to one count of conspiring to distribute and possessing with intent to distribute more than 100 grams of heroin, and on November 20, 2007, he was sentenced to 124 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>D. Minn. Cr. A. No. 06-0050. Green was apparently sentenced as a career offender, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a), a classification that was based, in part, on Green\u2019s prior Minnesota state conviction for fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle. Green did not file a direct appeal challenging his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>In February 2008, Green filed a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, raising several ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. The District Court denied the motion in January 2009, and the Eighth Circuit denied Green\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability in May 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">In November 2009, Green filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. Green argued that, because the Eighth Circuit had recently held that \u201cMinnesota\u2019s crime of fleeing a peace officer in a motor vehicle does not constitute a \u2018crime of violence\u2019 under the Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d <em>United States v. Tyler, </em>580 F.3d 722, 726 (8th Cir.2009),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> he was \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the career-offender designation. The District Court dismissed Green\u2019s petition, holding that the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 was not inadequate or ineffective, and as a consequence, Green could not proceed under \u00a7 2241. Green appealed to the Seventh Circuit, which ultimately dismissed the appeal due to Green\u2019s failure to pay the docketing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">In December 2011, Green filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He again claimed that, based on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Tyler, </em>he was \u201cactually innocent of the career offender enhancement.\u201d The District Court dismissed the petition, holding that it was not required to entertain a claim that had already been rejected by another district court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a), and that Green had not obtained this Court\u2019s permission to file a successive habeas petition, \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). Green then filed a timely notice of appeal to this Court; he has also asked the Court to appoint counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s disposition of this case. Apart from whether Green\u2019s petition was barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a), it is apparent that his claim is not viable under \u00a7 2241. We will therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s decision on this basis. <em>See Brightwell v. Lehman, </em>637 F.3d 187, 191 (3d Cir.2011) (noting that a federal appellate court may affirm on any ground supported by the record). \u201cMotions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences!)]\u201d <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). However, a federal prisoner can seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 if the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d to test the legality of his or her detention. <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. This occurs \u201conly where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation <em>of </em>scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his ... claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538. This exception is extremely narrow and applies in only rare circumstances. <em>See, e.g., In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251-52 (3d Cir.1997) (applying exception where an intervening change in the law decriminalized the conduct underlying the petitioner\u2019s conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">Green asserts that he is innocent of being a career offender, and that, therefore, his claim is properly brought under \u00a7 2241. He is mistaken. <em>Dorsainvil </em>allows relief under \u00a7 2241 only when a subsequent statutory interpretation renders a petitioner\u2019s conduct no longer criminal. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52. Green makes no allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>that he is actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted; he asserts only that his sentence was improper. The <em>Dorsainvil </em>exception is therefore inapplicable, and relief under \u00a7 2241 is not available. <em>See Okereke, </em>307 F.3d at 120-21 (holding that a petitioner could not proceed under \u00a7 2241 because his argument was based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466,120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which \u201cdealt with sentencing and did not render conspiracy to import heroin, the crime for which Okereke was convicted, not criminal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">For these reasons, we conclude that this appeal presents \u201cno substantial question,\u201d and will therefore summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. <em>See </em>3d Cir. L.A.R. 27.4; I.O.P. 10.6. We also deny Green\u2019s motions for appointment of counsel. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A(a)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">. In <em>Sykes v. United States</em>,\u2014U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 2270, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), the Supreme Court held that the Indiana state offense of fleeing from a law-enforcement officer qualifies as a violent felony. For purposes of this appeal, we need not decide whether <em>Sykes </em>abrogated <em>Tyler.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
