Rollin appeals all the district court\u2019s orders. We review a dismissal based on the statute of limitations <em>de novo. See Ventura Mobile-home Communities Owners Ass\u2019n v. City of San Buenaventura, </em>371 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2004). We review a grant of summary judgment based on qualified immunity <em>de novo. See Stoot v. City of Everett, </em>582 F.3d 910, 918 (9th Cir.2009). We review the denial of costs for a defendant\u2019s failure to waive service for abuse of discretion. <em>See Estate of Darulis v. Garate, </em>401 F.3d 1060, 1063 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-17\">1. Dismissal Orders</p>\n<p id=\"b690-18\">The statute of limitations is two years for claims accruing after January 1, 2003, and one year for claims accruing prior to that date. <em>See </em>Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 335.1; <em>see also Maldonado v. Harris, </em>370 F.3d 945, 954-55 (9th Cir.2004), <em>Wilson v. Garcia, </em>471 U.S. 261, 275, 105 S.Ct. 1938, 85 L.Ed.2d 254 (1985) (requiring application of single statute of limitations for all \u00a7 1983 claims).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-19\">We agree with the district court on the accrual date of Counts II-V. The claims related to Rollin\u2019s false arrest (Counts II and IV) accrued on May 19, 2003, the date Rollin was arraigned and bound over for trial. <em>See Wallace v. Kato, </em>549 U.S. 384, 391-92, 127 S.Ct. 1091, 166 L.Ed.2d 973 (2007). Cal.Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 352.1 tolled the statute of limitations for a maximum of two years, i.e., until May 19, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>2005. The statute ran until the appellate court reversed Rollin\u2019s judgment on December 13, 2006, almost one year and seven months later. After a jury acquitted Rollin on January 15, 2008, he did not file his complaint until almost one year and seven months later, on August 5, 2009. Count III, the count alleging illegal search and seizure, accrued on the search date, March 21, 2002, so the one-year statute of limitation applies. <em>See Venegas v. Wagner, </em>704 F.2d 1144, 1146 (9th Cir.1983). Counts II, III, and IV are thus untimely. Rollin\u2019s contention that \u00a7 352.1 tolled the limitations period while he was incarcerated after entry of judgment contradicts the text of the statute and well-settled precedents of California law. <em>See </em>Cal.Code. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 352.1 (requiring person to be incarcerated \u201cat the time the cause of action accrued\u201d for tolling to apply); <em>Cal. Savings &amp; Loan Soc. v. Culver, </em>127 Cal. 107, 110-11, 59 P. 292 (1899).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Count V relating to the seizure of Rollin\u2019s property on March 25, 2002 is also untimely. Rollin knew or should have known of the seizure by the preliminary hearing on November 23, 2003, at the latest. <em>See Maldonado, </em>370 F.3d at 955. After accounting for tolling, we agree with the district court\u2019s calculation and so affirm dismissal of Count V as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">2. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">With respect to Count I, we agree with the district court that Cook\u2019s conduct \u201c[did] not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Pearson v. Callahan, </em>555 U.S. 223, 231, 129 S.Ct. 808, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (quoting <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982)). We conclude that at the time of Cook\u2019s alleged violation of Rollin\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights in April 2003, it would not have been clear to a reasonable police officer that Cook\u2019s conduct was unlawful. <em>See Shedelbower v. Estelle, </em>885 F.2d 570, 574 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 1092, 111 S.Ct. 975, 112 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1991); <em>Missouri v. Seibert, </em>542 U.S. 600, 124 S.Ct. 2601, 159 L.Ed.2d 643 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">3. Attorney\u2019s Fees</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Rule 4 requires a defendant to pay reasonable attorney\u2019s fees if the defendant refuses to sign and return a waiver of service requested by plaintiff without good cause and the plaintiff files a motion to collect any service-related expenses. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(2). The district court erred in holding that the Hendersons\u2019 payment of service expenses after Rollin\u2019s filing of the motion rendered the motion moot, and that Rollin\u2019s attorney could have taken \u201cadditional steps\u201d to avoid having to effect formal service of process.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">Once a plaintiff has sent a valid request for a waiver of service of process, the burden shifts to the defendant to avoid imposing unnecessary costs on the plaintiff. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(1). Absent a showing of good cause, a defendant who fails to execute a valid waiver \u201cmust\u201d pay the costs of formal service and any costs, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, of any motion \u201crequired\u201d to collect service expenses. Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(d)(2). Because the Hendersons failed to waive service and also failed to pay the service expenses until after Rollin had filed a motion to collect them, they also must, absent a showing of good cause, pay Rollin\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees associated with these failures. The district court made no finding of good cause, which, in any case, should be \u201crare.\u201d <em>See Estate of Darulis, </em>401 F.3d at 1064. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Rollin attorney\u2019s fees and remand for additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">For the foregoing reasons, dismissal and summary judgment are AFFIRMED, but the order denying attorney\u2019s fees is VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b690-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
