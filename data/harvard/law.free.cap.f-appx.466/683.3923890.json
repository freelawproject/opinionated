We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s factual findings, <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-22\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding based on the inconsistencies between Parichkov\u2019s medical documentation and his testimony about the attacks and injuries he suffered from skinheads. <em>See id. </em>at 1043. Further, because the IJ had reason to question Parichkov\u2019s credibility, his failure to provide corroborating evidence undermines his claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1044-45. In light of our conclusion regarding the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding, we do not reach Parichkov\u2019s pattern or practice contention. In the absence of credible evidence, Parichkov\u2019s asylum and withholding of remov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>al claims fail. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Because Parichkov\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence that the agency found not credible, and he points to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not he would be tortured if returned to Bulgaria, his CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b708-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
