Antes (\u201cAntes\u201d) appeals from a decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) affirming the decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cthe Office\u201d) concluding that he was ineligible to receive Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d) annuity benefits and ineligible to make a deposit to the Civil Service Disability and Retirement Fund (\u201cCSRS Fund\u201d). <em>Antes v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. SF-0831-10-0717-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Sept.17, 2010) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>116 M.S.P.R. 354 (M.S.P.B. May 5, 2011) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u2019). </em>For the reasons explained below, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">Antes worked from March 1969 to July 1992 as a civilian employee for the Department of the Navy (\u201cNavy\u201d) at Subic Bay, Philippines. Each of Antes\u2019s appointments during this time was either a temporary appointment or an indefinite appointment in the excepted service. During this time, Antes was not covered by the Civil Service Retirement System, as reflected on the Standard Forms 50 of record indicating that his retirement plan was either 4 (None) or 5 (Other), as opposed to 1 (Civil Service). Antes admits that his federal employment was not subject to retirement deductions and that retirement deductions were not withheld during his employment. When Antes separated from federal employment in 1992, he was informed that he was entitled to twenty four months of severance pay based on his more than twenty three years of creditable service.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">In 1999, Antes requested a deferred CSRS annuity, which was denied by the Office because it concluded that Antes never served in a position subject to the CSRS. In 2008, Antes sought to make a deposit into the CSRS Fund, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8334(c), to cover the period of his federal service and make up for retirement deductions that the Navy had not taken from his salary during his service. The Office denied Antes\u2019s request because it concluded that none of Antes\u2019s previous appointments were subject to the CSRS. Antes appealed to the Board, which also concluded that Antes never served in a position covered under the Civil Service Retirement System. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 4-6. Antes then petitioned the full Board, which denied his petition for rehearing. <em>Final Order </em>at 1-5. Antes appealed to this court, which has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-11\">Antes argues on appeal that the Board erred in concluding that he was ineligible to receive CSRS annuity benefits and ineligible to make a deposit into the CSRS Fund. Specifically, Antes contends that he is eligible to receive benefits and make a contribution to the CSRS Fund because he meets the definition of \u201cemployee\u201d in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2105(a) and 8331(1)(A). Antes also argues that, based on his years of creditable service and 5 C.F.R \u00a7 831.303, he should be permitted to make a deposit in the CSRS Fund for his years of creditable service before 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-12\">The government responds that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333 makes clear that one\u2019s status as a federal employee, alone, is insufficient to confer entitlement to CSRS annuity benefits. The government responds that 5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 881.112(a) provides the proper definition of an employee who may make a deposit to the CSRS Fund. Additionally, the government contends that 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.303 applies only to computations concerning the length of an individual\u2019s service and is irrelevant as to whether an individual is covered under the CSRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">This court agrees with the government. Section 8333 requires that, in order for an employee to be eligible for annuity benefits under the CSRS, an employee must complete five years of \u201ccreditable\u201d service with at least one of the last two years prior to separation being in a position \u201ccovered\u201d by the CSRS. Section 8334(c) further provides that \u201c[e]ach employee ... credited with civilian service ... for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been made, may deposit with interest an amount equal to [a specified percentage] of his basic pay received for that service.\u201d The regulation associated with that section defines employees able to make a deposit under that section as (1) those currently employed in a position subject to the CSRS or (2) those formerly employed \u201cwho retain[] civil service retirement annuity rights based on a separation from a position in which retirement deductions were properly withheld and remain ... in the [CSRS Fund].\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.112. This regulation \u201callows a \u2018former employee\u2019 to make a deposit only if that former employee is already covered by the CSRS.\u201d <em>Dela Rosa v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>583 F.3d 762, 765 (Fed.Cir.2009). Antes does not contend that he is currently employed in a position subject to the CSRS or that he has ever had retirement deductions withheld under the CSRS. Thus, Antes\u2019s appeal turns on whether he has ever served in a position subject to the CSRS.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Although Antes proved that he had more than twenty years of creditable service as a federal employee, he has failed to show that any of his appointments were covered by the CSRS. The Board concluded, upon reviewing the Standard Forms 50 of record, that none of Antes\u2019s service was covered service subject to the CSRS. Antes failed to demonstrate how this finding is unsupported by substantial evidence. Moreover, the Board noted that all of Antes\u2019s appointments were either temporary or indefinite. Service rendered \u201cexclusively under temporary and indefinite appointments\u201d is \u201cexcluded from CSRS retirement coverage under OPM regulations.\u201d <em>Quiocson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>490 F.3d 1358,1360 (Fed.Cir.2007). Again, Antes does not challenge this finding on appeal. Finally, the Board, relying on the Standard Forms 50 of record, noted that Antes was entitled to twenty four months of severance pay for his twenty three years, six months, and one day of service in accordance with the Collective Bargaining Agreement/Filipino Employment Personnel Instruction (\u201cFEPI\u201d) and that this provided additional support for the conclusion that his service was not covered under the CSRS. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 5-6. Antes was covered by a different retirement system, the FEPI. \u201cHis receipt of benefits under a non-CSRS plan indicates that his service was not covered under the CSRS.\u201d <em>Quiocson, </em>490 F.3d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">This court has considered Antes\u2019s additional arguments and concludes that they do not require a different result. Because the Board\u2019s finding that Antes never served in a position covered under the CSRS was supported by substantial evidence and Antes has failed to demonstrate any legal error in the Board\u2019s decision, this court affirms the Board\u2019s conclusion that Antes is ineligible to receive CSRS annuity benefits or to make a deposit into the CSRS Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
