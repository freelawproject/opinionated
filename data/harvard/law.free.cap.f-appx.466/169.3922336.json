Schrock (\u201cDorothy\u201d) and Schrock, Incorporated, appeal from the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment, entered after a bench trial, that a business automobile insurance policy issued by Lancer Insurance Company (\u201cLancer\u201d) does not afford underinsured motorist coverage to Dorothy and Larry Schrock for injuries they suffered in an automobile collision. Appellants assert error in the district court\u2019s determination that Lancer was not required by Va.Code Ann. \u00a7 38.2-2206 (Supp.2011) to afford such coverage to Dorothy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-22\">On appeal from a bench trial, we review the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law de novo. <em>Roanoke Cement Co. v. Falk Corp., </em>413 F.3d 431, 433 (4th Cir.2005). After review of the record, we hold that the district court properly concluded that Lancer was not required by \u00a7 38.2-2206 to afford uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage to Dorothy, an insured of the second class under Virginia law who was present in a vehicle not listed in Lancer\u2019s insurance policy. <em>Stone v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>253 Va. 12, 478 S.E.2d 883, 886 (1996) (stating that \u00a7 38.2-2206 \u201conly requires, as to insureds of the second class, that uninsured motorist coverage be provided to those who are in <em>... the </em>motor vehicles listed in the policy, as opposed to \u2018any\u2019 vehicle to which the policy might apply\u201d) <em>(\u201cStone I </em>\u201d); <em>see also Stone v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>105 F.3d 188, 189-90,192 (4th Cir.1997) (applying <em>Stone I </em>and holding that employee was not entitled to uninsured or underinsured motorist coverage by operation of \u00a7 38.2-2206 for injury occurring while employee was operating his personal vehicle in the scope of his employment because the vehicle \u2014 although covered under the employer\u2019s liability policy when used in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>with the employer\u2019s business\u2014was not listed in the policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
