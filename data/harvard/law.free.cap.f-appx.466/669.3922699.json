Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Moreno\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided Moreno with the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-24\">Moreno waived his right to appeal his sentence with the exception of nonstandard conditions of supervised release. Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80-81, 109 S.Ct. 346,102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable grounds for relief as to the defendant\u2019s conviction and indicates that the appeal waiver is operative. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal of the sentence in part. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000). With regard to the nonstandard conditions of supervised release, our independent review of the record disclosed no arguable grounds for relief on direct appeal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-25\">In accordance with <em>United States v. Rivera-Sanchez, </em>222 F.3d 1057, 1062 (9th Cir.2000), we remand the case to the district court with instructions that it delete from the judgment the incorrect reference to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b). <em>See United States v. Herreras-Blanco, </em>232 F.3d 715, 719 (9th Cir.2000) (remanding sua sponte to delete the reference \u00a7 1326(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-26\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>AFFIRMED in part; DISMISSED in part; REMANDED to correct the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b693-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
