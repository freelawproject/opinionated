We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence factual findings, <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-25\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on Chen\u2019s failure to mention that she was forcibly sterilized during either of her interviews at the airport. <em>See Liu v. Holder, </em>640 F.3d 918, 926 (9th Cir.2011); <em>Zamanov v. Holder, </em>649 F.3d 969, 974 (9th Cir.2011) (explanation was plausible, but record did not compel the finding that the IJ\u2019s unwillingness to believe it was erroneous). The agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is also supported by the discrepancies between Chen\u2019s statements at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>the airport and her testimony regarding the circumstances of her arrest and release from custody, as well as the expert testimony that Chen\u2019s fine receipt was likely fraudulent. <em>See Kohli v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 1061, 1071 (9th Cir.2007) (adverse credibility determination is supported by discrepancy between testimony and declaration); <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 745 (9th Cir.2004). In the absence of credible testimony, Chen\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims fail. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">Because Chen\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence the agency found not credible, and she points to no other evidence showing it is more likely than not she will be tortured if returned to China, her CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1156\u201457.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b705-26\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
