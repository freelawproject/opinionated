He was sentenced to 72 months of imprisonment and 36 months of imprisonment to run concurrently, and three years and one year of supervised release, also concurrent. Santillan challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence, arguing that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the illegal reentry Guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not empirically based and double counts the defendant\u2019s criminal history. He argues, in reliance on <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply, but he concedes that his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), and he raises the argument to preserve it for possible review by the Supreme Court. He further argues that the guideline range overstated the seriousness of the offense, which was essentially a trespass, and failed to account for his benign motive for reentering, which was out of fear of being murdered in Juarez.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Because Santillan did not make any objections to his sentence or argue in the district court that his sentence was unreasonable, his arguments are reviewable only for plain error. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 134-35, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009); <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) (requiring objection to substantive unreasonableness of sentence to preserve error).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">As he so concedes, Santillan\u2019s argument that the presumption of reasonableness should not apply to his sentence because \u00a7 2L1.2 lacks empirical support has been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir. 2009) (rejecting the notion that this court should examine the empirical basis behind each Guideline before applying the presumption of reasonableness); <em>see also Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 366-67. Santillan\u2019s argument that his guidelines range was greater than necessary to meet \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s goals as a result of \u201cdouble counting\u201d is unavailing. The Guidelines provide for consideration of a prior conviction for both criminal history and the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6). We have also rejected the argument that such double-counting necessarily renders a sentence unreasonable. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. We have previously rejected the argument that illegal reentry is merely a trespass offense that is treated too harshly under \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Aguirre-Villa, </em>460 F.3d 681, 683 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The district court heard the arguments of Santillan and his counsel concerning his reasons for reentering the United States before imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range. The district court considered Santillan\u2019s personal history and characteristics and the other statutory sentencing factors in \u00a7 3553(a), in particular Santillan\u2019s extensive criminal history, prior to imposing a sentence within the Guidelines. Santillan\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 347, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Santillan has failed to show that the presumption should not apply. The district court did not abuse its discretion, much less plainly err, in imposing a sentence within the advisory guideline range. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Accordingly, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-25\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
