After review of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">Bonilla is a citizen of Honduras. He was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers on June 13, 2011 after they determined that he was in the country illegally. Bonilla pleaded guilty to the charge of illegal reentry. At sentencing, the district court adopted the PreSentence Report\u2019s recommendation of a base offense level of eight under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, a sixteen-level enhancement for a previous conviction for a crime of violence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), and a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1(a) and (b). The PSR also recommended a criminal history category of III, based on Bonilla\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated battery and two prior felony traffic violations. The overall offense level of twenty-one and the criminal history category of III resulted in a guideline sentence range of forty-six to fifty-seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-14\">On appeal, Bonilla argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable because 1) the district court did not adequately consider the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a); 2) the criminal history enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) was not supported by empirical evidence; and 3) the district court failed to consider the sentencing disparities that exist between fast track and non-fast track jurisdictions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). We consider each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-16\">We review a sentence for substantive reasonableness<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51,128 S.Ct. 586, 597,169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). This Court assesses the substantive reasonableness in light of the record and the factors listed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). A sentence must be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary\u201d to \u201creflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment,\u201d as well as deter criminal conduct. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Although we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guideline range to be reasonable, we ordinarily expect it to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008). We review arguments raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>472 F.3d 825, 831 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>(11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">First, Bonilla argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable under \u00a7 3553(a) because the district court gave almost exclusive consideration to his prior aggravated battery conviction, and failed to consider mitigating factors, such as the circumstances of the charged offense, and his family responsibilities. However, the district court considered a number of factors beyond Bonilla\u2019s prior conviction for aggravated battery, including his multiple prior illegal reentries, his demonstrated willingness to violate the laws once he was in the United States, and his family situation. Given that the district court weighed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the district court by re-weighing those factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Second, Bonilla argues that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) is not supported by empirical evidence, and that the provision disproportionately increased his offense level relative to the seriousness of his underlying offense. Bonilla apparently neither raised this argument in his objections to the PSR nor at the time of sentencing. Therefore, we review the argument for plain error. This Court has previously held that the absence of empirical evidence alone is not sufficient to compel invalidation of a sentencing guideline. <em>United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 870 (11th Cir.2010). Therefore, Bonilla cannot establish that the district court\u2019s alleged misapplication of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) was plain error. <em>See Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d at 1291 (\u201c[W]here the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">Finally, Bonilla argues that the district court erred under \u00a7 3553(a)(6)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in failing to consider sentencing disparities between fast-track and non-fast track jurisdictions. Given that he did not raise this issue in the district court, we also review this argument under the plain error standard. This Court is bound by <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235 (11th Cir.2008), which holds that \u00a7 3553(a)(6) does not require district courts to depart downward based upon the availability of fast-track sentencing departures in other jurisdictions. <em>Id. </em>at 1238-39. Therefore, the district court\u2019s failure to consider the fast-track sentencing disparities cannot be plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">For the reasons stated, we AFFIRM the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-12\">.
