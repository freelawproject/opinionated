Plaintiff had a cardholder contract with the company containing a valid arbitration agreement, and the parties do not dispute that Plaintiffs claims here are encompassed by that agreement. On April 12, 2011, Defendant moved to compel arbitration. Plaintiff contested on various grounds. The district court granted the motion, dismissing the action without prejudice and compelling arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">The sole issue here is whether, as Plaintiff argues, one of various Mississippi statutes of limitations for contracts bars Defendants\u2019 demand to arbitrate, because that demand is based on a contract that was signed several years ago.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This argument misunderstands the applicability of statutes of limitations to arbitration agreements. As stated by the district court, a party\u2019s right to compel arbitration accrues when the opposing party refuses to arbitrate, not when the contract is signed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants moved to compel arbitration less than two months after Plaintiff filed this action, well within all of the multi-year statutes of limitations that Plaintiff claims could apply. For this reason, and for the reasons given by the district court in its careful decision of August 3, 2011, 831 F.Supp.2d 957 we affirm the district court\u2019s order to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b349-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.

We assume only <em>arguendo </em>that this is a proper question for this court, rather than for the arbitrator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b350-8\">.
