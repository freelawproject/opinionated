Abreu also sued for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and abuse of process. He now appeals from the November 10, 2010 judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granting the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all of these claims. Because the defendants did not violate Abreu\u2019s constitutional rights when they searched his home, arrested him, and prosecuted him for possession of marijuana, we affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">We review an award of summary judgment <em>de novo. Gorzynski v. JetBlue Airways Corp., </em>596 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir.2010). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when, construing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \u2018there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rojas v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester, </em>660 F.3d 98, 104 (2d Cir.2011) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(a)). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-18\">1. <em>Illegal Search and Seizure</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-19\">The officers who searched Abreu\u2019s apartment on the night in question did so pursuant to a valid warrant, which was issued on the strength of defendant Detective Romero\u2019s affidavit asserting that he had overseen a \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d of narcotics at the apartment. Abreu argues that the \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d did not occur as Detective Romero represented it, and accordingly that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. However, \u201ca search or seizure pursuant to a warrant is presumed valid,\u201d and a party seeking to \u201cchallenge the truthfulness of factual statements made in the affidavit ... must show that there were intentional and material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>misrepresentations or omissions in [the] warrant affidavit.\u201d <em>United States v. Awadallah, </em>349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir.2003) (citation omitted) (citing <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 164-72, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978)). Because Abreu adduced no evidence that the affidavit supporting the search warrant in this case contained intentional, material misrepresentations, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to the defendants on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">2. <em>False Arrest and Malicious Prosecution</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">The District Court also correctly dismissed Abreu\u2019s claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution. \u201cUnder New York law, the existence of probable cause is an absolute defense to a false arrest claim,\u201d <em>Jaegly v. Couch, </em>439 F.3d 149, 152 (2d Cir.2006), and to a malicious prosecution claim, <em>Savino v. City of New York, </em>331 F.3d 63, 72 (2d Cir.2003). \u201cAn officer has probable cause to arrest when he or she has \u2018knowledge or reasonably trustworthy information of facts and circumstances that are sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution in the belief that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing a crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jaegly, </em>439 F.3d at 152 (quoting <em>Weyant v. Okst, </em>101 F.3d 845, 852 (2d Cir.1996)). Like the District Court, we conclude that the defendants had probable cause to arrest Abreu after they discovered over two ounces of marijuana in his bedroom. Accordingly, the District Court correctly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Abreu\u2019s claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">3. <em>Abuse of Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">Finally, we conclude that the District Court correctly granted summary judgment on Abreu\u2019s claim for malicious abuse of process. To make out such a claim, Abreu was required to demonstrate that the defendants employed legal process \u201cin order to obtain a collateral objective that is outside the legitimate ends of the process,\u201d such as retribution. <em>Cook v. Sheldon, </em>41 F.3d 73, 80 (2d Cir.1994). Abreu has proffered no evidence to suggest that the defendants had a collateral objective when they arrested and prosecuted him for possession of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">We have considered Abreu\u2019s remaining arguments on appeal and conclude that they are without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
