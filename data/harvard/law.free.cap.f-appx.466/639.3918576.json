Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Gonzalez Romero\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating there are no grounds for relief, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. We have provided the appellant with the opportunity to file a pro se supplemental brief. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">Gonzalez Romero waived his right to appeal his sentence with the exception of conditions of certain supervised release. Our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 80-81, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), discloses no arguable grounds for relief as to defendant\u2019s conviction or the conditions of supervised release, and indicates that the appeal waiver is valid. We dismiss the appeal of the sentence in part. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">AFFIRMED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b664-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
