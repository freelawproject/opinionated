Review is for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., United States v. Franklin, </em>561 F.3d 398, 405 (5th Cir.2009) (Rule 33); <em>Warfield v. Byron, </em>436 F.3d 551, 555 (5th Cir.2006) (Rule 60(b)).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Although Bouldin\u2019s appellate brief also references the district court\u2019s 19 September 2011 denial of his second motion for a new trial and relief from judgment, his 19 September 2011 notice of appeal refers only to the 13 September denial. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to review the 19 September denial. Fed. R.App. P. 3(c)(1)(B) (\u201cThe notice of appeal must ... designate the judgment, order, or part thereof being appealed____\u201d); <em>Gonzalez v. Thaler,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 132 S.Ct. 641, 651-52, 181 L.Ed.2d 619 (2012) (Rule 3 is jurisdictional). <em>See also Warfield v. Fidelity and Deposit Co., </em>904 F.2d 322, 325 (5th Cir.1990) (when appellant \u201cnotices the appeal of a specified judgment only or a part thereof ... this court has no jurisdiction to review other judgments or issues which are not expressly referred to and which are not impliedly intended for appeal\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The district court found Bouldin\u2019s Rule 33 motion untimely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b) (providing three-year time limit when ground for new trial is newly discovered evidence; otherwise, limit is 14 days). Bouldin\u2019s assertion that the time limits under Rule 33 should have been equitably tolled is not adequately briefed and therefore waived. Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9)(A). Bouldin also contends, citing <em>Eberhart v. United States, </em>546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005), that the district court erred by dismissing <em>sua sponte </em>his motion for untimeliness. In <em>Eberhart, </em>the Supreme Court concluded the time requirements for Rule 33 are nonjurisdictional claims-processing rules and that the Government forfeited the untimeliness defense by not raising it until after the district court decided the motion on the merits. 546 U.S. at 19, 126 S.Ct. 403. Bouldin\u2019s reliance on <em>Eberhart </em>is misplaced. The district court denied Bouldin\u2019s motion the day after it was filed, without participation by the Government. A \u201cdistrict court does not err, after <em>Eberhart, </em>if it enforces an inflexible claim processing rule, and we may not reverse its decision to do so\u201d. <em>United States v. Leijano-Cruz, </em>473 F.3d 571, 574 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-14\">To the extent Bouldin\u2019s motion also invoked Rule 60(b), the district court ruled correctly that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to criminal cases. <em>United States v. O\u2019Keefe, </em>169 F.3d 281, 289 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b352-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
