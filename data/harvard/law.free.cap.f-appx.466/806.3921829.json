Six Unknown Narcotics Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), against Federal Bureau of Prisons personnel claiming that they denied him the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment when they eliminated the Spanish language from the Residential Drug Abuse Program so that the Program would be delivered only in English. He also claimed that they denied him his First Amendment right to speak the official language of Puerto Rico. (Valazquez, who lived and resided in Puerto Rico until his arrest and conviction for trafficking narcotics, speaks only Spanish.)</p>\n<p id=\"b830-19\">The district court referred Valazquez\u2019s complaint to a magistrate judge who issued a Report &amp; Recommendation recommending that the district court dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim for relief. Over Valazquez\u2019s objection, the district court adopted the recommendation and dismissed the complaint, agreeing with the magistrate judge that Valazquez \u201chas no constitutional right to vocational, rehabilitative or educational programs. <em>Franklin v.
