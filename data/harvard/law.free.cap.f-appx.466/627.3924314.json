Regardless of whether the BIA or IJ directly considered whether the harm Davila fears is on account of her family membership, she is unable to show that her family\u2019s \u201cpersecutors actually imputed a political opinion\u201d to her family. <em>Ochoa v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 1166, 1171 (9th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1489 (9th Cir.1997)). Davila failed to demonstrate what political views the alleged persecutors attributed to her family, and any inference of political motivation that might be drawn from the unexplained killings of her family members doesn\u2019t qualify as \u201cclearly to be drawn from facts in evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Sangha, </em>103 F.3d at 1487).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-18\">2. The BIA and IJ didn\u2019t fail to consider Davila\u2019s experience as a child in rejecting her claim to past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution. Davila left Guatemala at age nine and testified, \u201cI hardly have any memories of living over there.\u201d The stories she\u2019s heard from friends and relatives about dangers in Guatemala fall short of the horrific events experienced firsthand by the asylum applicants in <em>Hernandez-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>496 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-19\">3. Davila\u2019s claim to derivative standing to pursue her mother\u2019s asylum claim doesn\u2019t suffer from a failure to exhaust. Davila\u2019s June 7, 2007, letter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>BIA raised the key issue as it then stood: whether Davila, as a derivative asylum applicant, could pursue her mother\u2019s asylum claim. When the government responded with a motion for summary dismissal, Davila wasn\u2019t obliged to respond, as she\u2019d already raised the derivative standing issue. And once the BIA granted the government\u2019s dismissal motion, Davila had no opportunity to present her derivative standing argument as a continuing derivative asylum claim despite the fact that her mother had received a different form of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">The BIA thus never addressed Davila\u2019s derivative standing claim. We remand for it to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">PETITION DENIED IN PART; PETITION GRANTED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
