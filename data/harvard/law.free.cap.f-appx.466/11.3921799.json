See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. R. 34(3). The court has accorded the issues full consideration and has determined that they do not warrant a published opinion. See D.C.Cir. R. 36(d). It is hereby</p>\n<p id=\"b35-18\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the decision of the district court be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-19\">Appellant Olzie Perry, an African American female, contends that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) discriminated against her on the basis of age, race, and sex in violation of both the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 621 et seq., and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq., when it promoted Don Murphy, a forty-one-year-old white male, over her to a managerial position. In response, VA asserts that it hired Murphy for a number of legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons, including Murphy\u2019s experience working at a remote worksite, his demonstrated ability to work with information technology systems, and the fact that he received the highest score of any candidate on his written application.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-21\">After full discovery, the district court granted summary judgment to VA. On appeal, Perry contends that the district court erred by analyzing her claim solely to determine whether she was discriminated against \u201cbecause of\u2019 a protected characteristic. Perry argues that, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(m) and this court\u2019s decision in <em>Ford v. Mabus, </em>629 F.3d 198 (D.C.Cir.2010), the district court was also required to determine whether a reasonable jury could find that age, race, or sex was a motivating factor in\u2014though not the but-for cause of\u2014the employment decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-22\">We need not consider this legal argument, however, because nothing in the record suggests that Perry\u2019s age, race, or sex played any role whatsoever\u2014whether as a but-for cause or as a motivating factor\u2014in VA\u2019s decision. Moreover, as the district court correctly determined, nothing in the record could support a reasonable inference that VA\u2019s stated reasons for Murphy\u2019s selection were pretextual. Thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment to VA.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-23\">The Clerk is directed to withhold the issuance of the mandate herein until seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>days after the resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
