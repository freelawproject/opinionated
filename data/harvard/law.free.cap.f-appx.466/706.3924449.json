TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b731-20\">The district court struck from the record Dar\u00edan Hunter\u2019s pro se pleading captioned \u201cWrit of Habeas Corpus\u201d on the basis that Hunter was represented by counsel. Hunter filed a pro se notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We vacate the district court\u2019s order for lack of jurisdiction, construe Hunter\u2019s notice of appeal and appellate briefs as an implied application for authorization to file a second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, and deny authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-21\">Hunter\u2019s conviction in 2000 on a drug trafficking charge was affirmed by this court in <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>9 Fed. Appx. 857 (10th Cir.2001). He filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, which the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>denied. This court declined to grant Hunter a certificate of appealability on November 14, 2003. Hunter\u2019s supervised release was revoked by the district court on October 25, 2010. He was represented by counsel in the revocation proceeding. On May 4, 2011, Hunter filed a pro se \u201cWrit of Habeas Corpus\u201d in the district court seeking \u201cdismiss[al] of the charges against him.\u201d R. at 35. He challenged the legal sufficiency of the indictment underlying his 2000 conviction and raised a claim of pre-trial delay. A day later, the district court entered the following order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">Defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>filing ... is STRICKEN from the record. Defendant is represented by counsel. Under the law, there is no constitutional right to a hybrid form of representation. Consequently, the Court will not consider any future <em>pro se </em>filings. All further communications with the Court must be filed through Defendant\u2019s counsel of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 39 (citation omitted). Hunter filed a pro se notice of appeal, asserting that he was not represented by counsel in connection with his Writ of Habeas Corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Hunter raises two issues on appeal: (1) whether the district court erred in striking his pro se application for a writ of habeas corpus; and (2) whether he has satisfied the requirements for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion based on a claim of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">Hunter explicitly characterizes his district court filing as an application for a writ of habeas corpus. Moreover, the relief he seeks \u2014 dismissal of the charges underlying his 2000 conviction \u2014 may only be obtained through \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a) (\u201cA prisoner in custody under sentence of a court established by Act of Congress claiming the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may move the court which imposed the sentence to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">\u201c[Fjederal prisoners seeking relief under \u00a7 2255 generally must marshal all of their claims into one collateral attack on their conviction and sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>235 F.3d 1238, 1241 (10th Cir.2000). Because Hunter has already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion and a judgment has been entered in that proceeding, he must obtain authorization from this court before filing another such motion in the district court. <em>See United States v. Nelson, </em>465 F.3d 1145, 1148 (10th Cir.2006). Accordingly, the district court lacked jurisdiction over Hunter\u2019s post-judgment motion, and its order striking Hunter\u2019s pleading must be vacated. <em>See id. </em>But we will construe his notice of appeal and appellate briefs as a request for the required authorization.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">\u201cFederal prisoners are barred from attacking their federal convictions through second or successive \u00a7 2255 motions except in very limited circumstances.\u201d <em>Kelly, </em>235 F.3d at 1241. \u201cSecond or successive \u00a7 2255 motions are restricted to claims involving either newly discovered evidence strongly suggestive of innocence or new rules of constitutional law made retroactive by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>Brace v. United States, </em>634 F.3d 1167, 1170 (10th Cir.2011) (quotation and ellipsis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">We have thoroughly reviewed the matter and conclude that Hunter has failed to make the prima facie showing required by \u00a7 2255(h). His contentions are not based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence that, if proven and viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would be suffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>cient to establish by clear and convincing evidence that no reasonable factfinder would have found [him] guilty of the offense\u201d \u00a7 2255(h)(1). Nor are they based on \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2255(h)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">The judgment of the district court is VACATED, and the implied application for authorization to file another \u00a7 2255 motion is DENIED. Hunter\u2019s Motion to Remove Assistant United States Attorneys is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b731-13\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-23\">. Counsel initially entered an appearance on behalf of Hunter in this appeal, but moved to withdraw on the basis that Hunter wished to proceed pro se. We granted counsel's motion to withdraw.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
