Nov. 30, 2010), <em>aff'g </em>No. A092 013 447 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 7, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-12\">Under the circumstances of this case, we have reviewed the entire IJ decision. <em>See Ming Xia Chen v. BIA </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). The applicable standards of review are well-established. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Yanqin Weng v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 510, 513 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-13\">I. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or a finding that no change or extraordinary circumstance excuses the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). We nevertheless retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">Kandaswamy argues first that, as a matter of law, the agency failed to make an explicit finding as to an excuse for untimeliness. However, a review of the IJ\u2019s decision shows that he did in fact determine that Kandaswamy had not demonstrated extraordinary or changed circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-16\">Kandaswamy argues that, in any event, any such finding was in error. Because the IJ mischaracterized the record, and because both the IJ and the BIA relied on that mischaracterization in determining that Kandaswamy failed to show changed circumstances sufficient to excuse the one year filing deadline, the agency erred as a matter of law. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Mendez v. Holder, </em>566 F.3d 316, 323 (2d Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-17\">The IJ noted in his decision that \u201cthe Tamil conflict has been going on in Sri Lanka for approximately 25 to 30 years\u201d and \u201c[njothing has changed\u201d; and the BIA agreed with that finding in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision to pretermit Kandaswamy\u2019s asylum application. The statement that nothing has changed in Sri Lanka in the past decades seriously misstates the record. Country condition evidence indicates: that there was a cease-fire between the government and the LTTE in 2002, which began to break down in 2006 and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>formally dissolved in January 2008; and that disappearances of ethnic Tamils by the government, and government-sponsored paramilitary groups, has \u201cincreased dramatically\u201d since 2006. This error affected the agency\u2019s decision regarding changed circumstances sufficient to excuse the one year deadline for filing an asylum application. <em>See Tian-Yong Chen v. I.N.S., </em>359 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir.2004). Moreover, remand to the agency to correct its error would not be futile, because it is not clear that the agency would adhere to its prior decision to pretermit Kandaswarn/s asylum application if it were to assess the record accurately. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">II. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">A. Individual Likelihood of Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Kandaswamy claims that he will be persecuted in Sri Lanka because the government will assume that a Tamil who lived abroad supports the LTTE, or, alternatively, that he will be persecuted as an unsuccessful asylum seeker. However, as the IJ observed, there is no evidence in the record that the Sri Lanka government is persecuting Tamils returning from abroad, or asylum seekers. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005). Kandaswamy also did not establish that the government would be aware that he sought and did not receive asylum. <em>See Hongsheng Leng v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 135, 143 (2d Cir.2008). Accordingly, the IJ did not err in finding that Kandaswamy failed to establish that he would be persecuted upon return to Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">B. Pattern or Practice</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">An applicant for withholding of removal may establish eligibility for that relief by showing either that he will be persecuted in the future, or that \u201cthere is a pattern or practice of persecution of a group of persons similarly situated to the applicant\u201d on account of a protected ground, and he is included in that group. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2); <em>see Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88, 91 (2d Cir.2007). Kandaswamy also argues that he established a pattern or practice of persecution of Tamils by the Sri Lankan government and by paramilitary groups. The IJ concluded that the record showed no more than \u201cisolated incidents\u201d of individuals considered to be \u201cpart of a terrorist organization\u201d being \u201carrested, detained, and beaten.\u201d As evidence that there was no pattern or practice of persecution of Tamils in Sri Lanka, the IJ observed that the State Department had not granted temporary protected status to Tamils in the United States. The BIA concurred with the IJ\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-11\">The agency\u2019s conclusion is undermined by problems with its fact-finding process, as it does not indicate what evidence it relied upon in determining that there were only isolated incidents of arrests, detentions and beatings: moreover, it mischaracterizes the record regarding the treatment of Tamils in Sri Lanka. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 405 (2d Cir.2005)(remanding where the agency \u201cmischaracterized the record\u201d); <em>cf. Santoso v. Holder, </em>580 F.3d 110, 112 (2d Cir.2009) (holding that where the agency\u2019s determination that an individual did not establish a pattern or practice of persecution is supported by background materials, the agency has provided a \u201csufficient basis\u201d for its conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-12\">There is documentary evidence which the agency may credit (or not) that suggests a high level of violence against ethnic Tamil civilians at the hands of the Sri Lankan government, government-supported paramilitary groups, and other ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>tors. A letter from members of the United States Congress to Ambassador Rice states that \u201cethnic-based violence is widespread in Sri Lanka, and Tamil noncombatants are deliberately victimized by Sri Lankan Government policies.\u201d A 2008 Human Rights Watch report states that \u201c[h]undreds of enforced disappearances committed since 2006 have already placed Sri Lanka among the countries with the highest number of new cases in the world. The victims are primarily young ethnic Tamil men who \u2018disappear\u2019\u2014often after being picked up by government security forces in the country\u2019s embattled north and east, but also in the capital Colombo.\u201d A 2008 report from the UNHCR states that \u201cTamils in Colombo ... are at heightened risk of security checks, arbitrary personal and house to house searches, harassment, restrictions on freedom of movement, and other forms of abuse\u201d and \u201cin relation to individuals who flee targeted violence or human right abuses by the authorities or paramilitary groups, there is no internal flight alternative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Finally, the designation of temporary protected status is not required for finding a pattern or practice of persecution. <em>Compare 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(1) (defining designation of temporary protected status) <em>with 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)(i) (defining \u201cpattern or practice\u201d) <em>and Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 222 (BIA 1985) (defining persecution), <em>overruled, in part, on other grounds, by INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, and the case is remanded to the agency for further proceedings. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
