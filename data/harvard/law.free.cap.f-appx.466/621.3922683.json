The district court did not err by denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for judgment as a matter of law. The knock-and-announce requirement may be excused by the presence of exigent circumstances. <em>See United States v. Bynum, </em>362 F.3d 574, 579 (9th Cir.2004). The municipal officer defendants presented evidence that they saw a person look down at them from the second floor of the Dualeh residence when they were crossing an open parking lot to serve drug-related search and arrest warrants. A reasonable juror could find that exigent circumstances existed based on the officers\u2019 fear for their personal safety or a concern for the destruction of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">2. The district court did not err by instructing the jury that the plaintiffs had the ultimate burden of proof and the defendants had the burden of producing evidence of exigent circumstances. The instruction was consistent with <em>Larez v. Holcomb, </em>16 F.3d 1513, 1517 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-13\">3. Because we hold that plaintiffs were not entitled to judgment as a matter of law and uphold the jury verdict in favor of the municipal officer defendants, we need not reach whether the district court erred by dismissing the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Agent Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b646-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
