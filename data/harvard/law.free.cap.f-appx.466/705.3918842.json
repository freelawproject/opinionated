MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b729-19\">David Robin Whitmore, an Oklahoma state prisoner, filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 on December 30, 2010, alleging prison officials incorrectly calculated his <em>\u201cEkstrand </em>credits.\u201d <em>See Ekstrand v. State, </em>791 P.2d 92, 95 (Okla.Crim.App.1990), <em>overruled on other grounds by Waldon v. Evans, </em>861 P.2d 311 (Okla.Crim.App.1993). Respondent moved to dismiss the application, arguing Whitmore had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. Respondent also argued the application was untimely under 28 U.S.C. 2244(d)(1)(D) because it was filed more than one year after the \u201cfactual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-20\">After providing notice to Whitmore, the district court converted Respondent\u2019s motion into a motion for dismissal or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. <em>See Miller v. Glanz, </em>948 F.2d 1562, 1565 (10th Cir.1991). Based on Whitmore\u2019s admission that he received a copy of the document detailing his earned credits in June 2009, the court concluded he discovered the factual predicate of his claim no later than that date. Whitmore\u2019s habeas application, however, was not filed until ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>proximately eighteen months later. Even assuming it was proper to exclude the time Whitmore spent pursuing mandamus relief in state court, the \u00a7 2241 petition was still filed beyond the one-year statute of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2) (providing the one-year limitations period is statutorily tolled while \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending\u201d). The district court also concluded Whit-more failed to demonstrate any circumstances that would support the equitable tolling of the one-year limitations period. <em>See Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). Finally, the court concluded Whitmore could not rely on a \u201ccontinuing violation\u201d theory. <em>Cf. Smith v. Grubbs, </em>42 Fed.Appx. 370, 371 (10th Cir.2002) (unpublished disposition). Accordingly, the district court concluded Whit-more\u2019s \u00a7 2241 application was untimely and granted summary judgment in favor of Respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">Whitmore now seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to enable him to appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his \u00a7 2241 application. To be entitled to a COA, Whitmore must show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484-85, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (holding that when a district court dismisses a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a petitioner is entitled to a COA only if he shows both that reasonable jurists would find it debatable whether he had stated a valid constitutional claim and debatable whether the district court\u2019s procedural ruling was correct). This court reviews the district court\u2019s decision on equitable tolling for abuse of discretion. Burger <em>v. Scott, </em>317 F.3d 1133, 1138 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"AZU\">This court has reviewed Whitmore\u2019s application for a COA and appellate brief, the district court\u2019s order, the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation, and the entire record on appeal pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El </em>and concludes Whitmore is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Whitmore\u2019s claim is not reasonably subject to debate and the claim is not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, Whitmore is not entitled to a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">This court denies Whitmore\u2019s request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. Whitmore\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
