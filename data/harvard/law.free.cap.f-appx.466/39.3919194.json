(\u201cMorgans\u201d) and its former President and CEO, W. Edward Scheetz (\u201cScheetz\u201d), which sought to recover Scheetz\u2019s profits from purchases and sales of Morgans stock within a six-month period. <em>See </em>Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 \u00a7 16(b), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78p(b). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-19\">\u2018We review de <em>novo </em>the dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), accepting all factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Hutchison v. Deutsche Bank Sec. Inc., </em>647 F.3d 479, 483-84 (2d Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court declined to consider certain SEC filings, which were not incorporated into the complaint, for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>truth of their assertions. This was not in error. <em>See Roth v. Jennings, </em>489 F.3d 499, 509 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cWhen a complaint alleges, for example, that a document filed with the SEC failed to disclose certain facts, it is appropriate for the court, in considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, to examine the document .... \u2018only to determine <em>what </em>the doeument[] stated,\u2019 and <em>\u2018not to prove the truth of [its] contents.\u2019 \u201d </em>(emphasis in original) (quoting <em>Kramer v. Time Warner Inc., </em>937 F.2d 767, 774 (2d Cir.1991))).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Absent the SEC filings, the complaint\u2019s allegations that Scheetz was part of an ownership group are entirely conclusory and cannot withstand Scheetz\u2019s motion to dismiss. <em>See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009) (\u201cTo survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\u201cWe review denial of leave to amend under an abuse of discretion standard.\u201d <em>Hutchison, </em>647 F.3d at 490 (internal quotation marks omitted). Chechele failed to amend or move to amend her complaint within 21 days after Scheetz filed his Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1). While a court \u201cshould freely give leave [to amend] when justice so requires,\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2), \u201c[i]t is within the court\u2019s discretion to deny leave to amend ... when [as here] leave is requested informally in a brief filed in opposition to a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>In Re: Tamoxifen Citrate Antitrust Litig., </em>466 F.3d 187, 220 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Porat v. Lincoln Towers Cmty. Ass\u2019n, </em>464 F.3d 274, 276 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\u201cEspecially given that plaintiffs counsel did not advise the district court how the complaint\u2019s defects would be cured, upon all the facts of this case we find no abuse of discretion and decline to remand for repleading.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Finding no merit in Chechele\u2019s remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
