Loreto argues that the condition is not reasonably related to his conviction or his history and characteristics. The district court did not abuse its discretion, as the challenged condition is reasonably related to the goals of deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation; and does not involve a greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d); <em>United States v.
