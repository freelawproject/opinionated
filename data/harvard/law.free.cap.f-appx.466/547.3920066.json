A magistrate judge, presiding by consent, ruled after a bench trial in favor of the defendants, finding that East failed to show either that she could perform the essential functions of her job (as required for relief under the ADA) or that race was the reason for her termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-22\">On appeal East\u2019s arguments boil down to an attack on the district court\u2019s resolution of conflicting evidence and credibility determinations, which this court reviews only for clear error. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985); <em>RK Co. v. See, </em>622 F.3d 846, 852 (7th Cir.2010). There is no clear error here. The judge sufficiently justified his decision and addressed the arguments East now raises. To the extent that East also charges the judge with bias against her, nothing in the record suggests that he exhibited the \u201chigh degree of favoritism or antagonism\u201d that would make \u201cfair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
