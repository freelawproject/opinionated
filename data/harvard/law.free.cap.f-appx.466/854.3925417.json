Levy was acquitted of one count of the latter charge. The Cohens appeal their convictions, alleging that (1) there was insufficient evidence to support their convictions on the conspiracy to defraud the IRS charge; (2) the district court erred by excluding their expert witness testimony; (3) the district court erred by giving an improper jury instruction and abused its discretion by failing to give their requested jury instructions; and (4) the district court committed plain error by admitting evidence of an \u201cother\u201d bad act.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-10\">After reviewing the record, reading the parties\u2019 briefs and having the benefit of oral argument, we reject all of the arguments made by the appellants and affirm their convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
