He alleged that his right to freely exercise his religion, protected under the First Amendment and the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42 U. S.C. \u00a7 2000cc-l, was violated when, in October 2008, the state denied him parole based, in part, on his refusal to participate in a sex offender counseling and treatment program. We consolidate Griffin\u2019s appeals and assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-18\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor.\u201d <em>Shomo v. City of N.Y., </em>579 F.3d 176, 183 (2d Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Oneida Nation of N.Y. v. Cuomo, </em>645 F.3d 154, 164 (2d Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Liberally construing his complaint to avoid mootness and the \u201cfavorable termination\u201d rule of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2864, 129 L.Ed.2d 388 (1994), we find that Griffin fails to state a claim nonetheless. Griffin argues that his Presentence Report erroneously states that he sexually abused one victim; but he admits to sexually abusing another. Participants in the sex offender treatment program are not required to confess to any particular offense or act of abuse. All that is required is that participants discuss the behavior that resulted in incarceration. Griffin does not plausibly state that this requirement necessitates that he lie or otherwise \u201cimposefs] a substantial burden on the exercise of his religion.\u201d <em>See Redd v. Wright, </em>597 F.3d 532, 536 (2d Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">As his complaint fails to state a claim, it follows that Griffin fails to show a \u201cclear\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d likelihood of success. <em>See Jolly v. Coughlin, </em>76 F.3d 468, 473 (2d Cir.1996) (articulating the standard for a preliminary injunction that will alter the status quo or \u201cprovide the movant with substantially all the relief sought\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the appeals docketed under 11-1047 and 11-3853 are CONSOLIDATED, and the order and judgment of the district court are hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
