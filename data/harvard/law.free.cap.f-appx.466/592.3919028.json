We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-19\">1. The district court properly awarded summary judgment in favor of Kaiser on Samano\u2019s claims for ERISA benefits. It is undisputed that Kaiser paid Samano\u2019s $31,000 discounted bill and reimbursed Samano for related out of pocket expenses he was charged for emergency medical services provided by Providence Holy Cross Medical Center (\u201cProvidence\u201d). It is also undisputed that once Providence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>applies the discounted rate to a patient\u2019s bill, that sum is the maximum amount the patient owes Providence. Thus, the district court correctly concluded that Samano has received all the benefits owed under his ERISA plan and is not entitled to reimbursement for the original, nonbilled, amount of benefits that Kaiser might have owed Providence had it originally recognized that Samano was entitled to coverage. Under the circumstances, such an award of benefits to Samano would be a windfall, not permitted under ERISA, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). Under ERISA, a beneficiary may not recover \u201cextracontractual, compensatory [or] punitive damages.\u201d <em>Bast v. Prudential Ins. Co. of Am., </em>150 F.3d 1003, 1009 (9th Cir.1998). Moreover, the district court properly ordered that if Providence makes any further claim arising from the emergency medical services rendered in August and September, 2006, Kaiser will be required to reimburse Samano for such a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">2. It is not clear, however, that Samano had the opportunity to move for attorney\u2019s fees before judgment was entered against him on April 1, 2010. In the judgment, the court ordered each party to bear its own attorney\u2019s fees and costs, without explanation. The court\u2019s order granting summary judgment states that Kaiser originally erroneously denied Samano plan benefits, but during the pendency of the litigation, changed its coverage position and paid the discounted sum to Providence. Samano \u201cneed not be a \u2018prevailing party\u2019 to be eligible for an attorney\u2019s fees award under \u00a7 1132(g)(1),\u201d <em>Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co.,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014,\u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2149, 2156, 176 L.Ed.2d 998 (2010), but \u201cmust show \u2018some degree of success on the merits\u2019 before a court may award attorney\u2019s fees,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2158. Because he did not have the opportunity to timely move for fees, Samano did not waive his right to them and he may be entitled to a fees award. <em>See San Diego Police Officers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v. San Diego City Emps.\u2019 Ret. Sys., </em>568 F.3d 725, 742-43 (9th Cir.2009). We therefore vacate the order splitting fees and costs and remand to the district court to address Samano\u2019s claim to them. We express no opinion on the merits of the request for attorney\u2019s fees. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b617-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
