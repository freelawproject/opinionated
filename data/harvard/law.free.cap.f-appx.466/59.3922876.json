May 29, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Ndoci\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely, as she filed it more than seven months after the BIA\u2019s order upholding the immigration judge\u2019s underlying merits decision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Although the time limitation does not apply to a motion to reopen seeking to apply for asylum \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing,\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii), substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s finding that Ndoci did not demonstrate a change in country conditions in Albania.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The evidence submitted indicated a continuation, from the time of Ndoci\u2019s initial application to the time of her motion to reopen, of police abuses, violence against women, electoral deficiencies, divisiveness between the Socialist Party and the Democratic Party, and the control of local authorities in Tirana by the Socialist Party. Because the evidence demonstrated a continuation of the same conditions, the BIA reasonably concluded that there had not been a change in conditions. <em>See Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 169 (2d Cir.2008) (holding that when the agency explicitly considers relevant evidence of country conditions in evaluating a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard). There is no indication that the BIA failed to consider any evidence. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA </em>437 F.3d 270, 274-75 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
