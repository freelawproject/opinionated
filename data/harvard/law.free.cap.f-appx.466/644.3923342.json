R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">In these consolidated appeals, Winston Alexander Aarons appeals from the 46-month sentence imposed following his guilty-plea conviction for being a deported alien found unlawfully in the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, and from the eight-month sentence imposed following revocation of supervised release. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-16\">Aarons contends that his 46-month sentence is substantively unreasonable under <em>United States v. Amezeua-Vasquez, </em>567 F.3d 1050 (9th Cir.2009), given the staleness of his prior conviction, and his subsequent lack of drug trafficking convictions. The bottom-of-the-Guidelines sentence is substantively reasonable in light of the totality of the circumstances and the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Valeneiar-Barragan, </em>608 F.3d 1103, 1108-09 (9th Cir.2010) (district court did not abuse its discretion by applying 16-level enhancement where section 3553(a) factors supported within-Guidelines sentence). Further, the district court did not abuse its discretion by declining to vary downward on the basis of the proposed amendments to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b). <em>See United States v. Ruiz-Apolonio, </em>657 F.3d 907, 917-18 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">Aarons also contends that his eight-month sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court declined to make it a fully concurrent sentence. The bottom-of-the-Guidelines, partially concurrent sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1182 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
