We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-23\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Minns\u2019 motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(1). First, the district court applied the correct legal rule\u2014the four-factor test established by <em>Pioneer Investment Services Co. v. Brunswick Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>507 U.S. 380, 395, 113 S.Ct. 1489, 123 L.Ed.2d 74 (1993). <em>See Brandt v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co., </em>653 F.3d 1108, 1110 (9th Cir.2011) (setting out the abuse of discretion standard of review); <em>Bateman v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>231 F.3d 1220, 1223-24 (9th Cir.2000) (applying the four <em>Pioneer </em>factors to a motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-24\">Second, the district court\u2019s application of the <em>Pioneer </em>factors was not illogical, implausible or without support in inferences that may be drawn from the facts in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>record. <em>See Brandt, </em>658 F.3d at 1110. The district court reasonably concluded that the prejudice, length <em>of </em>delay and reason for delay factors favored denial of Minns\u2019 motion. Although Rule 60(b)(1) can cover negligence on the part of counsel, <em>see Bateman, </em>231 F.3d at 1223, \u201cignorance of the rules[ ] or mistakes construing the rules do not usually constitute \u2018excusable\u2019 neglect,\u201d <em>Pincay v. Andrews, </em>389 F.3d 853, 857 (9th Cir.2004) (en banc) (quoting <em>Pioneer, </em>507 U.S. at 392, 113 S.Ct. 1489) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Casey v. Albertson\u2019s Inc., </em>362 F.3d 1254, 1260 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cAs a general rule, parties are bound by the actions of their lawyers, and alleged attorney malpractice does not usually provide a basis to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1).\u201d). <em>Bateman </em>is distinguishable because, there, plaintiff\u2019s counsel \u201cwrote to the court twelve days after it granted summary judgment and filed his Rule 60(b)(1) motion a little more than one month after the court denied his request to rescind the judgment.\u201d <em>Bateman, </em>231 F.3d at 1225. Here, by contrast, Minns filed her motion 11 months after the district court\u2019s entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The district court also did not abuse its discretion by denying Minns\u2019 motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(6). Although we have held that gross negligence on the part of counsel can justify relief under this provision, <em>see Lal v. California, </em>610 F.3d 518, 524-26 (9th Cir.2010), Minns has neither invoked this authority nor made a showing of gross negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b643-25\"> xhiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
