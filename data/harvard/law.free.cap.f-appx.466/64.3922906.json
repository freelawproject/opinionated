Jun. 10, 2011), <em>aff'g </em>No. A088 740 922 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 2, 2009). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case. The applicable standards of review are well-established. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Xiu Xia Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 165-66 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-25\">The agency reasonably found that the harm Huang alleged \u2014 being attacked and punched by schoolchildren when he was eight or nine years old and his overnight flight to the jungle \u2014 is insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>rise to the level of persecution. <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir.2006) Huang\u2019s alleged harm did not occur while he was detained or his liberty was restricted in any way, did not require medical attention, and did not cause any lasting physical effect. <em>See Jian Qiu Liu v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 820, 822 (2d Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">As Huang has failed to demonstrate past persecution or allege any additional basis for a well-founded fear of persecution, the agency did not err in finding he had not demonstrated an objective likelihood of future persecution, particularly given the ability of Huang and his family to remain in Malaysia for roughly thirty years without harm. <em>Jian Xing Huang v. INS, 421 </em>F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (a fear is not objectively reasonable if it lacks \u201csolid support\u201d in the record and is merely \u201cspeculative at best\u201d); <em>see also Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999). Finally, because Huang was unable to show the objective likelihood of future persecution needed to make out a withholding of removal claim, he is necessarily unable to meet the higher standard to succeed on a claim for CAT relief. <em>Paul v. Gonzales, 444 F.3d </em>148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34.1(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
