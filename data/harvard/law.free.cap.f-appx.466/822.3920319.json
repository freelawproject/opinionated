(collectively \u201cHuffmaster\u201d) in a wrongful death action she brought as the surviving spouse of Roger Earl Lee (\u201cMr. Lee\u201d). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-16\">Huffmaster was engaged as an independent contractor by The Clorox International Company (\u201cClorox\u201d) to provide security services at Clorox\u2019s Tampa facility. Clorox\u2019s facility handles hazardous chemicals and has been designated a \u201cCritical Infrastructure Site\u201d by the Department of Homeland Security; it is considered a possible target for terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-17\">Clorox hired National Freight, Inc. to transport a load of bleach from Clorox\u2019s Houston facility to its Tampa facility. National Freight, Inc. engaged Mr. Lee, who worked as an independent contractor, to accomplish the transport.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-18\">On 22 February 2008, Mr. Lee arrived at Clorox\u2019s Tampa facility just before 4:00 a.m.; his scheduled delivery time was 10:00 a.m. The security guard, a Huffmaster employee, advised Mr. Lee that he could not enter the facility before its scheduled opening at 6:30 a.m. Clorox\u2019s policy \u2014 which Huffmaster was responsible for enforcing \u2014 was to refuse entry onto Clorox\u2019s premises during non-business hours to truckers and other non-employees. Mr. Lee was aware of Clorox\u2019s policy of denying middle-of-the-night admittance from a previous delivery he had made just two months earlier. The security guard advised that Mr. Lee could park under a nearby highway overpass until the facility opened. Mr. Lee told the security guard that he would prefer to park on the street outside of Clorox\u2019s property. The security guard offered no objection to Mr. Lee\u2019s choice to park on public property adjacent to Clorox\u2019s facility. At approximately 4:30 a.m., while Mr. Lee was asleep in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>truck, an unknown assailant broke into the truck and fatally shot Mr. Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Plaintiff filed this wrongful death action against Huffmaster; Plaintiff argued that under Florida law Huffmaster owed Mr. Lee a duty of reasonable care to prevent foreseeable harm from third-party misconduct and a duty to warn of known dangerous conditions in the area immediately outside Clorox\u2019s facility. Huffmaster countered that Plaintiffs negligence-based claims fail as a matter of law because no duty was owed Mr. Lee by Huffmaster, and Huffmaster did not proximately cause Mr. Lee\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Under Florida law, \u201c[t]he general rule is that a party has no legal duty to prevent the misconduct of third persons----Florida courts have long been loathe to impose liability based on a defendant\u2019s failure to control the conduct of a third party.\u201d <em>KM. ex rel. D.M. v. Publix Super Markets, Inc., </em>895 So.2d 1114, 1117 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). But exceptions to the general rule exist; Plaintiff argues a number of these exceptions operated to impose a duty on Huffmaster.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">A duty may be imposed where the defendant\u2019s conduct creates a foreseeable zone of risk. <em>See McCain v. Fla. Power Corp., </em>593 So.2d 500, 503 (Fla.1992) (\u201cWhere a defendant\u2019s conduct creates a <em>foreseeable zone of risk, </em>the law generally will recognize a duty placed upon defendant either to lessen the risk or see that sufficient precautions are taken to protect others from the harm that the risk poses.\u201d). Plaintiff argues that in the light of the high crime rate in the neighborhood surrounding Clorox\u2019s facility and the inadequacy of the lighting in that area, Huff-master\u2019s refusal to allow truckers early entry into its facility created a foreseeable zone of risk. But Huffmaster\u2019s denial of entry into Clorox\u2019s facility when that facility was closed did not create directly a foreseeable risk of harm. As the district court noted \u2014 and Plaintiff does not allege to the contrary \u2014 Huffmaster was not an active participant in the criminal act causing Lee\u2019s death; no evidence was proffered that the high crime rate near the Clorox plant was related to the delivery entrance policy; and no evidence suggested that Huffmaster controlled access to the public street where the crime occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-9\">We can speculate that had Mr. Lee been allowed early entry into the facility his tragic death likely would have been avoided. But that does not mean Huffmaster\u2019s acts created or controlled the foreseeable risk. Clorox\u2019s entry policy as enforced by Huffmaster was known to Mr. Lee when he chose nevertheless to arrive at the facility hours before it opened knowing he would be denied entry. Huffmaster had no control over Mr. Lee\u2019s rejection of the security guard\u2019s suggestion that he park at a nearby highway overpass or over his decision to park on a public street adjacent to Clorox\u2019s facility. That the public premises where Mr. Lee parked were inadequately lighted represents no breach by Huffmaster. And Huffmaster had no control over the criminal who took Mr. Lee\u2019s life. In short, Huffmaster took no affirmative step nor failed to take a step that directly and necessarily created a risk of foreseeable harm. <em>See Demelus v. King Motor Co. of Fort Lauderdale, </em>24 So.3d 759, 761 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2009) (\u201cTo impose a duty, it is not enough that a risk merely exists or that a particular risk is foreseeable; rather, the defendant\u2019s conduct must <em>create </em>or <em>control </em>the risk before liability may be imposed\u201d); <em>Aguila v. Hilton, Inc., </em>878 So.2d 392, 396 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">The district court also took issue with Plaintiff on the foreseeability of the trage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>dy that befell Mr. Lee. Although it appears to be widely acknowledged that the Clorox plant was in a high crime area, no truck driver had ever been assaulted, shot, robbed or harassed in the area around the facility. Plaintiff failed to show that the negligent act of which Plaintiff complained had so frequently caused the same injury that the same result could be expected so as to support imposition of a legal duty. See <em>Palm Beach-Broward Medical Imaging Center, Inc. v. Continental Grain Co., </em>715 So.2d 343, 345 (FIa.Dist.Ct.App.1998); see also <em>Biglen v. Florida Power &amp; Light Co., </em>910 So.2d 405, 408 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005) (\u201cforeseeability [is] the polestar to finding both the existence of a legal duty and its scope.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Plaintiff also argues that a special relationship existed between Huffmaster and Mr. Lee \u2014 that of landowner or business \u2014 invitee-that gave rise to a duty to prevent harm caused by third persons. Florida has adopted the Restatement (Second) of Tort \u00a7 315 (1965) which states: \u201c[t]here is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm ... unless ... a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.\u201d <em>See KM. ex rel. D.M., </em>895 So.2d at 1117. But as the district court set out, if any special relationship could be found to exist, it was between Clorox and Mr. Lee not Huffmaster and Mr. Lee. Although we accept that Florida law continues to evolve on the special relationships that might give rise to a duty, <em>see Janis v. Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada, Inc., </em>370 F.Supp.2d 1226, 1230 (M.D.Fla.2005), the record here fails as a matter or law to show a special relationship that supports imposition of a duty upon Huffmaster to prevent off-premises third-party harm to Mr. Lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">Plaintiff also argues that a duty to protect arose from Huffmaster\u2019s actual or constructive control over the site where the tragedy occurred. Where the defendant controls the \u201c(1) the instrumentality; (2) the premises on which the tort was committed; or (3) the tortfeasor,\u201d <em>Daly v. Denny\u2019s, Inc., </em>694 So.2d 775, 777 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1997), Florida recognizes a duty to protect against third-party torts. <em>Id. </em>But Mr. Lee\u2019s murder occurred on public property; it did not occur on premises owned or controlled by Huffmaster. We agree with the district court that no evidence was proffered that Huffmaster had actual or constructive control over the public street where the tragedy occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">Plaintiffs last argument is that Huff-master\u2019s superior knowledge about crime rates in the area surrounding Clorox\u2019s facility created a duty to warn Mr. Lee about the danger to which he exposed himself. Again, however, the absence of a special relationship between Huffmaster and Mr. Lee is fatal to Plaintiffs claim. We are cited to no Florida case where a duty to warn was recognized but no special relationship existed to give rise to that duty. And so Plaintiffs reliance on <em>Shurben v. Dollar Rent-A-Car, </em>676 So.2d 467 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1996), where a customer-rental agency relationship existed, is misplaced. <em>See T.W. v. Regal Trace, Ltd., </em>908 So.2d 499, 504 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2005) (if no special relationship is shown, no duty to warn arises; general rule of no liability for third-party criminal acts applies unless another exception to the general rule may be invoked).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
