Rakoff, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b75-17\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b75-18\">Appellant Peter Shue, proceeding pro <em>se, </em>appeals the from district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his complaint <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A0H\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e). <em>See Giano v. Goord, </em>250 F.3d 146, 149-50 (2d Cir.2001). Here, Shue\u2019s constitutional claims against federal officials are properly analyzed as claims pursuant to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), rather than 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Nevertheless, we may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment solely on the ground that Shue\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). <em>See Boy Scouts of Am. v. Wyman, </em>335 F.3d 80, 90 (2d Cir.2003) (\u201c[W]e may affirm the judgment of the district court on any ground appearing in the record.\u201d). Because \u00a7 1983 actions and <em>Bivens </em>actions \u201cshare the same \u2018practicalities of litigation,\u2019 federal courts have typically incorporated \u00a7 1983 law into <em>Bivens </em>actions,\u201d including the law articulated by the Supreme Court in <em>Heck. Tavarez v. Reno, </em>54 F.3d 109, 110 (2d Cir.1995). As noted by the district court, the <em>Heck </em>Court held that a \u00a7 1983 action for monetary damages is not cognizable if a decision in the plaintiffs favor would necessarily invalidate a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>conviction that has not been reversed on appeal or otherwise overturned. <em>See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. In this case, success on Shue\u2019s claim that he was tried and convicted with a falsified superceding indictment that was never presented to a Grand Jury would invalidate his 1996 federal conviction, <em>see Stirone v. United States, </em>361 U.S. 212, 218-19, 80 S.Ct. 270, 4 L.Ed.2d 252 (1960), as would success on his claim that the Government withheld exculpatory and material impeachment evidence at trial, <em>see Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153-54, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972). Because Shue\u2019s 1996 conviction has not been overturned, his <em>Bivens </em>claims are subject to dismissal under <em>Heck. See Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487,114 S.Ct. 2364. In light of this conclusion, we decline to reach the district court\u2019s alternative analysis of Shue\u2019s constitutional claims under the applicable statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">Finally, there is no merit to Shue\u2019s argument that Judge Seybert was subject to recusal for bias solely because she presided over his 1996 trial. \u201c[Ojpinions formed by the judge on the basis of facts introduced or events occurring in the course of the current proceedings, or of prior proceedings, do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">We have considered Shue\u2019s other arguments on appeal and have found them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
