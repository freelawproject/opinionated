The district court granted him a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) as to the following issue: \u201c[Wlhether \u2018actual innocence\u2019 applies to a career offender sentence that has been final for nine years after a plea agreement that waived an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-13\">Stevens pled guilty in 1999 to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine and marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1). The offense involved at least 50 grams of crack cocaine. He was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment. In 2001, we dismissed his direct appeal on the ground that his plea agreement included a valid and enforceable appeal waiver.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-16\">In October 2010, Stevens filed <em>pro se </em>a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, in which he claimed that he was actually innocent of the career-offender designation. One of the predicate offenses for the designation was his conviction in Florida state court for possession of cannabis. He asserted that the U.S. Supreme Court case <em>Salinas v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 188, 126 S.Ct. 1675, 164 L.Ed.2d 364 (2006), had clarified that a simple possession offense cannot be used as a predicate \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d for career-offender designation. Thus, he argued that he had never been a career offender and that he was actually innocent of the career-offender designation. He further contended that he had not raised this claim at sentencing because <em>Salinas </em>was not available at that time and that his actual-innocence claim could overcome the procedural default and the untimeliness of his \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-17\">The government responded that (1) Stevens\u2019s motion was time-barred, as his conviction had become final in 2001 and the <em>Salinas </em>decision had been issued in 2006; (2) the claim was procedurally barred because he had not raised it at sentencing or alleged cause and prejudice or a fundamental miscarriage of justice that would excuse the default; and (3) the claim was without merit because <em>Salinas </em>had not been given retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-18\">The district court acknowledged that Stevens\u2019s prior conviction might not support the career-offender designation, but it found that Stevens had procedurally de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>faulted the claim by failing to raise it at sentencing or by timely filing his \u00a7 2255 motion. It noted that <em>Salinas </em>had not been given retroactive effect, that this Court had yet to hold that an \u201cactual innocence\u201d argument could apply to a career-offender designation, and that he had not alleged other grounds for equitable tolling. Accordingly, it dismissed the \u00a7 2255 motion as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Stevens timely moved for reconsideration. The court denied reconsideration but granted Stevens\u2019s motion for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In a \u00a7 2255 proceeding, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and factual findings for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Relief under \u00a7 2255 \u201cis reserved for transgressions of constitutional rights and for that narrow compass of other injury that could not have been raised [o]n direct appeal and would, if condoned, result in a complete miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Lynn, </em>365 F.3d at 1232 (quotation marks omitted). If the defendant could have raised a challenge to his sentence during the criminal proceedings but did not do so, he is procedurally barred from raising it in a \u00a7 2255 motion unless he can show cause and prejudice for the default or actual innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">A \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction became final, \u201cthe date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,\u201d or other events not applicable here. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f). The limitations period may be equitably tolled \u201cif [the movant] shows (1) that he has been pursuing his rights diligently, and (2) that some extraordinary circumstance stood in his way and prevented timely filing.\u201d <em>San Martin v. McNeil, </em>633 F.3d 1257, 1267 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied,</em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 132 S.Ct. 158, 181 L.Ed.2d 73 (2011) (quotation marks omitted). A court also may consider an untimely \u00a7 2255 motion \u201cif, by refusing to consider the [motion] for untimeliness, the court thereby would endorse a \u2018fundamental miscarriage of justice\u2019 because it would require that an individual who is actually innocent remain imprisoned.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1267-68. The actual innocence exception has been applied to actual innocence for the crime of conviction and actual innocence of a capital sentence. <em>McKay v. United States, </em>657 F.3d 1190, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">The actual innocence exception is a narrow exception that requires factual, not merely legal, innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 1197-98. We have not yet determined whether the actual innocence exception can be applied to noncapital sentences, and in <em>McKay </em>we declined to make such a determination because the appellant had alleged only legal innocence. <em>Id. </em>at 1198. Specifically, that petitioner claimed that his conviction-for carrying a concealed weapon had been misclassified as a crime of violence to wrongly support a \u00a7 4B1.1 sentence enhancement. <em>Id. </em>at 1194-95. He sought to be resentenced without the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement in light of that misclassification. <em>Id. </em>at 1194. We rejected the petitioner\u2019s claim because the alleged misclassification of a crime was a legal argument, and the petitioner did not assert that he was factually innocent of carrying a concealed weapon. <em>Id. </em>at 1199. \u201cWe thus decline[d] to extend the actual innocence of sentence exception to claims of legal innocence of a predicate offense justifying an enhanced sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Even assuming <em>Salinas </em>applies retroactively, Mr. Stevens\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>is untimely because he only had one year to file his motion from the date <em>Salinas </em>was decided in 2006. <em>See Dodd v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1273, 1281 (11th Cir.2004) (interpreting limitations period in \u00a7 2255(f)(3) begins to run on the date the Supreme Court recognizes a new right and closes one year later). Here, Mr. Stevens filed his \u00a7 2255 motion in October 2010, almost four years after <em>Salinas </em>was decided. Thus, his motion was untimely filed. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(f)(3). He also has not alleged cause and prejudice for purposes of equitable tolling. <em>See San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267. Furthermore, his substantive claim for relief from the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement could have been raised at the time of sentencing, and, thus, is procedurally barred. <em>See Lynn, </em>365 F.3d at 1232; <em>Young v. United States, </em>936 F.2d 533, 538 (11th Cir.1991) (holding, prior to Stevens\u2019s conviction and sentencing, that a state drug conviction must contain a trafficking element in order to qualify as a \u201ccontrolled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2). Thus, both the district court\u2019s ability to review the motion despite the statute of limitations and Stevens\u2019s ability to overcome the procedural bar to his claim depend on whether he is actually innocent of the \u00a7 4B1.1 career-offender enhancement. <em>See San Martin, </em>633 F.3d at 1267-68; <em>Lynn, </em>365 F.3d at 1234.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The actual innocence exception is inapplicable in this case. Like the petitioner in <em>McKay, </em>Stevens asserts that his conviction for possession of cannabis can no longer support a career offender enhancement under \u00a7 4B1.1. Specifically, Stevens asserts that his conviction for possession of cannabis cannot support the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement because: (1) that conviction no longer qualifies as a controlled substances offense, and (2) the Florida statute under which he was convicted is unconstitutional. Significantly, Stevens does not assert that he did not commit possession of cannabis. Because Stevens\u2019s arguments center on the legal classification of the crime of possession of cannabis, his claim is one of legal, not factual, innocence. <em>See McKay, </em>657 F.3d at 1199. In <em>McKay, </em>we \u201cdecline[d] to extend the actual innocence of sentence exception to\u201d such legal claims. <em>Id. </em>Thus, Stevens has not excused the procedural deficiencies facing his motion to vacate, and we affirm the dismissal of his motion to vacate. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of Stevens\u2019s motion to vacate.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-14\">. The plea agreement waived only Stevens\u2019s right to appeal his sentence, not his right to pursue a collateral attack.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
