At issue instead is an employee\u2019s termination following a company\u2019s internal investigation into an allegation of workplace sexual harassment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>The plaintiff here, though, was neither the employee that complained of the sexual harassment nor the employee allegedly responsible for that harassment. Rather, Plaintiff-Appellant Janet Brush (\u201cBrush\u201d) was one of the employees tasked with conducting the internal investigation. Defendant-Appellee Sears Holding Corporation (\u201cSears\u201d) terminated her soon after.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brush subsequently filed suit against Sears, alleging she was terminated in retaliation for certain actions she took as an investigator of the sexual harassment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Upon consideration of Sears\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the district court found Brush could not support a Title VII retaliation claim. Among the deficiencies the district court identified in Brush\u2019s claim was the fact that she was not engaged in \u201cprotected activity\u201d as defined by Title VII and therefore her subsequent termination could not be actionable as retaliation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\u201cThis court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same legal standards used by the district court.\u201d <em>Galvez v. Bruce, </em>552 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate where \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a); <em>see also Swisher Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Schafer, </em>550 F.3d 1046, 1050 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cIn making this determination, we ... draw[ ] all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\u201d <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets of Fla., Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir.1999). Of course, the nonmoving party must go beyond the pleadings to present affirmative evidence demonstrating that there is a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 252, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). However, a plaintiffs failure to support an essential element of her case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial and requires the district court to grant summary judgment for the defendant. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Janet Brush worked for Sears or its affiliates, off and on, for over fifteen years. In her most recent stint, Brush was employed from approximately 2000 to November 20, 2007. Beginning in 2006, Brush accepted a position as a Loss Prevention District Coach. The district she oversaw contained 20 stores. Her job was to minimize varieties of risk to the company, including losses arising from theft, as well as to protect Sears\u2019 assets, including its employees. In that capacity, she interacted with numerous Sears employees during the course of her employment. Her immediate boss was David Pearson, who served as Sears\u2019 Regional Loss Prevention Coach.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-12\">During Brush\u2019s employment with Sears, Sears had noted several deficiencies relating to Brush\u2019s work performance. These deficiencies first became apparent at the end of 2006. Early the next year, Sears placed Brush on a Performance Improve<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>ment Plan (\u201cPIP\u201d) to address these deficiencies. Although Brush\u2019s PIP plan was extended several months to enable her to meet the relevant criteria, by all accounts Brush completed her PIP on or around September 20, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Only a few days before her completion of the PIP plan, on or around September 15, 2007, Brush received a telephone call from an Assistant Store Coach. The Assistant Store Coach, whom we refer to simply as \u201cMrs. Doe,\u201d informed Brush that she was being sexually harassed by her Store Coach. Brush notified Sears of the allegation. Sears suspended the Store Coach accused of harassment and directed Brush and another Sears employee, Scott Reuter, to meet with Mrs. Doe to investigate further. They did so, but both Brush and Reuter felt that she was not entirely forthcoming during their interview. Reuter and Brush then determined that Brush should meet with Mrs. Doe alone \u201cto see if she wanted to add anything to her prior interview.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 40. Brush did so, at which time Mrs. Doe informed her that she had been raped multiple times by the Store Coach. However, Mrs. Doe asked that neither her husband nor the police be informed of the rape. Brush notified Reuter of what Mrs. Doe told her, and they subsequently reported the same to Sears. Brush \u201cstated that [Sears] need[ed] to contact the Orange County Police.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 48. Sears declined, citing the investigation\u2019s incomplete status and Mrs. Doe\u2019s own desire not to involve law enforcement. Sears, however, terminated the employment of the Store Coach, the man who Mrs. Doe said harassed and raped her. Brush nonetheless continued to urge the reporting of the alleged rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">On November 20, 2007, Sears terminated Brush\u2019s employment, citing her violation of Sears\u2019 policy relating to the investigation of sexual harassment claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> One week later, Brush filed a charge with the EEOC, alleging sex discrimination and retaliation. The EEOC issued a finding that there was reasonable cause to support Brush\u2019s retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Nearly two years later, Brush filed suit against Sears, alleging that she was dismissed in retaliation for \u201cher opposition to the nature and performance of the [sexual harassment] investigation.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 5. Specifically, her Complaint alleges that she was terminated because \u201cshe uncovered that [Sears] had negligently allowed three forcible rapes to occur on its premises and did nothing about it,\u201d Compl. \u00b6 59; because \u201cshe raised rape issues that would have been kept hidden if she had allowed Mr. Reuter to conduct the interviews,\u201d Compl. \u00b6 60; \u201cbecause of her participation in the investigation and her opposition to the way [Sears] was conducting the investigation,\u201d Compl. \u00b6 61; and because \u201cshe was considered a trouble-maker and whistleblower,\u201d Compl. \u00b6 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Through discovery, Brush produced evidence that showed she \u201copposed the alleged sexual battery [experienced by Mrs. Doe], explained [to her employer, Sears] that the seriousness of these allegations required police intervention, and that she wanted to call the Orange County Police.\u201d Appellant Br. at 8. Furthermore, deposition testimony demonstrated that Brush was \u201cvery adamant ... that the authorities should be involved because Sears was not capable of investigating this type of criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted). Finally, Brush also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>provided some circumstantial evidence that her termination may have been related to her involvement in the internal investigation conducted by Sears. In particular, she cited a declaration by her former boss, Pearson, who stated that he \u201cbelieve[d] Ms. Brush was terminated because of her involvement in uncovering and opposing rapes that took place on [Sears\u2019] property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Nonetheless, subsequently Sears moved for summary judgment, contending that Brush could not establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation and that there was no genuine issue of material fact showing that Sears\u2019 decision to terminate Brush was pretextual. The district court agreed. Brush now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision makes it unlawful for an employer to discriminate against an employee \u201cbecause [s]he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice ..., or because [s]he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d <em>McCann v. Tillman, </em>526 F.3d 1370, 1375 (11th Cir.2008) (alterations in original) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a)). As noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., </em>555 U.S. 271, 274, 129 S.Ct. 846, 172 L.Ed.2d 650 (2009), the two clauses of the anti-retaliation provision are known as the \u201cparticipation clause\u201d and the \u201copposition clause.\u201d Although Brush\u2019s allegations encompassed both means of retaliation, she conceded before the district court that she may only recover under the opposition clause in this instance. <em>See EEOC v. Total Sys. Svcs., Inc., </em>221 F.3d 1171, 1174 (11th Cir.2000) (prohibiting recovery under participation clause where no EEOC complaint was filed prior to termination).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore, we need only address her claim insomuch as it pertains to Brush\u2019s opposition to an allegedly unlawful employment practice by Sears. <em>See also Little v. United Techs. Carrier Transicold Div., </em>103 F.3d 956, 960 (11th Cir.1997) (noting also that plaintiff must have an objectively reasonable belief that the employer engaged in an unlawful employment practice).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">Brush\u2019s case rests upon her belief that her opposition to rape and Sears\u2019 handling of Mrs. Doe\u2019s allegations are actionable under Title VII. Under the framework provided by <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp.,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Brush must \u201ccarry the initial burden under the statute of establishing a prima facie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>case.\u201d <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp., </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. We need only turn to the remaining stages of the burden-shifting inquiry under <em>McDonnell Douglas</em>\u2014articulation of \u201csome legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason\u201d by the defendant for the employment action, <em>id. </em>at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, and showing of pretext by the plaintiff regarding defendant\u2019s stated reasons for the employment action, <em>id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817\u2014if a <em>prima facie </em>case is established.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">To make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of a retaliation claim, a plaintiff must demonstrate that (1) she engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) she suffered a materially adverse employment action; and (3) there was a causal link between the protected activity and the subsequent materially adverse employment action. <em>Butler v. Ala. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>536 F.3d 1209, 1212 (11th Cir.2008). It is the first prong, protected activity, which we now address.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Quite simply, Brush\u2019s disagreement with the way in which Sears conducted its internal investigation into Mrs. Doe\u2019s allegations does not constitute protected activity. As required by the explicit language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a), to qualify as \u201cprotected activity,\u201d a plaintiffs opposition must be to a \u201cpractice made unlawful by [Title VII.]\u201d Since there is no evidence of Brush\u2019s opposition to any unlawful practice here, it follows that Brush can support no claim under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Although she seeks to predicate her claim for retaliation upon Mrs. Doe\u2019s claims of sexual harassment and rape, Brush was neither the aggrieved nor the accused party in the underlying allegations. Instead, she was one of the Sears employees tasked with conducting the internal investigation. As such, her claims relate not to Mrs. Doe\u2019s allegations, but instead to the procedures of the internal investigation conducted by Sears. Although we have found no published Eleventh Circuit cases regarding whether such a basis is a viable foundation for a Title VII retaliation claim, <em>cf. Entrekin v. City of Panama City, Fla., </em>376 Fed.Appx. 987, 994 (11th Cir.2010) (per curiam) (unpublished case disallowing recovery under similar circumstances), certainly internal investigations alone do not constitute discriminatory practices. <em>See, e.g., Baldwin v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Ala., </em>480 F.3d 1287, 1304 (11th Cir.2007) (detailing type of investigative procedures acceptable under Title VII). Nor do federal courts mandate the procedures that are required under such circumstances. <em>See Adams v. O\u2019Reilly Automotive, Inc., </em>538 F.3d 926, 930 (8th Cir.2008) (\u201cFederal courts, however, are not in the business of micromanaging or second-guessing companies\u2019 internal investigations.\u201d); <em>see also Entrekin, </em>376 Fed.Appx. at 994 (\u201cTitle VII does not ... establish requirements for an employer\u2019s internal procedures for receiving sexual harassment complaints, or even require that employers must have an internal procedure for receiving such complaints.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">Nonetheless, Brush argues that an investigative manager\u2019s role in reporting a Title VII violation necessarily qualifies as a \u201cprotected activity\u201d relating to a discriminatory practice. Reply Br. at 5 (\u201c[W]hen an employee communicates a belief that her employer has engaged in employment discrimination, that communication virtually always constitutes protected activity.\u201d). In support, Brush cites <em>Crawford. </em>In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Coui't held that an employee that responded to an inquiry about whether she had ever witnessed \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d from a specific employee was protected by Title VII. <em>Crawford, </em>555 U.S. at 280, 129 S.Ct. 846. In so finding, the Court rejected the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reasoning that the opposition clause of Title VII \u201cdemands active, consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>\u2018opposing\u2019 activities to warrant ... protection against retaliation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 275, 129 S.Ct. 846 (citing <em>Crawford v. Metropolitan Government of Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tenn., </em>211 Fed.Appx. 373, 373 (6th Cir.2006)). Instead, the Court stated that the <em>Crawford </em>plaintiffs opposition was no less actionable because she had been asked about sexual harassment rather than having volunteered similar allegations. <em>Crawford, </em>555 U.S. at 277-78, 129 S.Ct. 846.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Brush would have us extend <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>reasoning not just to those directly impacted by workplace discrimination but to all individuals involved in the investigation of that discrimination, no matter how far distant. Although we have not yet passed on the transitive property of a Title VII claim, other circuits have by creating what is known as the \u201cmanager rule.\u201d In essence, the \u201cmanager rule\u201d holds that a management employee that, in the course of her normal job performance, disagrees with or opposes the actions of an employer does not engage in \u201cprotected activity.\u201d <em>See McKenzie v. Renberg\u2019s Inc., </em>94 F.3d 1478 (10th Cir.1996); <em>Hagan v. Echostar Satellite, L.L.C., </em>529 F.3d 617 (5th Cir.2008) (same). Instead, to qualify as \u201cprotected activity\u201d an employee must cross the line from being an employee \u201cperforming her job ... to an employee lodging a personal complaint.\u201d <em>McKenzie, </em>94 F.3d at 1486. While Brush argues that <em>Crawford </em>has foreclosed the \u201cmanager rule,\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we cannot agree. <em>Crawford </em>pertained only to whether the reporting of a harassment claim was covered by Title VII where the reporting was solicited rather than volunteered. <em>Crawford, </em>555 U.S. at 277-78, 129 S.Ct. 846. It did not address whether a disinterested party to a harassment claim could use that harassment claim as its own basis for a Title VII action. Accordingly, we find the \u201cmanager rule\u201d persuasive and a viable prohibition against certain individuals recovering under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Considering the facts adduced by the parties in light of the \u201cmanager rule,\u201d there can be no dispute that Brush acted solely as a manager here. In her capacity as an investigator of Mrs. Doe\u2019s sexual harassment claim, Brush informed Sears of Mrs. Doe\u2019s allegations, investigated those allegations, and reported the results of her investigation to Sears. Brush\u2019s job responsibilities involved exactly the type of actions that Brush took on Mrs. Doe\u2019s behalf. There is simply no evidence in the record that Brush was asserting any rights under Title VII or that she took any action adverse to the company during the investigation. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1486-87, 129 S.Ct. 846. Disagreement with internal procedures does not equate with \u201cprotected activity\u201d opposing discriminatory practices. Under such circumstances, the breadth of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>application to individuals who suffered workplace discrimination is not transferable to the entirety of the manage<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>ment string that might review any such allegation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The evidence in this record shows that Brush\u2019s opposition was to Sears\u2019 failure to immediately summon law enforcement and a more general \u201copposition] to the grave forcible sex [alleged by Mrs. Doe].\u201d Brush, however, has not demonstrated how these actions were criminally unlawful on the part of Sears. She has cited no state or federal law that would have mandated Sears take some action other that what it took. Sears fired the accused offender. Nor has Brush demonstrated that Mrs. Doe in this instance wanted her claims reported to the police. In fact, it is undisputed that Mrs. Doe informed Brush and Sears that she did not want either the police or her husband informed of what happened to her. Under these circumstances, then, it is impossible for Brush to have had a reasonable belief that Sears\u2019 actions were unlawful. <em>Cf. Little, </em>103 F.3d 956 at 960. Therefore, Brush\u2019s deposition testimony that she was \u201copposed [to] the way that Sears Holding took care of our associates, took care of the investigation\u201d simply refutes any claim that she was engaged in protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">As a final matter, to the extent that Brush predicates her argument of unlawful employment practices upon the alleged rapes by the Store Coach, her argument necessarily fails. She conceded both before the district court and at oral argument that Sears is not tolerant of rape and, in fact, did not tolerate it in this instance. Nonetheless, she seeks to found her opposition upon her principled stance against rape generally, and rape in the workplace particularly. However, opposition against a general type of criminal behavior does not, without some connection to the employer, constitute the type of opposition to an unlawful employment practice that was contemplated by Congress in passing Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Therefore, we echo the words of <em>Entrekin: </em>\u201cbecause [Brush\u2019s] complaint involved the adequacy of [Sears\u2019] internal procedure for receiving sexual harassment complaints, rather than an employment practice that Title VII declares to be unlawful,\u201d <em>Entrekin, 376 </em>Fed.Appx. at 994, her criticisms do not relate to unlawful activity. And, since unlawful activity is the <em>sine qua non </em>of \u201cprotected activity\u201d as defined by Title VII, Brush cannot satisfy the first requirement of a <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Given our holding that Brush cannot satisfy the first factor of the three-part <em>prima facie </em>case for retaliation, we need not address the district court\u2019s other bases for granting summary judgment to Sears. In particular, we decline to address the evidence of Brush\u2019s PIP; Sears\u2019 proffered legitimate, non-discriminatory basis for Brush\u2019s termination; or Brush\u2019s subsequent argument of pretext under the burden-shifting inquiry under <em>McDonnell Douglas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Having studied the record along with the parties\u2019 briefs, and entertained oral argument, we find that Brush did not engage in statutorily protected activity and therefore cannot support a claim for retaliation under Title VII. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Defendant-Appellee Sears Holding Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-10\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2; <em>see also McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

However, for the sake of clarity with respect to the named defendant here, we refer to Defendant-Appellee as \"Sears.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-5\">. Specifically, Sears alleges Brush violated the sexual harassment policy in meeting with the complainant alone, in suggesting to the employee that she had been raped without asking an open-ended question to see what the employee said, and in failing to properly investigate the claim by obtaining video evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\">. Nonetheless, Brush urges on appeal that <em>Total Sys. </em>is no longer good law because of such subsequent decisions as <em>Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP,</em>-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 863, 178 L.Ed.2d 694 (2011); <em>Rosten v. Saint-Gobain Performance Plastics Corp.,</em>-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1325, 179 L.Ed.2d 379 (2011); and <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Government of Nashville &amp; Davidson County, Tennessee, </em>555 U.S. 271, 129 S.Ct. 846, 172 L.Ed.2d 650 (2009). We need not address that argument at this time because, \"[u]nder the prior panel precedent rule, we are bound by earlier panel holdings ... unless and until they are overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, 122 </em>F.3d 1355, 1359 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">. While Brush disputes the applicability of <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>under these circumstances, claiming that Pearson\u2019s declaration provides direct evidence of retaliation by Sears, we cannot agree. Pearson\u2019s declaration merely states his belief that Brush\u2019s termination was in retaliation for Brush\u2019s opposition of rape; nowhere does the declaration or any other evidence provided by Brush detail specific conversations, communications or other direct evidence of retaliatory intent on the part of Sears. Accordingly, Brush can only prove her case through circumstantial evidence, which necessitates the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b811-5\">. Indeed, Brush cites several district court cases she claims support this position: <em>Schanfield v. Sojitz Corp. of America, </em>663 F.Supp.2d 305 (S.D.N.Y.2009), and <em>Rangel v. Omni Hotel Management Corp., </em>No. SA-09-CV-0811 OG, 2010 WL 3927744 (W.D.Tex. Oct. 4, 2010). However, it should go without saying that we are not bound by the decisions of other circuits, let alone the decisions of district courts from other circuits. <em>See, e.g., United States v. McGarity, </em>669 F.3d 1218, 1266 n. 66 (11th Cir.2012) (\"It is axiomatic that this Circuit is bound only by its own precedents and those of the Supreme Court ... and certainly this is even more true in the context of a district court determination from another circuit.\u201d) (citing <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir.1981)). This is even more obvious when considering an opinion like <em>Rangel, </em>which is actually a magistrate judge's Report and Recommendation. <em>See Rangel, </em>2010 WL 3927744, *1. Nonetheless, both <em>Rangel </em>and <em>Schanfield </em>are easily distinguishable from the facts at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">. Of course, we do not foreclose the ability of one employee to \"oppose\u201d discrimination on another employee\u2019s behalf. <em>Cf. Sumner v. United States Postal Serv., </em>899 F.2d 203, 209 (2d Cir.1990) (recognizing right of third party to recover for retaliation under such a basis). However, where, as here, a third party is neither directly interested in the underlying discrimination nor acting beyond the scope of her employment in opposing an employer\u2019s action, no Title VII claim will lie.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b812-11\">. Brush urges us that the EEOC letter of determination should have some evidentiary weight. While we agree that an EEOC reasonable cause finding may be admissible as evidence, <em>Goldsmith v. Bagby Elevator Co., </em>513 F.3d 1261, 1288 (11th Cir.2008), it alone does not create a genuine dispute of material fact preventing the granting of summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
