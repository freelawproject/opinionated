We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen, <em>Najmabadi v. Holder, </em>597 F.3d 983, 986 (9th Cir.2010), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-30\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying Singh\u2019s motion to reopen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>as untimely where the motion was filed over four years after the BIA\u2019s final order, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), and Singh failed to present sufficient evidence of changed circumstances in India to qualify for the regulatory exception to the time limit for filing motions to reopen, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii); <em>Malty v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 942, 945 (9th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe critical question is ... whether circumstances have changed sufficiently that a petitioner who previously did not have a legitimate claim for asylum now has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">We reject Singh\u2019s contention that the BIA failed to consider evidence because he has not overcome the presumption that the BIA reviewed the record. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006). Singh\u2019s contention that the BIA applied a higher standard is belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Finally, we decline to reconsider Singh\u2019s contentions regarding the immigration judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination because this court already decided that issue in <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>206 Fed.Appx. 707 (9th Cir.2006). <em>See Merritt v. Mackey, </em>932 F.2d 1317, 1320 (9th Cir.1991) (explaining that under the \u201claw of the case doctrine,\u201d one panel of an appellate court will not reconsider questions which another panel has decided on a prior appeal in the same case).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b702-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
