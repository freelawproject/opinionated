Civ. R. 58<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was intended to resolve \u201cthe old, old question of when is a judgment a judgment.\u201d 11 Wright, and Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil, Section 2781, citing <em>Cedar Creek Oil &amp; Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Fidelity Gas Co. (C. </em>A. 9, 1956), 238 F. 2d 298. However, \u201c[t]here are no hard and fast rules for determining what is a judgment; past cases have set certain boundaries and announced generalizations, but essentially every case must be determined from its own facts.\u201d <em>Associated Press </em>v. <em>Taft-Ingalls Corp. </em>(C. A. 6, 1963), 323 F. 2d 114, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">For this reason, it is difficult to resolve what is here represented as a conflict between two judgments, for the facts of the cases certified differ markedly. <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Chester, supra, </em>was not appealed to this court. We therefore do not pass upon the correctness of its holding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Unlike <em>Shore, </em>the case before us concerns an equivocal order not readily identifiable as a judgment entry, but rather one arguably intended by the trial judge as an announcement of his decision denying the appellant\u2019s motions for new trial and for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Prior to a 1963 amendment to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 58, which now requires a judgment to be entered by separate document, cases of this type were decided by determining whether the trial judge had clearly declared his intention to enter a final decision in the matter before him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Kaplan, Amendments of the Federal Nudes of Civil Procedure, 1961-1963(11), 77 Harvard Law Review 801, at page 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">For example, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>F. &amp; M. Schaefer Brewing Co. </em>(1958), 356 U. S. 227, the fact that the trial judge, when later presented with a formal journal entry, had signed it, was deemed significant by the United States Supreme Court in determining the trial judge\u2019s intention, and finding the formal order appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">In <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. </em>(C. A. 3, 1950), 181 F. 2d 934, the court, while holding that a memorandum opinion which concluded by stating \u201c [t]he motions * * * are denied\u201d was not a judgment, suggested that a memorandum or opinion could do double duty and serve as a judgment if it included a sufficiently definitive formal statement. The court added that if this method was to be employed, it would be well to entitle the memorandum \u201copinion and order,\u201d so that no question of interpretation would arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Here, the trial court, in signing the formal journal entry on January 7, 1975, recognized that the earlier order either -was not intended to be a final disposition, or that it insufficiently contained notice of its finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We have examined that earlier order carefully, and find none of the usual indicia which demonstrate finality such that an immediate appeal would be required. Both the form of the order and the circumstances surrounding its issuance indicate that a more formal entry was to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">Therefore, the order of the Court of Appeals dismissing the appeal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-10\">O \u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigax, Ster\u00edt and P. BrowN, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b63-11\">Celebrezze and W. BrowN, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\"> Civ. R. 58 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u201cSubject to the provisions of Rule 54(B), upon a .general verdict of a jury, or upon a decision announced, the court shall promptly cause the judgment to-be prepared and, the court having signed it, the clerk shall thereupon enter it. A judgment is effective only .when filed with the clerk for journalization. Entry, of the judgment. shall not be delayed for the taxing of costs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-9\"> It should be sufficient to point out that the written , entry' prepared and filed in <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Chester </em>was identified as a \u201cdecision and judgment entry,\u201d and clearly and finally disposed of the dispute between the parties. Thus, it fulfilled the formal requirements of Civ. R. 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-10\">Civ. R. 58 does not go as far as Federal Rule of \"Civil Procedure 5S :(Amend. 1963), which requires judgments t\u00f3 be entered on a separate- document, and provides that \u201c[a] judgment is-effective only when \u25a0so set forth and when entered as provided in Rule 79(a).\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b63-12\">Celebrezze, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ApH\">dissenting. This case was certified to this court as a \u201cconflict case\u201d pursuant to Rule III, Rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>of Practice of the Supreme Court. The journal entry of certification states-:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u201cThe court being fully advised in the premises find that the court in <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Chester </em>holds that an announcement of a decision cannot be the same document as the judgment entry, whereas in the present case we have held that the. announcement of the decision may be the same cLocument as the judgment entry. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">The majority opinion avers that since the facts in this case are \u201cmarkedly\u201d different from those in <em>Shore </em>v. <em>Chester </em>(1974), 40 Ohio App. 2d 412, they -chose not to pass upon the \u201ccorrectness of its holding.\u201d If that judgment of the majority herein be correct then the only proper order under the rules of practice of this court is to remand to the Court of Appeals for clarification.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">See <em>McClung </em>v. <em>Bd. of Edn. </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St. 2d 149, 156, wherein the following appears:</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">\u201cHerbert and P. BrowN, JJ., would remand the cause to the Court of Appeals under Section 6, Rule III, Rules of Practice of the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">While I did not agree with the foregoing approach to resolution of the issues presented in <em>McChmg, </em>for the reason that a conflict between two appellate decisions did exist therein, application of the principle' is required here, where, in the words of the majority \u201cit is difficult to resolve what is here represented as a conflict between two judgments, for the facts of the cases certified- differ markedly.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
