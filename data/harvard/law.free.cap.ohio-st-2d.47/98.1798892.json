The syllabus provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u201cInsofar as App. R. 4(B), permitting the prosecution, as of right, to appeal judgments of trial courts, enlarges the statutory right of appeal provided by R. C. 2945.67 through-2945.70 and abridges the right of appellate courts to exercise their discretion in allowing appeals provided by these same sections, such.rule is.invalid under the provisions of Section 5 of Article IY of the Ohio Constitution, and an appeal filed by the state pursuant to App. R. 4(B) is properly dismissed <em>where the provisions of R. C. 3945.68 have not been complied with.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Understandably, therefore, the prosecution commenced its appeal pursuant to R. 0. 2945.68,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulting in -an order of the -Court of Appeals on May. 27, 1975, allowing the filing of the bill of .exceptions. In perfecting the appeal pursuant to R. C. 2945.67 through 2945.70, appellant did not file a formal notice of appeal in either the trial court or .Court of Appeals. An analysis of R. C. 2945.67 through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>2945.70 reflects no requirement of the filing of a notice of appeal, hence, none was statutorily required. <em>State </em>v. <em>Meltzer </em>(1965), 4 Ohio App. 2d 373. Thus, if the holding in <em>Wallace </em>applies only prospectively, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the appeal for failure to file a notice of appeal, as none was required.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">On July 2, 1975, this court decided <em>Wallace, supra </em>(43 Ohio St. 2d 1). While there does not appear either in the syllabus or in the opinion an express declaration that the holding therein announced was to be applied only prospectively, it is manifest that such was the intention of this court. The express recognition in the opinion that App. R. 5 was promulgated to provide a procedure for a delayed appeal by a <em>defendant </em>attests to such conclusion. Thus, it was stated, at page 3 in the opinion, \u201c [i]n light of <em>Hughes, </em>we <em>now hold </em>that App. R. 5(A) is applicable to appeals by the state in criminal cases.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">In a similar view with respect to the applicability of App. R. 4(B), the court stated at pages 3-4: \u201cWe also hold that the time within which a motion for leave to appeal must be filed <em>is to be governed </em>by App. R. 4(B),\u201d and \u201c [b]ecause the time limits in App. R. 4(B) meet that objective, we. <em>make them </em>applicable to such appeals.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Finally, it is to be noted that the syllabus reflects only a future application: \u201cA motion for leave to appeal by the state in a criminal case <em>shall be governed </em>by the procedural requirements of A.pp. R. 5 and the time requirement of App. R. 4(B).\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In <em>Hughes, supra, </em>this court necessarily recognized the continuing vitality of R. C. 2945.67 through 2945.70, where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>in, after-concluding the invalidity of App. R. 4(B) in the aspects, set forth in the syllabus, the court stated that the appeal must be dismissed for failure to comply .'with R. CL 2945.68. Until <em>Wallace, </em>the procedural statutory implementation of the limited right.of appeal remained viable and in force, and compliance with such procedural statutes resulting in an order, of the Court of Appeals allowing the filing of the bill of exceptions properly invoked-the jurisdiction o.f such court. <em>Wallace </em>simply reflects the, view of this court that, thereafter, the substantive right of-appeal recognized in <em>Hughes </em>was better implemented by the application of existing procedural rules properly promulgated by this court pursuant to constitutional grant rather than by the existing statutory, implementation in R. C. 2945.67 through 2945.70.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">We, therefore, now make express what we view as clearly implicit in <em>Wallace, </em>that App. R. 4(B) and \"App. R. 5 govern appeals by the state from only those orders and judgments which become final after July 2, 1975. Since the judgment of dismissal by the Court of Appeals rests upon an application of such rules to an appeal from an order entered prior to July 2,1975, and the appeal was otherwise properly perfected pursuant to R. C. 2945.67 through 2945.-70, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b120-6\"><em>O </em>\u2019Neill, C.
