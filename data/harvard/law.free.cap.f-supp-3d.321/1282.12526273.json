Fine Furniture disagreed with the Department's basing its financial ratios only on the statements of Tagum and Mount Banahaw, arguing that the Department's decisions not to use also the financial statements of Winlex and Mega Plywood were not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Commerce continued to exclude the Winlex financial statements in its Remand Redetermination \"because of a missing note regarding 'Property, Plant, and Equipment,' identified as Note 9.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (footnote omitted).

Fine Furniture's Comments 12-13. Further, Fine Furniture maintains that the missing information is irrelevant because the Department does not use property, plant, and equipment information in its calculation of financial ratios.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. Fine Furniture concludes its argument by asserting that because Commerce rejected the Winlex financial statements based solely on the omission of \"superfluous and irrelevant\" information in Note 9, its decision was unsupported by substantial evidence and the court \"must remand to Commerce with instructions to use the Winlex financial statements to calculate Fine Furniture's financial ratios.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. In reply to these arguments, defendant acknowledged Fine Furniture's explanation that Note 9 may have been omitted simply because no value was ascribed to property, plant, and equipment but argues that Commerce permissibly \"opted to avoid unsupported speculation, considering that the record otherwise contained two useable statements for calculating Fine Furniture's financial ratios.\" Def.'s Reply 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The record evidence supports the Department's decision not to use the Winlex financial statements. Note 9 is indeed missing from the text of the document comprising the financial statements for the years ending December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2012 as that document exists on the record.\n   <em>\n    See Letter from deKieffer &amp; Horgan, PLLC to Dep't of Commerce re: Surrogate Values for the Preliminary Results\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 7 (Aug. 6, 2013) (P.R. Doc. 419), ECF No. 172-1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Winlex Financial Statements\n   </em>\n   \"). It is the only note that appears to be missing. Commerce opined in the Remand Redetermination that Fine Furniture's \"zero value\" explanation, \"while plausible, is problematic because 'Note 6: Trade Receivables' on the same page does appear, even though there are no reported values.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   at 18 (footnote omitted). \"Thus, it is also possible that all text on the bottom portion of the page, including 'Note 9' and any other information, was omitted from the financial statement on the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   It is not clear from the record whether Note 9 once existed and is actually missing from the text or was intentionally omitted\n   from the document due to the zero value, and there is no record information that resolves this question. The apparent omission that caused Commerce not to use the Winlex statements may be characterized as minor or unimportant, but the record fact is that the two sets of financial statements Commerce used did not raise a similar issue. While Commerce is required to use the best available information, the possible discrepancy in the Winlex statements is a sufficient ground for it to invoke its practice of not using financial statements that appear to be incomplete if an alternative that does not have that possible flaw is available on the record. Fine Furniture's argument that Commerce would not have used the information in Note 9 whether or not the value was zero is unavailing because the possible discrepancy reasonably served as a reason to avoid using the financial statement in light of alternatives. In summary, the question posed by the issue of the Winlex statements is not whether Commerce permissibly could have found these statements acceptable but whether the record\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   it to do so. Fine Furniture's arguments fall short of convincing the court that Commerce erred in making its selection from among the choices available on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the Remand Redetermination, Commerce maintained its decision in the Final Results not to use the financial statements of Mega Plywood, basing its decision on evidence that the company received non-interest-bearing loans or advances from shareholders with no definite call period.\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   at 19 &amp; n.67;\n   <em>\n    see also Final I &amp; D Mem.\n   </em>\n   at 24. Fine Furniture argues that Commerce was required to include the Mega Plywood financial statements in calculating the surrogate financial ratios. Fine Furniture's Comments 14-15. Fine Furniture argues that the decision not to do so is unsupported by substantial evidence because, as to the Philippines, \"information on the record establishes that such shareholder advances are temporary corporate capital infusions that occur in the ordinary course of business\" and because \"Commerce could have imputed an interest expense if it needed to perfect the financial statements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal citation omitted). Neither argument is persuasive. Loans or advances from shareholders may be a routine practice in the Philippines, but the problem Commerce sought to address was not whether the loans or advances are irregular or unusual. Instead, Commerce was concerned with possible distortion in the calculation of financial ratios should the affected financial statement be used.\n   <em>\n    See Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   at 19. Commerce did not act unreasonably or contrary to record evidence in concluding that the loans or advances could distort information upon which it would rely, particularly with respect to the Department's need to calculate an interest expense. Fine Furniture argues that \"[e]ven if Commerce were justified in its determination that Mega Plywood's financial statements should have an interest expense associated with stockholder advances, Commerce did not have to reject the statement for this reason\" and \"should have adjusted the financial ratios by adding an interest expense rate based on publicly available rates on the record.\" Fine Furniture's Comments 16. Imputing an interest rate based on information not specific to the producer represented by the financial statement is a less-than-ideal solution when financial statements are on the record that are not affected by the problem Commerce identified. In short, Fine Furniture has not demonstrated that, given the available alternatives, Commerce made an impermissible choice in deciding not to use the Mega Plywood statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Of the remaining four criteria-public availability, contemporaneity with the period of review, representativeness of a broad-market average, and specificity to the input-the record shows, and no party contests, that the \"publicly available\" factor is met by both competing sets of data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fine Furniture's Comments 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The application of the contemporaneity factor remains in dispute between the parties.

Doc. 310), ECF No. 150-1 (\"\n   <em>\n    Wooden Bedroom Furniture Mem.\n   </em>\n   \");\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    NPC Data and Supplemental Information\n   </em>\n   ). Fine Furniture also objects to the Department's reliance on the 2012 copyright date on the Doing Business in Camarines Sur webpage. According to Fine Furniture, \"[n]othing indicates that the 2012 copyright has anything to do with the electricity rates shown earlier on the webpage.\" Fine Furniture's Comments 6. Rather, Fine Furniture argues, \"[i]t is common knowledge that a website can be redesigned without the web host changing the substantive information presented on that website and it appears that is exactly what happened here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Fine Furniture also argues that whereas the NPC data are from the original source, the government-owned power company, the Camarines Sur publication is a secondary source that does not identify its primary source for the electricity rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant responds that Commerce \"declined to draw unsupported inferences\" from the unchanged Camarines Sur rate data and the fluctuation of the NPC data and \"instead relied on actual record evidence showing that the copyright date of the Camarines Sur website was 2012.\" Def.'s Reply 11 (internal citations omitted). In response to Fine Furniture's argument that \"the existence of a copyright date is not 'definitive' evidence regarding contemporaneity,\" defendant submits that \"Commerce's factual findings must only be supported by substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Even if it were presumed (despite certain record evidence to the contrary) that the 2012 copyright date is the date actually applying to the electricity rate data in the Camarines Sur publication, remaining evidence still would show that the NPC data are superior to the Camarines Sur data\n   with respect to contemporaneity. The NPC data are presented for each of the 19 months of the POR whereas the Camarines Sur data still would pertain only to the eleven months of the POR that occurred during 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The remaining two criteria, broad market average and specificity to the input, point in opposite directions. Commerce acknowledged in the Remand Redetermination that the \"NPC rates cover a broader geographical area than the Camarines Sur rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Remand Redetermination\n   </em>\n   at 24. Fine Furniture argues that its surrogate value submission provided data allowing calculation of a country-wide electricity rate, having been obtained from the National Power Company, the government-owned Philippine power supplier, and covering all three main regions in the country, Mindanao, Visayas, and Luzon. Fine Furniture's Comments 8, 10. In contrast, the Camarines Sur data pertain to only two locations, Naga City and Iriga City/Pili, in the Camarines Sur area of Luzon. Record population data (for 2010) show that Camarines Sur as a whole had a population of 1,822,371, which was less than 2% of the total population of 92,337,852 for the Philippines; the record does not contain data on the portion of the Camarines Sur population comprised of the populations of Naga City and Iriga City/Pili.\n   <em>\n    NPC Data and Supplemental Information\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because they pertain to only two locations and to a very small percentage of the Philippine population, the electricity rates listed in the Camarines Sur publication cannot be said to be representative of the Philippines as a whole. They also are unrepresentative in another respect: as shown by the NPC data, they are substantially higher than the rates for the Philippines as a whole and even are significantly higher than the average rates for Luzon, the region in which Camarines Sur is located. As demonstrated by the NPC data, the average of the 19 monthly rates for Luzon is 5.3005 PHP/kWh; the average for Mindanao is 2.8938 PHP/kWh, and the average for Visayas is 4.2884 PHP/kWh.\n   <em>\n    See NPC Data and Supplemental Information\n   </em>\n   . The Naga City rates averaged 6.9292 PHP/kWh (the average of the 6.3147 PHP/kWh residential rate, the 7.7287 PHP/kWh industrial rate, and the 6.7441 PHP/kWh average of the two commercial rates), and the six listed Iriga City/Pili rates averaged 7.9577 PHP/kWh.\n   <em>\n    See Camarines Sur Data\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Commerce made its selection based on its specificity criterion. The other criteria either were neutral (public availability) or favored the NPC data (contemporaneity with the POR, tax exclusivity, and broad market average). There may be situations in which the criterion of specificity to the input may be the controlling criterion even if constituting the only criterion supporting the Department's choice, but based on the record evidence this is not one of those situations. The record in this review does not support a finding that the best available information is the evidence of record that pertains solely to industrial users of electricity. Here, that evidence is extremely limited in scope (obtained from only the two locations in Camarines Sur), substantially divergent from electricity rates for the country as a whole, and not substantially divergent from the non-industrial rates for Naga City and Iriga City/Pili. The record evidence shows that electricity rates vary so widely in the Philippines that the major determinant of the cost of electricity is the location within the country; this factor strongly supports the use of a country-wide rate for the Philippines, which is the Department's chosen surrogate country. The record does not support a finding or inference that electricity rates for industrial customers in the Philippines typically are substantially different than\n   other electricity rates. In valuing the electricity input at 7.8139 PHP/kWh, the average of the industrial rates for Naga City (7.7287 PHP/kWh) and Iriga City/Pili (7.8990 PHP/kWh), Commerce is using a rate for industrial customers only, but that rate, while varying substantially from the country-wide rates (which averaged 4.1609 PHP/kWh during the POR) does not vary substantially from the average of all the rates (for all types of customers) for the two Camarines Sur locations (which is 7.6148 PHP/kWh).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In summary, the record does not contain substantial evidence that supports a finding that the industrial electricity rates for Naga City and Iriga City/Pili are the \"best available information\" on the record with which Commerce could have valued Fine Furniture's electricity usage. In preparing a new determination in response to this Opinion and Order, Commerce must reconsider its surrogate electricity value and ensure that the result is supported by substantial evidence on the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    4.
