For the following reasons, the Defendant's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plaintiff is a New York limited liability company that designs, manufactures, distributes, and sells sunglasses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendant is a California limited liability company which is a wholesaler of eyewear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 20, 2009, the Plaintiff and non-party Allison Singer (\"Singer\") entered into a Confidentiality, Non-Solicitation, and Non-Competition Agreement (the \"Agreement\") as part of her employment with Eyeking. While the Plaintiff claims in its complaint that Singer is the sole member of JSS, the Defendant submitted an affidavit from Joseph Santley (\"Santley\") in which he stated that he is and has always been its sole member, as well as the statement of information filed by Joseph Santley with the California Secretary of State which lists him as its sole member. The Plaintiff submitted an affidavit from Craig Fels (\"Fels\"), a member of Eyeking, in which he stated that Santley has no personal involvement in the Defendant's business. However, it is not clear how Fels, as a member of Eyeking, would have personal knowledge of this fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During her employment with Eyeking, Singer was apparently privy to confidential information. On January 21, 2016, Singer resigned from Eyeking. At some point, Singer apparently became employed by the Defendant, and allegedly disclosed confidential information to JSS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   JSS apparently sells and distributes sunglasses to a number of national retail stores and distribution channels, including Vanilla Sky, Aeropostale, Discovery Clothing Company, Spencer Gifts, Inc., Zumiez, Shoe Sensation Inc., 10 Spot Plus, Icon Eyewear Inc., DD's Discounts, Torrid Merchandising Inc., Forever 21, Van Maur, The Buckle Inc., Journey's Retail, Citi Trends, Inc., Charlotte Russe, K &amp; G, Hot Topic, Rue 21, and 5 Below. The Plaintiff also sells to these national retailers. Fels testified during a deposition that Singer attempted to secure business with Urban Outfitters, Tilly's, and Zumiez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The establishments enumerated above maintain over 100 retail locations in New York State. The Plaintiff did not provide any evidence that the Defendant ships its products to these retailers in New York, or\n   that these retailers even sell the Defendant's products in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Relevant Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Plaintiff initially filed its complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, Suffolk County, on September 28, 2017. The Plaintiff's sole cause of action is for tortious interference with business relations. The Plaintiff seeks injunctive relief and damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On October 24, 2017, the Defendant removed the action to federal court based on the diversity of the parties and the amount in controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 15, 2017, the Defendant filed the instant motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Standard of Review Under Rule 12(b)(2)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Rule 12(b)(2) authorizes a party to seek dismissal on the ground that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over him or it. However, as the party attempting to invoke the Court's jurisdiction, it is the Plaintiff that bears the burden of showing that personal jurisdiction exists over the Defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metro.
