Throughout all stages of litigation, attorneys must vigorously advocate for their clients in spite of busy schedules, personality conflicts, or unforeseen circumstances. In particular, attorneys advocating for criminal defendants who face tough odds at trial must tell their clients what they\n   <em>\n    need to hear\n   </em>\n   -not necessarily what they\n   <em>\n    want to hear.\n   </em>\n   This sentiment is not merely an aspiration of the judicial system; it is a guarantee under our Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   The Sixth Amendment requires effective assistance of counsel at critical stages of a criminal proceeding. Its protections are not designed simply to protect the trial, even though counsel's absence in these stages may derogate from the accused's right to a fair trial. The constitutional guarantee applies to pretrial critical stages that are part of the whole course of a criminal proceeding, a proceeding in which\n   <em>\n    defendants cannot be presumed to make critical decisions without counsel's advice.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Lafler v.

While West advised Steele that no plea offer had been made by the Government, based on her discussions with the Government, she outlined the sort of plea agreement she believed she could obtain (based on an Offense Level of 30, resulting in a sentence of imprisonment of 97-121 months, and the possibility of a reduction of 2-4 levels for cooperation)-a case resolution that would have resulted in approximately half of the length of imprisonment that Steele ultimately received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 648-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite this meeting occurring after eight of Steele's ten co-defendants had accepted plea agreements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   West concluded her correspondence by dissuading Steele from taking such a plea offer because the Government would not be \"giving you much\" and opining that Steele \"[did not] have to make a decision soon.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Testimony.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   At the evidentiary hearing, the Court heard testimony from both Steele and West.

However, numbers do not require a credibility determination because they do not lie. The Court need not find an agency relationship, imputation of knowledge, or even the standards of professional conduct, because this sentencing range in-and-of-itself tells the whole story. At its lower value, 97 months is merely a hair over eight years-so\n   <em>\n    even if Steele had never changed his mind to accept a higher range\n   </em>\n   , the parties were nearly at an agreement. At its upper value, 121 months is a hair over ten years-so\n   <em>\n    even if the Government would not have accepted a sentence below ten years\n   </em>\n   , the parties were nearly at an agreement. Thus, the Court is left to conclude that \"what we've got here is a failure to communicate.\" Cool Hand Luke (Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, Inc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   1967).

They apply throughout \"the whole course of a criminal proceeding,\" both during trial and all \"pretrial critical stages.\"\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 165,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p165\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The record indicates that West not only neglected her obligations to communicate with her client regularly, but also failed to proactively engage in the plea bargaining process with the Government. Repeatedly, Ms. West acknowledged that her practice is to seek out a plea offer\n   <em>\n    when her client asks for one.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As noted above, the role of a criminal defense attorney is to tell clients what they\n   <em>\n    need to hear\n   </em>\n   -not necessarily what they\n   <em>\n    want to hear.\n   </em>\n   An attorney's desire to go to trial is an insufficient substitute for proper representation. Steele's pretrial motions were lost, the evidence mounted against him was overwhelming,\n   <em>\n    see supra, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Note 10, and his leverage was dwindling as eight of his ten co-defendants had accepted plea agreements,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Note 12. Under these circumstances, a rational and competent advocate would not cling to delusions of victory when hope was slipping away, but rather would have proactively sought out a plea offer and advised his or her client that a plea was likely in the client's best interest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted in\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , a client \"cannot be presumed to make critical decisions without counsel's advice,\" and here, the advice West gave was fundamentally wrong, if given at all. 566 U.S. at 165,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p165\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In any event, the facts of this case illustrate an even graver deficiency. Despite all of West's failures to properly advise her client or proactively engage the Government in vitally important plea discussions, Steele-on his own volition-\n   <em>\n    begged\n   </em>\n   his attorney to obtain a plea offer for him. And West failed to do so. It does not matter if the range discussed with the Government was slightly different than what the defendant was seeking or if the plea offer omitted some condition that the defendant desired. Sometimes, that is what advocacy is all about-having heartfelt discussions with clients to adequately advise them of their options and realistically prepare them for what lies ahead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Quite simply, when a criminal defendant asks his or her attorney to obtain a plea offer, and the attorney fails to do so when acquiring one was reasonably practicable, then that attorney has \"made [an] error[ ] so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 165-66,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p165\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, Steele has established that West's performance was deficient in her failures to properly advise him throughout the critical pretrial stages, to adequately engage in the plea bargaining process, and to obtain a plea offer when her client pleaded for one and when obtaining one was reasonably practicable. Additionally, the Court finds that Steele has established prejudice because not only would he have accepted a sentencing range\n   of 97-121 months had he been properly advised, but also he tried to accept such a sentencing range through his unsuccessful attempts at communication with West through her \"intern.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Remedy.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Having concluded that Steele has satisfied his burden under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , the Court must now determine the appropriate remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   As guidance, there is some decisional precedent in instances of an attorney's failure to communicate existing plea offers, or plea offers rejected by defendants due to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 150-51,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 174-75,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p165\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that available remedies may include resentencing). The Government points to the factual differences between the instant case and\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   -namely, the absence of a formal, written plea offer-to assert that Steele is entitled to no relief whatsoever.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 694 at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, the Government's argument entirely misses the mark. It is true that\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   involved a plea offer rejected by a defendant due to counsel's erroneous advice, 566 U.S. at 161,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p165\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   involved a plea offer never communicated to a defendant, 566 U.S. at 138-39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188490\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/134/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While these cases are factually different from the instant case,\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   stand for the more fundamental proposition that the plea bargaining process is essential to representation under the Sixth Amendment. It is true that the specific facts of this case do not fit neatly into the fact patterns of these prior Supreme Court cases, but a very grave injustice has befallen Steele.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Due to West's deficient performance, Steele is now serving a sentence vastly disparate to his co-defendants that is manifestly unjust considering the comparative culpability of each defendant. There was overwhelming evidence mounted against Steele; eight of his ten co-defendants had already assented to plea agreements; and he desperately sought to enter a plea in exchange for a reduced sentence. The Court has before it the credible testimony of Steele, a letter to him from West [ECF No. 648-4] and posthumous notes made by the prosecutor [ECF No. 696], which establish a clear outline of the parameters for a plea agreement involving Steele-parameters to which Steele assented, and which West did not pursue. All of this amounts to an opportunity lost. With a minimal amount of effort, West could have obtained a formal plea agreement, thus making the circumstances of this case equivalent to an offer not communicated. Therefore, to allow the Government to rely solely on the absence of a written plea offer would shock the conscience of this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Pursuant to the Supreme Court's guidance in\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 170-72,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p165\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court will remedy the miscarriage of justice at issue in this case by vacating Steele's sentence, and ordering a new sentencing proceeding.
