Following a direct appeal, and Sasser's effort to obtain Arkansas state court postconviction relief pursuant to Arkansas Rule of Criminal Procedure 37, Sasser sought federal relief through a writ of habeas corpus. (Doc. 3). The Court dismissed the petition but granted a certificate of appealability with respect to several issues. (Docs. 30 and 34). During Sasser's first appeal to the Eighth Circuit, and following the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Atkins v.

Sasser has presented no argument or evidence concerning this claim.

Whether or not Sasser's positions are inconsistent, it is clear from the procedural history of this case that Sasser's earlier position was not accepted by the Court. Sasser gains no unfair advantage and the Respondent suffers no unfair detriment if Sasser is not estopped from asserting that his habeas claims are new. The Respondent's argument is rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Sasser argues that the Respondent should be estopped from arguing that Sasser's claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not new claims. Specifically, Sasser argues that the Respondent argued to this Court that Sasser's postconviction counsel failed to effectively present the claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and the supporting facts to the state courts. Sasser argues that this Court agreed when it denied Sasser relief due to procedural default, and that the Respondent's position now-that these claims were raised in the state proceedings-is inconsistent with the Respondent's earlier, successful position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court has reviewed the record in this case and agrees that the Respondent previously argued before this Court that Sasser's habeas claims\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   were new claims, and that Respondent partially succeeded in convincing the Court of that position. In particular, in its response to the amended habeas petition, the Respondent argued that \"the only ineffective-assistance claim that was fairly presented to and decided by the state courts concerned only counsel's failure to seek a limiting instruction for the jury's consideration of Jacki Carter's testimony, and that is the only ineffective-assistance claim that is preserved for review here.\" (Doc. 24, p. 3). In its May 28, 2002 memorandum opinion and order denying the amended habeas petition, this Court agreed with the Respondent's position, but only with respect to the claims in the amended petition (Doc. 23), ruling that out of the eight grounds listed in the amended petition, \"[w]ith the exception of Ground 8, [Sasser] failed to assert and develop any of the remaining grounds set forth in his Amended Petition at the state court level.\" (Doc. 30, p. 3). Ground 8 was an ineffective assistance claim premised on trial counsel's failure to request a limiting instruction after the State of Arkansas presented victim testimony from Sasser's previous conviction for battery, rape, and kidnapping. (Doc. 23, p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The \"remaining grounds\" in Sasser's Amended Petition that are premised on ineffective assistance of counsel, and which the Respondent successfully argued were \"new\" claims, are: (1) a general claim that Sasser was deprived of his right to effective assistance; and (2) a claim, in light of standards promulgated by the Arkansas Public Defender's Commission requiring a minimum of two attorneys in capital cases, that Sasser's counsel was ineffective when he did not request additional counsel and a continuance, and when he did not object to being required to proceed alone. The first of these is entirely too general to constitute a claim. It states a legal basis, but no factual basis. The second, a claim premised on the need for additional counsel, may be a reason that trial counsel failed to prepare for the sentencing phase of the trial, obtain a timely psychological evaluation of\n   Sasser, or meaningfully consult with a mental health professional, but it is not one of the three ineffective assistance claims under consideration on remand. While the Respondent would be judicially estopped from arguing that the \"additional counsel\" claim is not a new claim, because that is not one of the ineffective assistance claims under consideration on remand from the Eighth Circuit, estoppel does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    2. New Claims/Procedural Default\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Because there is no estoppel, the Court must now compare the three claims on remand with those raised in the state proceedings to determine whether any is new or procedurally defaulted. In determining whether these claims are the same as any claim exhausted in state court proceedings or otherwise raised in these proceedings, the Court is mindful that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [a] petitioner must present \"\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the\n   <em>\n    factual and legal\n   </em>\n   premises\" of his claims to the state courts in order to preserve them for federal habeas review. This standard applies to claims that trial counsel has been constitutionally ineffective. A habeas petitioner who asserts only broadly in his state petition for relief that his counsel has been ineffective has not immunized his federal habeas claim's specific variations from the effects of the state's procedural requirements. Nor has a petitioner who presents to the state courts a broad claim of ineffectiveness as well as some specific ineffectiveness claims properly presented all conceivable specific variations for purposes of federal habeas review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Flieger v.

As summarized in Sasser's post hearing brief, the first claim under consideration in this Court argues that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Trial counsel's performance fell well below prevailing professional norms when he failed to ensure that Mr. Sasser was represented by two qualified lawyers, failed to perform necessary investigations, unreasonably failed to secure competent expert mental health assistance that was obviously needed, unreasonably failed to secure competent and qualified investigative assistance, unreasonably failed to use properly the investigative assistance he was provided, unreasonably failed to interview and present witnesses who would have provided Mr. Sasser's jury with compelling mitigating evidence, failed to investigate and present evidence of Mr. Sasser's intellectual deficiencies, and unreasonably failed to investigate and present evidentiary exhibits that would have supported Mr. Sasser's case for a life sentence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   (Doc. 273, pp. 5-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Some of these \"failures of preparation\" in the first claim are recharacterizations of the second and third claims now under consideration in these federal proceedings, and their inclusion in this first claim is representative of Sasser's apparent habit of trying to shoehorn multiple claims into one.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sasser II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3721289\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/833/#p851\">\n    735 F.3d at 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"At every turn in these proceedings, Sasser has raised new ineffective assistance of counsel claims or recast old claims in new ways. Having carefully scrutinized Sasser's numerous filings, we count no fewer than sixteen ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised under the umbrella of the second ground certified for appeal.\"). For example, there is little or no fundamental difference in claiming trial counsel failed to adequately prepare for the sentencing phase of the trial by failing to secure competent expert mental health assistance and in claiming trial counsel failed to meaningfully\n   consult with a mental health professional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Others are essentially the same claims before the state court. For example, there is little or no fundamental difference in claiming trial counsel failed to interview and present witnesses who would have provided Mr. Sasser's jury with compelling mitigating evidence (Doc. 273, p. 6) and in claiming that trial counsel failed to investigate for the penalty phase and to call additional witnesses to adduce evidence of relevant mitigating factors. Respondent's Ex. 2, Vol. 1, pp. 144-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Still others are so far afield of the four claims identified on remand that it appears Sasser is attempting to revive claims already dismissed by the Eighth Circuit. For example, Sasser claims in Ground VII of his petition that he was \"deprived of the effective assistance of counsel and is entitled\n   <em>\n    to a new trial\n   </em>\n   because he was not represented by two attorneys.\" (Doc. 48, p. 3) (emphasis added). This is not one of the surviving claims identified by the Eighth Circuit, but Sasser now argues that the claim that trial counsel was ineffective when he failed to prepare for the sentencing phase results from trial counsel not asking for another attorney to be appointed. (Doc. 273, p. 7). A claim is identified by its legal and factual bases. Because the legal and factual bases Sasser argues in the first claim on remand are the same as those that have already been dismissed, or are fundamentally the same as others to be considered on remand, this claim is not amenable to a\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trevino\n   </em>\n   analysis. That is, it is not a claim that has been procedurally defaulted and can therefore be excused. Where it is not duplicative of the second and third claims, it is a claim that has already been dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   However, the second and third claims are different. Sasser argues that prevailing professional norms at the time of trial required the early involvement of a qualified and informed mental health expert in order to effectively present mitigation evidence at sentencing. Sasser also argues that prevailing professional norms required trial counsel to present expert witnesses to discuss mental illness, and that any meaningful expert opinion on mental health will be informed by family and social history. Sasser argues that trial counsel failed to timely seek the appointment of qualified experts in neurology and neuropsychology to conduct a full test battery on Sasser. Sasser also claims that this failure caused trial counsel to be uninformed as to what he needed a mental health expert to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Although trial counsel enlisted the help of Mary Pat Carlson, she was family counselor, not a clinical psychologist. Sasser argues that trial counsel provided Carlson with no referral questions, providing her only with a \"copy of my file, and she took it from there.\" (Doc. 273, pp. 17-18). Sasser argues that trial counsel failed to provide Carlson any other records concerning Sasser, including prior incarceration records. Sasser additionally maintains that because trial counsel conducted no investigation, he had no biopsychological history to give Carlson. Sasser argues that trial counsel failed to investigate Carlson's professional licensure, only \"assuming\" she was qualified. Sasser states Carlson \"was not competent, qualified, or licensed to perform the testing she did in this case;\" and, Carlson's results were, therefore, \"inaccurate and highly aggravating,\" overestimated \"Sasser's intellectual functioning and failed to discover readily apparent organic brain damage.\" (Doc. 273, p. 18). Sasser also argues that Carlson's trial testimony was extremely prejudicial, testifying that Sasser \" 'had repressed and denied vast amounts of rage ... that in the future could be expected to be directed at\n   women, particularly those perceived as being rejecting, unloving and/or having power.' \" (Doc. 273, pp. 18-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Sasser asserts that had the proper investigations been timely performed and qualified experts been retained prior to trial, trial counsel would have discovered and presented evidence that Sasser had a structural problem with his brain that was objectively evident on tests. Sasser further asserts that testimony would have been presented that these brain impairments were present from a very young age. Finally, Sasser argues that expert testimony from a psychologist would have established that Sasser's brain impairments had \"broad-reaching detrimental effects on his ability to function in the world\" and would have established that Sasser was \"particularly lacking in his ability to plan, exercise good judgment, and problem solve.\" (Doc. 275, pp. 8-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The most significant distinction between Sasser's Rule 37 claims and the second and third claims as characterized on remand are that the claims in the Rule 37 petition focus on how trial counsel could have been better prepared for the mitigation arguments he actually raised at sentencing with his chosen expert and how those arguments could have been set forth more effectively, while the claims under consideration on remand concern the steps minimally effective trial counsel would have taken with respect to mental health evidence and obtaining a qualified expert in anticipation of mitigation at the sentencing phase. The second claim on remand is not a claim that trial counsel should have investigated earlier so that he could secure Carlson's evaluation earlier and better consult with her and prepare for sentencing. That issue was fully and fairly raised in the Rule 37 proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondent's Ex. 2, Vol. 2, pp. 310-60 (testimony of Mary Pat Carlson); pp. 310-14 (Carlson's testimony that trial counsel did not contact her until close to trial and she did not do most of the work she otherwise might have); pp. 335-36 (Carlson's testimony that trial counsel did nothing to inform her about mitigating circumstances he intended to address). It is that trial counsel should have begun his preparations and obtained a psychological evaluation earlier so that he would know that he needed a qualified and licensed expert, and not Carlson, to present mental health evidence in mitigation. The third claim on remand is not that trial counsel should have done a better job in consultation with Carlson to prepare both her and himself for the sentencing phase, but that he should have had meaningful consultation with a qualified and licensed mental health professional. Given the new evidence of Carlson's lack of qualifications and her licensure issues, Sasser's third claim is essentially that his trial counsel should not have consulted with her at all, and given the evidence of trial counsel's disdain for mental health professionals and how that disdain impacted trial counsel's preparation, it is hard to see how he could ever be effective in having meaningful consultation.

At the state postconviction level, Sasser's final amended petition alleged, broadly, ineffective assistance of counsel, both at the guilt and penalty phase of trial.

The Arkansas Capital Resource Center was funded by a federal grant and was technically without funding for the handling of matters in state court. To further complicate matters, during the summer of 1995 it became evident to the staff of the Resource Center that federal funding was running out and the staff began looking for other employment. The Resource Center finally completely closed for business in March 1996, several months after postconviction counsel's October 1995 filing of the initial postconviction petition. At the time the Resource Center closed, postconviction counsel filed a motion with the state court seeking to be appointed individually to represent Sasser. The motion for appointment of counsel was not ruled on until September 1996. Upon appointment, postconviction counsel was awarded reimbursement for her expenses and compensation with respect to her representation in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Postconviction counsel's reimbursement budget was to cover expenses-for travel, service of subpoenas, witness fees, etc.-and attorney fees. Postconviction counsel was unemployed for several months after the closing of the Resource Center. In October 1996, postconviction counsel was hired by the Pulaski County Public Defender's Office. Although representing Sasser was not part of her job duties, her employer agreed to allow her to continue her representation of Sasser in her spare time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Despite the many hindrances associated with her representation, postconviction counsel did significant work on the case. Her case file is detailed and extensive. Petitioner's Ex. 47. Prior to the Resource Center's closure, an investigator with the Resource Center performed some background research on Sasser's social history. In addition, postconviction counsel gathered the police files and the files of the prosecutor. Postconviction counsel met with Sasser in prison and communicated\n   with him numerous times. She traveled and met with members of Sasser's family as a group, including his mother and siblings. Postconviction counsel attempted to meet with Sasser's former girlfriend and his child. She gathered medical information, and prison records, and interviewed some of Sasser's former employers, including Castleman and Whistle. Postconviction counsel met with Willie Carroll, Sasser's childhood friend. She met with Mary Pat Carlson and gathered records from Southwest Mental Health Counseling concerning the mental evaluations which were given to Sasser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   This investigative work was not enough to qualify as reasonable, however. Much of it was performed prior to the closure of the Resource Center, and was characterized as a good but \"minimal start\" by Richard Burr, Sasser's standard of care expert. Much of it fell far short of the applicable best practices identified in the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   While these guidelines are not binding precedent, without some articulated reason why postconviction counsel would deliberately ignore them, the guidelines are good evidence that her failures in investigation and representation were unreasonably deficient, rather than strategic. Postconviction counsel did not gather birth certificates, death certificates, or other documents of a social history nature. She did not meet with family members individually or specifically investigate the family history of poverty. She did not become aware that Sasser did not technically graduate from high school, or that he was not mentally qualified to enlist in the military and that he hid that fact from his family. Postconviction counsel did not request additional funding and did not make a record for the needed additional expenses for a mitigation expert or mental health expert. As a result, postconviction counsel did not hire a mitigation expert. Postconviction counsel did not request that the state appoint another attorney to serve as second-chair. Furthermore, postconviction counsel did not hire a mental health expert, but instead focused on how Carlson, a marriage and family counselor, could have been a better witness if properly informed by trial counsel. Without a qualified mental health expert, postconviction counsel was unable to understand or effectively present to the postconviction court why trial counsel's mitigation case was wholly insufficient. As evidenced by the testimony to this Court, qualified mental health experts would have been able to rebut the state's expert evidence and present an accurate picture of Sasser's mental health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   It is true that postconviction counsel's decisions were constrained by her circumstances. The Resource Center closed; she was without employment and was unable to find another attorney to take on Sasser's case; after seeking to be appointed, her motion lagged with the state court for months; after appointment, she was given the meager budget of $1,000. These circumstances indicate that not all of postconviction counsel's deficiencies were her own failings. They also make clear that her deficiencies were not reasonable strategic choices, but were another facet of the systematic operation of Arkansas state proceedings to deny capital defendants \"meaningful review of a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sasser II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3721289\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/833/#p851\">\n    735 F.3d at 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Postconviction counsel's\n   investigation and representation were not reasonably effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Prejudice Due to Postconviction Counsel's Ineffective Assistance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Having found postconviction counsel's representation was not reasonably effective, the Court must analyze whether Sasser was prejudiced by that ineffective assistance of counsel. If there was no prejudice, there is no cause to excuse the procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Whether Sasser was prejudiced by postconviction counsel's failure to raise Sasser's surviving claims about trial counsel's ineffective assistance at the sentencing phase depends on whether trial counsel was actually constitutionally ineffective by failing to obtain a timely psychological evaluation of Sasser and failing to meaningfully consult with a mental health professional. If trial counsel's failure to do these things was an unreasonable deficiency rather than a reasonable strategic decision, and if there is a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different had trial counsel provided effective representation, then postconviction counsel's procedural default on these issues in the postconviction proceedings would be prejudicial, and would provide cause to excuse the procedural default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   At the evidentiary hearing held by this Court, trial counsel testified that throughout the pretrial period, and up until approximately three weeks before trial, he was expecting to be able to reach a plea agreement, avoiding the death penalty. Trial counsel testified that he really did not prepare for the sentencing phase during the time he spent trying to reach a plea agreement. Trial counsel characterized his strategy as \"trying to ... tug on their heart strings a little bit to keep them from giving the death penalty.\" Respondent's Ex. 2, Vol. 2, p. 457.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In February 1994, approximately two and a half weeks prior to the trial, trial counsel requested funding for the services of both an investigator and a mental health expert. When funding was secured, trial counsel hired Bill Sillivan to perform an investigation of the crime, with the goal being to avoid the death penalty. Sillivan's investigation was performed in a limited two-to three-week period before trial. Although trial counsel testified that Sillivan \"checked out everything I was interested in checking out,\" the evidence reveals that Sillivan focused his investigation on the crime, and any possible alibi for Sasser, rather than on any psychological or mental health issues that could serve as mitigating factors with respect to sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At approximately the same time Sillivan was hired, trial counsel hired Mary Pat Carlson as a mental health expert. Trial counsel testified that he hired Carlson because she had done an evaluation for trial counsel in the past. Trial counsel provided Carlson with a copy of his file \"and she took it from there.\" Carlson was not a psychiatrist or psychologist; she was a family counselor. Trial counsel assumed, without confirming, that Carlson had the qualifications to conduct the testing necessary. Trial counsel testified that a more qualified expert was probably available in the area, but, he said, \"I just take those kind of people with a grain of salt anyway....\" Respondent's Ex. 2, Vol. 2, p. 458. During the February 2016 hearing, trial counsel was asked what he meant by that statement. Trial counsel stated that he \"didn't find that [mental health experts] were all that credible. I didn't think they knew what they were talking about about half the time.\" (Doc. 265, p. 26:9-1). Testimony was presented in the February 2016 hearing that Carlson was not competent, qualified, or licensed to perform the testing she performed with respect to Sasser,\n   and that she overestimated Sasser's intellectual functioning and failed to discover organic brain damage. Testimony was also presented that disciplinary actions were pending with respect to Carlson's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Evidence was presented concerning the American Bar Association Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases. Petitioner's Ex. 50. The relevant ABA Guidelines, which were in effect from 1989 until 2003, provide that defense counsel should perform an investigation into mitigating evidence which \"should comprise efforts to discover all reasonably available mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3721289\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/833/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 85 (Guideline 11.4.1(C) ). The ABA Guidelines include, in a list of areas for investigation relevant to the sentencing phase:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   medical history, (mental and physical illness or injury, alcohol and drug use, birth trauma and developmental [sic] delays); educational history (achievement, performance and behavior) special educational needs (including cognitive limitations and learning disabilities); military history (type and length of service, conduct, special training); employment and training history (including skills and performance, and barriers to employability); family and social history (including physical, sexual or emotional abuse); prior adult and juvenile record; prior correctional experience (including conduct on supervision and in the institution, education or training, and clinical services; and religious and cultural influences.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2898993,5383491\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/1041/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , p. 86 (Guideline 11.4.1(D)(2)(C) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Sasser also presented testimony from Richard Burr with respect to the standard of care required of defense counsel in a capital case. Burr explained the reason for extensive mitigation phase investigations leading up to a capital trial. Among other things, Burr testified that trial counsel failed to provide effective assistance of counsel during the penalty phase of Sasser's trial because trial counsel conducted no life history or social history investigation, which caused him to work ineffectively with the mental health expert that he called to the stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Sasser presented easily attainable documentary evidence surrounding significant events in Sasser's childhood, such as his birth records, death records concerning his father's tragic death when Sasser was two years old, and Arkansas Worker's Compensation Records evidencing the meager benefits provided to the family following Sasser's father's death. This evidence, along with testimony from witnesses, provides insight into the dire financial, economic, and social aspects of Sasser's childhood. Sasser's school records were presented at the February 2016 hearing. Those records, along with testimony from former teachers, established Sasser's lack of ability in school, and set forth sufficient evidence that Sasser had deficits in intellectually functioning from an early age and was \"socially promoted\" through school, rather than actually graduating from high school. In addition, testimony was presented about Sasser's failure to qualify for military service, and his attempts to cover up that failure. Testimony was also presented from Sasser's coworkers and supervisors concerning his lack of mental ability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   All of this evidence would have been uncovered had trial counsel made a reasonable investigation, and would have assisted him in presenting an effective mitigation case with respect to Sasser's mental health and psychological state. Had this information been provided to Sasser's mental health expert, Carlson, or to Dr. James Blackburn, who testified for the\n   prosecution during the trial, their trial testimony likely would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \"It is unquestioned that under the prevailing professional norms at the time ... counsel had an 'obligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant's background.' \"\n   <em>\n    Porter v.

Trial counsel simply did not investigate or compile a social history of Sasser, and there is no reasonable strategic basis for that decision. It is not unreasonable to hope for a plea and a sympathetic jury, but a reasonable strategy requires some substantive preparation, as well. Trial counsel's failure to investigate was unreasonable, and his investigation was too little, too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Trial counsel failed to timely request and meaningfully consult with a mental health professional. He waited to secure funding and contact Mary Pat Carlson until approximately two and a half weeks before trial. Trial counsel simply provided Carlson with his file as preparation. Not only did trial counsel fail to effectively consult with a mental health expert and supply her with the significant social history which would have been available if he had performed a proper investigation, trial counsel also failed to carefully choose a properly qualified expert under the circumstances. Had trial counsel sought out a mental health professional in timely fashion, he likely would have discovered the professional he initially selected was not qualified. Had trial counsel effectively chosen an appropriate and qualified expert who could perform a psychological evaluation, evidence could have been presented to show that Sasser suffered from mental deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court need not rely on speculation that such evidence could have been presented. During the February 2016 hearing, Sasser presented the testimony of Dr. Pamela Blake, a neurologist, Dr. Dale G. Watson, a neuropsychologist, and Dr. Leslie Lebowitz, a clinical psychologist. Each expert had evaluated Sasser following review of Sasser's background, including various affidavits concerning Sasser's early life, Sasser's academic and social records, and records from Sasser's previous psychological evaluations and cognitive testing. Both Dr. Blake and Dr. Watson concluded that Sasser suffered moderate neurological impairment or dysfunction. Dr. Lebowitz concluded that Sasser \"endured significant adversity throughout his development in the form of extreme poverty and maternal depression and that he was impaired and that his impairment in all likelihood rendered that adversity more overwhelming and harmful than it might have been for somebody else.\" (Doc. 265, Volume 3, p. 620.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Had trial counsel effectively presented a mitigation case, there is a reasonably probability that the jury would have returned a different sentence. During Sasser's jury trial, \"the jury found one aggravating circumstance: that appellant had previously committed another felony an element of which was the use or threat of violence to another person or creating a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another person. The jury found three mitigating circumstances: that appellant would be a productive inmate, had a supporting family of him as an inmate, and had stipulated he caused the victim's death.\"\n   <em>\n    Sasser v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1449584,1449600\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/902/773/\">\n    902 S.W.2d at 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Had the jury been presented with the mental and psychological health mitigation case presented at the February 2016 hearing, there is a reasonable probability that the jury would have chosen a life sentence instead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Because trial counsel's ineffective assistance in failing to obtain a timely\n   psychological evaluation of Sasser and meaningfully consult with a mental health professional prejudiced Sasser at the sentencing phase of trial, postconviction counsel's failure to raise these claims in postconviction proceedings was ineffective assistance of counsel and prejudiced Sasser. Because Arkansas as a systematic matter did not afford Sasser meaningful review of his claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel, the exception to\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   outlined in\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Trevino\n   </em>\n   applies, and ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel can provide cause to excuse a procedural default. The procedural default is therefore excused. Furthermore, because trial counsel was unconstitutionally ineffective in these areas, Sasser's petition must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
