Friends urge the Court to remand the Project to be evaluated in a single Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") along with the Glacier Loon Fuels Reduction and Forest Health Project (\"Glacier Loon Project\"). The two projects are adjacent, occupy facing shorelines of Lindberg Lake, and each propose logging activities in the Buck Holland grizzly bear subunit. As Friends accurately state, the\n   two projects \"fit together like puzzle pieces.\" (Doc. 9 at 10.) Alternatively, Friends argues that the Court should remand the Beaver Creek Project's Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") to conduct a more thorough analysis of the cumulative impacts resulting from the two projects, and recalculate road density standards in grizzly bear and elk security habits to determine compliance with the Flathead National Forest Plan (\"the Forest Plan\"). Lastly, Friends asks the Court to order a new Biological Opinion to assess the impact of the Legacy Lands acquisition\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   on grizzly bear populations in the area. The Court will address these claims below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Beaver Creek Project is located on the Flathead National Forest approximately nine miles south of Condon. AR 60326. It encompasses 34,962 acres of forest, 20,026 acres of wilderness, and a small portion of private land.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The project implements a variety of management directives at the national, regional and local level, with the purpose of restoring natural forest habitat and reducing fuel accumulations which pose a threat of uncharacteristic wildfire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Project proposes to undertake these objectives by implementing silvicultural treatments, thinning, logging, prescribed burning, and various other treatments. AR 60336-37. To access the areas targeted for treatment, the Project proposes building 7.5 miles of temporary roads, while decommissioning 4.5 miles and placing an additional 12.58 miles of road into intermittent stored service (\"ISS roads\"). AR 60337.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Beaver Creek Project area is adjacent to the Glacier Loon Project area. The Glacier Loon Project is also a forest restoration and fuel management project, which utilizes similar forest treatments and temporary road construction.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swan View Coalition v.

Friends further notes that the Beaver Creek EA fails to calculate the proposed total acres logged and land effected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First, the Court recognizes the deference it owes to the agency's decision regarding how and where to present its evidence, and will not elevate form over substance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1474089\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/690/753/\">\n    690 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   761 ;\n   <em>\n    League of Wilderness Defenders-Blue Mountains Biodiversity Project\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734287\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1211/#p1218\">\n    549 F.3d at 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Though the cumulative effects section as it pertains to lynx critical habitat is lean-it takes up no more than a page and a half-the discussion is considerably more in depth when read in its fuller context. For starters, the discussion of the Project's impact upon lynx is listed under two headings: Canada Lynx (AR 60632-53) and Canada Lynx Critical Habitat (AR 60655-63). The Glacier Loon and other timber projects in the area are discussed in both sections. Both sections explain the importance of contiguous land for lynx-both in terms of the lynx's ability to move securely through the land, and the importance of undisturbed quality snowshoe hare habitat. AR 60646, 60661-62. The EA also explains that the largest threat to lynx habitat is \"major highways and permanent developments.\" AR 60647.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Both the Beaver Creek and Glacier Loon Projects encompass the Lower and\n   Upper Beaver LAU.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734287\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1211/#p1218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the Beaver Creek Project does not propose any highway improvement or development of lands within the Lower Beaver LAU, the EA speculates that future highway improvement or development on private land within the Lower Beaver LAU may occur and is discussed in the habitat baseline.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734287\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/549/1211/#p1218\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the EA goes on to explain that the Legacy Land acquisition will \"minimize the negative effects of human and related activities from the development of private lands, and insure (sic) that a larger portion of lynx habitat in the Swan Valley will be managed\" under the forest guidelines. AR 60647.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   What this narrative explanation makes clear is that the acquisition of the Legacy Lands is essential to maintaining large acreage of contiguous forest lands in the surrounding area. AR 60662. Given this, the EA describes that even with the added acreage impacted by the Glacier Loon Project or possible future development in the Lower Beaver LAU, \"lynx foraging habitat will remain well distributed through the project LAUs.\" AR 60647. This description goes beyond\n   <em>\n    Klamath-Siskiyou\n   </em>\n   because it explains to the reader\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   the impact will not be significant: because neither project proposes large scale or permanent development, and because the forest service has acquired and now controls vast acreage in the surrounding area, lynx critical habitat will remain sufficiently contiguous to ensure a healthy hare population and ensure lynx's secure travel. This explanation was precisely what was missing from the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Klamath-Siskiyou\n   </em>\n   . Though the Court has taken a generous reading of the text in its analysis, this is what APA requires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Friends further argues that this analysis is insufficient because it doesn't indicate the total acreage impacted by the two Projects, which\n   <em>\n    Klamath-Siskiyou\n   </em>\n   indicated was a minimum requirement. Friends is correct that the total acreage is not revealed in the narrative discussion. However, when read with the accompanying graphs, the total impacted acreage is clear. As a starting point, Table 67 \"displays the approximate acre changes in available foraging habitat by LAU\" for the Beaver Creek Project's Alternative 2 proposal. AR 60638. The table indicates that the Lower Beaver LAU has 1,902 acres of pre-project stand imitation, while the Upper Beaver LAU has 740 acres. Alternative 2 for the Beaver Creek Project would reduce the stand imitation acreage in the Lower Beaver LAU to 1,541 (resulting in a net decrease of 361 acres) while proposing no changes to the Upper Beaver LAU.\n   <em>\n    See AR\n   </em>\n   60638. The narrative description that discusses the impact of the Glacier Loon Project indicates that it would further reduce the stand imitation in Lower Beaver by an additional 8 acres. From this it can be easily calculated that the combined impacts of the Beaver Creek and Glacier Loon Projects under Alternative 2 will result in a net decrease of 353 acres of stand imitation in the Lower Beaver LAU. A similar analysis can be done under Alternative 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Court concedes that\n   the EA does the bare minimum, for the reasons already explained, it is enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Accordingly, the Court concludes that the Beaver Creek EA has complied with NEPA on these accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The five-year objectives provide that: (1) \"open motorized access is less than 19%\"; (2) \"total motorized access ... will be brought to 24% density\"; (3) \"security core area will provide at least 60%.\" AR 52325. The ten-year objectives provide that \"total motorize access is less than 19%\" and \"security core areas are 68 to 100 percent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ten-year objectives are often referred to as the 19/19/68 objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Friends argues that the Beaver Creek Project violates NEPA and NFMA because the EA states that the Project is in compliance with Amendment 19. According to Friends, this statement is untrue for two reasons. First, Friends observes that post-project road densities in the Buck Holland subunit will be far greater than those permitted under the 19/19/68 ten-year objective, rendering the Project inconsistent with Amendment 19. Next, Friends argues that each of the EA's calculations assumes that ISS roads may be subtracted from the road density determination. Amendment 19 is clear that only \"reclaimed roads\" may be subtracted from road density calculations and Friends argues\n   that the proposed treatment plan for the ISS roads will not meet \"reclaimed\" status. Therefore, according to Friends, the EA falsely concludes that the Project complies with Amendment 19. The Court will address these arguments in that order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Buck Holland's Compliance with Amendment 19\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Friends argues that the Forest Service violated NEPA and NFMA because it approved the Project in the Buck Holland subunit knowing that it would never comply with the 19/19/68 objectives of Amendment 19. The EA states at the completion of the project, the road density levels in the Buck Holland subunit will be 24/37/40. AR 1709.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Forest Service claims that there is an important distinction between the standards and objectives. According to the Forest Service, the only mandatory requirement is that a project result in \"no net increase in open motorized road density and no net decrease in the size or amount of security core.\" Further, the Forest Service argues that the ten-year objectives have not yet been triggered and will not be triggered until December 31, 2018. For these reasons, the Forest Service believes that the Project in the Buck Holland subunit complies with Amendment 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Amendment 19 itself does not clearly indicate how the standards and objectives are different from one another and whether the objectives are mandatory. This is important to determine because the Project proposed in the Buck Holland subunit will not comply with either the five or ten-year objectives at its conclusion. However, the Notice of Decision giving rise to Amendment 19 provides better instruction. It clearly distinguishes between standards and objectives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 52643. Listed under the heading \"Forest-wide Standards for Grizzly Bear\" the section instructs that no Forest Service actions will result in a net increase in total or open motorized density, nor will it decrease security core. AR 52643. It also states that all \"Forest Service actions will result in a net gain towards the objectives on National Forest System lands.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the heading \"Forest-wide Objective for Grizzly Bear,\" the section sets forth the five and ten-year objectives as already described.\n   <em>\n    See AR\n   </em>\n   52643. What this document makes clear is that the minimum requirement for any Forest Service action is that it move the area closer to compliance with the Forest objectives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Here, the Project does not clearly violate the dictates of Amendment 19. Within the Buck Holland subunit, pre-project road density is calculated at 24/41/40. AR 1709. Post-project density is calculated at 24/37/40.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This result does not increase open road density, it decreases total road density, and security core remains the same.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In the Beaver Creek subunit, pre-project road density is calculated at 6/26/66.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Post-project density is calculated at 6/19/68.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This meets the ten-year objectives for total road density and security core, and is well below the proscribed ratio for open motorized density.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This result clearly satisfies the requirement that every Forest Service action \"must result in a net gain towards the objective on National Forest system lands.\" AR 52643. For this reason, the agency was not arbitrary or capricious in concluding that the Project complied with Amendment 19, assuming the agency calculated road density standards correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Exclusion of ISS Roads from Density Calculations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Forest Plan is clear that only \"reclaimed roads\" may be excluded from road density calculations.

This can be accomplished through one or a combination of treatments including: recontouring to original slope, placement of natural debris, or revegetation with shrubs or trees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   AR 56218.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The definition goes on to explain the minimum treatments required to achieve \"reclaimed\" status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Subsection (d) of the \"minimum treatment requirements\" explains that \"it is the intent\n   <em>\n    in many cases\n   </em>\n   that the reclaimed road no longer function as a road again.\" AR 56219 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Friends claims that the ISS roads do not meet the definition of a \"reclaimed road,\" and therefore should not have been excluded from the road density calculation. According to Friends, this is because the Forest Service's intent in placing these roads into \"intermittent storage\" is clearly to use the roads again in the future. Furthermore, the Forest Service's proposed treatment to the roads-to place them \"in a self-maintaining condition\"-is inconsistent with the \"minimum requirements\" of a \"reclaimed road.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Forest Service argues, in essence, that Friends has taken a selective reading of the EA. The Forest Service concedes that the EA defines ISS roads as \"roads closed to motorize traffic that are placed in a self-maintaining condition,\" AR 60378, but argues that the EA also explains that the ISS roads will meet the definition of a \"reclaimed road\" and proposes numerous treatments that would accomplish \"reclaimed\" status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court agrees. In subsequent sections, the EA provides considerably greater detail on its proposed treatments. In Table 16, the EA explains that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Stored roads (ISS) will be thoroughly treated so that they are completely impassable to motorized vehicles and meet the minimum criteria for a \"reclaimed road\" as defined by Forest Plan Amendment 19. The intent will be that ISS treatments will no longer function as roads, yet these roads will retain a road number and stay on the road system. ISS roads will continue to have a legal closure order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   AR 60387.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The table goes on to describe the particular treatments that the ISS roads will receive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   These proposed treatments\n   clearly indicate that the Forest Service is aware of the rigorous requirements to achieve \"reclaimed\" status and is prepared to implement them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Friends also contends that the concept of a \"reclaimed road\" is ideologically at odds with the Forest Service's intent in placing them in \"intermittent storage.\" According to Friends, this indicates that the Forest Service intends to use these roads in the future. Friends argues that this is incompatible with the notion that a \"reclaimed road\" is one that will never function as a road again.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   However, it is not a requirement of a \"reclaimed road\" that the Forest Service never intend to use the road again. Subsection (d) of the \"minimum requirements\" section states only that it is the \"intent in many cases\" that the reclaimed road never function as a road again. This leaves open the possibility that there are some cases where the roads may be intended to be used as roads in the future. Nonetheless, the crucial characteristic of a \"reclaimed road\" is its lack of functionality, not its future purpose. The definition makes clear that a \"reclaimed road\" is one that \"has been treated in such a manner so as to no longer\n   <em>\n    function\n   </em>\n   as a road or trail.\" AR 56218 (emphasis added). The ISS roads therefore comply with the definition of a \"reclaimed road\" because post-treatment they will no longer function as roads, and will remain roads in number only. For this reason the Forest Service's determination that the Project complies with Amendment 19 of the Forest Plan was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Lastly, Friends argues that the agency's exclusion of ISS roads from its road density calculations constitutes an abrupt change in position or policy, and therefore violates NEPA. The Court was unable to find any clear statement of this position or policy within the Forest Plan, the Beaver Creek EA, or the Notice of Decision. The Chilly James EA does appear to include ISS roads in its density calculation. However, the Chilly James EA also proposes to treat its ISS roads very differently from the Beaver Creek Project. AR 61924-25, 61931. The Court therefore dismisses this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Road Density in Elk Moist Sites\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Friends argues that the EA violates NEPA and NFMA because it fails to disclose the road density standards in elk moist sites and because it misrepresents that \"no such standard exists.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Forest Service argues that the Forest Plan is far from clear in how or what it requires in terms of elk security. The Forest Service explains that the Forest Plan identifies two components of elk habitat: moist sites and security areas. AR 52353. \"Security areas\" are composed of \"areas associated with the moist sites that provide security and other necessary components of elk summer habitat.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"Moist sites,\" on the other hand, are \"composed of specific habitat types, topographic situations, and elevations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While the Forest Plan requires that \"[a]reas with moist sites will\n   be managed during the elk use period, with open road densities that average 1 mile or less per square mile,\" the Forest Service observes that the Forest Plan does not define \"moist site,\" \"elk use period,\" and does not set the spatial scale at which the open road density standard of one mile per square mile should apply. The Forest Service argues that these ambiguities leave the agency with discretion in determining whether the Project provides sufficient elk security in moist areas during the elk-use period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Here, the Court concludes that the EA's conclusion that the Project's \"moist areas are located away from roads and contain high elk security,\" AR 60754, does not clearly conflict with the language of the Forest Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The EA explains that elk security (areas with brush cover away from roads) is largely present in the Project area, due mostly to the stringent road density requirements for grizzly bear habitat. AR 60753. As it pertains the elk, the EA provides that the Project area includes no elk winter range lands, and that \"elk remain on higher elevation summer ranges until forced down to lower elevations by snow and severe weather.\" AR 60752. The EA goes on to note that the Mission Mountains Wilderness \"provides high elk security during the summer and early fall months due to difficulty of hunter access.\" AR 60753. These statements form the basis for the EA's ultimate conclusion that \"[m]oist areas in the project are located away from roads and contain high elk security.\" AR 60754. This is because non-winter \"moist areas\" used by elk are located within the Mission Mountain Wilderness, where there are no roads.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Friends is correct that the only clear road density calculation within this section states that \"only 6 percent of the [Project] area exceeds 1 mile/square mile open motorized access.\" AR 60753. There is no road formal determination made that road density in elk moist areas during the elk use period average less than 1 mile per square mile. However, because the section provides sufficient information to logically conclude\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   , the Court determines that the section meets NEPA's procedural requirements. The Court will defer to the agency where there is \"a rational connection between the facts found and the conclusions made.\"\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n    418 F.3d at 960\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Reconsult Grizzly Bear Subunit Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Friends argues that a new Biological Opinion is required to assess the effects of the grizzly bear population in the aftermath of the Legacy Lands acquisition. This argument arises in light of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Swan View Coalition v. Weber\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   While the Forest Service initiated consultations to \"revise the implementation schedule for [Amendment 19]\" in 2009, it was not completed until 2014. At that time, the 2014 Biological Opinion assumed that the 19/19/68 objectives would not apply to the seven newly acquired grizzly bear subunits. The Court's opinion has since changed that position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The question is whether application of the 19/19/68 objectives over the seven new grizzly bear subunits constitutes \"new information\" triggering a mandatory consultation under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.16\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) to (c).

AR 10294, 10303-04. Additionally, the Biological Opinion assessed the effects of these seven subunits on grizzly populations by assuming that they would be managed in accordance with the general Forest Plan standard that there be \"no net increase in [open or total motorized access density\" and no decrease in security core.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.16\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As previously noted, this is the minimum requirement of any action on forest service land, but it certainly does not preclude an action from going further-that is, from moving the project area closer into compliance with the 19/19/68 objectives. Further improvement within these subunits was expressly contemplated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   For example, the effects of decommissioning 8.4 miles of road within the Glacier Loon and Buck Holland subunits as a result of the Glacier Loon Project was considered to \"improve\" the conditions within those subunits, moving them closer into compliance with the 19/19/68 objectives. AR 10302.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   After the Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Swan View Coalition v. Weber\n   </em>\n   , the Forest Service informally consulted with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to determine whether application of the 19/19/68 objectives required a new Biological Opinion. The determination made at the time was that the seven subunits were sufficiently addressed within the 2014 Biological Opinion, and it was therefore not \"new information.\" AR 61095, 1896. Though this decision itself is not conclusive of the issue, it further assures the Court that that the application of the 19/19/68 objectives and the need for further improvement in decreasing road density and increasing security core was adequately considered across all subunits and is therefore not \"new information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, the Court concludes that the agency was not arbitrary or capricious in failing to initiate a new Biological Opinion to account for the transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Having reviewed all of Friends' claims,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   IT IS ORDERED that Defendant's Motion (Doc. 12) is GRANTED.

The court stated that \"NEPA does not require the government to do the impractical,\" and noted that such a requirement would \"require a level of analysis sufficient to stop all action in the Forest while every conceivable effect is catalogued.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047035\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/754/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Because the EA adequately discloses the total acreage of foraging stand imitation and non-foraging habitat reduced from the Glacier Loon Project within the Lower and Upper Beaver LAU, which extends the analysis area beyond that of the project boundary, the Court concludes that the agency was not arbitrary and capricious by failing to disclose the entire extent of lynx habitat impacted from the Glacier Loon project.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    The definition states that \"minimum treatments include: (a) The entire road will receive treatment such that maintenance or entries to maintain \"road drainage\" is not needed.... (b) The first portion of the road (typically 200 to 600 feet) will be treated in such a manner so as to preclude its use as a motorized or non-motorized travel way. This will include: (1) making the road junction area unattractive as a travel way, and (2) treating the remainder of the first portion to make awareness of the road improbable and preclude motorized or non-motorized use. (c) Treat the road, other than the first portion, in a way that will discourage its use as a motorized or non-motorized travelway .... (d) It is the intent in many cases that the reclaimed road no longer function as a road again ...\" AR 56218-19.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The table explains that \"the entire road will receive treatment such that maintenance or entries to maintain road drainage is not needed. Culverts aligned with stream channels will be removed. Road related sediment sources will be repaired and road (sic) reworked to eliminate ditch water flow without the aid of cross drain culverts. Typically this is achieved by cutting waterbars into the ditch line every 200 feet. Waterbars can be placed closer or further apart depending on site specific conditions and are typically installed 50ft (sic) above grade or near existing cross drains. The first portion of the road (200 to 600 feet) will be recontoured to the original hillslope. In level topography where recontouring is not feasible[,] rock barriers or berms and placement of natural debris will be used to make the road junction unattractive as travel way and preclude motorized or non-motorized use on the remainder of the first portion of road (first 200 to 600 feet). Beyond the first portion of the road (200 to 600 feet), the roadway will be treated to discourage use including sporadic placement of natural debris where available and seeding or planting to encourage re-vegetation.\" AR 60387.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    The Biological Opinion expressly describes the need for improved management within these subunits.
