Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   This case raises serious issues about sentencing generally, and supervised release for marijuana users specifically: Are we imposing longer terms than are needed for effective supervised release? Should we stop punishing supervisees for a marijuana addiction or habit?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After revisiting and reconsidering these issues, I conclude: (1) I, like other trial judges, have in many cases imposed longer periods of supervised release than needed, and I, like other trial judges, have failed to terminate supervised release early in many cases where continuing supervision presents such a burden as to reduce the probability of rehabilitation; and (2) I, like other trial judges, have provided unnecessary conditions of supervised release and unjustifiably punished supervisees for their marijuana addiction, even though marijuana is widely used in the community and is an almost unbreakable addiction or habit for some. As a result of these errors in our sentencing practice, money and the time of our probation officers are wasted, and supervisees are unnecessarily burdened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In summary, in this and my future cases I will: (1) impose shorter terms of supervised release as needed; (2) give greater consideration to the appropriateness of conditions; (3) provide for earlier termination where indicated; and (4) avoid violations of supervised release and punishment by incarceration merely for habitual marijuana use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A. Supervised Release\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The purpose of federal supervised release is to assist people who have served prison terms with rehabilitation and reintegration into the law-abiding community. The United States Probation Department (\"Probation Department\") monitors individuals on supervised release and can help a supervisee with his or her reintegration into lawful society by providing drug treatment, mental health counseling, vocational training, and many other services to help reduce recidivism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Violating a condition of supervised release can lead to-and in instances must lead to-additional incarceration. This situation can trap some defendants, particularly substances abusers, in a cycle where they oscillate between supervised release and prison.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [This is] the sinister side of probation the place where the promise of redemption is subverted by a lurking punitiveness.... Sanctions imposed for probation violations ... frequently lead to disproportionate sentences, with probation merely becoming a staging area for eventual imprisonment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Nora V. Demleitner,\n   <em>\n    How to Change the Philosophy and Practice of Probation and Supervised Release: Data Analytics, Cost Control, Focus on Reentry, and a Clear Mission\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Fed.%20Sent%27g%20Rep.%20231\">\n    28 Fed. Sent'g Rep. 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Connections with family and community organizations-religious or secular-are an aid to, and indication of, rehabilitation and reentry into normal, lawful life.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mark T. Berg &amp; Beth M. Huebner,\n   <em>\n    Reentry and the Ties That Bind: An Examination of Social Ties, Employment, and Recidivism\n   </em>\n   , 28 Just. Q. 382 (2011). Every time a connection is broken with the world outside of prison, by unnecessary incarceration following violations of supervised release, it probably becomes more difficult to reconnect. The court must consider such factors in finding violations during supervised release.\n   <em>\n    Cf. Reentry Program - Recidivism Reduction\n   </em>\n   , Aleph Institute (June 25, 2018), https://aleph-institute.org/wp/programs/reentry-services/ (offering reentry programs and community connections to reduce recidivism).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Probation Department in this court merits high praise for its work. Our probation officers do a difficult job well; often they have a helpful impact on criminal defendants' lives. Recognizing the possibility of over-supervision, our Probation Department has now taken measures to reduce supervision burdens by (1) tapering off supervision over time; (2) creating a \"low intensity\" supervision program; and (3) recommending early termination when warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The resources of the Probation Department are limited.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   U.S. Courts,\n   <em>\n    Probation Offices Look to Technology to Offset Budget, Staffing Reductions\n   </em>\n   (Apr. 18, 2012) (discussing innovative measures taken by the Probation Department to offset budgetary concerns). The Probation Department should be focused on assisting those defendants with the potential for success, not on those doomed to fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The significance of terms and conditions of supervised release is often ignored when sentencing.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Christine S. Scott-Hayward,\n   <em>\n    Shadow Sentencing: The Imposition of Federal Supervised Release\n   </em>\n   , 18 Berkeley J. Crim. L. 180, 190 (2013). At the sentencing hearing, the term of supervised release is seldom discussed; defense counsel, Assistant United States Attorneys, and the court assume it will be imposed for a significant period (usually three or five years). The sentencing hearing centers on the incarceration term. Going forward, more careful attention should be given to the potential of supervised release, and its duration, to help-or to prevent-rehabilitation. Proposals of the American Law Institute to improve all aspects of sentencing are excellent, but generally beyond the powers of a trial judge to implement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   American Law Institute, Model Penal Code: Sentencing (Proposed Final Draft), \u00a7 6.09, at 197 (2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   B. Marijuana and Supervised Release\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Without addressing the advantages and dangers of the change in criminal laws on smoking marijuana, it is obvious that marijuana use, through law, policy, and social custom, is becoming increasingly accepted by society. Many people from all walks of life now use marijuana without fear of adverse legal consequences. In New York, where marijuana policy is evolving in favor of decriminalization, serious racial and social-class disparities exist in the enforcement of anti-marijuana laws.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Benjamin Mueller, Robert Gebeloff, &amp; Sahil Chinoy,\n   <em>\n    Surest Way to Face Marijuana Charges in New York: Be Black or Hispanic\n   </em>\n   , N.Y. Times, May 13, 2018, at A1 (reporting that African Americans are arrested at eight times the rate of White\n   people in New York City despite equal marijuana usage rates).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Yet, marijuana remains illegal for all purposes under federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Silvia Irimescu,\n   <em>\n    Marijuana Legalization: How Government Stagnation Hinders Legal Evolution and Harms A Nation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20Gonz.%20L.%20Rev.%20241\">\n    50 Gonz. L. Rev. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249 (2015) ;\n   <em>\n    but cf.\n   </em>\n   Sadie Gurman &amp; Natalie Andrews,\n   <em>\n    Jeff Sessions Struggles to Get Planned Marijuana Crackdown Going\n   </em>\n   , Wall St. J., June 10, 2018 (discussion of a \"bipartisan bill\" which would prevent the federal government from interfering with state laws legalizing marijuana). Marijuana use violates a mandatory condition of federal supervised release and can require mandatory incarceration for some supervisees.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section III(B)-(E)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Effectively, courts are faced with a choice: imprison a marijuana user on supervised release or cut short supervision, forcing an attempt at further rehabilitation on the supervisee's own. Many men and women who have terms of incarceration imposed by this court are seeking to live productive, law-abiding lives, but are derailed by their marijuana addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Like many federal trial judges, I have been terminating supervision for \"violations\" by individuals with long-term marijuana habits who are otherwise rehabilitated. No useful purpose is served through the continuation of supervised release for many defendants whose only illegal conduct is following the now largely socially acceptable habit of marijuana use. The cost to tax-payers of long, repeating sentences and extended, unnecessary supervised release is substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   C. Defendant Tyran Trotter\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Tyran Trotter, like many of his peers who fall into crime, comes from a broken home. He never knew his father. His mother struggles with drug addiction. His brother was apparently murdered. At fourteen he was placed in foster care. By sixteen he had half-a-dozen arrests on his record. He was convicted of a federal drug distribution charge and sentenced to two years imprisonment before he could legally drink alcohol. Now twenty-two years old, Trotter is on federal supervised release trying to lead a productive life, with a chronic problem holding him back: marijuana addiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Trotter began smoking marijuana when he was twelve years old. After serving his prison term, he has stayed out of trouble. Rehabilitation and reintegration into society are the most important roles the criminal justice system ought to play in his life. But, he should be returned to prison under prior practice because his marijuana use conflicts with federal law and the conditions of his supervision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Supervised release is now being terminated by this court for Tyran Trotter. Its continuation would inhibit rehabilitation. He must attempt to lead a productive life on his own. As he himself put the matter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   There's not a day that I don't wake up that I don't think about how I was one of the big shots and I had a lot of money and I was doing my thing and breaking the rules.

Revocation of Supervised Release\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Although the idea of revocation as punishment for the supervisee's failure to follow Probation's instructions is foreign to the purpose of supervised release, it was included in the statute. Revocation was originally introduced by Senator Strom Thurmond, in 1985, and was adopted as a \"technical\" change contained within the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (\"ADAA\"). Doherty,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 1000.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   With this \"technical amendment\" and the revocation mechanism it created, Congress brought back conditional release. In enacting the ADAA, however, little consideration seems to have been given to the conceptual differences between supervised release and probation incorporated into the SRA. The adoption of the revocation mechanism did not even warrant a separate header to draw attention to the change....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   For those accustomed to parole and probation, the absence of a revocation mechanism for supervised release seemed like an \"impractical oddit[y].\" Many actors in the system wondered how supervised release could be effective unless courts and probation officers were granted systematic leverage over offenders. And leverage had always meant prison.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Procedurally, the ADAA grafted the revocation mechanism for probation onto supervised release, ignoring the different theoretical roots of those systems. Judges could now \"revoke\" a term of supervised release after finding, by a simple preponderance of the evidence, that the person had violated a condition of supervision. There was to be no trial and no jury; courts were to apply the same rules of diluted procedure applicable to parole and probation revocation hearings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The term \"revoke\" appears to be somewhat of a misnomer. Parole was based on early release from prison-by the grace of the parole board a person was conditionally released from prison, and the leniency could be \"revoked.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 985. A person on supervised release has completed his or her prison term and is serving an independent term of supervision separately ordered\n   by the court. Supervised release is not being \"revoked\"; rather, a supervisee is being punished for violating conditions and for the individual or general deterrence of the punishment. A conceptual oddity exists:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   The supervised release statute continued to instruct judges not to consider the goals of punishment and incapacitation when deciding whether to impose-and now revoke-supervised release. And yet, the possibility of revocation made supervised release indisputably about punishment, oversight, and coercion. Judges and probation officers were to gauge how well released prisoners were adjusting with the threat of more prison hanging overhead. Despite the statutory bar on punishment, people on supervised release could now be sent back to prison for conduct that did not even violate a federal criminal statute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1002.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Notwithstanding its shaky theoretical underpinnings, revocation proceedings are central to federal supervised release.

Two of the problems are relatively minor, and we mention them quickly to get them out of the way. One is the number-thirty [although now slightly reduced]-and the other the variety of the listed discretionary conditions. The sheer number may induce haste in the judge's evaluation of the probation service's recommendations and is doubtless a factor in the frequent failure of judges to apply the sentencing factors in section 3553(a) to all the recommended conditions included in the sentence....

These three sets of decisions would decrease the potential for violations while allowing the court and the probation team to focus on higher-risk individual offenders. Those persons should have individualized requirements imposed and supervision provided to help prevent recidivism and assist rehabilitation. Although initially more work for a judge, in the long run such thoughtful decisions may decrease the need for judicial intervention and sanctions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Demleitner,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 233 (emphasis added). \"Federal judges may need to begin to focus on questions of whether to impose [supervised release], for how long, and what discretionary conditions to attach.

In evaluating the utility of any particular defendant, courts should distinguish between conditions that are aimed simply at establishing control over \"criminals\" and conditions that provide reintegrative services, such as job-training or mental health treatment.

When the assessment indicates that ... the offender is likely to remain crime free and to comply with all other conditions without further interventions by the officer, the case should be supervised under ... low intensity standards.... Working smart means never supervising offenders more intrusively than required by their assessed risks and needs at any given time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Some supervisees, such as sex offenders, are ineligible for the program.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A supervisee must go six months without a positive drug test to qualify.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Whether this limit is a hard-and-fast rule for all cases is not clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The Probation Department also recommends early termination in appropriate cases. Consistent with case law,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III(D), Probation Department policy states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   It is a common misconception that early termination under \u00a7 3583(e)(l) must be based on an offender's significantly changed circumstances or extraordinarily good performance under supervision.

[A] court must simply be satisfied that\n   the termination is warranted and is in the interest of justice....

This habit will lead to conflict between Trotter and his probation supervisor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   If his supervision continues, he will probably end up in the almost endless cycle of supervised release and prison. Because the revocation statute requires jail time for drug use,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   Section III(B), he is likely to be sent back to prison, to be followed by a term of supervised release, which, when violated, will again send him back to prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   V.
