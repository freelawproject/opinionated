I agree that the arbitration will be administered by either the American Arbitration Association or its successor (\"AAA\") or the American Dispute Resolution Center or its successor (\"ADRC\") at the discretion of the party first filing a demand for arbitration. I understand that AAA will administer the arbitration in accordance with its administrative rules (including, as applicable, the Commercial Rules of the AAA and the Expedited Procedures of such rules), and ADRC will administer the arbitration in accordance with its administrative rules (including, as applicable, the Rules of Commercial Arbitration or under the Rules for Expedited Commercial Arbitration).

The Franchise Application also does not contain any promises to send applicants additional information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After an initial review of DAI's Petition and Alemayehu's Objection, it appeared to the court that consideration was lacking. However, because the parties had not fully addressed the issue in their original submissions, the court ordered the parties to \"submit evidence and/or argument to the court\" on the issue of whether the alleged contract was supported by consideration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (Doc.

DAI also argues that the parties delegated the question of whether the arbitration provision was supported by consideration to the arbitrator.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.

The court need not assess the merits of these cases, however, because they are inapposite. In this case, DAI did not make a legally enforceable promise to consider Alemayehu's Franchise Application. As noted above, there is no language in the Franchise Application binding DAI to consider franchise applications, to provide applicants with additional information, or to respond to everyone who applies. Indeed, DAI does not sign the application. Had Alemayehu's application simply languished, unread, in an electronic inbox, nothing in the Franchise Application gives Alemayehu the right to sue-or arbitrate-for breach of contract. Therefore, assuming, without deciding, that a promise to consider an application is sufficient consideration, that does not dictate the outcome in this case where no promise to review the Franchise Application was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a Declaration submitted in support of DAI's Response to the court's Order regarding consideration, Senior Associate General Counsel for DAI, David Cousins, states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   In return for the provision of [information provided by applicants], DAI considers the information provided in the application and elsewhere and decides whether to grant the applicant the right to purchase a Subway franchise and sign a franchise agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Declaration of David Cousins (\"Cousins Decl.\") (Doc. No. 29-1) at \u00b6 12. Cousins does not, however, cite the court to any language in the Franchise Application or any other written or oral contract provisions containing a promise by DAI to review all applications that are filed. The court concludes that nothing in the Franchise Application actually binds DAI to consider all the applications that it receives. For example, if DAI decided it had enough franchises in Colorado, nothing in the Franchise Application precludes DAI from unilaterally deciding not to review any applications submitted for Colorado-based franchises. Furthermore, neither DAI nor Alemayehu has suggested that the alleged contract between the parties consists of additional documents or oral communications. Cousins's statement that DAI\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   consider applications is not equivalent to a promise to Alemayehu that DAI\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   consider his Franchise Application. The possibility, or even likelihood, that DAI will consider Alemayehu's Franchise Application is not a promise and is not, therefore, sufficient consideration to find that the Franchise Application is a valid and enforceable contract.\n   <em>\n    W.

The court's conclusion with respect to consideration was based on a declaration submitted in support of DAI's Petition to Compel Arbitration by Ralph Piselli, who was a Franchise Sales Manager for Subway restaurants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Ralph Piselli (Doc. No. 2-7),\n   <em>\n    Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Burr\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-1335 (JCH).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, DAI has submitted no evidence to support their position that the Franchise Application in some way binds them to consider applications or requires them to provide applicants with information about opening franchises. In addition, in\n   <em>\n    Burr\n   </em>\n   , the defendants did not dispute that a valid arbitration agreement was in place, but instead attacked the scope of the agreement and its relevance to the claims they were trying to litigate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Answer (Doc. No. 13),\n   <em>\n    Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Burr\n   </em>\n   , 3:16-cv-1335 (JCH). In other words, this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Burr\n   </em>\n   both as a matter of the record before the court and the arguments raised by the parties. Furthermore, to the extent that the court's conclusion in this Ruling is inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Burr\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Burr\n   </em>\n   Ruling is not binding on this court. Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Burr\n   </em>\n   does not alter the court's conclusion that DAI did not promise to review or consider the Franchise Application submitted by Alemayehu and, therefore, while the Franchise Application may have been considered, that was not legally sufficient consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Mutual Promise to Arbitrate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   DAI has characterized the arbitration clause as a mutual agreement to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition at \u00b6 7 (\"The Franchise Application contains a dispute resolution clause requiring the parties to arbitrate 'any and all previously unasserted claims, disputes, or controversies arising out of or relating to my application or candidacy for the grant of a Subway franchise from [DAI].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   If the arbitration provision was a mutual agreement to arbitrate, that alone would be sufficient to constitute consideration.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nowak v.

However, the arbitration provision at issue, like the rest of the Franchise Application, is not mutual: it is a unilateral promise to arbitrate by the applicant, Alemayehu.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Franchise Application at 3 (\"I agree that I will settle any and all previously unasserted claims, disputes or controversies arising out of or relating to my application or candidacy for the grant of a SUBWAY franchise from Franchisor, pursuant to the laws of Connecticut, USA, and by binding arbitration only.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nowak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20192084\">\n    2009 WL 192084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (\"[C]onsideration other than the promise to arbitrate is required where the arbitration agreement is not mutual.\").

Nothing in the arbitration provision requires\n   DAI to arbitrate. Notably, DAI did not sign the Franchise Application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   DAI cites the court to a slew of cases in which a mutual agreement to arbitrate was sufficient consideration to make an arbitration clause binding and enforceable. As acknowledged above, this court agrees. However, unlike here, the agreements to arbitrate at issue in the cases cited by DAI were mutual.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hellenic Lines, Ltd. v.

Conn. 1996) (\"[T]his Handbook is our entire agreement concerning\n   <em>\n    each party's\n   </em>\n   right to arbitrate employment disputes ....\" (emphasis added) ). In short, the existence of a mutual agreement to arbitrate in the cases cited by DAI makes those cases materially distinguishable from this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Whether the Question of Consideration Is a Question for the Arbitrator\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In its Response to the court's Order regarding consideration, DAI also argues that \"[t]he Court does not need to decide whether the Franchise Application or the agreement to arbitrate is a contract or is supported by sufficient consideration because the parties have delegated these issues to the arbitrator.\" Pl.'s Response at 9. However, this argument by DAI assumes that an enforceable agreement to arbitrate between the parties exists; the parties have only \"delegated these issues to the arbitrator\" if they agreed to arbitrate in the first place. The Second Circuit has expressly rejected such an argument: \"Inasmuch as the arbitrator has no authority of any kind with respect to a matter at issue absent an agreement to arbitrate, the question of whether such an agreement exists\n   <em>\n    and is effective\n   </em>\n   is necessarily for the court and not the arbitrator.\"\n   <em>\n    Trilegiant\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623805\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/110/#p118\">\n    697 F.3d at 118\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In light of the court's conclusion above that there was no contractual agreement to arbitrate because the promises contained in the Franchise Application were entirely unilateral, the parties have not agreed to delegate any issues to the arbitrator because they have not agreed on anything.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, DAI asserts that the delegation provision itself is mutual and, therefore, constitutes consideration for the arbitration provision and the contract as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Response at 10. In light of the court's conclusion that, by the plain language of the Franchise Application, DAI has not promised to arbitrate any claims\n   <em>\n    it\n   </em>\n   may elect to bring arising out of the Franchise Application, it has also not agreed to delegate threshold questions of arbitrability to an arbitrator with respect to\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   claims. That DAI is willing to delegate threshold questions of arbitrability of\n   <em>\n    Alemayehu's\n   </em>\n   claims is not consideration, since by doing so DAI is neither giving Alemayehu anything of value nor giving up anything of value to itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hatlee v. Hardey\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-2469-RM-MJW,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205719644\">\n    2015 WL 5719644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (D.

It has not bound itself to so arbitrate. Further, at the time the agreement was signed by Alemayehu, DAI did not sign it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the court concludes that the Franchise Application was not supported by consideration and, therefore, the parties did not agree to arbitrate.
