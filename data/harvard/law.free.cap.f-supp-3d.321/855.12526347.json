Leinenweber, Judge\n   This case involves the overlap, and potential conflict, between core areas of state and federal power: the state's traditional police powers and the federal government's broad, undoubted power over immigration. In order to advance federal immigration policies, the Attorney General attached several new immigration-related conditions to a longstanding federal grant which provides funds to local and state police departments. Those immigration-related conditions conflict with Chicago's policy goals of promoting cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities and ensuring access to essential city services for all city residents regardless of citizenship status. Chicago brought suit to enjoin the Attorney General from attaching those conditions to the grant funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is the Attorney General's Motion to Dismiss the Complaint in its entirety and the City of Chicago's Partial Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts I, II, and V.

No. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The dispute centers around the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (the \"Byrne JAG grant\"), a federal grant named after a fallen New York City police officer which awards funds to states and local jurisdictions to support criminal justice initiatives for personnel, equipment, training, and other community services.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010152\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Byrne JAG program distributes grant funds by a statutorily-defined formula based on a state's population and the number of violent crimes reported within that jurisdiction in the past year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010156\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To receive funds under the program, the would-be grantee must submit an application and comply with all conditions outlined in the Solicitation document provided by the Attorney General. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2010153\">\n    34 U.S.C. \u00a7 10153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , FY 2017 Local Solicitation, Ex. T to Pl.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 157-20.) The City of Chicago and its neighboring localities have received Byrne JAG funds every year since 2005. In 2016, Chicago used those funds to buy police vehicles and to support the efforts of non-profit organizations working in its high crime communities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"Facts\") \u00b6 14, Dkt. No. 168; Sachs Decl. \u00b6 4, Dkt. No. 154.) The funds at issue now were originally earmarked to be distributed in 2017, but this litigation ensued. Should Chicago receive those 2017 funds, the City intends to expand its use of \"SpotShotter\" acoustic surveillance technology, which allows officers to pinpoint the location of gun shots across the City and thus respond more quickly. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 15, Dkt. No. 168.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The grant conditions causing Chicago umbrage are related to federal immigration enforcement. In 2016, the Attorney General determined that various state and local policies of withholding information and other cooperation from federal immigration\n   authorities were frustrating the federal government's immigration-related goals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 31, 2016 Office of Inspector General Mem., Ex. H to Def.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 140-8.) Citing public safety concerns, the Attorney General announced that the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") would award Byrne JAG grants only to localities that: share certain immigration-related information with federal immigration agencies, allow immigration agents access to local detention facilities, and provide notice before releasing certain undocumented individuals. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DOJ Press Release, Ex. B to Compl., Dkt. No. 1-2.) In this suit, Chicago challenges all three of these new conditions (hereafter, \"the Conditions\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. The \"Access Condition\" requires that Byrne JAG recipients permit personnel of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") to access any detention facility to meet with undocumented immigrants and inquire as to their right to be or remain in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. The \"Notice Condition\" requires that Byrne JAG recipients provide DHS at least 48 hours advance notice of the scheduled release date and time of an alien in the jurisdiction's custody whenever DHS requests such notice in order to take custody of the alien upon release. The Attorney General later amended this Condition to clarify that \"[i]n the event that ...the scheduled release date and time for an alien are such as not to permit the advance notice [of scheduled release]...it shall not be a violation of this condition to provide only as much advance notice as practicable.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. The \"Compliance Condition\" requires that Byrne JAG recipients certify compliance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a federal statute that bars local governments from restricting the sharing of immigration status information with federal law enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FY 2017 Local Solicitation, Ex. T to Pl.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 157-20; Example Byrne JAG award documents, Exs. F, G to Jennings Decl., Dkt. No. 158.) The Attorney General added the Notice and Access Conditions for the first time in FY 2017, but the Compliance Condition also applied the previous year. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to Chicago, these Conditions conflict with longstanding City policy of ensuring access to essential city services regardless of a resident's citizenship status and of promoting cooperation between local law enforcement and immigrant communities. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1, Dkt. No. 1.) Chicago's local policies protecting immigrant rights date back to 1985, when they were first embodied in executive orders and then eventually codified. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 4-8, Dkt. No. 168.) The City's Welcoming City Ordinance, enacted in 2012, encapsulates its current policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) Though Chicago's policy and others like it are commonly referred to as \"sanctuary city policies,\" the Seventh Circuit has recognized the inaptness of that term.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n    888 F.3d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the term is \"commonly misunderstood\" and does not accurately describe the effect of such policies).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Welcoming City Ordinance reflects both the City's determination that effective police work relies on willing community assistance and its belief that the \"cooperation of the city's immigrant communities is essential to prevent and solve crimes and maintain public order, safety and security in the entire city.\" Chicago, Ill. Muni. Code \u00a7 2-173-005. The City intended the Welcoming City Ordinance to clarify both the\n   communications and enforcement relationship between the City and the federal government as well as the specific conduct City employees are prohibited from undertaking, given the City's view that such prohibited conduct would \"significantly harm[ ] the city's relationship with immigrant communities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Specifically, the Ordinance prohibits all City agents and agencies from: requesting or disclosing information about an individual's immigration status,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 2-173-020, -030; detaining anyone based solely on their immigration status or an ICE detainer,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-173-042(a); and spending on-duty time \"responding to ICE inquiries or communicating with ICE regarding a person's custody status or release date,\" unless the responding City employee is \"acting pursuant to a legitimate law enforcement purpose that is unrelated to the enforcement of a civil immigration law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-173-042(b). Notably, these prohibitions do not apply to certain classes of potentially dangerous individuals, including known gang members and those with outstanding criminal warrants, felony convictions, or pending felony charges.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-173-042(c);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Chicago Police Department (\"CPD\")'s Special Order S06-14-03, Ex. F to Pl.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 157 (reiterating the policies of the Welcoming City Ordinance and establishing rules for CPD officers in conformance therewith).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Chicago contends that the new Conditions put it in an untenable position, forcing the City either to accept the grant funds with the attached Conditions and-the City believes-lose the trust and cooperation of its immigrant communities\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   decline the grant and forgo much-needed funding for critical police resources and community services. (Compl. \u00b6 9.) Chicago argues that the Constitution protects it from making this Hobson's choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To that end, Chicago brings a seven-count Complaint, alleging constitutional infirmities and unlawful agency action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., Dkt. No. 1.) Counts I and II allege the Conditions are unconstitutional because the Byrne JAG statute does not provide the Attorney General statutory authority to impose them. Count III alleges the Conditions violate the Spending Clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Chicago's Count IV alleges that, independent of the Byrne JAG grant, Section 1373 is an impermissible federal conscription of state power and is thus unconstitutional under the anticommandeering doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Next, Chicago charges in Count V's declaratory judgment claim that even if Section 1373 is constitutional, the City complies with it and deserves judgment to that effect.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In Count VI, the City alleges the Attorney General's decision to impose the Conditions was arbitrary and capricious and thus violated the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And finally, Count VII alleges violations of the Paperwork Reduction Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After filing its Complaint, Chicago moved for a preliminary injunction as to all three Conditions. This Court found that Chicago was likely to succeed on its argument that the Attorney General lacked the statutory grant of authority to impose the Notice and Access Conditions and accordingly enjoined those Conditions nationwide.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266915\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/933/#p937\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the Court refused to enjoin the third condition, the Compliance Condition, finding the City not likely to succeed in arguing either that the Attorney General lacked the authority to impose it or that Section 1373-again, the statute with which Chicago must certify compliance under this third Condition-is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266915\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/933/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266915\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/933/#p937\">\n    at 945-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Attorney General appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Seventh Circuit panel affirmed, agreeing that Chicago demonstrated a likelihood of success that the Byrne JAG statute does not grant the Attorney General the authority to impose the Notice and Access Conditions and approving this Court's corresponding issuance of the nationwide preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

The Seventh Circuit granted the Attorney General's petition on the limited issue of the injunction's nationwide scope, thus vacating that portion of the panel opinion but leaving intact the finding that the Notice and Access Conditions are likely unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See En Banc\n   </em>\n   Order,\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

No. 128.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Turning to the matters now before the Court: The Attorney General moves to dismiss Chicago's Complaint in its entirety, and Chicago cross-moves for partial summary judgment. The Attorney General moves to dismiss the Complaint on two grounds, raising challenges to both this Court's subject matter jurisdiction and to the sufficiency of Chicago's Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1), (6). For its part, Chicago moves for summary judgment on only Counts I, II, and V. The City requests, first, a finding that all three Conditions are not authorized by the Byrne JAG statute and are thus\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   (Count I) and in violation of the separation of powers (Count II). With that request, the City urges the Court to reconsider its earlier-expressed belief that Chicago was not likely to succeed on this argument as to the Compliance Condition. Second, Chicago requests a declaratory judgment that, assuming the Compliance Condition is valid, the City complies with Section 1373 (Count V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As already described, the Attorney General moves to dismiss both by challenging jurisdiction and by asserting that the Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. FED. R. CIV. P. 12(b)(1), (6). To survive a 12(b)(1) motion, the plaintiff must carry the burden of providing sufficient evidence to establish a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case for personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    RAR, Inc. v.

In short, the Attorney General argues that because the DOJ has not yet reached a final decision on whether to award Chicago funds under the Byrne JAG grant, the DOJ has not yet consummated any \"final agency action\" that is ripe for judicial review.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Appropriate Rural Roads v.

The Court agrees with Chicago that this earlier determination is the one challenged by this suit.

Both of these conditions are clearly met here. The imposition of these Conditions by the Attorney General is far from \"tentative\"; Alan Hanson, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs at the DOJ, states in his declaration that every FY 2017 award-presumptively including the award Chicago seeks here-will include conditions identical to those attendant to the grant awards already handed out to Binghamton and Greenville, the only two cities to receive Byrne JAG funds thus far. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hanson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5-6, Dkt. 32-1 (\"[T]he award documents set[ ] out the various conditions...that\n   <em>\n    will apply\n   </em>\n   to the FY 2017 Byrne JAG award\" (emphasis added) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6 27, Dkt. No. 168.) Both of those awards explicitly require compliance with all three Conditions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Example Byrne JAG Award Documents, Exs. F, G to Jennings Decl., Dkt. Nos. 158-6, 158-7.) Further, all FY 2017 awards, including Chicago's potential one, are awarded based on applications invited by that year's grant Solicitation, which clearly imposes the Conditions as well. (FY 2017 Local Solicitation, Ex. T to Pl.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 157-20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s\n   Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 27-30, Dkt. No. 168.) Thus, the Attorney General's attachment of the Conditions is the end result of his decision-making process on this score. That satisfies the first requirement for finality under the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    520 U.S. at 177-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651295\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/154/#p177\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The second requirement is met as easily as the first.

New Jersey passed a law partially repealing its gambling prohibition anyway, claiming it could do so\n   because PASPA's edict to the contrary violated the Constitution's anticommandeering principle.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    at 1472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before the Supreme Court, the\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   respondents argued PASPA could not violate the Tenth Amendment because-much like this Court observed in its preliminary injunction ruling-the Supreme Court had only found such violations in cases where Congress went \"beyond precluding state action and affirmatively command[ed] it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    at 1478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Court rejected this argument, finding the \"distinction...empty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It reasoned that regardless whether a federal law commands state action or precludes it, \"[t]he basic principle that Congress cannot issue direct orders to state legislatures\" still applies.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration omitted). The reasoning highlights the Supreme Court's reluctance to rely on a distinction more reflective of sophisticated draftsmanship than substantive effect. Thus, PASPA, which \"unequivocally dictate[d] what a state legislature may and may not do,\" was held to be unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That holding pulls the lynchpin from this Court's earlier Section 1373 constitutionality analysis and demands that this Court reconsider that statute with fresh eyes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But before delving further into the anticommandeering analysis, the Court must first dispose of a threshold argument. The Attorney General argues that no anticommandeering claim exists here because compliance with Section 1373 is merely a condition on grant funds which Chicago is free to refuse. This argument ignores that Section 1373 is an extant federal law with which Chicago must comply, completely irrespective of whether or not the City accepts Byrne JAG funding. And the City's Count IV clearly recites Chicago's anticommandeering challenge to the law\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   , not to the law as a condition imposed on the grant. (\n   <em>\n    See Compl.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 132-135 \" Section 1373 is...facially unconstitutional\").) This distinction is important. No Tenth Amendment problem exists when a federal agency imposes grant conditions, because the Spending Clause empowers the federal government to offer funds in exchange for state action it could not otherwise demand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NFIB v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p537\">\n    567 U.S. 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p537\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2566\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407356\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/519/#p537\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 450\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (observing that the federal government may award grant funding that \"may well induce the States to adopt policies that the Federal Government itself could not impose\" (citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    South Dakota v.

Section 1373 imposes two overlapping regulations: First, subsection (a) prohibits any \"government entity or official\" from restricting any other \"government entity or official\" from exchanging immigration status information with INS. As is apparent, subsection (a) is directed exclusively to state actors. Second, subsection (b) prohibits any \"person or agency\" from doing the same.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Rather, this statute mandates that local government employees have the option of furnishing immigration information to the INS while acting in their official, state-employed capacities.

This weighs heavily on the constitutionality analysis. A state's ability to control its officers and employees lies at the heart of state sovereignty: \"To say that the Federal Government cannot control the State, but can control all of its officers, is to say nothing of significance. Indeed, it merits the description 'empty formalistic reasoning of the highest order.' \"\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    521 U.S. at 931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Adding credence to this constitutional objection is the fact that the information at issue is state-owned and only accessible to city employees in their official capacities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    at 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.17 (noting that a constitutionally-impermissible statute required state employees \"to provide information that belongs to the State and is available to them only in their official capacity\"). To illustrate further, it is clear under\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   that an explicit federal directive to state employees is unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (characterizing\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   ). Given the pre-\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   command-versus-proscription dichotomy, Congress, perhaps cautious of running afoul of the Tenth Amendment by demanding that states share immigration-status information, drafted Section 1373 to avoid the potential\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   problem by framing it as a prohibition on, rather than a directive to, state employees. Rather than requiring state employees to share immigration information with federal authorities, Section 1373 prohibits state policymakers from\n   <em>\n    preventing\n   </em>\n   their employees from sharing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet as\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   demonstrates, this draftsmanship does not diminish the infringement on state sovereignty.

This was the concern squarely addressed in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , where the Court observed that a \"more direct affront to state sovereignty is not easy to imagine\" than in a federal law that \"dictates what a state legislature may and may not do.\"\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . True, the statute in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   , which explicitly forbade local lawmaking, presented a clearer case than the one at bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But the spirit of\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   is not diminished here, where Section 1373 imposes a blanket, if indirect, prohibition on certain local lawmaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    521 U.S. at 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is an essential attribute of the States' retained sovereignty that they remain independent and autonomous within their proper sphere of authority.\");\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government argued unsuccessfully that the anticommandeering doctrine prohibits only federal statutes compelling states to make certain law, but not statutes that simply require local officials to provide \"limited, non-policymaking help in enforcing [federal] law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    at 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court did not agree with that distinction, pointing out that the decision concerning what \"reasonable efforts\" should be expended in conducting a background check is \"preeminently a matter of policy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    at 927-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Section 1373 prohibits the City from restricting its employees' communications with federal immigration authorities. As such, the degree of discretion afforded to each City employee or police officer is broad indeed. Beyond simply determining what constitutes \"reasonable efforts,\" as in\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   , City employees may decide for themselves whether to communicate with federal authorities\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"916145\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/898/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This is certainly a matter a policy, and yet it is a matter that, under Section 1373, state policymakers are not allowed to touch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, because Section 1373 eliminates the City's ability to control its employees' communications with INS, the statute prevents Chicago from extricating itself from federal immigration enforcement. Section 1373 thus impermissibly forecloses\n   <em>\n    New York's\n   </em>\n   \"critical alternative\": the option of non-participation in a federal program.\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p177\">\n    505 U.S. at 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480961\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/144/#p177\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Beyond this, the policy rationales undergirding the anticommandeering principle further counsel its application in this case.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   articulated three such rationales: First, the principle protects individual liberty by dividing authority between federal and state governments; second, it promotes political accountability by clarifying whether laws and policies are promulgated by federal or state actors; and third, it prevents Congress from shifting the costs of regulation to the states.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611443\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1461/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1373 flouts these rationales; the statute makes it difficult for citizens to distinguish between state and federal policy in the immigration context by barring states from adopting policies contrary to those preferred by the federal government. The statute also forces states to allow their employees to participate in the federal scheme, shifting employee time-and thus corresponding costs-to federal initiatives and away from state priorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Despite all this, the Attorney General contends that Section 1373 does not pose nearly the regulatory imposition Chicago claims. Instead, he says, the dictates of Section 1373 boil down to mere information sharing, which the Attorney General believes to be exempt from Tenth Amendment scrutiny. To that end, the Attorney General opines that \"the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   would likely have been very different if PASPA had only required States to share information regarding sports betting operations to facilitate federal regulation.\" (Def.'s Resp. at 4, Dkt. No. 176.) This Court is not so sure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Attorney General contends that information sharing is immune from challenge under the anticommandeering doctrine. From the Attorney General's view, Congress could constitutionally\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   states to provide the federal government with immigration-related information. And if that is constitutional, then surely a statute merely requiring that states\n   <em>\n    allow\n   </em>\n   their employees to provide immigration-related information is also constitutional.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freilich v.

The Attorney General rests his argument in favor of an information sharing carve-out on\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   . It is true that\n   <em>\n    Printz\n   </em>\n   's dicta signals that such an exception might exist, but the opinion neither states an exception conclusively nor provides any guidance as to its contours.

Now, the Attorney General wants this Court to go further than the Supreme Court has and hold that information sharing is constitutionally unique.

And yet, the strongest rationale for departing from\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   is the same reason this Court took up reconsideration of Section 1373's constitutionality in the first place.\n   <em>\n    City of New York\n   </em>\n   's outcome ultimately does not depend on the balancing test it employs, but rather the distinction it draws between affirmative obligations and proscriptions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

The parties offer competing interpretations of this language. The Attorney General argues that the word \"applicable\" refers to laws applicable to the grantee-here, the City-and thus covers any federal law that applies to Chicago; it follows that because Section 1373 plainly applies to \"local government entit[ies],\" Section 1373 falls within that broad sweep.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201373\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Chicago offers a far narrower interpretation, comprising just those federal laws applicable to federal grantees generally. That is, according to Chicago, the \"applicable Federal laws\" countenanced by the Byrne JAG statute include only those laws that \"by their express terms govern recipients of federal funds,\" such as 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d, which prohibits discrimination in \"any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.\" (Pl.'s Mem. in Supp. of Summ.

Even though the Compliance Condition is substantively the same as Section 1373 because the Condition was designed to reinforce Section 1373's requirements, the two are constrained by different constitutional limitations. The former is a federal statute carrying the force the law, while the latter is merely a condition imposed on a federal grant that Chicago may freely decline. This distinction matters because, as already described, the anticommandeering doctrine does not limit the conditions agencies may attach to federal grants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28042\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/203/#p210\">\n    483 U.S. at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28042\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/203/#p210\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reciting that the Tenth Amendment's limit on congressional regulation of state affairs does not equally limit the conditions attachable to federal grants).

This Court discussed in detail how Chicago met the four factors in its preliminary injunction ruling and now incorporates that analysis here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266915\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/933/#p937\">\n    264 F.Supp.3d at 949-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The material facts have not changed since that earlier ruling and adding the Compliance Condition to the mix does not change the Court's evaluation of the harm caused by the unlawful Conditions. All three Conditions undermine Chicago's ability to protect its relationship with its immigrant communities which the City contends is\n   vital to effective law enforcement. As reflected by a fresh consideration of the four injunction factors, the circumstances here continue to demand equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   First, Chicago's harm is irreparable and cannot be compensated by monetary damages. Chicago submits an affidavit from Lieutenant Kevin Hannigan, a longtime Chicago police officer, explaining that if the City complies with the Conditions, undocumented immigrants will be less likely to interact and cooperate voluntarily with local police, believing that such contacts could put them or their families at risk of deportation. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11, Dkt. No. 168; Hannigan Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 5, Dkt. No. 155.) In Lieutenant Hannigan's view, informed by twenty-nine years of experience, \"requiring Chicago's police officers to request immigration status would drive a wedge between [the CPD] and the local communities.\" (Hannigan Decl. \u00b6 5, Dkt. No. 155.) Doing so \"would run the risk of alienating portions of the Chicago population; could increase hostility toward law enforcement in vulnerable areas of the City; and could deprive officers of valuable sources of information.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266915\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/933/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   If Chicago were to adopt such a policy, he avers \"that the type of cooperation [the CPD is] able to achieve with immigrant communities would be materially damaged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266915\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/264/933/#p937\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Chicago adopted this view in its Welcoming City Ordinance, which the City clearly intended to protect against such harms: The Ordinance itself states that \"[t]he cooperation of the City's immigrant communities is\n   <em>\n    essential\n   </em>\n   to prevent and solve crimes and maintain public order, safety and security in the entire City\" because the \"assistance from a person, whether documented or not, who is a victim of, or a witness to, a crime is important to promoting the safety of all...residents.\" \u00a7 2-173-005 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Attorney General takes the contrary view, arguing that so-called sanctuary policies increase crime and make cities that implement them less safe. Of this the Court is not convinced. Chicago points out that not only are there no peer-reviewed studies supporting the AG's proposed correlation, the scholarship on the subject actually suggests that such policies do not affect, and might even lower, crime rates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 24-25 (noting University of California Riverside study found \"no support\" for proposition that \"sanctuary policies lead to increased crime\" and Center for American Progress study found \"crime [ ] statistically significantly lower in sanctuary counties compared to nonsanctuary counties\").) But the Court need not delve into this factual determination.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n    888 F.3d 272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 277 (7th Cir. 2018) (\"Our role in this case is not to assess the optimal immigration policies for our country.\"). The key point here is that the Attorney General offers no facts or affidavits belying Chicago's declarations concerning the connections between its policies and the effectiveness of its police force. The Attorney General never addresses the above-discussed harm to Chicago's immigrant communities or considers that such harm may affect the CPD's ability to prevent and solve crimes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 11; May 31, 2016 Office of Inspector General Mem., Ex. H to Def.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 140-8; July 25, 2017 DOJ Press Release, Ex. R to Pl.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 157-18.) As such, this Court finds that Chicago's compliance with the Conditions would damage local law enforcement's relationship with immigrant communities and decrease the cooperation essential to prevent and solve crimes both within those communities and Chicago at large.

Jan. 4, 2018). Chicago faces such an injury here, where the Attorney General subjects the City's receipt of grant funds to unconstitutionally imposed Conditions. For all of those reasons, Chicago demonstrates irreparable harm and lacks an adequate remedy at law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The balance of hardships weighs in Chicago's favor as well. As already explained, Chicago will suffer irreparable harm if the Attorney General's imposition of the Conditions is not enjoined. If Chicago accepts the Byrne JAG funds and its Conditions, the City's relationship with its immigrant communities will be degraded, making the City's task of preventing and prosecuting crime more difficult. (Def.'s Resp. to Pl.'s Facts \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, 11.) The picture is no brighter if Chicago declines the funds. If it does so, it will do so only to avoid the Conditions which the Attorney General has no authority or right to impose. Chicago intends to use the FY 2017 funds to expand its use of the ShotSpotter acoustic-surveillance technology into two communities plagued by high rates of gun violence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) According to Chicago's submissions, implementing this technology has a direct and positive effect on public safety. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201401847\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Sach Decl. \u00b6 15 (reciting that Chicago had 302 fewer shootings compared to the equivalent period in 2016 and that more than half of the reduction came from areas that recently deployed ShotSpotter).) But without the already-budgeted FY 2017 Byrne JAG funds, Chicago will not be able to expand its use of that technology as planned. (Sach Decl. \u00b6 11.) Thus, the Conditions' continued application causes Chicago hardship by unlawfully blocking it from funds it could otherwise accept without grievance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   On the other side of the scale, the Attorney General experiences little hardship from the imposition of this injunction. First, as the Seventh Circuit recognized, Chicago, \"like other 'welcoming' or 'sanctuary' cities or states, does not interfere in any way with the federal government's lawful pursuit of its civil immigration activities, and presence in such localities will not immunize anyone to the reach of the federal government. The federal government can and does freely operate in 'sanctuary' localities.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n    888 F.3d at 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). True, the corresponding downturn in cooperation\n   from local jurisdictions could, as the Attorney General fears, decrease the effectiveness of federal immigration enforcement. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 31, 2016 Office of Inspector General Mem., Ex. H to Def.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 140-8; July 25, 2017 DOJ Press Release, Ex. R to Pl.'s Request for Judicial Notice, Dkt. No. 157-18.) Yet while the Attorney General would prefer to avoid that outcome, his present attempt to steer around it relies upon unlawfully imposing unauthorized grant Conditions. Though the Attorney General has many tools at his disposal to increase such local cooperation, conditioning the Byrne JAG grant as he has here is not one of them. The Attorney General thus suffers little hardship here because the injunction does not strip away any option he could otherwise exercise. In the end, the weight of the hardships rests with Chicago.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, the public interest is served by issuing a permanent injunction. The Attorney General must administer the Byrne JAG grant program in conformance with the limited statutory authority Congress affords him. As explained at length, Congress provided the Attorney General no authority to impose the Conditions. The role of the judiciary to enjoin conduct by the executive that crosses its constitutionally-imposed limits is as essential to our form of government as it is well-established:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   The founders of our country well understood that the concentration of power threatens individual liberty and established a bulwark against such tyranny by creating a separation of powers among the branches of government. If the Executive Branch can determine policy, and then use the power of the purse to mandate compliance with that policy by the state and local governments, all without the authorization or even acquiescence of elected legislators, that check against tyranny is forsaken....It falls to us, the judiciary, as the remaining branch of the government, to act as a check on such usurpation of power. We are a country that jealously guards the separation of powers, and we must be ever-vigilant in that endeavor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

By enjoining the unlawful Conditions, the Court acts as a check on the executive's encroachment of congressional power and thus serves the public interest by constraining the Attorney General's authority in order to preserve the Byrne JAG program as Congress envisioned.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon v.

Braunskill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222374\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/770/#p776\">\n    481 U.S. 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 776,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222374\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/770/#p776\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222374\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/770/#p776\">\n    95 L.Ed.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). In weighing the factors, \"a 'sliding scale' approach applies; the greater the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits, the less heavily the balance of harms must weigh in its favor, and vice versa.\"\n   <em>\n    In re A &amp; F Enters.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4228097,4072690\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/763/\">\n    742 F.3d at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Here, those factors weigh in favor of staying the nationwide scope of the injunction. First, as illustrated above, the scope of the injunction involves novel issues upon which reasonable minds could differ, as evidenced by the disagreement between the majority and dissenting opinions in the Seventh Circuit's now-vacated panel opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v. Sessions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n    888 F.3d at 288-300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And, while certainly not determinative, the fact that the court of appeals granted rehearing\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   and stayed the injunction in the first place makes Chicago's nationwide-scope argument less auspicious than it had otherwise been. The first factor thus tilts the scales toward granting the stay, and the other factors do not reset the balance. The second and third factors weigh neutrally. The Attorney General faces no great harm absent a stay because he has no authority to impose the Conditions, and Chicago will not be directly affected by the stay. Finally, the fourth factor weighs in favor of granting the stay. The public interest will be best served by allowing the court of appeals time to issue its ruling. Noting that this complex issue is currently pending, prudence dictates waiting for guidance before effectuating such broad relief. Given the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   stay already in place, mimicking that stay now will keep these scope issues streamlined and, if the\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ruling were to overturn the panel's affirmance, reduce the judicial whiplash to which Byrne JAG applicants nationwide will be subjected. In sum, the required elements for a stay of the nationwide scope of the permanent injunction are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, the Court grants the City of Chicago's Motion for Summary Judgment on Counts I and II and correspondingly denies the Attorney General's Motion to Dismiss Counts I, II, and IV. The Court enters and immediately stays permanent injunctive relief as detailed above. The remaining claims are dismissed as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
