Now pending are Motions to Dismiss filed by Apple Inc. (Doc. No. 40) and Verizon Wireless Services LLC (Doc.

Because binding Sixth Circuit precedent suggest that they are, the motions will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fontana's Amended Complaint sets forth Tennessee causes of action for strict liability in tort and breach of warranty. The essence of his claim is that he \"has suffered cancer,\" and has \"an increased risk of cancer\" (Doc. No. 39, Amended Complaint \u00b6 11) as a result of using an iPhone 6 that was designed, manufactured, and marketed by Apple, and sold and serviced by Verizon. Fontana asserts that Apple and Verizon \"provided an inadequate warning that cell phone radiation is 'possibly carcinogenic' to humans\" and \"failed to warn of the damaging effects of radio-frequency radiation on human cells.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12(a), (b) ). He also alleges that (1) Apple failed to design the iPhone 6 to include \"certain technologies to reduce RF exposure,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13), and (2) Defendants jointly engaged in a \"common plan\" in \"fail[ing] to provide adequate warnings or instructions for the Plaintiff's health,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28).

The court then held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Congress passed the TCA to foster industry competition in local markets, encourage the development of telecommunications technology, and provide consumers with affordable access to telecommunications services.

The TCA furthers those goals by preventing local governments from impeding the siting and construction of cell towers that conform to the FCC's RF-emissions standards.

By delegating the task of setting RF-emissions levels to the FCC, Congress authorized the federal government-and not local governments-to strike the proper balance between protecting the public from RF-emissions exposure and promoting a robust telecommunications infrastructure.

A proliferation of suits similar to the one the Residents brought would tie up companies whenever they tried to build cell towers, leading to construction delays, increased costs, and ultimately, less public access to affordable cell-phone services. Widespread litigation would also shift the power to regulate RF emissions away from the FCC and into the hands of courts and state governments.\n   <em>\n    Stanley v.

It broadly bars \"RF-emissions-based tort suits\" because they would impair the goals of the TCA. This has been the holding of many other courts as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For example, in\n   <em>\n    Farina v.

In so doing, the court addressed and rejected several of the arguments now raised by Fontana, including that (1) the savings clause of the TCA and/or the Federal Communications Act (\"FCA\") permits suits such as this, and (2) a claim alleging insufficient warnings does not call into play federal regulations and thus there is no preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The savings clause in the FCA provides: \"Nothing in this chapter contained shall in any way abridge or alter the remedies now existing at common law or by statute, but the provisions of this chapter are in addition to such remedies.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20414\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 414\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even though the court in\n   <em>\n    Farina\n   </em>\n   recognized that \"[t]he presence of a savings\n   provision is fundamentally incompatible with complete field preemption,\" and that both Congress and the FCC \"hesitated to override all state law ... within the field of RF preemption,\" it found conflict in the form of obstacle preemption applicable for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The court began by reviewing Supreme Court cases that indicate \"that regulatory situations in which an agency is required to strike a balance between competing statutory objectives lend themselves to a finding of conflict preemption.\"\n   <em>\n    Farina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3800574\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/97/#p125\">\n    625 F.3d at 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (discussing\n   <em>\n    Buckman Co. v.

However, not only is\n   <em>\n    Pinney\n   </em>\n   apparently somewhat of an outlier, it has been criticized because \"the focus on the headset requirement is misplaced. For the purposes of preemption analysis, it is the cause of action, and not the specific relief requested, that matters. Preemption speaks in terms of claims, not in terms of forms of relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Farina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3800574\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/625/97/#p125\">\n    625 F.3d at 133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Pinney\n   </em>\n   has also been criticized because (1) \"the court appears to have reached its conclusion without considering the views of the FCC\"; (2) the \"court's focus was not on the adequacy of the FCC's SAR standard\"; (3) it \"gave weight to the fact that the FCC undertook its rulemaking relating to RF standards pursuant to the broadly applicable National Environmental Policy Act ... rather than pursuant to specific radio-communications legislation,\" even though \"the FCC adopted its current regulations after passage of the Telecommunications Act\"; and (4) it improperly relied on the savings clause because \"[t]he Supreme Court has 'repeatedly declined to give broad effect to saving clauses where doing so would upset the careful regulatory scheme established by federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7294629\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/982/764/#p768\">\n    982 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   778 n. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Ultimately, whether such criticism is warranted does not matter because this Court is bound by Sixth Circuit authority. As already noted,\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   makes clear that \"[b]y delegating the task of setting RF-emissions levels to the FCC, Congress authorized the federal government - and not local governments - to strike the proper balance between protecting the public from RF-emissions exposure and promoting a robust telecommunications infrastructure,\" and \"[a]llowing RF-emissions-based tort suits would upset that balance and impair the federal government's ability to promote the TCA's goals.\"\n   <em>\n    Robbins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276903\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/854/315/\">\n    854 F.3d at 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, the Motions to Dismiss filed by Apple Inc.
