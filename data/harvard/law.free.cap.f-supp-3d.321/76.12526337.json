(\"IFTIM\"), a nonprofit organization that promotes truthful product labeling and advertising, filed the instant action against Defendant Total Health Network Corp. (\"Total Health\"), a vitamin and dietary supplement seller, in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1.) Total Health maintains that federal question jurisdiction exists because \"the resolution of Plaintiff's claims will require adjudication of disputed questions of federal law[,]\" and alternatively, that there is complete diversity of citizenship and that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 when the cost of compliance with the requested injunctive relief, and also attorneys fees, are taken into account.

For the reasons explained below, this Court finds that IFTIM's state law claims do not arise under federal law, so there is no federal question jurisdiction, and that Total Health has failed to show that the amount-in-controversy requirement is satisfied for the purpose of diversity jurisdiction. Consequently, this Court concludes that it has no subject-matter jurisdiction over this dispute, such that Plaintiff's motion to remand the case to state court must\n   be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . A separate order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion will follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Total Health runs a website that sells vitamins and dietary supplements to consumers in the United States, including in the District of Columbia. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 2.) IFTIM allegedly purchased ten different products from Total Health, each of which was shipped to IFTIM's address in the District of Columbia.

In the instant action, IFTIM asserts that Total Health advertised the price for each product \"as reduced from a significantly higher comparison price (labeled 'Suggested Retail Price')[,]\" but that Total Health's representations regarding the comparison prices were \"fictitious[,]\" because there were, in fact, \"no substantial sales made at the comparison price[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Notably, in its one-count complaint, IFTIM claims that Total Health's advertising violates the District of Columbia's consumer protection statute, and in particular, D.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 20-25, 85-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that IFTIM has brought the instant action \"to protect the general public from trade practices that violate federal and District of Columbia law\" and \"to vindicate its statutory rights under the [DC]CPPA[.]\").) Moreover, IFTIM charges that the alleged advertising practices violate D.C. Code section 28-3904(x), which specifically prohibits the sale of consumer goods \"in a condition or manner not consistent with that warranted ... by operation or requirement of federal law[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028-3904\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 28-3904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (x). IFTIM maintains that Total Health's comparison-price advertising breaches this particular D.C. Code provision because Total Health's conduct violates the Federal Trade Commission Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and its corresponding regulations.

As relief for Total Health's alleged multifaceted violation of the DCPA, IFTIM seeks (1) an injunction requiring Total Health to \"cease and desist from falsely advertising any comparison price that misleads, or has a tendency to mislead, consumers in the District of Columbia, provided that the cost of compliance to Defendant Total Health does not exceed $25,000\"; (2) statutory penalties under the CPPA of $1,500 for each violation, which total $15,000 for the ten products purchased by IFTIM; and (3) reasonable attorney's fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2045\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Relief Requested, \u00b6\u00b6 A-C.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 2, 2018, Defendant Total Health removed this action to this Court, citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and invoking both federal question jurisdiction and diversity jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Total Health argues that \"[t]he entirety of Plaintiff's claims arise under the FTC Act\" because the resolution of IFTIM's claims \"will require [resolution of] questions of federal law including, potentially, issues arising under the Constitution of the United States.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Specifically, Total Health contends that all of IFTIM's CPPA claims \"rely ineluctably on Plaintiff's mistaken belief that price comparisons like those used by Total Health are 'fictitious' and 'deceptive'\n   <em>\n    because of 1967 guidance from the FTC\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12 (emphasis added).) Total Health further maintains that there is complete diversity of citizenship-IFTIM is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in the District of Columbia (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 13; Ex. C to Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1-5), while Total Health is a New York corporation with its principal place of business in New York (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. D to Notice of Removal, ECF No. 1-6)-and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000 because \"in addition to a civil penalty of $15,000 and injunctive relief of at least $25,000, Plaintiff seeks recovery of attorney[']s fees authorized by statute.\" (Notice of Removal \u00b6 8.) According to Total Health, given that IFTIM has not expressly limited the amount of attorney's fees in the same way that it has limited the cost of injunctive relief, \"meeting or exceeding the jurisdictional amount is more likely than not.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 1, 2018, IFTIM filed the instant motion to remand this matter to Superior Court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Remand.) IFTIM argues that there is no federal question jurisdiction because the claim in this case is brought solely under D.C. law and Total Health has failed to show that it fits into the narrow category of cases in which a state cause of action is nevertheless deemed adequate to give rise to federal question jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) IFTIM emphasizes that, first of all, only one aspect of its CPPA claim-its allegation of the violation of D.C. Code section 28-3904(x) - implicates a federal law, and not of the other allegations (alleged violations of sections 28-3904(e), (f), (f-1), and (j) ) relate to federal law at all, and furthermore, its theory under section 28-3904(x) is insufficient to raise a substantial federal question. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) As to diversity jurisdiction, IFTIM does not dispute that there is complete diversity of citizenship between the parties, but argues that Total Health has failed to meet its burden of proving that the amount-in-controversy requirement is satisfied because, among other things, the \"non-aggregation principle\" applies in calculating the appropriate amount in controversy, which necessitates that the cost of injunctive relief and any award of attorney's fees be divided by the total number of persons who would benefit,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the general public on whose behalf IFTIM brings the lawsuit.

For the reasons explained below, this Court agrees with IFTIM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. There Is No Federal Question Jurisdiction Because Plaintiff's Claim Does Not \"Arise Under\" Federal Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The complaint in this case alleges one count brought under the District of Columbia CPPA for violations of various provisions of D.C. law: D.C. Code sections 28-3904(e), (f), (f-1), (j), and (x). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) As explained above, \"federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie [only] if a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p258\">\n    568 U.S. at 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p258\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And for the reasons explained below, it is clear to this Court that IFTIM's consumer protection claim does not necessarily raise substantial questions of federal law that are capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance that Congress has contemplated. Total Health's alternative contention-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that this case raises constitutional issues-is also unavailing, because the alleged constitutional questions have been raised in the context of Total Health's defenses, which do not establish the scope of this Court's jurisdiction under the well-pleaded complaint rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    IFTIM's Claim Does Not Necessarily Raise Issues Of Federal Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Total Health contends that IFTIM's CPPA claim necessarily implicates federal law because it \"rel[ies] ineluctably\" on IFTIM's understanding of federal FTC regulations (Notice of Removal \u00b6 12); indeed, says Total Health, \"[b]ut for the reference to the federal statute, Plaintiff's claim would not be sustainable under D.C. law\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Opp'n to Remand at 2 (\"For [Plaintiff] to make its case, it\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   rely upon a meaning of fictitious set forth in guidance issued by the Federal Trade Commission in 1967[.]\") ). In this regard, Total Health appears to have misconstrued the aim of IFTIM's complaint, and as a result, its argument misses the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Properly understood, IFTIM's complaint alleges that Total Health's advertising practices constitute a CPPA violation. This\n   alleged violation is pled in one count, and happens to be based on five different theories about the manner in which the challenged conduct violates the CPPA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8 (relying on D.C. Code sections 28-3904(e), (f), (f-1), (j), and (x) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Remand at 7.) The cited provisions are\n   <em>\n    alternative\n   </em>\n   bases; any one of these theories of liability is sufficient to sustain the claim alleged. Furthermore, of the five CPPA provisions that IFTIM cites,\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   section 28-3904(x) implicates federal law-the other sections do not reference federal law or raise any federal issues at all.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028-3904\">\n    D.C.

Therefore, this Court must conclude that IFTIM's state law claim fails to satisfy the requirements of the special category of state law cases that can be the basis of this Court's subject matter jurisdiction because they necessarily raise a substantial federal issue that can be addressed in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance that Congress has crafted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Arguments Regarding Potential Federal Defenses Are Unavailing\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Undaunted, Total Health suggests that, even if IFTIM has not directly raised a federal question that can ground this Court's subject matter jurisdiction, this Court can exercise \"arising under\" jurisdiction in this removed action based on the fact that \"Plaintiff's interpretation of the [CPPA] raises substantial questions under the United States Constitution[,]\" such as restrictions on commercial speech and placing an undue burden on interstate commerce.

(Notice of Removal \u00b6 8.) There is no dispute that, if successful, IFTIM would be entitled to $15,000 in civil penalties under the CPPA, because it has brought unfair marketing claims under the CPPA regarding ten different products (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Am.

And Total Health provides no factual basis from which to infer that IFTIM's voluntary limit on the cost of the injunction is a viable or accurate estimation of how much it would actually cost Total Health to change its marketing practices.

Thus, this Court has no basis upon\n   which to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the cost of the injunction or the attorney's fees in this case are the amounts that Total Health asserts, such that the amount-in-controversy requirement is satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sloan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%209272838\">\n    2015 WL 9272838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9 (finding that \"bald assertions\" about likely attorney's fees that are based on pure conjecture are inadequate to support an assertion of diversity jurisdiction);\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Consumers League v.

Thus, even if Total Health had shown sufficient support for its assertion that it would have cost at least $25,000 to comply with the proposed injunction (Notice of Removal \u00b6 8), that figure must then be divided by the several tens of thousands of consumers in the District of Columbia on whose behalf IFTIM brings the instant CPPA case, which brings the appropriate figure with respect\n   to the injunctive costs to a single digit or even less.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Breakman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3801701\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/545/96/#p103\">\n    545 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   106- 107 (dividing the cost of injunctive relief among 28,541 estimated District of Columbia consumers).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Courts in this district have also applied the non-aggregation principle to attorney's fees in CPPA actions brought on behalf of the public.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Animal Legal Def.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Total Health has removed this case to federal court, but it has failed to establish that this Court can exercise either federal-question jurisdiction or diversity jurisdiction over IFTIM's CPPA claim. Consequently, this Court finds that it has no subject matter jurisdiction over the instant case, which means that Plaintiff's Motion for Remand for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (ECF No. 6) must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , and this case must be\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   back to the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, as set forth in the accompanying Order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    On the date the complaint was filed, the plaintiff organization was named \"American Institute for Truth in Advertising, Inc.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Am. Compl. at 1.) According to a notice this Court received on April 26, 2018, the organization subsequently changed its name to \"Institute for Truth In Marketing, Inc.\" (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Notice Regarding Change of Name, ECF No. 10.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Page numbers herein refer to those that the Court's electronic case-filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The alleged federal issue in\n    <em>\n     Merrell Dow\n    </em>\n    was relevant to the state law cause of action in that case because it was a \"proximate cause\" or a \"presumption\" in the state negligence claim brought in that case, and the Supreme Court concluded that it would upset the federal-state balance to permit the state claim to proceed in federal court based on this nexus to federal law.\n    <em>\n     Merrell Dow\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213698\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/804/#p808\">\n     478 U.S. at 812\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6213698\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/804/#p808\">\n     106 S.Ct. 3229\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . How much more so for the D.C. claim at issue here, where the District of Columbia has opted to incorporate wholly any federal violations such that the federal question presented is the entirety of the state cause of action? The fact that there is no separate non-federal substantive content to IFTIM's state law claim means that, by exercising jurisdiction over that claim, this Court would be directly addressing a legal contention that Congress has already determined should not be litigated in the federal courts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
