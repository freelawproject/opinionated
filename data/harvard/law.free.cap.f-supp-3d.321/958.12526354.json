Tr. at 160-61. Plaintiff was forty-five years old at the time of a hearing on April 21, 2016, before Administrative Law Judge John E. Sandbothe (ALJ). Tr. at 29-50. The ALJ issued a Notice of Decision - Unfavorable on June 2, 2016. Tr. at 7-22. On September 21, 2016, the Appeals Council declined to review the ALJ's decision. Tr. at 1-3. Thereafter, Plaintiff commenced this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ALJ noted that Plaintiff meets the insured status requirements of the Social Security Act until December 31, 2018. At the first step of the sequential evaluation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1520\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(4), the ALJ found that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity after July 10, 2013, the alleged disability onset date. At the second step, the ALJ found that Plaintiff had the following severe impairments: morbid obesity ; fibromyalgia ; major depressive disorder ; generalized anxiety disorder ; panic disorder ; and rule-out personality disorder. Tr. at 12. The ALJ found that Plaintiff's impairments were not severe enough to qualify for benefits at the third step of the sequential evaluation. Tr. at 13. At the fourth step, the ALJ found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   After careful consideration of the entire record, the undersigned finds that the claimant has the residual functional capacity to perform light work as defined in 20 CFR 404.1567(b) and 416.967(b) such that she could lift 20 pounds occasionally and 10 pounds frequently; only occasionally balance, stoop, kneel, crouch, crawl or climb; simple, routine, repetitive tasks; no contact with the public; and no specific production rate requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Tr. at 14. The ALJ found that Plaintiff is unable to perform any of her past relevant work. At the fifth step of the sequential evaluation, the ALJ found that jobs exist in significant numbers which the claimant can perform. Tr. at 21. Examples of such jobs are cleaner/housekeeper, folder, and marker. It was the ALJ's decision that Plaintiff is not disabled nor entitled to the benefits for which she applied. Tr. at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For reversal, Plaintiff argues the ALJ erred by failing to afford controlling weight to the opinion of the treating psychologist, Kenneth J. Israel, Ph.D. Plaintiff also argues the ALJ improperly weighed the opinion rendered by the nurse practitioner who prescribed Plaintiff's psychiatric mediation. Plaintiff argues the ALJ's finding of residual functional capacity is flawed because it is not supported by medical evidence from a treating or examining source. Plaintiff also argues that the ALJ improperly discounted her subjective allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    MEDICAL EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this voluminous (approximately 900 pages) medical record, Plaintiff received medical care for all of the impairments that the ALJ found to be severe at step two of the sequential evaluation. In the following summary, the Court will highlight only those entries that are most relevant to the central issue of this case, i.e., whether the ALJ erred by failing to accord controlling weight to Dr. Israel's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over the years covered in this record, Plaintiff saw several health care providers for the medical management of her mental health impairments. Changes in providers were often dictated by changes in Plaintiff's health insurance. Plaintiff saw Judy Gonzalez, PMHNP-BC, at the clinic of James R. Trahan, M.D. It was noted that Plaintiff had a history of panic attacks and diagnoses were noted to be major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Tr. at 465. Plaintiff's psychiatric medication was prescribed by Ana A. Valencia, ARNP, at Unity Point Health counseling and psychiatry clinic. The record reflects ongoing treatment at this clinic, as well as at other mental health clinics, for medication management of these disorders. Medication, prescribed at various times, included Lexapro, Effexor XL, Trazodone, Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Abilify, Klonopin, Amitriptyline, Wellbutrin, Savella, Duloxetine HCI (Cymbalta ), and Buspar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Much of Plaintiff's medical care took place at McFarland Clinic in Ames, Iowa. Plaintiff was seen in the hematology and oncology clinic because of a history of breast cancer. Plaintiff saw rheumatologists for treatment of fibromyalgia Those specialists included David D. Gerbracht, M.D., and Mary Radia, D.O., both of whose examinations showed multiple tender points consistent with their diagnoses of fibromyalgia. Tr. at 381.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On January 5, 2012, Plaintiff saw Dr. Israel at Ames Counseling and Psychological Services. It is clear this was not Plaintiff's first visit with Dr. Israel because Plaintiff noted that she had only one panic attack since the last appointment. Plaintiff also complained of fatigue. Tr. at 494. Thereafter, Plaintiff saw Dr. Israel on a regular basis-usually three or four times each month. Tr. at 493-580, 1130-1210.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In his treatment notes, Dr. Israel sometimes expressed his opinion on Plaintiff's ability to work. Some examples of those notations are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 January 31, 2013: \"I am concerned about her ability to maintain her job, given her current level of impairment.\" Tr. at 514.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 February 7, 2013: \"Clearly her level of depression and anxiety is impacting\n   her work performance. It may be in her best interest to consider a reduced workload or several weeks of disability leave to help her gain traction in addressing these long-standing issues.\" Tr. at 515.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 February 28, 2013: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff was on short-term disability but that she hoped to return to work in three weeks. Tr. at 518.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 March 7, 2013: Dr. Israel opined Plaintiff would not be able to return to work the following week as previously planned. Tr. at 519.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 March 21, 2013: Dr. Israel recommended Plaintiff should attempt to gradually return to work over the next several weeks. Tr. at 521.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 March 28, 2013: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff was attempting to return to work as he had recommended. Tr. at 522.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 May 30, 2013: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff was better able to attend work and to complete her shifts, although fatigue and pain remained problems. Tr. at 529.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 June 13, 2013: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff was having difficulty with her sleep and was experiencing fatigue, which was interfering with her work attendance. Tr. at 530.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 June 20, 2013: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff had missed two of the previous four days of work due to fatigue and pain. Tr. at 531.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 June 27, 2013: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff continued to struggle with work. Dr. Israel raised the possibility of filing for disability. He wrote, \"She is reluctant to do this. She feels some sense of shame about it but reality is that her physical condition is making it very difficult for her to work full time.\" Tr. at 532.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 July 11, 2013: Dr. Israel again noted Plaintiff would, at some point, need to consider disability because her current condition did not allow for consistent work attendance or the ability to function at work. Tr. at 533.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 August 8, 2013: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff struggled to sustain pace and effort for almost any activity. He wrote, \"She does not appear better able to work at her job despite financial need.\" Tr. at 536.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 On October 31, 2013: Plaintiff reported she had been notified that her job and benefits were about to be terminated. Dr. Israel noted he would be in contact with Plaintiff's primary care physician to provide any assistance requested of him. Dr. Israel wrote: \"In my conversations with the reviewer it seems that the lack of a specific medical diagnosis is creating some problems in certifying her disability. She is still seeking medical answers but very clearly is impaired. Her level of fatigue precludes sustained effort at virtually any activity in her life at present.\" Tr. at 547.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 May 1, 2014: Dr. Israel noted Plaintiff continued to struggle with anxiety, dysphoria, fatigue, and pain. He further noted Plaintiff's focus, concentration, and general stamina were all impacted by the impairments. Dr. Israel noted that, even when Plaintiff paced herself, she was frequently unable to complete routine tasks. Tr. at 572.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 September 24, 2014: Because of the increase in Plaintiff's depression, Dr. Israel suggested hospitalization, but Plaintiff stated that, with the support of her family, she would be able to maintain her safety. Tr. at 1139.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On February 12, 2016, Dr. Israel completed a questionnaire. Tr. at 623-24. In it, he wrote that Plaintiff's diagnoses were major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, both of which are chronic. The doctor opined that Plaintiff is not capable of working because her symptoms are persistent and significant. Tr. at 623. On a \"check the box\" form, the doctor indicated Plaintiff would have marked limitations in the ability: To maintain attention and concentration for extended periods; to complete a normal workday and work week without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods; to interact appropriately with the general public; to accept instructions and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors; to get along with co-workers or peers without unduly distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes; to respond appropriately to expected or unexpected changes in the work setting. The doctor opined that Plaintiff had a mild limitation in the ability to understand and remember very short and simple repetitive instructions or tasks. Tr. at 624.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On February 15, 2016, Nurse Valencia, the advanced registered nurse practitioner who prescribed Plaintiff's psychiatric medication, completed a residual functional capacity questionnaire. Tr. at 595-96. The nurse opined that Plaintiff was mildly limited in the following areas: to understand and remember very short and simple repetitive instructions or tasks; to interact appropriately with the general public; to accept instruction and respond appropriately to criticism from supervisors; to get along with co-workers or peers without unduly distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes. Plaintiff would be moderately limited in the following areas: to maintain attention and concentration for extended periods; to complete a normal workday and workweek without interruptions from psychologically based symptoms and to perform at a consistent pace without an unreasonable number and length of rest periods; to interact appropriately with the general public or customers; to respond appropriately to expected or unexpected changes in the work setting. The nurse noted Plaintiff has significant problems with depression and anxiety that cause problems with focus and concentration. The nurse noted anxiety greatly affects Plaintiff's ability to interact with others. The nurse also noted that, because of anxiety, Plaintiff does not do well with unexpected change. Tr. at 595. Nurse Valencia wrote she had treated Plaintiff for a year. Diagnoses were: major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate; and generalized anxiety disorder. The nurse opined that Plaintiff's symptoms are too severe for Plaintiff to obtain and maintain work on a sustained basis. Tr. at 596.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    STATE AGENCY PHYSICIANS' OPINIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On July 18, 2014, Plaintiff's claim was reviewed by Lon Olsen, Ph.D., a State agency psychological consultant. Dr. Olsen noted that Plaintiff had been in psychotherapy with the psychologist for at least two years and that she was treated with medication at various clinics. Dr. Olsen wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   The claimant's allegations about her functional limitations are credible and her presentation is consistent. While she does have some limitations, they do not prevent her from engaging in purposeful activity when she is motivated to do so. She is independent for self-cares and for taking medication. She helps care for the family pets, prepares meals, and does light household tasks. She is able to go places alone, unless she is feeling very anxious. She drives, shops, pays\n   bills, and manages money. She stays in touch with friends every day through email and texting. She socializes with friends, visits her father several times a month, participates almost daily in an online fibromyalgia group and keeps appointments. She would be capable of simple, repetitive tasks that do not require intense concentration or unremitting pace. She will need some support when adjusting to changes in routine. [Medically Determinable Impairments] are major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and rule out personality disorder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Tr. at 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On July 28, 2014, Plaintiff's claim was reviewed by Lawrence Staples, M.D., a State agency medical consultant. Dr. Staples determined Plaintiff's medically determinable impairments are fibromyalgia, obesity, and history of breast cancer without recurrence. The doctor opined that Plaintiff retains the residual functional capacity to lift twenty pounds occasionally, and ten pounds frequently; can stand and/or walk about six hours and can sit about six hours in a work day. Tr. at 68. It was the initial determination that Plaintiff, while unable to do past relevant work was able to do unskilled work such as mail clerk or order caller. Tr. at 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On September 15, 2014, John May, M.D., a State agency medical consultant, reviewed Plaintiff's claim and affirmed the findings made by Dr. Staples. Tr. at 83. Also on September 15, 2014, David A Christiansen, Ph.D., a State agency psychological consultant reviewed Plaintiff's claim and determined that there were no changes or new allegations. Dr. Christiansen affirmed the findings made by Dr. Olsen. Tr. at 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In his decision, the ALJ wrote that he accorded some weight to the opinion rendered by Dr. Israel but found that Plaintiff's reported level of activity failed to support the degree or marked limitations assessed by Dr. Israel. The ALJ accorded some weight to Nurse Valencia's opinion \"to the extent that the claimant experienced difficulty with concentration and focus on a daily basis which would carry-over to the work environment.\" The ALJ went on: \"To this end, the degree of limitation assessed, while more consistent with the claimant's level of reported activities, in the context of chronic and persistent mental health issues, was inconsistent with the ability to perform work-related activities.\" The ALJ accorded \"significant weight\" to the opinions rendered by the State agency medical and psychological consultants. Tr. at 20. The ALJ wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Ongoing treatment records fail to support indicate (sic) changes in mental status physical or neurological examination and no further deterioration of function. However, given the claimant's assertion of anxiety dealing with customers and difficulty being in an (sic) crowds, the undersigned finds it reasonable to set forth a more restrictive residual functional demands (sic) precluding public contact (Ex 2A, 4A).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Tr. at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   We will affirm the ALJ's decision \"[i]f the ALJ's findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole,\" an inquiry that requires us to consider evidence in the record that detracts\n   from the ALJ's decision.\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.

The doctor opined that Plaintiff is not capable of working-an opinion reserved to the Commissioner-however, the doctor also told us that Plaintiff's symptoms are persistent and significant.
