INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns an agency's refusal to produce records in response to what is referred to in political parlance as a \"Seven Member Rule\" request. That moniker derives from the \"Seven Member Rule,\" which is embodied in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Adopted by Congress in 1928, section 2954 provides in pertinent part that, upon request of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the U.S. House of Representatives (\"the House Oversight Committee\"), \"\n   <em>\n    or of any seven members thereof\n   </em>\n   ,\" an Executive agency \"shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). The Seven Member Rule thus provides a statutory mechanism for members of the minority party to obtain records from the Executive Branch to support the Committee's oversight function.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs here are seventeen minority members of the House Oversight Committee who have made several Seven Member Rule requests of the General Services Administration (\"GSA\") for information relating to GSA's management of its lease agreement with Trump Old Post Office LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That lease agreement granted\n   Trump Old Post Office LLC--an entity owned by President Donald J. Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump, and his sons, Donald, Jr., and Eric Trump--the rights to develop and convert the Old Post Office building in Washington, D.C., into the Trump International Hotel. In early January 2017, GSA produced records that were responsive to Plaintiffs' initial requests. Since President Trump's inauguration, however, GSA has disclosed no additional information about the Old Post Office lease agreement in direct response to Plaintiffs' subsequent Seven Member Rule requests. Plaintiffs brought this action against GSA's Administrator to compel compliance with their Seven Member Rule requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss and Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. For the reasons stated below, the court concludes that these Plaintiffs, as individual members of the House Oversight Committee, lack standing to bring this action. Thus, the court grants Defendant's Motion to Dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and denies Plaintiffs' Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Statutory Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Congress enacted the Seven Member Rule in 1928 as part of an Act containing only three sections, the first two of which are pertinent here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of May 29, 1928, ch. 901,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Stat.%20986\">\n    45 Stat. 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 1 of the Act repealed 128 mandatory reporting statutes that obligated federal agencies to submit periodic reports to Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Stat.%20986\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1, 45 Stat. at 986-96. Congress repealed these requirements, because it deemed the reports to no longer \"serve [a] useful purpose,\" as the reports proved to be labor intensive but ultimately \"useless\" in their utility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 70-1757, at 3, 6 (1928);\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 6 (\"The departmental labor in preparation is a waste of time and the files of Congress are cluttered up with a mass of useless reports.\"). Section 2 of the Act replaced this mandatory, reports-based model of disclosure with a request-driven process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of May 29, 1928, ch. 901, \u00a7 2,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Stat.%20986\">\n    45 Stat. 986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 996. Section 2 is now codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides in relevant part: \"An Executive agency, on request of the Committee on Government Operations of the House of Representatives [today, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform], or of any seven members thereof ... shall submit any information requested of it relating to any matter within the jurisdiction of the committee.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, instead of requiring mandatory reporting by Executive agencies, section 2 provided a mechanism by which the House Oversight Committee and its members could obtain information by making a specific demand for information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Section 2954 plainly gives members of the House Oversight Committee the right to request information from Executive agencies, so long as the information sought\n   falls within the Committee's jurisdiction and at least seven members join in the request. That much is clear. Section 2954's legislative history, however, reveals some ambiguity as to the statute's reach.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Louis Fisher,\n   <em>\n    Congressional Access to Information: Using Legislative Will and Leverage\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Duke%20L.J.%20323\">\n    52 Duke L.J. 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 362-64 (2002). Part of the legislative history suggests that Congress intended to limit the scope of a request made under section 2954 to information contained in the abolished regular reports that Executive agencies previously had sent to Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   H.R. Rep. No. 70-1757, at 6 (\"To save any question as to the right of the House of Representatives to have furnished any of the information contained in the reports proposed to be abolished, a provision has been added to the bill requiring such information....\"). But other portions of the legislative history suggest no such limitation. For instance, both the House and Senate Reports provide that, \"[i]f\n   <em>\n    any information\n   </em>\n   is desired by any Member or committee upon a particular subject that information can be better secured by a request made by an individual Member or committee, so framed as to bring out the special information desired.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Duke%20L.J.%20323\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added); S. Rep. No. 70-1320, at 4 (1928) (emphasis added). Thus, hidden behind the seemingly straightforward and broad statutory language of section 2954 is legislative history that leaves some uncertainty as to the precise scope of demandable information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fisher,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 363.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Now, spring forward 85 years. On August 5, 2013, GSA entered into a lease agreement with Trump Old Post Office LLC, a company owned by now President Donald J. Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump, and his sons, Donald, Jr., and Eric Trump. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6 10. The lease agreement permitted the company to develop and convert the Old Post Office on Pennsylvania Avenue in Northwest Washington, D.C., into the Trump International Hotel.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As relevant here, Article 37.19 of the lease agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   No member or delegate to Congress, or elected official of the Government of the United States or the Government of the District of Columbia, shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. It is probably safe to say that when GSA and Trump Old Post Office LLC entered into the lease agreement in August 2013, few would have anticipated that, within years, Article 37.19 would become central to a controversy between the political branches of the federal government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 8, 2016, Donald J. Trump was elected President of the United States. On November 30, 2016, House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Elijah Cummings, joined by three other Representatives, sent a letter to then GSA Administrator Denise Turner Roth requesting unredacted copies of lease documents, monthly and annual statements from Trump Post Office LLC, and a briefing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. On December 14, 2016, they sent another letter to GSA requesting similar records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. On December 22, 2016, Ranking Member Cummings, joined by 10 other members of the House Oversight Committee, sent a third letter to GSA that specifically invoked the Seven Member Rule and demanded unredacted documents and expense reports related to the Old Post Office lease agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. By letter dated January 3, 2017, GSA responded to these demands and produced the requested records, including amendments to the lease, a 2017 budget estimate, and monthly income statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   (noting that in the letter, GSA Associate Administrator Lisa\n   A. Austin stated that the production was \"[c]onsistent with the Seven Member Rule and judicial and Department of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel opinions\" (alteration in original) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Upon his inauguration on January 20, 2017, President Trump became an \"elected official of the Government of the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 18. Recall, Article 37.19 of the Old Post Office lease provides that \"[n]o ... elected official of the Government of the United States ... shall be admitted to any share or part of this Lease, or to any benefit that may arise therefrom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Yet, according to Plaintiffs, neither President Trump nor his children have divested their interests in Trump Old Post Office LLC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. Concerned about potential conflicts of interest, Ranking Member Cummings, along with the same three Representatives who joined in the first two requests, sent a letter to then GSA Acting Administrator Timothy Horne on January 23, 2017, asking GSA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (a) to explain the steps that GSA had taken, or planned to take, to address President Trump's apparent breach of the lease agreement; (b) to state whether GSA intended to notify President Trump's company that it is in breach; (c) to provide the monthly reports President Trump's company submits to the GSA on the Trump International Hotel's revenues and expenses; (d) to explain and provide documentation of the steps GSA had taken, or planned to take, to address liens against the Trump International Hotel; and (e) to provide copies of all correspondence with representatives of President Trump's company or the Trump transition team.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. GSA did not comply with the request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Instead, by letter dated February 6, 2017, GSA Acting Associate Administrator Saul Japson promised that \"[s]hould the [House Oversight Committee] or any seven members thereof submit a request pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , GSA will review such a request.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Members of the House Oversight Committee took Japson up on his invitation. On February 8, 2017, Ranking Member Cummings, joined by seven other committee members--all Democrats in the minority--sent a letter to Horne demanding the same documents related to the Old Post Office lease and, this time, specifically invoking section 2954.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    \u00b6 21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . GSA did not respond to the February 8th letter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    \u00b6 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It did, however, issue two important public statements in the months that followed. First, on March 23, 2017, GSA issued a letter from a contracting officer asserting that Trump Old Post Office LLC was in full compliance with Article 37.19 of the lease.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    \u00b6 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, in testimony before the House Committee on Appropriations in May 2017, Horne announced that GSA would comply with oversight requests from Democrats if joined by a Republican Chair of a committee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    \u00b6 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Horne did not acknowledge the Seven Member Rule in his testimony.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Thereafter, Ranking Member Cummings and other minority members of the House Oversight Committee continued their pursuit of records. By letter dated June 5, 2017, Ranking Member Cummings, now joined by 17 other House Oversight Committee members (collectively \"Plaintiffs\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   renewed the demand for records\n   made in the February 8th letter and requested additional records, including documents \"containing legal interpretations of Section 37.19 of the Old Post Office lease\" and \"relating to funds received from any foreign country, foreign entity, or foreign source.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    \u00b6 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this letter, Plaintiffs also asserted that GSA's failure to provide the requested information violated section 2954 ; was \"inconsistent with prior practices of both Republican and Democratic administrations and of GSA's prior practice to honor requests made under the Seven Member Rule\"; and \"thwart[ed] the ability of Committee members to carry out their congressionally-delegated duty to perform oversight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Once more, GSA provided no response. Undeterred, on July 6, 2017, Plaintiffs sent a third letter demanding a response to their previous requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   GSA responded in writing to this third demand, but produced no records. By letter dated July 17, 2017, GSA Associate Administrator P. Brennan Hart, III denied Plaintiffs' request, citing a recent Office of Legal Counsel (\"OLC\") memorandum.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n    \u00b6 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Quoting from the OLC memorandum, Hart's letter states that \"[i]ndividual members of Congress, including ranking minority members, do not have authority to conduct oversight in the absence of a specific delegation by a full house, committee, or subcommittee,\" and that \"the Executive Branch's longstanding policy has been to engage in the established process for accommodating congressional requests for information only when those requests come from a committee, subcommittee, or chairman authorized to conduct oversight.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202954\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

It sent a letter to Senator Charles Grassley, stating that \"the OLC opinion '\n   <em>\n    does not\n   </em>\n   set forth Administration policy' and that '[t]he Administration's policy is to respect the rights of all individual Members, regardless of party affiliation, to request information about Executive branch policies and programs.' \" Compl. \u00b6 29 (alteration in original) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notwithstanding this stated position, GSA still has yet to produce any records in direct response to Plaintiffs' Seven Member Rule requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.

If one of the Members were to retire tomorrow, he would no longer have a claim; the claim would be possessed by his successor instead.

The same is true here. Plaintiffs have not been \"singled out for specially unfavorable treatment\" like Adam Clayton Powell.

As discussed above, because the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   claimed that they had an adequate interest in maintaining the \"effectiveness of their votes\" like the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Coleman, Raines\n   </em>\n   arguably left open the question whether individual Members of Congress have standing to assert other types of institutional injuries outside the vote dilution context. The Court seemed to suggest as much when, in closing, it observed that \"the institutional injury [the plaintiffs] allege is wholly abstract and widely dispersed (contra,\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   ).\"\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915902\" index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/811/#p820\">\n    521 U.S. at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915902\" index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/811/#p820\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Might a claimed institutional injury that is\n   <em>\n    neither\n   </em>\n   \"wholly abstract\"\n   <em>\n    nor\n   </em>\n   \"widely dispersed\" suffice to confer standing on an individual Member of Congress?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Arguably, this is such a case. Section 2954 is unique in that it grants a statutory right to seven members of the House Oversight Committee--a true minority (seven Members) of a minority of the House of Representatives (those Members on the Oversight Committee)--to request and receive information from an Executive agency, provided that information falls within the Committee's jurisdiction. The denial of a Seven Member Rule request, although not a personal injury, is a more particularized type of institutional injury than a general diminution of legislative power, such as the dilution of the efficacy of Congress members' votes (e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   ) or the deprivation of their right to participate and vote in manner prescribed by the Constitution (e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Chenoweth\n   </em>\n   ). Those types of injuries, by definition, affect all Members\n   <em>\n    equally\n   </em>\n   . Here, by contrast, not every Member even possesses the right to make a Seven Member Rule request--only a small percentage do and, even then, it must be a collective demand. So, the injury brought upon by a denial of a Seven Member Rule request cannot genuinely be said to apply equally to all Members. It falls specifically on the Members that made the demand and therefore is not \"widely dispersed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Additionally, the rejection of a Seven Member Rule request is more concrete than, say, again, a claim of vote dilution. Courts have not, for instance, doubted in the congressional subpoena enforcement context that the Executive Branch's refusal to produce records is a sufficiently concrete injury.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Miers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3659838\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/558/53/#p71\">\n    558 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   71 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holder\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192813\" index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/979/1/#p14\">\n    979 F.Supp.2d at 20-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At least in terms of concreteness, it is hard to conceive of a material difference between this case--a suit to enforce a congressional records demand--and a subpoena enforcement case--a suit to enforce a congressional records demand. Thus, to the extent that\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   demands that an individual Member of Congress have an injury that is both concrete\n   and particularized to vindicate an institutional injury, this case bears those characteristics in a way that other cases post-\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   have not.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the court finds that Plaintiffs have made a stronger case than the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   that they have suffered the type of institutional injury that could potentially establish Article III standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   But that is not the end of the analysis. The Court in\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   instructed that, when evaluating the standing of a Member of Congress, courts also must consider \"historical experience,\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915902\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/811/#p820\">\n    521 U.S. at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915902\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/811/#p820\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as well as several other factors, including whether the Member has been \"authorized to represent\" the house of Congress in which she serves and the availability of an \"adequate remedy,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915902\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/811/#p820\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9318994\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/230/51/#p64\">\n    230 F.Supp.2d at 64-65, 68-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, these additional considerations all weigh heavily against recognizing standing in this case.

Pls.' Mem. at 25 n.10. The mere adoption of section 2954 cannot, however, carry the weight that Plaintiffs accord it. It is a dubious proposition that, when Congress adopted the Seven Member Rule 90 years ago, it meant the statute to be an unqualified grant of permission for as few as seven members of the House Oversight Committee to bring suit against the Executive Branch any time those members were dissatisfied with a document production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9318994\" index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/230/51/#p64\">\n    230 F.Supp.2d at 69-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that the \"highly generalized allocation of enforcement power\" given to the Comptroller General \"twenty-two years ago hardly gives this Court confidence that the current Congress has authorized this Comptroller General to pursue a judicial resolution of the specific issues affecting the balance of power between the Article I and Article II Branches\"). Nothing about the text or history of section 2954 supports such an interpretation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, Plaintiffs' view, if accepted, would have profound consequences for the balance of powers between the political branches, as it would mean that a small group of congressmen could initiate an inter-branch conflict, even if the institution, speaking through a majority vote, opposes the confrontation. So, the court reads the Seven Member Rule only to allow what it plainly says: A minority group of Members of the House Oversight Committee may make a demand for information from an Executive agency. The Rule says nothing, however, about such a group's capacity to file suit to enforce the demand, let alone whether they could do so without the majority assent of\n   their colleagues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The absence of approval from the House to commence this suit to remedy an institutional injury therefore is fatal to Plaintiffs' assertion of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Alternative Remedies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Finally, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   buttressed its standing decision by noting that the plaintiffs there were not left without avenues of redress. They could, the Court observed, endeavor to \"repeal the [Line Item Veto Act] or exempt appropriations bills from its reach.\"\n   <em>\n    Raines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915902\" index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/811/#p820\">\n    521 U.S. at 829\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"915902\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/521/811/#p820\">\n    117 S.Ct. 2312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For instance, Plaintiffs could attempt to convince a majority of their colleagues on the House Oversight Committee to join in their demand under section 2954 or, alternatively, to issue a subpoena for the documents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Rule XI, cl. 2(m)(1)-(3), Rules of the House of Representatives, https://rules.house.gov/sites/republicans.rules.house.gov/files/115/PDF/House-Rules-115.pdf [hereinafter House Rules]. Presumably, with majority support from the Oversight Committee, GSA's refusal to produce documents would be met with greater political force. And, even if their Oversight Committee colleagues rejected their efforts, Plaintiffs could urge the House Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group to support litigation to enforce the Seven Member Rule requests.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiffs, they did not try this route.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 33-36.
