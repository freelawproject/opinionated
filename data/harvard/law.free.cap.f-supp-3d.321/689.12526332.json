Westen (\"Westen\"), plaintiffs move for partial summary judgment on certain claims and defenses. For the reasons that follow, the court grants the motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Carmack, Miller, and Aniagu are former hourly-paid home health employees of Park Cities Healthcare, which is a third-party provider of certified nursing aides, certified medical assistants, and other home health employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Westen is Park Cities Healthcare's founder, president, sole shareholder, owner/administrator, and nurse. Park Cities Healthcare hired Carmack and Aniagu in 2011, and hired Miller in 2013. Carmack and Miller held the title of Certified Nursing Aid, and Aniagu was classified as a Medical Assistant. From May 2015 until November 2016 Miller also served as a Certified Nursing Aid supervisor and performed additional duties, such as assisting Westen with new employee\n   orientation. Plaintiffs primarily provided in-home care to ill or injured elderly individuals. They generally worked 12-hour shifts, during which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , they performed medically-related services, such as checking vital signs (including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature), assisted the client with daily activities (including dressing, grooming, feeding, bathing, toileting, and transferring to/from bed), and housework (including meal preparation, light housework, and assistance with taking medications).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs reported to Westen and were not employed by individual patients, the patients' families, or the patients' households. Plaintiffs performed all work in private homes that Park Cities Healthcare did not own, manage, or rent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs were regularly scheduled to work 12-hour shifts at least five days per week, but their actual hours varied. Prior to December 2016, in weeks in which plaintiffs worked greater than 40 hours, they received straight pay, or their regular hourly rate of pay, for the hours in excess of 40. Around December 2016, defendants began paying overtime pay at a rate of 1\u00bd times regular pay to employees for hours worked in excess of 40 hours per week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 26, 2016 Carmack filed this action on behalf of herself and all others similarly situated, alleging that defendants had willfully violated the FLSA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20207\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), and seeking recovery of unpaid overtime compensation based on a two-year statute of limitations period from January 1, 2015 until the first week of December 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and an equal amount of liquidated damages, as well as attorney's fees and costs. Carmack alleges that, during the two-year limitations period, she worked 1,432 overtime hours, Miller worked 2,066.25 overtime hours, and Aniagu worked 1,903 overtime hours. During the two-year limitations period, Carmack earned between $11 and $12 per hour; Miller earned between $11 and $12.50 per hour; and Aniagu earned $12 per hour. Miller received additional pay for her role as a Certified Nursing Aid supervisor, including $50 per pay period to carry Park Cities Healthcare's on-call phone and a varying hourly rate for her time assisting with new employee orientation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Miller resigned from Park Cities Healthcare on November 2, 2016. Park Cities Healthcare terminated Carmack's employment on January 13, 2017. And Aniagu resigned on February 17, 2017. Plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on December 5, 2017,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which also alleged that defendants had retaliated against Carmack and Aniagu based on their FLSA activity. As of the time of filing this memorandum opinion and order, defendants have not filed an answer to the second amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs now move for partial summary judgment, seeking summary judgment on their FLSA overtime claim, their FLSA retaliation claim, and defendants' affirmative defenses of the Companionship Services overtime exemption and good faith under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20260\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs performed their duties in the private homes of Park Cities Healthcare's clients. The Certified Nurse Aid job description on Park Cities Healthcare's website outlines some responsibilities, including cooking, light housekeeping, and ensuring timely provision of ordered treatments and medications. Plaintiffs performed services such as recording vital signs, including blood pressure,\n   pulse, and temperature. They also assisted patients with dressing, grooming, feeding, bathing, toileting, and transfer to and from bed.

Westen avers that she thought that if she paid at least minimum wage to her domestic service employees, she was not required to pay overtime for hours over 40 hours per week. Westen contacted Clark and another attorney in November 2016. She also accessed the DOL website and attempted to call for guidance. Finally, defendants point to division in the lower courts regarding the effective date of the DOL Amended Regulations, discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in \u00a7 IV, as evidence of the reasonable grounds of their belief that they did not have to pay overtime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The court holds that, taking defendants' evidence as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in their favor, their proof is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. First, Westen's deposition testimony establishes that she had conversations with attorneys regarding the FLSA. But it does not contain any detail about the particular facts or issues that were discussed, and Westen largely omits detail regarding the advice she received from counsel. For example, Westen avers that she contacted an attorney in November 2016 regarding the DOL regulations, but she does not describe the advice she received.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowrin v.

But defendants offer no evidence that they actually relied on the Companionship Services exemption when deciding whether to pay overtime. Nor do they present proof that an attorney advised them that they fell under the Companionship Services exemption. Westen testified in her deposition that Clark concurred that defendants were in compliance with the FLSA so long as they paid\n   minimum wage to their domestic service employees. But the alleged uncertainty regarding the Companionship Services exemption would not give her reasonable grounds to rely on Clark's advice because the advice was not connected to the Companionship Services exemption. In this case, defendants' evidence at best shows that Westen was ignorant or uncertain of the FLSA's mandates. But \" '[g]ood faith' in this context requires more than ignorance of the prevailing law or uncertainty about its development. It requires that an employer first take active steps to ascertain the dictates of the FLSA and then move to comply with them.\"\n   <em>\n    Reich v. S. N.E. Telecomms.
