TCPA Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant contends that summary judgment is warranted on Plaintiff's TCPA claim, because Plaintiff provided the Synchrony with his phone number and express consent to be contacted. Defendant's Memorandum of Law in Support of Summary Judgment (\"Def's Mem.\") at 8-10, ECF 85. To succeed on a TCPA claim, Plaintiff needed to establish that (1) the defendant called the plaintiff's cellular telephone number; (2) using, an automatic telephone dialing system; (3) without prior express consent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A)(iii). The FCC has stated that \"the provision of a cell phone number to a creditor,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , as part of a credit application, reasonably evidences prior express consent by the cell phone subscriber to be contacted at that number regarding the debt.\"\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Rules &amp; Regulations Implementing the Tel.

It bears worth noting, however, that capturing a debtor's phone number with caller ID tools does not constitute express consent.\n   <em>\n    Castro v. Green Tree Servicing LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834985\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/959/698/#p721\">\n    959 F.Supp.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citations omitted). Here, Defendant submitted an electronic version of Plaintiff's 2007 GAP credit card application. The credit application listed Plaintiff's identifying information including, inter alia, his phone number ending in 7845, home address, and social security number. In his deposition, Plaintiff admitted that he used the phone number ending in 7845 at the time the application was submitted to Synchrony. Plaintiff also admitted that he currently uses the phone number ending in 7845. Defendant also submitted several years of billing statements that were sent to Plaintiff's home addresses. Plaintiff confirmed in his deposition that Synchrony's billing statements listed his accurate addresses. Also important was Plaintiff's acceptance of an online offer to GAP Visa Card ending in 4157 in 2012. Defendant submitted a copy of the GAP Visa account agreement that was sent to Plaintiff's home address. The Gap Visa account agreement included a \"Consent to Communications\" clause which provided express consent for Synchrony to contact Plaintiff. Plaintiff's phone number ending in 7845 called Synchrony around the same time to activate the Gap Visa.card ending in 4157. On that call, Plaintiff provided his social security number, accepted the terms and agreement for the Gap Visa account, and activated the Gap Visa card ending in 4157.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff failed to submit any evidence in support of his opposition to summary judgment. Plaintiff did not submit phone records showing that Synchrony called his cell phone in an attempt to collect a debt. Plaintiff did not submit evidence regarding Synchrony's use of an automatic telephone dialing system. Plaintiff also failed to rebut Synchrony's evidence regarding his express consent. Instead of submitting evidence of his own, Plaintiff simply attacked Synchrony's Koehler Affidavit calling it hearsay, unauthenticated, and untruthful. Plaintiff's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Summary Judgment (\"Pl's Mem.) at 7-9, ECF 94. Contrary to Plaintiff's arguments, however, it was not improper for Synchrony's custodian to rely on business records to support her testimony. \"A record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis\" is admissible if \"the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, organization, occupation,\n   or calling, whether or not for profit.\" Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)(B). Under Rule 803(6), business records exempt from hearsay may include \"data stored electronically on computers and later printed out for presentation in court, so long as the original computer data compilation was prepared pursuant to a business duty in accordance with regular business practice.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Potamkin Cadillac Corp. v. B.R.I. Coverage Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852568\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/627/#p632\">\n    38 F.3d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632 (2d Cir. 1994). The Koehler Affidavit avers that the records upon which the testimony was based are electronic records made \"at or about the time of the events reflected in each record, by an employee or representative of Synchrony with knowledge of the act, event, condition, or opinion recorded to make the record original or exact duplicates of the original and were maintained in the ordinary course of Synchrony's regularly conducted business.\" Koehler Aff. \u00b6 4. The fact that the affiant examined electronic copies of Synchrony's records does not raise an issue of material fact that would preclude summary judgment. Also irrelevant is whether the affiant is physically located at Synchrony's headquarters in Utah.

The Court finds that Plaintiff's acceptance of the terms of the GAP card, which included his \"consent to communication\" was the kind of bargained-for consideration that is not unilaterally revocable. But even if Plaintiff's express consent was unilaterally given as opposed to a bargained-for exchange, Plaintiff has not shown that he revoked his express consent.

The Official Staff Interpretation provides that \"[w]hen a card issuer substitutes or replaces an existing credit card account with another credit card account, the card issuer must either provide notice of the terms of the new account ... or provide notice of the changes in the terms of the existing account ....\" 12 C.F.R. pt. 226.5(b)(1)(i)(6), Supp. I. However, the Federal Reserve Board explicitly addressed the case at bar, stating that \"a card issuer that replaces a credit card or provides a new account number because the consumer has reported the card stolen or because the account appears to have been used for unauthorized transactions is not required to provide a notice ....\" 12 C.F.R. pt. 226.5(b)(1)(i)(6)(iii), Supp. I. This is not a case where a consumer was sent an unsolicited ready-to-use credit card. Plaintiff applied for and used a GAP credit account only to complain of fraud on his account six years later. In December, 2013, Plaintiff sent Synchrony a notice of cancellation of the GAP Visa card ending in 4157, alleging that he was the victim of identity theft and fraud. In response to Plaintiff's claim of identity theft, Synchrony closed the GAP Visa card ending in 4157 and sent Plaintiff a replacement GAP Visa Card ending in 2094. Synchrony also transferred the balance of Plaintiff's account to the GAP Visa Card ending in 2094. Without any legal support, Plaintiff maintains that Synchrony's substitution constituted a new account triggering TILA disclosures, because the bank ignored Plaintiff's request to cancel the account. Pl's Mem. at 13. Plaintiff is wrong. Even if Synchrony somehow \"ignored\" a request to cancel the credit account, the plain language of \u00a7 1642 does not address such a grievance. In a digital world rife with electronic fraud, it seems axiomatic that a credit card company would not be held liable for sending a customer, who complains of fraud, a replacement card to ensure the security of the account.

Breach of Contract Counterclaim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant moves for summary judgment on its breach of contract counterclaim. Def's Mem. at 15-16. In order to succeed on a motion for summary judgment, New York law requires Defendant to show that the undisputed material facts establish the existence of a contract, Defendant's performance of the contract, Plaintiff's non-performance of the contract, and damages stemming from the breach.\n   <em>\n    CSI Inv.

App'x 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2009). As an initial matter, the Court finds it appropriate to exercise supplemental jurisdiction because the claims \"form part of the same case or controversy under Article III of the United States Constitution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). As to the merits of Defendant's counterclaim, the summary judgment evidence shows that Plaintiff opened a GAP credit card account in 2007. The GAP account agreement included a \"You Promise to Pay\" provision requiring debtors to pay all amounts owed on the account. Plaintiff used the GAP card for five years. Synchrony sent countless billing statements to Plaintiff's home address. The billing statements show nearly 60 payments were made on the account. In 2012, Plaintiff accepted and activated the upgraded GAP Visa card in July 2012. Plaintiff used the GAP Visa card for numerous transactions until late 2013 and actually\n   made payments during this time frame, further evidencing the validity of this contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In the face of this evidence, Plaintiff argues that during the investigation, the CRA deleted the negative information pertaining to the GAP card and GAP Visa accounts. Pl's Mem. at 14. According to Plaintiff, the CRA's removal of the negative information is evidence that the account was procured through fraudulent means. The Court disagrees. The CRA's decision to remove negative information from Plaintiff's credit report while Defendant investigated the dispute has no bearing on whether Plaintiff entered a contract with Defendant. Beyond conclusory allegations and blanket denials, Plaintiff has failed to raise a triable issue of fact as to whether he used the GAP credit cards. For example, Plaintiff did not show he lived somewhere other than the address where his GAP card statements were sent. Plaintiff has not presented evidence that someone else used his cell phone to call Synchrony and activate the GAP Visa card. Nor has Plaintiff shown that he had been the victim of fraud in the past, which would raise an inference that the GAP card accounts may have also been fraudulently obtained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Defendant fully performed its obligations under the account agreement by extending credit to Plaintiff on the account. Therefore, Defendant is entitled to recover the value of the credit extended under the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Towers World Airways Inc. v. PHH Aviation Sys.
