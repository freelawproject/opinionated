In addition, Mahon asks the Court to vacate the denial of her application for naturalization. She also seeks attorney's fees pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202412\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendants move to dismiss on the grounds that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. (Def. Mot. (Doc. No. 31).) Mahon opposes the motion (Pl. Opp. (Doc. No. 33) ) and defendants have replied (Def. Reply (Doc. No. 34) ). For the reasons that follow, the Court grants defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mahon, who is a citizen of Trinidad and Tobago, entered the United States on or about December 23, 1990. Her father, a U.S. citizen, filed a Form I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on her behalf, based on the classification of Mahon as an unmarried daughter of a U.S. citizen. (Compl. (Doc. No. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.) That petition was approved in May 1999. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.) Mahon filed for an adjustment of status to become a lawful permanent resident on March 24, 2000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19.) Mahon then got married to a U.S. citizen on April 29, 2001. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) Because she was married, Mahon was no longer eligible to adjust her status as an unmarried daughter of a U.S. citizen. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") did not realize Mahon had gotten married, however, and adjusted her status to lawful permanent resident in\n   December 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) Mahon then filed an N-400 application for naturalization, which was approved in July 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Her naturalization application was subsequently denied, however, because USCIS realized that she obtained her lawful permanent resident status not in accordance with all applicable provisions of the immigration laws. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mahon's husband, who is a U.S. citizen, filed a Petition for Alien Relative on Mahon's behalf in April 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Mahon then filed an adjustment application, seeking to readjust her lawful permanent resident status through this avenue in an attempt to correct the defect in her previous application. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In September 2014, the Petition for Alien Relative was approved, which did not it itself grant any immigration status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29; DHS Ltr. (Doc. No. 1-12).) In October 2014, USCIS denied Mahon's second adjustment application on the grounds that she is already a lawful permanent resident. (Compl. \u00b6 30; USCIS Denial Ltr. (Doc. No. 1-13).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mahon then filed her complaint in this Court on September 2, 2016. About two months later, on October 29, 2016, USCIS issued Mahon a \"Notice to Appear\" before an Immigration Judge. (Gov't Ex. A (Doc. No. 32) at 15.) Mahon was placed in removal proceedings because she was not entitled to her lawful permanent resident status at the time of her adjustment of status in 2003. (Def. Mem. at 15-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A district court must dismiss an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) when the court \"lacks the statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate it.\"\n   <em>\n    Cortlandt St. Recovery Corp v.

Mandamus Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Styling her petition as a \"complaint for mandamus,\" Mahon states that the \"lawsuit arises from a failure of the defendant to adjudicate the plaintiff's application to adjust status on its merits\" and asks the Court to order the defendants to adjudicate Mahon's second application. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 13.) The defendants respond that this claim is moot. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The case or controversy requirement of Article III precludes litigation over claims that are moot.\n   <em>\n    Fox v.

When a plaintiff asks a court to compel a federal official to act, and the federal official has already performed that act, the claim is moot, and, therefore, the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Barrett v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637324\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/105/793/#p794\">\n    105 F.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 794 (2d Cir. 1996). Here, Mahon seeks to compel USCIS to adjudicate her adjustment application. However, USCIS already did so on October 1, 2014 when it denied her second application. (Compl. \u00b6 30.) The Court cannot mandate USCIS to adjudicate an application that it has already adjudicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aizah v.

Mar. 28, 2013) (finding an action for a writ of mandamus moot where USCIS had already adjudicated the plaintiff's I-130 petition). Accordingly, this claim is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mahon asks the Court to vacate the denial of her application for lawful permanent resident status. (Compl. at 12.) She also asks the Court to declare that the approval of Mahon's application for permanent resident status in 2003 \"is void ab initio\" and that Mahon's \"denied application for permanent resident status is entitled to a nunc pro tunc decision on its merits.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Without any citations to supporting case law, Mahon claims that USCIS should have corrected her application to reflect that she was a married daughter of a U.S. citizen-as opposed to an unmarried one-and suggests that USCIS had an obligation to send her a Request For Evidence. (Pl. Mem. (Doc. No. 33) at 10.) In light of these alleged mistakes, Mahon urges the Court to vacate the denial of her second adjustment application. The defendants respond that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to review USCIS's denial because Mahon has not exhausted her administrative remedies available in removal proceedings. The Court agrees with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201255\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the status of an alien admitted into the United States \"may be adjusted ... to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\" If an alien's application is denied, then \"[n]o appeal lies from the denial of an application ... but the applicant retains the right to renew his or her application in [removal] proceedings.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20245.2\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 245.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5)(ii).

Mar. 21, 2010) (finding that the court lacked jurisdiction to reopen plaintiffs' adjustment of status application). This remains true even if the removal proceedings begin after the plaintiff files her complaint, as is the case here. In\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the applicant was placed in removal proceedings while her case was pending before the Second Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, Mahon has failed to exhaust her administrative remedies, and, therefore, the Court does not have jurisdiction. As was the case in\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   , Mahon has the opportunity to renew her application before the Immigration Judge in removal proceedings. Moreover, none of the\n   exceptions to the administrative exhaustion requirement applies here. Mahon cannot claim that she lacks a genuine opportunity for adequate relief because she may renew her application for adjustment of status during the removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413031\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/288/#p291\">\n    72 F.3d at 293\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Requiring Mahon to renew her application before the Immigration Judge, instead of permitting immediate review at the district court, will not cause irreparable injury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413031\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/288/#p291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The administrative process will not be futile, \"since if the immigration judge approves [Mahon's] application for adjustment of status at the [removal] proceedings, she will have had an adequate remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413031\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/288/#p291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, Mahon has not raised any \"substantial constitutional question that would warrant an exception to the exhaustion requirement.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7413031\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/72/288/#p291\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She states in her complaint that the denial of her lawful permanent resident status application deprived her of her Fifth Amendment rights. (Compl. \u00b6 42.) However, she does not explain how, and her reply to the defendants' motion to dismiss does not even mention this alleged constitutional violation. Merely asserting a constitutional violation, without more, does not exempt Mahon from exhausting her administrative remedies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In her response to the defendants' request for a pre-motion conference, Mahon suggests that\n   <em>\n    Howell\n   </em>\n   does not apply. (Pl. Ltr. (Doc. No. 26) at 3.) She notes that Howell's application was denied on evidentiary grounds, whereas USCIS denied Mahon's application based on its interpretation of the relevant statute. Regardless of the basis for USCIS' decision, however, Mahon has not exhausted her administrative remedies, and, as a result, the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Blaszczyk\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%201038690\">\n    2010 WL 1038690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y.
