Reg. at 64,358 (AR Doc. 6764, BSSG 87898). In conjunction with the proposed rules (\"Proposed Listing\"), the Service proposed designating critical habitat for the Bi-State DPS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the Proposed Listing, the Service echoed the concerns set forth in the 2013 Species Report with respect to the status of the Bi-State DPS and threatened impacts to it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Service concluded that the severity of these impacts was \"high.\" 78 Fed. Reg. at 64,364 (AR Doc. 6764, BSSG 87904).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In determining whether the Bi-State DPS was threatened or endangered, the Service considered the following five factors that may give rise to a finding that a species is threatened or endangered: \"(A) The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range; (B) overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes; (C) Disease or predation; (D) the inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms; or (E) other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.\" 78 Fed. Reg. at 64,358 (AR Doc. 6764, BSSG 87898).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With respect to Factor D, the inadequacy of the existing regulatory mechanisms, the Service found that some local, state and federal regulatory mechanisms exist \"that either provide or have the potential to provide a conservation benefit to the Bi-State DPS,\" but that \"supporting documents for some of these are many years old and have not been updated, calling into question their consistency with our current understanding of the DPS's life history requirements, reaction to disturbances, and the DPS's conservation needs.\" 78 Fed. Reg. at 64,372 (AR Doc. 6764, BSSG 87912). The Service further noted that implementation of conservation actions pursuant to these existing regulatory mechanisms varies depending on the availability of staff and funding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to land planning mechanisms for federally managed lands (of which the Bi-State area is \"largely comprised\"), the Service noted that \"[e]xisting land use plans, as they pertain to sage grouse, are typically general in nature and afford relatively broad latitude to land managers,\" which \"can result in land use decisions that negatively affect the Bi-State DPS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Service found regulations in some counties \"identify the need for natural resource conservation and attempt to minimize impacts of development through zoning restrictions\" but that they \"neither preclude development nor do they provide for monitoring of the loss of sage-grouse habitats.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, the Service concluded that \"State laws and regulations are general in nature and provide flexibility in implementation, and do not provide specific direction to State wildlife agencies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   With respect to the proposed special rule under Section 4(d) of the ESA to provide for the conservation of the Bi-State DPS, the Service recognized the ongoing voluntary conservation efforts discussed above, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   The Service proposes this 4(d) special rule in recognition of the significant conservation planning efforts occurring throughout the range of the Bi-State DPS for the purpose of reducing or eliminating threats affecting the DPS. Multiple partners (including private citizens, nongovernmental organizations, and Federal and State agencies) are engaged in conservation efforts across the entire range of the DPS on public and private lands, and these efforts have provided and will continue to provide a conservation benefit to the DPS. Two recent examples of conservation programs in the Bi-State area are the Bi-State Action Plan, which was finalized on March 15, 2012, and addresses the entire range of the DPS on public and private lands; and the NRCS's Sage-Grouse Initiative (SGI). Efforts associated with both programs will facilitate conservation benefits in the Bi-State area, and these programs will continue to provide conservation benefits to the DPS into the future. Currently, existing programs do not yet fully address the suite of factors contributing to cumulative habitat loss and fragmentation, which is our primary concern across the Bi-State DPS's range. However, the Bi-State Action Plan, if completely refined and fully implemented, may result in the removal of threats to the Bi-State DPS so that the protections of the Act may no longer be warranted, especially in combination with other actions, including Federal land management agencies' ongoing efforts to ensure regulatory mechanisms are adequate for the DPS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   October 28, 2013 Proposed Listing,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20Fed.%20Reg.%2064%2C377\">\n    78 Fed.

Contentions of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Plaintiffs' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiffs ask the Court to enter summary judgment in their favor on all three of their claims and to enter an order vacating and remanding the Withdrawal Decision and SPR Policy and enjoining Defendants from relying on or applying that policy. Plaintiffs argue that the Withdrawal Decision is unlawful on numerous grounds. First, they contend it is not based on the best available science, focusing in particular on: 1) the Service's reliance on the 2014 Coates Study to show that the population of the Bi-State DPS is stable; and 2) the Service's reliance on recent genetic studies to support their revised analysis of species resiliency, redundancy and representation. They also contend the Service addressed threats to the Bi-State DPS only in isolation and failed to consider the cumulative impacts of these threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Second, they argue that the Service improperly relied on updates to various land use plans that had not yet been adopted whereas the Service may consider only\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   regulatory mechanisms in making listing determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs challenge the Service's PECE analysis, which concluded that the future conservation efforts described in the 2012 BSAP justified withdrawing the listing of the Bi-State DPS. In particular, Plaintiffs argue that PECE does not allow the Service to rely on \"speculative promises\" of future action but instead requires that it rely on \"formalized conservation efforts\" where there is a \"high level of certainty\" that the measures will be implemented and effective. According to Plaintiffs, the Service did not adhere to this requirement in conducting its PECE analysis. With respect to the level of certainty that the conservation measures in the 2012 BSAP will be implemented, Plaintiffs argue that the letters of commitment by federal agencies to funding and staffing, upon which the Service relied in its Withdrawal Decision, cannot provide the requisite certainty where they purport to commit to efforts that will occur over the next ten years. Such commitments, no matter how well-intentioned, cannot be \"highly certain\" when agency budgets are subject to annual Congressional budget appropriations and executive branch prerogatives, Plaintiffs assert. Plaintiffs also contend there is not a high level of certainty that the conservation efforts envisioned in the 2012 BSAP will be effective. Rather, they argue, the Service provides a \"laundry list\" of proposed future actions without explaining why they would be sufficiently effective to withdraw the Proposed Listing of the Bi-State DPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue the PECE analysis is flawed because the ESA permits the Service to consider conservation efforts by \"any State or foreign nation, or any political subdivision of a State or foreign nation\" in determining whether listing is warranted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). When it comes to conservation efforts by federal agencies, on the other hand, the ESA takes into account only\n   <em>\n    existing\n   </em>\n   regulatory mechanisms, Plaintiffs assert.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(D). According to Plaintiffs, the Service violates the ESA by relying on non-regulatory promises by a few federal agencies to deprive the Bi-State DPS of the mandatory protection that would be required of all federal agencies if it were listed as threatened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs challenge the 2014 SPR Policy on its face and as applied. Plaintiffs' facial challenge is based on the definitions of \"significant\" and \"range\" in the SPR Policy. As to the former, Plaintiffs contend the SPR Policy gives the \"significant portion of its range\" language of the ESA no independent meaning because a portion of a species' range is \"significant\" under the SPR Policy only if its contribution to the viability of the species is so important that without the members of that portion the species would be threatened or endangered throughout all of its range. Plaintiffs argue that approach is inconsistent with the Ninth Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Defenders of Wildlife v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085271\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/258/1136/\">\n    258 F.3d 1136\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2001). They also contend it is inconsistent with Congressional intent and the purpose of the ESA. With respect to the definition of \"range\" in the SPR Policy as meaning \"current range,\" Plaintiffs argue that this definition violates principles of statutory construction because \"range\" is used throughout the ESA to refer to the historical range of a species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiffs also contend the Service misapplied the SPR Policy when it considered whether the listing of the Bi-State DPS should be withdrawn. In particular, they argue that the Service failed to explain why the acknowledged challenges to the smaller PMUs, which are at significant risk of extirpation, are not sufficient to show that the entire species is threatened under the SPR Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Defendants contend they have violated neither the ESA nor the APA and ask the Court to enter summary judgment in their favor on all of Plaintiffs' claims. First, they reject Plaintiffs' assertion that the Service's PECE analysis was flawed, arguing that it was based on an extensive analysis of the 2012 BSAP, including the new information that was submitted during the public comment period for the proposed listing by the local, state and federal agencies involved in the implementation of the plan. According to Defendants, this included consideration of refined conservation priorities and specific and concrete conservation measures, as well as letters of commitment totaling $45 million in funding for these measures. Because this new information addressed the shortcomings identified in the Proposed Listing, Defendants assert, the Service's conclusion that the PECE criteria were satisfied was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants reject Plaintiffs' argument that the conservation plans outlined in the 2012 BSAP are too speculative to satisfy PECE, arguing that PECE is a predictive tool that allows the Service to consider even incomplete and unproven actions, so long as they are \"sufficiently certain\" to be implemented and effective. Likewise, Defendants accuse Plaintiffs of adopting a \"cramped\" reading of language in the PECE policy that states that the Service \"must determine at the time of the listing decision that the conservation effort has improved the status of the species.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' reliance on the vagaries of Congressional funding and changing executive priorities to show that implementation of the BSAP conservation measures is not \"sufficiently certain\" is a \"novel argument\" that is unsupported by case law. Further, they assert, the possibility of budget cuts is speculative and should not be considered. And even if appropriations were reduced in future budgets, they contend, this does not automatically result in cuts to particular\n   programs given that agencies retain the discretion to set priorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Defendants also argue that the Service reasonably concluded that the actions in the 2012 BSAP are \"sufficiently certain\" to be effective, rejecting Plaintiffs' contention that the Service did not provide specific reasons in support of that conclusion. To the contrary, Defendants assert, the Service provided an extensive evaluation of the threats to the Bi-State DPS, the efficacy of past and ongoing conservation efforts and the likely efficacy of future conservation measures in addressing these threats. The Service also compared planned conservation measures in the 2012 BSAP to the guidance provided in the COT report, which provided peer-reviewed conservation objectives and recommended measures to achieve them. According to Defendants, the main example cited by Plaintiffs - conservation efforts to remove pinyon and juniper trees from sagebrush habitat - actually shows that the Service conducted a thorough analysis of how the conservation efforts described in the 2012 BSAP were likely to reduce this threat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Defendants also reject Plaintiffs' argument that the Service should not have considered the future voluntary conservation efforts of federal agencies, arguing that under PECE and the ESA, the Service may consider \"the pertinent laws, regulations, programs, and other specific actions of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   entity that either positively or negatively affects the species.\" To the extent that Plaintiffs rely on\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A), which calls for consideration of conservation efforts of \"any State or foreign nation,\" Defendants contend this provision is not exclusionary and does not preclude the Service from considering the non-regulatory efforts of federal agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   With respect to Plaintiffs' assertion that the Service did not rely on the best available science, Defendants argue that the Service's reliance on the Coates Study and the Oyler-McCance and Tebbenkamp genetic studies in support of the Withdrawal Decision was not arbitrary and capricious. With respect to the Coates Study, Defendants reject Plaintiffs' assertion that the study: 1) did not support the conclusion that the population of the Bi-State DPS is stable; and 2) did not provide a sufficient basis for analyzing the general direction of the population trend for the Bi-State DPS because it did not study the Mount Grant or White Mountains PMUs. As to the genetic studies, Defendants argue that the Service's reliance on them in support of its findings as to species resiliency, representation and redundancy was only one piece of its analysis and that it actually addressed Plaintiffs' concerns about connectivity and minimum sustainable population size, noting that the 5,000 individual minimum population was theoretical and not statistically proven, and that observations showed that the populations \"have continued to persist despite relatively small numbers of birds and annual fluctuations.\" Defendants also reject Plaintiffs' assertion that the Service did not consider threats to the Bi-State DPS cumulatively, asserting that the Service did, in fact, consider specific threats both individually and cumulatively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Addressing Plaintiffs' challenges to the SPR Policy and its application to the Bi-State DPS, Defendants argue that the policy is a permissible construction of the ESA and is entitled to deference. They further contend the policy reasonably defines the words \"significant\" and \"range.\" As to the term \"significant\" Defendants contend Plaintiffs' challenge is not ripe for judicial review because the Service's conclusion that the Bi-State DPS was not threatened under the SPR Policy was based on its finding that\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   portion of the Bi-State\n   DPS was threatened and therefore, it did not address whether any portion was \"significant.\" Defendants also argue that the Service's application of the SPR Policy in the Withdrawal Decision was reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Defenders of Wildlife\n   </em>\n   , cited by Defendants, the Supreme Court held that \"federal courts ordinarily are empowered to review only an agency's final action,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n     5\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20704\">\n    U.S.C. \u00a7 704\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the fact that a preliminary determination by a local agency representative is later overruled at a higher level within the agency does not render the decision making process arbitrary and capricious.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"224\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p659\">\n    551 U.S. 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659-60,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p659\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/#p659\">\n    168 L.Ed.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). However, as the Ninth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. U.S. Department of Transportation\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    National Association of Home Builders\n   </em>\n   \"did not hold ... that such preliminary determinations are irrelevant in any context ... or that they may not be considered when reviewing an agency action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829198\" index=\"227\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1124/#p1134\">\n    655 F.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1134 (9th Cir. 2011). Here, the comments of the agency biologists who were expressly requested to provide recommendations as to whether the Bi-State DPS should be listed (and whose\n   opinions were cited in the formal recommendation letter by the Director of the Pacific Southwest Region) are relevant to whether the Service's decision to withdraw the proposed listing was arbitrary and capricious even if these preliminary recommendations are not themselves final agency action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Turning to Plaintiffs' specific challenges, the Court finds that the Service did not violate the requirement that it use the \"best available science\" by relying on the Coates Study to gain an understanding of overall population trends for the Bi- State DPS.\n   <em>\n    See San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180707\" index=\"228\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/581/#p602\">\n    747 F.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 602 (9th Cir. 2014). While Plaintiffs have raised some serious questions about the conclusions of the Coates Study, they have not pointed to\n   <em>\n    superior\n   </em>\n   scientific evidence addressing current population trends of the Bi-State DPS that the Service ignored when it relied upon the Coates Study. Rather, it appears that prior studies of sage grouse population trends were less comprehensive than the Coates Study, which attempted to fill this gap in the science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   It is a separate question, however, whether there was a \"rational connection between the facts found and the determinations made.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona Cattle Growers' Ass'n v. Salazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3678668\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/606/1160/#p1163\">\n    606 F.3d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163 (9th Cir. 2010). Even where there is no better science available, failure to meet this requirement may render an agency action arbitrary and capricious. Thus, for example, in\n   <em>\n    Tucson Herpetological Soc. v. Salazar\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit found that the Service's withdrawal of a proposed listing of the flat-tailed horned lizard was \"without substantial basis in fact,\" and therefore arbitrary and capricious, where the Service concluded that the lizard at issue persisted in a substantial portion of its range; that conclusion, in turn, was based on population studies that were \"limited and inconclusive.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647252\" index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/870/#p878\">\n    566 F.3d 870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 878-879 (9th Cir. 2009). According to the court, the Service erred when it \"[a]pparently ... infer[red] from the uncertainty in the population studies that lizard populations remained viable throughout most of the lizard's current extant range.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647252\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/870/#p878\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647252\" index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/870/#p878\">\n    at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations and citation omitted). Here, the Court must decide whether the Coates Study provides a rational basis for the Service to conclude that the overall population trend of the Bi-State DPS is stable - a conclusion upon which it relied heavily in the Withdrawal Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The Court rejects Plaintiffs' challenge based on the ten-year period that was used in the Coates Study to evaluate population trends. In order to assess the appropriateness of that period, the Court would be required to weigh competing scientific analyses, which exceeds the scope of its review under the arbitrary and capricious standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ecology Ctr. v. Castaneda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3676463\" index=\"232\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/574/652/#p659\">\n    574 F.3d 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 659 (9th Cir. 2009) (\"Though a party may cite studies that support a conclusion different from the one the Forest Service reached, it is not our role to weigh competing scientific analyses\"). In particular, the authors of the Coates Study cite one study to justify their conclusion that the ten-year period is reasonable; Plaintiffs point to three other studies cited in the Coates Study that they contend support the opposite conclusion. The Court does not have the expertise to resolve this dispute, nor would it be appropriate\n   for it to do so. At most, this appears to be a challenge based on \"weak\" science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Similarly, the Court concludes that it is beyond the scope of its arbitrary and capricious review to determine whether the authors of the Coates Study could properly use the IPM to make predictions about the overall population of the Bi-State DPS without data from the Mount Grant and White Mountains PMUs. The authors of the study opined that the subpopulations that they did study provided a \"reliable representation of demography\" for the entire DPS and the Service found that conclusion to be reasonable. The Court defers to the expertise of the Service on this issue as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   On the other hand, the Service's adoption of the main conclusion of the Coates Study - that the overall population of the Bi-State DPS is stable - is inconsistent with its own finding, set forth in the Withdrawal Decision, that the results of the Integrated Population Model (IPM) that was developed by Coates must be interpreted \"with caution\" because the IPM incorrectly predicted the population trend in the Pine Nut PMU.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C831\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 22,831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (AR Doc. 6771, BSSG 87988) (\"[t]herefore, we interpret these model results, particularly for the [Pine Nut] population, with caution.\"). In other words, the Service itself recognized that the failure to accurately predict the population in the Pine Nut PMU cast significant doubt on the validity of the IPM as a whole. This scenario is similar to the one in\n   <em>\n    Tucson Herpetological Society\n   </em>\n   , where the Service drew inferences as to persistence even though it had recognized that the studies on which it relied were \"limited and inconclusive.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Defendants contend the Service \"acknowledged and accounted for the limitations of the Coates [S]tudy with respect to the Pine Nut subpopulation, but there was no reason to discount the Coates [S]tudy in its entirety,\" citing cases that hold that even if plaintiffs can \"poke some holes\" in a model, that does not mean reliance upon that model is arbitrary and capricious. Defendants' Opposition/Cross-Motion at 27 (citing\n   <em>\n    San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180707\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/581/#p602\">\n    747 F.3d 581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620-621 (9th Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    Alaska v.

The problem with that argument, however, is that it mischaracterizes the Withdrawal Decision on this question. The Service did not discount the IPM as to only the Pine Nut PMU. Rather, as discussed above, the Service found that the predictions of the population model\n   <em>\n    as a whole\n   </em>\n   should be treated with caution. Indeed, this conclusion is entirely consistent with the opinions of virtually all of the agency biologists who participated in the Recommendation Team meeting, who concluded in October 2014 that the current status of the Bi-State DPS - considering new information (including the Coates Study) received after the 2013 listing proposal but not the likely impact of future conservation efforts - was threatened. In light of the Service's own recognition of the questionable validity of the model developed in the Coates Study, the Service erred in relying on that study in support of its finding in the Withdrawal Decision that the overall population of the Bi-State DPS was stable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In the Withdrawal Decision, the service addresses \"Resiliency, Redundancy, and Representation.\" It describes \"resiliency\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   <em>\n    Resiliency\n   </em>\n   refers to the capacity of an ecosystem, population, or organism to recover quickly from disturbance by tolerating or adapting to changes or effects\n   caused by a disturbance or a combination of disturbances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   The degree of resiliency of a species is influenced by both the degree of genetic diversity across the species, and the number of individuals. Resiliency increases with increasing genetic diversity and/or a higher number of individuals; it decreases when the species has less genetic diversity and/or fewer individuals.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 22,839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (AR Doc. 6771, BSSG 87996) (emphasis in original). Turning to the resiliency of the Bi-State DPS, the Withdrawal Decision goes on to state that \"resiliency may be lower to some degree because the total population size is relatively small (e.g., compared to the population size of many upland game birds), with some populations having low numbers or negative population trends.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the other hand, the Service points to a 2014 study by Oyler-McCance\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   (\"Oyler-McCance Study\"), along with a number of older studies, that indicate that the genetic diversity of the Bi-State DPS \"does not appear to be low.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the basis of these studies, the Service concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-171\">\n   This information suggests that while resiliency of the [B]i-State DPS may be reduced to some degree as a result of relatively small total population size, the genetic diversity in the [B]i-State area improves the capacity of the DPS to recover from disturbance, or adapt to changes or effects caused by a disturbance or a combination of disturbances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"239\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%203%2C694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Service also notes that \"[m]ultiple, interacting populations across a broad geographic area provide insurance against the risk of extinction caused by catastrophic events (redundancy).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"240\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Next, the Service states that the Oyler-McCance Study and Tebbenkamp 2014 (\"the Tebbenkamp Study\") support its conclusion that there are \"between three and six populations ... in the [B]i-State area that largely operate demographically independent of each other.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"241\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Also citing the Oyler-McCance and Tebbenkamp Studies, the Service states that \"[r]epresentation across the [B]i-State DPS is moderate to high, with three to six genetically different groups across the [B]i-State DPS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (The Service defines \"representation\" as \"conservation of the diversity of a species, including genetic make-up.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) The Service notes that the viability of some of the smaller populations is \"less certain\" and acknowledges that \"[i]f a population is permanently lost, the DPS' population redundancy would be lowered, thereby decreasing the DPS' chance of survival in the face of potential environmental, demographic, and genetic stochastic factors and catastrophic events (extreme drought, wildfire, disease, etc.).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It finds that the \"level of threats faced by the population[s] that make up the [B]i-State DPS\" is reduced due to \"ongoing and planned\" conservation measures under the 2012 BSAP.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Plaintiffs challenge the Service's characterization of the \"resiliency, redundancy and representation\" of the Bi-State DPS, arguing that the \"Service erroneously suggested that two recent genetic reports may lessen concerns about persistence over time because they indicate that [there is] moderate to high genetic diversity across the DPS range.\" Plaintiffs' Motion at 26. Plaintiffs point to the Service's own recognition that \"[m]ultiple, interacting populations across a broad geographic area provide insurance against the risk of extinction caused by catastrophic events (redundancy),\" arguing that here, the evidence shows that the populations that make up the Bi-State DPS are isolated and do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   interact.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C839\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, Plaintiffs argue that the Service has overstated the degree of resiliency, redundancy and representation based on the genetic\n   diversity found in the Oyler-McCance and Tebbenkamp Studies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Plaintiffs also point to a draft version of the Withdrawal Decision in which the Service used much more dire language in its discussion of this issue, stating as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   [W]e find that resiliency, redundancy, and representation in the Bi-State DPS are a concern for the DPS's long-term persistence given current and future conditions. The best available information indicates resiliency overall is low, with four of six populations being small. Trends for some of the smaller populations (e.g., Pine Nut, Fales, and Parker Meadows) remain of concern at the DPS level because fluctuations in these small, less secure populations are likely to result in extirpations and loss of population redundancy within the DPS. Representation is not of concern at this time but may be in the future if smaller populations become extirpated. When considered together, the low level of resiliency and redundancy, current and future threats to the Bi-State populations (in particular, see Drought (Factor E discussion below) ), the potential loss of one or more small populations outside of the two core populations, the overall reduction of range, and future risk to representation indicate the long-term persistence of the Bi-State DPS may be at risk.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Draft Withdrawal Decision (AR Doc. 5158, BSSG 64536).

For example, the future loss of additional significant sagebrush habitat due to wildfire in the [B]i-State DPS ... could occur because of the synergistic interactions among fire, people and infrastructure, invasive species, and climate change.

As another example, improper livestock grazing management alone may only affect a small portion of the Bi-State DPS, but when combined with invasive species, drought, and wildfire, it could collectively result in substantial habitat loss, degradation, or fragmentation across large portions of the species' range. Predation may also increase as a result of increases in human disturbance and development. These are just a few scenarios of the numerous impacts that are likely acting cumulatively to further contribute to the challenges faced by many Bi-State DPS populations now and into the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   2015 Species Report (AR Doc. 5508, BSSG 578-579).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the Service failed to analyze the cumulative impact of the threats to the Bi-State DPS, asserting that while it acknowledged the \"synergistic interactions among fire, people and infrastructure, invasive species, and climate change\" in the Withdrawal Decision, it \"did not discuss their potential impact on\n   loss of sagebrush habitat and/or loss of sage grouse population.\" Plaintiffs' Motion at 26-27.

Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   As the parties are in agreement that the ESA limits the Service to consideration of \"existing\" regulatory mechanisms and does not extend to\n   <em>\n    planned\n   </em>\n   regulatory mechanisms that have not yet been adopted, the only remaining question is whether the Service has violated this requirement by reaching the conclusion - based in part on its PECE analysis of the conservation efforts envisioned in the 2012 BSAP - that listing of the Bi-State DPS as threatened is not warranted. If the Service based its finding under PECE upon the\n   proposed land management plan amendments (even if only in part), this would appear to allow through the back door consideration of regulatory measures that are not \"existing\" and would potentially run afoul of the case law prohibiting the consideration of regulatory mechanisms that have not yet been enacted. The record reflects, however, that the Service did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Although the final PECE analysis does acknowledge that BLM was in the process of preparing amendments to RMPs and LMRPs for Carson City District, Tonopah and Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, it also describes the RMPs and Activity Plans that\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   existed and that contained \"detailed, site-specific management actions outlined in livestock allotment management plans, wildlife habitat management plans, wild horse herd area management plans, wilderness management plans. etc.\" Final PECE Analysis (AR Doc. 5716, BSSG 79507-79608). Further, the Service states in the Withdrawal Decision that it did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   rely on the proposed amendments when \"analyzing the BSAP\" under PECE. Withdrawal Decision (AR Doc. 6771, BSSG 88002) (citing Final PECE Analysis). Therefore, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' assertion that the Withdrawal Decision was arbitrary and capricious because the Service impermissibly relied on amendments to land use plans that had not yet been enacted in support of its conclusion that planned conservation measures under the 2012 BSAP justified withdrawal of the proposed listing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Certainty of Implementation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the Service has not demonstrated sufficient certainty of implementation, notwithstanding the commitments with respect to funding and staffing contained in the Commitment Letters, because there can be no certainty as to Congressional\n   funding and executive priorities going forward and in particular, over the ten-year period addressed in the plans submitted by USDA and BLM along with their Commitment Letters. Plaintiffs' concerns are not frivolous or speculative. Budget cuts and changes in executive priorities are a fact of life. Nonetheless, Plaintiffs have not cited any case in which a court has held that specific funding or staffing commitments by a federal agency (or any agency) should not be considered under PECE because they might later be withdrawn. The only case Plaintiffs cite in support of this argument,\n   <em>\n    Western Watersheds Project v.

Idaho Aug. 19, 2005), did not reach the question of whether the Service's PECE analysis was flawed, finding that the proposed listing violated the ESA on other grounds completely unrelated to whether the voluntary conservation efforts were sufficiently certain to be implemented. Indeed, the court noted that it did \"not want to discourage or undermine conservation agreements undertaken outside the auspices of the ESA,\" that it \"commend[ed] the efforts and hard work undertaken by the many different parties involved in developing\" a formal conservation plan, and that it \"hope[d] the federal and state agencies and various private groups [would] continue to work cooperatively to conserve\" the species at issue \"within the mandate of the ESA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"381\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%202002473\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   In its PECE analysis, the Service found that the commitments of the federal (and state) agencies as to funding and staffing were sufficiently certain because these same agencies had a history of involvement in the conservations efforts under the 2012 BSAP. This is a permissible basis to find that there is a high level of certainty that they will continue to be involved in this effort and to abide by the commitments in their Commitment Letters.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Defenders II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4208742\" index=\"382\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/70/183/#p193\">\n    70 F.Supp.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Service acted reasonably in finding sufficient certainty of implementation based on past experience). While there will always be some degree of uncertainty where budgets require approval and agency priorities are subject to change due to changes in leadership, the Court declines to adopt a rule that no other court has adopted and that would effectively make it impossible for voluntary conservation efforts by state or federal agencies to survive the PECE analysis. Therefore, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' assertion that the commitments of the federal agencies are not sufficiently certain to be implemented to satisfy PECE.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   e.

It further sets forth \"Conservation Options\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   related to pinyon-juniper removal, including prioritizing use of \"mechanical treatments\" in order to allow understory habitats to remain intact, using caution at higher elevations if removing pinyon-juniper by prescribed fire, reducing juniper cover in sage grouse habitats to less than 5%, and employing \"all necessary management actions to maintain the benefit of pinyon and/or juniper removal for sage-grouse habitats, including long-term monitoring with appropriate management responses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C847\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at BSSG 103877.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   While the Court has no reason to question the soundness of the process the Service\n   describes for evaluating the problem of pinyon-juniper encroachment and developing projects to address the problem, it also finds no evidence in the record that allows it to conclude that the efforts envisioned in the 2012 BSAP are sufficiently certain to be effective. As Plaintiffs point out, the ten-year plan offered by the Forest Service identifies eight pinyon-juniper removal projects covering roughly 95,000 acres over the next ten years, while the BLM's proposed plan identifies only one pinyon-juniper removal project aimed at removing pinyon-juniper from 301 acres in Mill Canyon over a period of many years. It is not clear how these projects were selected or what percentage of habitat threatened by woodland encroachment they will cover; nor is there evidence in the record that allows the Court to determine the likelihood that these projects will be sufficient to accomplish the goal described in the Final PECE Analysis of \"halting losses of sagebrush habitat.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Even more importantly, it is not sufficiently certain that the planned pinyon-juniper removal efforts will actually have a beneficial impact on the Bi-State DPS. In the 2015 Species Report, the Service noted that \"[a] variety of techniques (e.g., mechanical, herbicide, cutting, burning) are being implemented to remove conifers in sage-grouse habitat\" and that \"[t]reatment effectiveness varies with the technique used and proximity to invasive plant infestations, among other factors.\" 2015 Species Report (AR Doc. 5508, BSSG 507). It continues, \"[w]e are not aware of\n   <em>\n    any study\n   </em>\n   documenting a direct correlation between these treatments and sage-grouse population response[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C847\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Similarly, as to the 25 woodland thinning or removal projects completed over the past decade under the 2012 BSAP, which involved removal of approximately 19,533 acres of woodland, the Service explained that it was \"still too early to measure a population-level response of sage-grouse to these treatments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"397\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C847\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Service \"infer[red] some level of positive response\" based on studies showing that pinyon-juniper encroachment leads to \"avoidance or reduced use\" by sage grouse, but this negative inference is simply a guess; it is not based on any scientific evidence linking pinyon-juniper removal to improvement as measured by population trends. The Service also observes that there have been \"anecdotal observations indicat[ing] that these actions are resulting in the addition of suitable habitat in some instances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"398\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C847\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Such observations, however, are a far cry from the level of certainty of effectiveness required under PECE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Finally, while the Final PECE Analysis states that the ongoing conservation efforts in the area of pinyon-juniper removal were \"consistent\" with the general objective of the COT Report, that is, to \"remove pinyon-juniper from areas of sagebrush that are most likely to support sage-grouse (postremoval) habitat at a rate that is at least equal to the rate of pinyon-juniper incursion,\" it does not state that future conservation efforts will be sufficient to achieve that goal, much less explain the basis for such a conclusion.

What is notably missing from the Final PECE Analysis is any discussion of whether the future conservation efforts for cheatgrass removal will be sufficient to result in a beneficial impact on the Bi-State DPS and the expected magnitude and timing of such an impact. Nor does the Service address whether the Conservation Measures recommended in the COT Report will be employed under the 2012 BSAP. Given that the effectiveness of cheatgrass removal is, by the Service's own admission, \"mostly unproven and experimental,\" the efforts described in the Final PECE analysis do not support a finding that there is a sufficient certainty of effectiveness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   iii. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   PECE requires that future conservation efforts must be \"sufficiently certain\" to be effective. This inquiry requires that the Service consider not only whether the planned conservation measures are the\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of measures that are likely, in the abstract, to be beneficial to the species. Rather, the Service must also consider the magnitude of the impact on the species that the measures can be expected to achieve, and \"the estimated length of time that it will take for a formalized conservation effort to produce a positive effect on the species.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"406\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=68%20Fed.%20Reg.%2015%2C114\">\n    68 Fed. Reg. 15,114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the Service's PECE Analysis fails to meet these requirements. As the examples of pinyon-juniper and cheatgrass removal illustrate, it is uncertain whether the conservation efforts outlined in the 2012 BSAP will be sufficient to produce a positive effect on the species, the magnitude of the effect (assuming there is one), or when the effect will be achieved.

It also erred in concluding under PECE that there was sufficient certainty of effectiveness of planned conservation measures to support the conclusion that listing the Bi-State DPS as threatened is no longer warranted. There is no real dispute that the Service's PECE analysis was critical to its Withdrawal Decision. The Service acknowledges in the Withdrawal Decision that \"[w]ithout the conservation measures being implemented now and planned for the future as described in the BSAP, the stressors that rise to the level of being a threat as identified in the proposed rule to the [B]i-State DPS would remain at a level that would warrant listing of the DPS as a threatened species.\" Withdrawal Decision (AR Doc. 6771, BSSG 88007). Likewise, the erroneous reliance on the Coates Study to conclude that the population of the Bi-State DPS was stable also likely played an important role in the Service's decision to withdraw the Proposed Listing. This finding clearly informed the Service's understanding of the urgency of the situation, which must be taken into account when deciding under PECE whether future conservation efforts are likely to produce positive results quickly enough to change the status of a species. Consequently, the Court concludes that both errors go to the heart of the agency's action and are not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the Service's Withdrawal Decision was arbitrary and capricious and unsupported by the record for the reasons discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

First, while the bulk of the discussion in the Service's SPR analysis was aimed at answering the status question, the Service reached final conclusions as to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the status question and the \"significant\" question. Even if the Service's underlying discussion provides no analysis to support the conclusion on the \"significant\" question or it did not intend to reach that question, the explicit finding that \"[t]here are no portions of the [B]i-State DPS that may be significant\" undercuts the Service's argument that Plaintiff's challenge to the definition of \"significant\" under the SPR Policy is not ripe for review. Furthermore, the Service's finding that there was \"substantial information indicating that ... the portion [in the three PMUs] may be significant,\"\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 22852, must necessarily have been informed by the Service's understanding of the meaning of \"significant\" under the SPR Policy.

The first of those populations (found in Portion Y) currently faces only moderate threats, but that population occurs in an area that is so small or homogeneous that a stochastic (i.e., random, unpredictable, due to chance) event could devastate that entire area and the population inhabiting it. Therefore, if it were the only population, the species would be so vulnerable to stochastic events that it would be in danger of extinction. (With two main populations, it is unlikely that both would be affected by the same stochastic event. The severity of the threats posed by the stochastic event would therefore be smaller because there could be exchange between the populations following the stochastic event-and this exchange could help to stabilize the population that has suffered declines.) Thus, without the portion of the range currently occupied by the second population (Portion X), the species would be in danger of extinction. But, as long as Portion X contained an extant population, the resiliency and redundancy of the two portions combined would be sufficient that the species would not be in danger of extinction, or likely to become so in the foreseeable future, throughout all of its range, even in the face of severe threats to Portion X.

It recognized that \"the combination of the [B]i-State DPS small population size, isolation due to fragmented habitat, peripheral locations, and the presence of several stresors [sic] to the sage-grouse in the Pine Nut, Mount Grant, and White Mountains PMUs makes these PMUs more vulnerable than the Bodie, Desert Creek-Fales, and South Mono PMUs,\" but concluded that they were not threatened because the Coates Study showed that \"several of the populations in the [B]i-State area (including but not limited to the core populations) are stable (as opposed to declining).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"469\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It also relied on findings that \"(1) Multiple sage-grouse are still observed through monitoring activities, (2) one to eight active leks are present within each PMU, [and] (3) stresors [sic] acting upon these small populations are not geographically concentrated and exist in all six PMUs throughout the range of the bi-State DPS.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"470\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, while acknowledging that there was \"information available that may lead some to believe that the populations in these three PMUs are at risk of becoming endangered in the foreseeable future\" the Service concluded, based on its PECE analysis, that ongoing conservation efforts would \"change[ ] the trajectory from a point where the DPS was previously considered to be a threatened species, to a point where the best available\n   information related to current and future conservation efforts indicates the entire range of the DPS, including the specific portion of the DPS's range in the Pine Nut, Mount Grant, and White Mountains PMUs, does not meet the definition of a threatened species or an endangered species.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"471\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C852\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   There are no rational grounds for the Service's conclusion. First, as discussed above, the model developed in the Coates Study did not generate accurate predictions and was particularly unreliable with respect to the Pine Nut PMU, causing the Service to note in the Withdrawal Decision that the entire model should be treated with caution and\n   <em>\n    especially\n   </em>\n   as to the Pine Nut PMU. The Coates Study also did not analyze the White Mountains and Mount Grant PMUs at all, as the authors of that study had no data for those PMU. Nor does the Service offer any explanation for its reliance on the conclusions of the Coates Study in its SPR analysis in light of these shortcomings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   Second, the Service relies heavily upon its conclusions as to the entire Bi-State DPS under PECE. For the reasons discussed above, however, the Service failed to show that there was \"sufficient certainty\" of effectiveness of future conservation efforts under PECE. Moreover, the PECE analysis made a finding as to the persistence of the Bi-State DPS over all of its range. It did not address the likelihood of persistence for each individual PMU. The Court notes that the 2015 Species Report concluded that \"[w]ithin the next several decades, it is possible that sage-grouse in the Bi-State area will persist in two of the potentially six populations located in the South Mono DPU (Long Valley) and the Bodie PMU (Bodie Hills)\" because these PMUs are \"larger and more stable and generally have fewer habitat pressures.\" 2015 Species Report (AR Doc. 5508, BSSG 579). Having failed to address the likely persistence of the species in each PMU in its PECE analysis, the Service had no basis for relying on that analysis in its SPR analysis to reach conclusions about the Pine Nut, White Mountains and Mount Grant PMUs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   Third, the Service offers no rational basis for relying on the fact that \"multiple\" sage grouse are still observed in these three PMU's, which each have one to eight leks. As the Service recognizes in the Withdrawal Decision, \"each population in the [B]i-State DPS is relatively small and may be below the theoretical minimum threshold ... for long-term persistence.\" While the exact population required to exceed this threshold is not statistically proven, there is nothing in the record to suggest that \"multiple\" sage grouse (which could mean just two) would be above that threshold. Likewise, the Service has not explained why observation of one to eight leks in these PMUs (which the Service acknowledges are currently isolated) would be sufficient to show that these populations are not threatened and why these numbers do not, in fact, point to the likelihood of extirpation of the species in these smaller PMUs. That is what the Delta Table listing the numbers of birds observed and leks for each PMU in 2014 seems to show as well. Indeed, that chart indicates that the Service found the probability of persistence of the Pine Nut, Mount Grant and White Mountains PMUs to be \"questionable.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR Doc. 4836, BSSG 57940-57941.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   Therefore, to the extent the Service found in applying its SPR Policy that the populations of these PMUs were not threatened, that conclusion was arbitrary and capricious. Further, to the extent the Service purportedly also found that these three PMUs combined were not a \"significant\" portion of the species' range, that\n   conclusion is also arbitrary and capricious because the Service offered no explanation in support of the conclusion in the Withdrawal Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Reg. at 22,847-22,848 ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-335\">\n    Of course, it is another matter if these agencies actually\n    <em>\n     do\n    </em>\n    withdraw their funding and staffing commitments. As the EOC Cover letter indicates, over 80% of the funding for implementation of the 2012 BSAP is to be provided by federal agencies and 92% of the Bi-State DPS is located on federal lands. Without the commitments of these agencies to fund and implement the conservation measures set forth in the 2012 BSAP, the primary basis for the Withdrawal Decision - the amelioration of threats to the Bi-State DPS likely to result from implementation of the 2012 BSAP - would no longer exist.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-336\">\n    The Service's cover letter for the COT Report explains that \"Conservation Options\" are \"examples of actions that could be used to help attain the conservation objectives\" but that are not \"prescriptive or mandatory.\" AR Doc. 5829, BSSG 103824.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-337\">\n    The Court also notes that the Final PECE Analysis does not state that future conservation efforts will rely on any of the \"Conservation Options\" described in the COT Report, such as the use of mechanical treatments when possible, or ongoing management actions to maintain the quality of the habitat. Nor do the 2012 BSAP or the Commitment Letters state that future removal efforts will employ these Conservation Options. Given that the Service acknowledged in the 2015 Species Report that the effectiveness of removal varies depending on a variety of factors, the failure of the Final PECE Analysis to address the issues raised in the Conservation Options further supports the Court's conclusion that the Service has not established sufficient certainty of effectiveness as to future pinyon-juniper removal efforts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-338\">\n    For example, the Final PECE Analysis acknowledges that while only 11 % of \"suitable sage-grouse habitat is under private ownership, these private lands harbor the majority of the [B]i-State DPS's critical brood-rearing habitat.\" AR Doc. 5716, BSSG 79522. These areas \"may be impacted by existing grazing or ranching activities, or they may be targeted for development,\" and therefore conservation easements and land exchanges are considered \"the most effective tool for protecting these critical eras.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at BSSG 79523. Although the Final PECE Analysis notes that 15,000 acres of conservation easements had been purchased by 2013 and that the Service expected further such easements to be purchased in the future, including \"high priority targets,\" it does not address the percentage of critical brooding habitat that is likely to be obtained under the 2012 BSAP or whether it will be sufficient to have a positive impact on the Bi-State DPS. Indeed, to the extent that such easements and land exchanges are dependent on the willingness of private landowners to sell or exchange their land, it is unlikely the Service would be able to make any such projections.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-339\">\n    In support of their position, Plaintiffs cite to a comment in the legislative history, 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 9453, 9468, stating that \"the term range is used in the general sense, and refers to the historical range of the species.\" This comment is contained in a House Report issued in connection with 1978 amendments to the ESA. The district court in\n    <em>\n     Humane Society v. Jewell\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4248239\" index=\"474\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/76/69/#p130\">\n     76 F.Supp.3d 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 130 (D.D.C. 2014) cited this statement in support of its conclusion that the Service impermissibly construed \"range\" to mean current range in the SPR Policy. The undersigned, however, concludes that this single statement in the legislative history is not sufficient to render the Service's interpretation unreasonable. While the statement appears to refer generally to the use of the word \"range\" in the ESA, it is made in connection with a discussion of Section 4(c)(1),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"475\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1), which requires the Secretary to include critical habitat designations on the endangered species list. That section provides that lists of endangered and threatened species \"shall refer to the species contained therein by scientific and common name or names, if any, specify with respect to each such species over what portion of its range it is endangered or threatened, and specify any critical habitat within such range.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"476\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1). While the district court in\n    <em>\n     Humane Society v. Jewell\n    </em>\n    concluded that the statement in the legislative history applied to\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    usages of the word \"range\" in the ESA, another possible interpretation of the statement, which is somewhat unclear, is that it was directed only at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"477\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201533\">\n     16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1533\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1) and the designation of critical habitat and not at the use of the word \"range\" in Section 1532. As the D.C. Circuit concluded, on appeal of the district court's decision, that the Service's construction of the word \"range\" in the SPR Policy was permissible, it apparently reached the same conclusion.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Humane Society v.
