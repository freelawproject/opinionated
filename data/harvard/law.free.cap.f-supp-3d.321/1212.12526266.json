(ECF No. 59). As there is no direct caselaw on point, plaintiff analogizes this case to\n   <em>\n    Edelstein v. Bank of N.Y. Mellon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412004\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/128/505/\">\n    128 Nev. 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412004\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/128/505/\">\n    286 P.3d 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). In\n   <em>\n    Edelstein\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court of Nevada held that a lender's designation of a separate entity as a deed-of-trust beneficiary split the deed of trust from the note's\n   payment right, which \"ma[de] it impossible to foreclose the mortgage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 254.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Edelstein\n   </em>\n   applies to the HOA foreclosure context for two primary reasons. First, Nevada law incorporates the law of real property to Chapter 116, which includes\n   <em>\n    Edelstein.\n   </em>\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Edelstein's\n   </em>\n   rationale applies equally to HOA foreclosures as it does to deed of trust foreclosures. The court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Here, First 100 and the HOA entered into an agreement that split the underlying lien (which the HOA retained) from the right to collect on the delinquent account (which First 100 obtained). (ECF No. 59-2). As the court held in\n   <em>\n    Edelstein\n   </em>\n   , the holder of a note has the right to repayment only, and does not have the right to use the property to satisfy repayment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412004\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/128/505/\">\n    286 P.3d at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, First 100 had the right to repayment of the Fryes' HOA delinquency, but did not have a lien interest in the property that it could foreclose on to satisfy the obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Edelstein\n   </em>\n   , First 100 did not possess the right to foreclose on the property.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edelstein\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412004\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/128/505/\">\n    286 P.3d at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In short, First 100 negotiated for the ability to conduct its own foreclosure sale and buy the property at a severely depressed price after the HOA trustee represented to the bank that the foreclosure sale would not impact the first deed of trust. These facts are sufficient to justify setting aside the foreclosure sale as commercially unreasonable.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ZYZZX2\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201181666\">\n    2016 WL 1181666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (misleading statements regarding the effect of foreclosure, coupled with a sale price of 7% of fair market value and CC &amp; R's containing a mortgage protection clause warranted setting aside a sale as commercially unreasonable). In addition, First 100's purchase sale agreement with the HOA split the lien from the payment right, thereby rendering the lien un-enforceable. Therefore, plaintiff's first deed of trust was not extinguished by the foreclosure proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201181666\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court will grant plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on its claim for quiet title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    b. Defendants' motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court holds that the foreclosure sale was commercially unreasonable. Therefore, the court will deny the Lahrs' motion to dismiss, which argues that plaintiff's complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Because Kupperlin's motion for summary judgment requests judgment on plaintiff's claim for quiet title based on the theory that First 100 obtained an interest in the property at the foreclosure sale that it subsequently transferred to the Trust, the court will deny the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that plaintiff's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 59) be, and the same hereby is, GRANTED, consistent with the foregoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Kupperlin's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 60) be, and the same hereby is, DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Lahrs' motion to dismiss (ECF No. 52) be, and the same hereby is, DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that plaintiff shall prepare and submit to the court a proposed judgment consistent with the foregoing within thirty (30) days of the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    In the court's order denying Kupperlin's motion for summary judgment, the purchase price is cited as $22,346.67, which is the sale price that Kupperlin allegedly wrote into the foreclosure deed. However, the receipt of sale notice states that the winning bid amount at the foreclosure sale was $151.
