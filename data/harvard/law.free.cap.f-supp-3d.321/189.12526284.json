BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Faulk was indicted for murder in the first degree and for carrying a firearm without a license. Pet'r's Mem. Supp. Pet. Habeas Corpus Relief (\"Pet'r's Mem.\") 2, ECF No. 30. On November 18, 2010, after a jury trial in the Massachusetts Superior Court, the jury found the petitioner guilty of the lesser included offense of murder in the second degree and guilty of the firearms charge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Massachusetts Appeals Court summarized the evidence introduced at Faulk's trial as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   As shown by videotape surveillance footage obtained from a camera system installed at the scene, on April 30, 2007, [Faulk] entered 33 Dover Street, Brockton, with the victim, Derrick Wilson, right behind him. [Faulk] stopped, turned, and appeared to speak to the victim. The victim then followed the defendant up a set of stairs. Two minutes later, the victim slid feet first down the stairs, and lay at the foot of the stairs, struggling. Within seconds, [Faulk] came down the stairs, stepped over the victim, and left the building. A few minutes later, [Faulk] returned with a female companion, and kicked the victim's foot and his head.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   According to the medical examiner, the victim died from a gunshot wound to the chest. It appears from the video footage that no one entered or left through the second-floor door at the time of the incident. There was evidence that the third floor of the building was locked. When [Faulk] initially spoke with police, he told them that he had not entered the building with the victim. After being shown still images from the video, he\n   acknowledged his presence but claimed not to know if he had heard gunshots, or if there had been any kind of fight or struggle on the stairs. He said that he kicked the victim to wake him up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   A cigarette butt at the second-floor landing was linked to [Faulk] by deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) evidence, and a projectile found in the wall at the top of the second-floor landing was linked to the victim by DNA evidence. However, no weapon or shell casings were recovered. Strands of \"Mardis Gras\" beads worn by the victim were broken, and beads were found scattered -- including one at the top of the landing -- suggesting a struggle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Faulk\n   </em>\n   , --- Mass.App.Ct. ----, No. 11-P-1663,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20767584\">\n    2016 WL 767584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Mass.
