(ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 17.) Jinghon then applied for a visa, and on June 30, 2016, the National Visa Center sent him a notice scheduling an interview for him at the U.S. Consulate in Guangzhou, China, on August 9, 2016. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 22, Ex. G.) On July 7, 2016, the plaintiffs' immigration attorney, Stephen Irwin, emailed the consulate to inquire whether Jinghon should attend his interview or wait for approval of his visa forms. (ECF No. 1 at Ex. H.) The consulate apparently did not respond to this email. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 34-35.) A few days later, on July 14, 2016, the plaintiff filed a Form I-601 waiver application and Form I-212 application to reapply for admission to the U.S. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.) Jinghon allegedly believed that he needed to wait for his visa forms to be approved, and he did not attend his August 9 interview. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 35.) The following year, on July 10, 2017, the consulate sent the plaintiffs' attorney a notice of termination, which stated that Jinghon's visa application was cancelled, but could be reinstated if he could establish that his \"failure to pursue\" his visa was due to \"circumstances beyond [his] control.\" (ECF No. 1 at Ex. I.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 3, 2017, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") requested additional information from Jinghon in connection with the I-601 and I-212 visa applications he submitted. (ECF No. 1 at Ex. K.) On April 15, 2017, the plaintiffs filed this complaint, alleging that the defendants failed to \"extend or hold off on the visa interview to give time for USCIS to adjudicate both forms 601 waiver and 212,\" and asking the Court to compel the defendants to \"adjudicate the forms\" and set a new interview date. (ECF No. 1 at \u00b6 38, p. 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to USCIS materials submitted by the defendants, on September 12, 2017, Jinghon had his visa interview at the consulate in China; his visa was denied because of missing documents. (ECF No. 9-5). On December 14, 2017, USCIS denied Jinghon's Form I-601 and I-212 applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF Nos. 9-5, 9-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In evaluating a motion to dismiss, the court must accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint, and draw all reasonable inferences in the plaintiff's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Town of Babylon v.
