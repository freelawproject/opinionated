Compl., ECF No. 10 \u00b6 143 (\"During the period that Burrell has been employed at the Superior Court, the workplace has been permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe and pervasive enough to alter the conditions of her employment, and has created an abusive working environment.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147 (providing examples of conduct \"that created a hostile work environment\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 159 (relying primarily on the allegations set forth in Count I for Count II).

Those acts include, for example, defendants' refusal to transfer or reassign Ms. Burrell to a different division so\n   that she would not have to \"interact with Shepard and others who were discriminating against her or might retaliate against her\" for lodging the complaint.

Taking these allegations together and construing the amended complaint in a light favorable to Ms. Burrell, the Court finds that Ms. Burrell has plausibly alleged that she was subjected to a hostile work environment, which may also have been a form of retaliation for her decision to file a harassment complaint. Because Ms. Burrell is able to \"adequately link\" the alleged retaliatory attacks that occurred after May 11, 2016 to other acts occurring before May 11, 2016, those acts are not time barred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baird v.

In particular, Ms. Burrell alleges that Ms. Shepard used racially derogatory language - i.e., \"I hate ignorant black folk, they get on my nerve\" - toward her in the course of filming the video on her cell phone. Am. Compl., ECF NO. 10 \u00b6\u00b6 29-38.
