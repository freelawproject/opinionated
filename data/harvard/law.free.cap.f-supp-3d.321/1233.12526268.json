Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This dispute revolves around the now deceased Siri Singh Sahib Bhai Sahib Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogiji, aka Yogi Bhajan. Yogi Bhajan was a Sikh Dharma spiritual leader who helped promulgate the Sikh religion and Kundalini Yoga in the United States until his death in 2004. In 1971, Yogi Bhajan became \"Siri Singh Sahib,\" or the Chief Religious and Administrative Authority for the Ordained Ministry of Sikh Dharma in the Western Hemisphere. Gurujot Decl. [396], \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. Pursuant to his role as Siri Singh Sahib, Yogi Bhajan established numerous non-profit organizations and for-profit businesses. This case involves three of these organizations: Sikh Dharma International (SDI), Siri Singh Sahib Corporation (SSSC), and Unto Infinity, LLC (UI).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Plaintiffs in this case are Bibiji Inderjit Kaur Puri, Ranbir Singh Bhai, Kamaljit Kaur Kohli, and Kulbir Singh Puri, the widow and three children of Yogi Bhajan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants remaining in this case are UI, SSSC, Sopurkh Kaur Khalsa, the President and a member of the UI Board of Managers and a member of the SSSC Board of Trustees, and Kartar Singh Khalsa, a member of the UI and SSSC boards. Plaintiffs allege in the operative Second Amended Complaint (SAC) that after Yogi Bhajan's death on October 6, 2004, the individual Defendants conspired to exclude them from management of UI and SSSC. SAC [234] \u00b6\u00b6 24-29. They seek declaratory relief placing them on the boards and monetary damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. SDI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   SDI is a California nonprofit religious corporation. Gurujot Decl. [396], \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1. It is undisputed that SDI is a religious organization. SDI, which was originally named Sikh Dharma Brotherhood, was formed in 1973 for the following primary purposes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [T]o operate for the advancement of education, science and religion and for charitable purposes by the distribution of its funds for such purposes by operating as a religious organization and as association of religious organizations, by teaching the principles of the Sikh Dharma, or way of life, in the Western Hemisphere\n   and including, but not limited to, the creation and operation of places of worship, the ordination of ministers of divinity, the creation and operation of educational centers and associated and supportive activities related to these primary purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Gurujot Decl. [396], Ex. 1 (SDI Articles of Incorporation). SDI's 2003 Bylaws, which were in effect at the time of the events underlying this case, stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   [SDI] is organized and shall be operated exclusively for the purposes of operating as a religious organization and as an association of religious organizations by teaching the principles of the Sikh Dharma, or way of life; by creation and operation of places of worship; by ordination of ministers of divinity; by creation and operation of educational centers; and by the conduct of associated and supportive activities related to these purposes; and to do all things necessary, expedient or appropriate to the accomplishment of the purposes for which this corporation is formed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gurujot Decl.

Gurujot Decl. [396], Ex. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to Yogi Bhajan's death, there were two individual religious positions in SDI: the Siri Singh Sahib and the Bhai Sahiba. Yogi Bhajan, in his role as Siri Singh Sahib, served as the chief religious authority of SDI, and the Bhai Sahiba \"over[saw] religious protocol.\" Gurojodha Decl. [395], Ex. 3 at 31. Following Yogi Bhajan's death, the \"Siri Sikdar Sahib/a and the Bhai Sahib or Bhai Sahiba [are] together ... the chief authority on the teachings of Siri Singh Sahib Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogiji on the practice of Sikh Dharma.\" Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 10. The Bhai Sahiba advises SDI, the Khalsa Council, and UI on religious matters. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 13. The Siri Sikdar Sahib/a \"shall champion the spiritual and secular education of the children of Sikh Dharma\" and \"shall devote time daily for meditation and prayer on behalf of the congregations of Sikh Dharma, shall be responsible through the office of the Bhai Sahib/a for maintaining and improving the quality of spiritual practice in Western hemisphere communities and for inspiring and promoting devotion to Shabd Guru.\" Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 12. Additionally, the 2003 SDI Bylaws call for the Siri Sikdar Sahib/a to lead annual pilgrimages and perform outreach to other Sikh religious leaders. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   SDI's bylaws also outlined several governing boards, including an advisory board of SDI ministers called the Khalsa Council, which advises UI \"on matters of significance\" to SDI, and a board of directors called the Khalsa Council Adh Kari. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. SSSC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   SSSC is an Oregon nonprofit religious corporation formed in 1997 \"to take over the leadership function of [Yogi Bhajan] after his death.\" Gurojodha Decl. [395], Ex. 3 at 30. SSSC's purposes include overseeing the \"administration and program services\" of SDI and \"conduct[ing] and/or facilitat[ing] religious, charitable, and educational activities.\" Gurojodha Decl. [395], Ex. 3 at 17, 20; Soni Decl. [394], Ex. C, Art. VI. Like SDI, SSSC receives a tax exemption as \"a church or a convention or association of churches.\" Gurojodha Decl. [395], Ex. 3 at 2, 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During his lifetime, Yogi Bhajan was the sole director of SSSC. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. B (SSSC Articles of Incorporation), at 3. Following his death, a board of trustees/directors was to govern SSSC. According to\n   the original SSSC Articles of Incorporation, following Yogi Bhajan's death or incapacity, \"the directors shall be those persons designated in writing by [Yogi Bhajan]. The written designation; and any amendment, or supplement to it, shall be dated upon execution and shall be delivered to, and held in confidence by the attorney for the corporation and Sikh Dharma designated in the corporation's Bylaws.\" Soni Decl. [394], Ex. B at 3. The original SSSC Bylaws designated Roy Lambert (who was a Defendant in this case until Plaintiffs settled their claims against him) as the attorney for SSSC. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. C, Art. VI. These disputed designations that are at the core of Plaintiff's claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Bylaws also outline certain job duties for the trustees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   A trustee shall perform his or her duties as a trustee including his or her duties as a member of any committee of the board upon which the trustee may serve, in good faith, in a manner the trustee believes to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the corporation and with such care as an ordinarily prudent person would use under similar circumstances in a like position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Soni Decl. [394], Ex. C, Art. 2 (Bylaws). The SSSC Articles outline an additional job duty for the board: the Articles state that Yogi Bhajan would designate an individual to succeed to the office of Siri Sikdar Sahib/a, who would also serve as a director of the SSSC board. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. B at 4. But if Yogi Bhajan failed to designate such an individual, the SSSC board was to choose a new Siri Sikdar Sahib/a, with the advice of the Khalsa Council. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. B at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Additionally, later amended versions of the Articles of Restatement of SSSC and the Restated Articles of Incorporation required that SSSC board members be qualified as ministers of Sikh Dharma and live \"in a manner consistent with the teachings and values of [Yogi Bhajan].\" Soni Decl. [394], Ex. E. Although some of these documents were dated October 1-3, 2004, prior to Yogi Bhajan's death, it appears that the documents were actually created in November 2004, after his death. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. DD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Yogi Bhajan's death and the subsequent 2012 settlement agreement, SSSC's role within the Sikh Dharma hierarchy changed. The current SSSC board \"has the authority to appoint and remove the board members of Sikh Dharma International (SDI), which, among other things, contains the Sikh Dharma Ministry and, through the Ministry, carries out the function of ordaining Sikh Ministers.\" Gurojodha Decl. [395] \u00b6 28. The current mission statement of SSSC\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   With the guidance of God and the grace of the Guru it is the mission of the SSSC to protect, preserve and cultivate the prosperity of the constituent community and its assets; listen to, serve and elevate the constituent community; support the non-profit and for profit entities and the family of constituent communities; and live to and hold the values of the teachings of the Siri Guru Granth Sahib and the Siri Singh Sahib Bhai Sahib Harbhajan Singh Khalsa Yogi Ji: selfless service, compassion, kindness, honesty,\n   integrity, trustworthiness and Guru inspired consciousness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Gurojodha Decl. [395] \u00b6 25. The current president of the SSSC board stated that board members \"act as representatives and ambassadors of Sikh Dharma. SSSC Board members, myself included, regularly participate in outreach, interfaith, mission building, and Sikh awareness events.\" Gurojodha Decl. [395] \u00b6 39. Finally, the SSSC board president describes the current election process for SSSC as following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   For the 2012, 2015, and 2017 SSSC Board elections, the elected SSSC Board members were elected by fellow Sikh Dharma ministers, active Khalsa Council members, and members of the Sikh Dharma community pursuant to the terms of the SSSC Board Election Policy. For future elections, and pursuant to a change in the SSSC Board Election Policy, only Sikh Dharma ministers who are in good standing will be eligible to vote for SSSC Board members.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Gurojodha Decl. [395] \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. UI\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Following the death of Yogi Bhajan, SSSC became the sole member of UI, an Oregon nonprofit LLC formed in 2003. UI was the sole member of SDI until 2012, when SSSC assumed this role.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gurujot Decl.

Former attorney for Defendants (and former Defendant) Roy Lambert testified that UI was intended to be the \"ultimate decision-maker with respect to the ... [Yogi Bhajan] community\" after Yogi Bhajan's death, because Yogi Bhajan felt that the board of SSSC was too large. Soni Decl. [394], Exh. WW at 138. To this end, Yogi Bhajan issued a proclamation on June 30, 2004 stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   I hereby proclaim that Unto Infinity, LLC, is the entity authorized by me to continue to exercise the administrative authority of the office of the Siri Singh Sahib of Sikh Dharma, once I no longer occupy that office, in all those cases where authorization by the Siri Singh Sahib is required in the articles, bylaws, or any contractual commitment of a Sikh Dharma affiliated organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Southwick Decl. [398], Ex. 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A board of managers governs UI. The original operating agreement for UI outlined that Yogi Bhajan would appoint the first UI board. Southwick Decl. [398], Ex. 21 at 1. The original operating agreement for UI also stated that the original agreement would be superseded upon Yogi Bhajan's death by the \"Amended and Restated Operating Agreement.\" Southwick Decl. [398], Ex. 21 at 3. The \"Amended and Restated Operating Agreement\" outlines certain eligibility standards, including that a board member had to be: (1) qualified as a minister of Sikh Dharma; (2) a member in good standing of the Khalsa Council of the Sikh Dharma; and (3) living, practicing, and participating in the affairs of the Sikh community in a manner consistent with the teachings and values of Yogi Bhajan. Southwick Decl. [398], Ex. 22 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   According to the Bylaws of SDI established in December 2003, as the sole member of SDI, UI was to perform a number of duties related to SDI and the Khalsa Council, including: (1) approving all actions of the Khalsa Council Adh Kari; (2) electing the directors of the Khalsa Council Adh Kari, other than the Siri Sikdar Sahib/a; (3) amending the Articles and Bylaws\n   of SDI; (4) approving the Executive Officers of SDI; (5) choosing the Secretary General of SDI, who would become the new Siri Sikdar Sahib/a if the Siri Sikdar Sahib/a died or was incapacitated; (6) approving the removal of employees, including the Siri Sikdar Sahib/a if the Siri Sikdar Sahib/a died or was incapacitated; (7) appointing the members of the Khalsa Council; and (8) \"designat[ing] such other religious or administrative officials of [SDI] as it deems appropriate; ... defin[ing] or redefin[ing] the function and scope of authority of each such official from time to time; and ... appoint[ing] and ... remov[ing] any person from any official position designated by it.\" Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 2-14. Additionally, UI played a role in determining whether and how a new Siri Sikdar Sahib/a would assume his or her position through a particular type of religious ceremony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    D. State Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On September 21, 2009, several Sikh Dharma ministers and board members of Sikh Dharma entities sued Sopurkh, Kartar, UI, SSSC, and several other defendants derivatively, on behalf of the Sikh Dharma Community. The State of Oregon subsequently sued the same parties, and the state court consolidated these cases. McGrory Decl. [177] Exs. 2 &amp; 3. The state court plaintiffs asserted numerous claims against the UI defendants, EWTC Management, and its owners, including claims for breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, and unjust enrichment. This litigation culminated in a four week trial, and the state court plaintiffs prevailed on all claims. McGrory Decl. [177] Ex. 4. The parties eventually reached several settlement agreements, after which SSSC assumed UI's role as sole member of SDI. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Plaintiffs' Claims to Board Membership\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Bibiji and the three children should be on the SSSC Board and that Bibiji should be on the UI Board. SAC [234] \u00b6\u00b6 24-29. They assert that, before Yogi Bhajan's death, they expressed to him that they wished to become more involved in the management of the various business entities that he controlled.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Soni Decl. [394], Ex. NN (Ranbir Dep.) at 60. Plaintiffs assert that Yogi Bhajan instructed defendant Sopurkh, both orally and in writing, to add plaintiffs to the management boards of whatever business entities the family wanted. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. NN (Ranbir Dep.) at 60-61. Sopurkh testified that Yogi Bhajan asked her to talk to the family members about which boards they were interested in participating in. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. RR (Sopurkh Dep.) at 40-41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   There are several documents in the record that might indicate who Yogi Bhajan intended to be on the UI and SSSC boards. On July 10, 1997, Sopurkh emailed Yogi Bhajan and referred to \"the listing of the [SSSC] board members as [Yogi Bhajan] gave them to me.\" Soni Decl. [394], Ex. I.

FAC [102]. After a 2012 round of motions to dismiss and a First Amended Complaint (FAC), I granted Defendants' four motions to dismiss [125, 172, 178, 180] the FAC in full on October 11, 2013, concluding that Plaintiffs lacked standing to bring derivative claims and that the direct claims failed based on res judicata, mootness, the First Amendment's ministerial exception, Rule 9(b)'s heightened fraud standard, and/or failure to state a claim. Minutes of Proceedings [215]; Transcript of Proceedings [220]. Plaintiffs appealed. The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded. In a published opinion, the Ninth Circuit concluded that dismissal pursuant to the ministerial exception or the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine was not warranted at the pleadings stage.\n   <em>\n    Puri v.

SAC [234]. Defendants filed several Motions to Dismiss. I issued an Opinion and Order granting in part and denying in part Defendants' Motions to Dismiss. [296]. I then denied Plaintiffs' related Motion for Reconsideration and for Entry of Judgment Pursuant to Rule 54(b) [305], and granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs' Motion for Leave to Amend [301].

Following these Opinions and the subsequent settlement of the claims between Plaintiffs, Lambert, and Schwabe, the following claims remain in this case:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Claim One (declaratory relief): direct claims against UI and SSSC by all Plaintiffs (relief of having Bibiji placed on UI board and all Plaintiffs placed on SSSC board).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 Claim Two (fraud): claim by all Plaintiffs against Sopurkh and Kartar,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 Claim Four (tortious interference): claim by all Plaintiffs against Sopurkh\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

As the Ninth Circuit described, SSSC and UI hold assets and oversee several subsidiaries, including for-profit companies like East-West Tea Company and Akal Security. Gurojodha Decl. [395], Ex. 7.

[394], Ex. C, Art. VI. And according to SSSC's 1997 Articles, the SSSC board also had the duty to choose a new Siri Sikdar Sahib/a-one of the two religious leaders of the Sikh Dharma religion in the Western Hemisphere-in the case that Yogi Bhajan did not choose such an individual. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. B at 4-5; Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 12. And SSSC was to make this decision with the advice of the Khalsa Council Adh Kari, SDI's board of directors, and with nominations from the Khalsa Council, SDI's ministerial board-two clearly religious bodies. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. B at 4-5; Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Similarly, according to the 2003 SDI Amended and Restated Operation Agreement, UI had a significant role in running the religious affairs of SDI. UI was to approve or elect nearly all religious and administrative leaders of SDI. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 2-14 (UI to choose the directors of the Khalsa Council Adh Kari and the Khalsa Council, the Executive Officers of SDI, the Secretary General of SDI, and \"designat[ing] such other religious or administrative officials of [SDI] as it deems appropriate\"). UI could also remove employees, including the Siri Sikdar Sahib/a if the Siri Sikdar Sahib/a died or was incapacitated. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 2-14. UI also had final authority over all actions of the Khalsa Council Adh Kari and could amend the Articles and Bylaws of SDI. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 2-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In my view, these documents show that although SSSC and UI do act as corporate boards in some ways, they were also formed to perform Yogi Bhajan's leadership role in approving religious policy and leaders. Although both organizations perform some secular functions, they appear to be \"religiously affiliated entities\" with clearly religious purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Penn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516187\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/416/#p424\">\n    884 F.3d at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Taking this information into consideration, I now address\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor's\n   </em>\n   other guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether the Board Members Have Formal Religious Titles\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Ninth Circuit acknowledged that board members must be ministers, but concluded that \"[a]n employee's status as an ordained minister, standing alone, does not trigger the ministerial exception when that individual is employed in a secular capacity by an entity other than a church.\"\n   <em>\n    Puri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177741\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1152/\">\n    844 F.3d at 1161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I take this to mean that formal religious titles can satisfy this first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   analysis, but do not control the outcome. Here, Plaintiffs do not dispute that the UI Amended and Restated Operating Agreement required board members to be qualified as Sikh Dharma ministers and\n   included other religious qualifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Southwick Decl. [398], Ex. 22 at 3-4. But appears that the SSSC ministerial qualifications came into effect immediately after Yogi Bhajan's death and may not have applied at the time of the \"employment decision\" disputed by Plaintiffs. I therefore conclude this factor weighs in favor of applying the ministerial exception to Plaintiffs' claims against UI and against applying the ministerial exception to Plaintiffs' claims against SSSC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Defendants argue that \"the SSSC and UI Board positions carry a responsibility to convey the Sikh Dharma message and carry out its mission.\" Def. MSJ [390] at 23. Plaintiffs argue there are no ministerial requirements or religious job duties listed in the then-applicable 1997 Articles and Bylaws for SSSC, or in UI's governing documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Soni Decl.

[398], Ex. 21 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   In my view, the evidence not available at the pleadings stage changes considerably the analysis of this factor. On one hand, Plaintiffs are correct that the section of the SSSC Bylaws entitled \"Duties\" makes no reference to religion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Soni Decl. [394], Ex. C, Art. 2. But on the other hand, the boards members of SSSC and UI have some express religious duties. SSSC was to choose a new Siri Sikdar Sahib/a, one of the two religious positions to exist after Yogi Bhajan's death, in the event that Yogi Bhajan did not choose such an individual. Soni Decl. [394], Ex. B at 4-5. And as discussed above, UI had the power to choose and remove many of SDI's religious leaders, approve the decisions of the Khalsa Council Adh Kari, and amend the bylaws and articles of SDI. Gurojot Decl. [396], Ex. 9 at 2-14. Furthermore, some of the Plaintiffs testified that they were appointed to \"spread the word of [Yogi Bhajan's] mission,\" including \"the word of the Holy Scripture,\" and \"teach the Sikh way of life.\" Southwick Decl. [419], Ex. 1 (Bibiji Dep.) at 59-60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The duties of the board members do not fit neatly into case law, which often involves religious educators.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    565 U.S. at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the plaintiff was \"expressly charged ... with 'lead[ing] others toward Christian maturity' and 'teach[ing] faithfully\n   the Word of God, the Sacred Scriptures, in its truth and purity and as set forth in all the symbolical books of the Evangelical Lutheran Church' \"). But in my view, the board members of UI and SSSC have important religious duties: they may choose and remove religious leaders, and approve religious decisions and governing documents. Although the board members do not act as teachers, they have significant religious duties that allow them to shape the future of the Sikh Dharma religion through its religious employees, governing documents, and the decisions of its board of directors. In the context of SSSC's and UI's leadership roles in relation to SDI, these facts weigh strongly in favor of applying the ministerial exception to Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Whether Board Members or the Board Hold the Members Out as Religious Leaders\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Ninth Circuit found it significant that the pleadings did not allege that the board members are held out as religious leaders, either by the members themselves or their employers.\n   <em>\n    Puri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177741\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1152/\">\n    844 F.3d at 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, there is evidence not available at the pleadings stage that both the Plaintiffs and their potential \"employers\" viewed these positions as involving religious leadership components. In their depositions, the Plaintiffs testified that they were appointed to \"spread the word of [Yogi Bhajan's] mission,\" including \"the word of the Holy Scripture,\" and \"teach the Sikh way of life.\" Southwick Decl. [419], Ex. 1, (Bibiji Dep.) at 59-60;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Southwick Decl. [398], Ex. 10 at 116 (Kulbir agreeing with the statement that board members would \"generally be in a position to engage in that kind of outreach to religious leaders\"). Furthermore, the Plaintiffs admitted \"that the members of the SSSC Board of Trustees hold positions of leadership within the Sikh Dharma community by virtue of their position as SSSC Trustees.\" Southwick Decl. [398], Ex. 1 at 4. In terms of the boards themselves, it is clear from the governing documents of SSSC, UI, and SDI that the board members of SSSC and UI were to play an important role as religious leaders, in choosing and removing subordinate religious leaders, and by affecting religious policy. Given these facts, I conclude this factor weighs in favor of applying the ministerial exception to Plaintiffs' claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Considering the role UI and SSSC were to play in the hierarchy of Sikh Dharma and these four factors, I conclude the application of the ministerial exception is a close call. On one hand, the board members of SSSC did not appear to need a religious title at the time of the employment decision in question. And neither board appeared to require religious training. Furthermore, this case falls outside the typical cases in which the ministerial exception applies, which tend to involve religious educators. On the other hand, the Supreme Court suggested \"a fairly broad application of the exception\" in\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Puri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177741\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1152/\">\n    844 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1159 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    565 U.S. at 188-89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). I conclude the importance of each board in the religious hierarchy of Sikh Dharma at the time Plaintiffs allege they were appointed to the board is particularly relevant. And there were significant religious duties involved in these leadership positions, including choosing and firing religious leaders, approving the governing documents of SDI, and approving the actions of SDI's board of directors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Given this religious structure and the ministerial leadership roles played by the board members, I conclude that judicial review of the decisions to not place Plaintiffs on the UI and SSSC boards falls within the purpose of the ministerial exception, as it would constitute \"government\n   interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hosanna-Tabor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    565 U.S. at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12445443,12186094\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/171/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In effect, Plaintiffs seek court interference in the membership of the boards that choose Sikh Dharma's highest level of leadership and exercise significant control over the direction of the Sikh Dharma religious in the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, the ministerial exception bars review in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the Ecclesiastical Abstention Doctrine Bars Review in this Case\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because this case does not involve the typical application of the ministerial exception, I address in the alternative whether the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine applies. The ecclesiastical abstention doctrine is based on courts' determination that \"[t]he Free Exercise Clause restricts the government's ability to intrude into ecclesiastical matters or to interfere with a church's governance of its own affairs.\"\n   <em>\n    Bollard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11558336\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/196/940/#p947\">\n    196 F.3d at 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Under this doctrine of ecclesiastical abstention, 'a State may adopt any one of various approaches for settling church ... disputes so long as it involves no consideration of doctrinal matters.' \"\n   <em>\n    Puri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12177741\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/1152/\">\n    844 F.3d at 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

[395] \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   To grant Plaintiffs' requested relief, this Court would have to determine the legitimacy of Yogi Bhajan's succession. Additionally, this relief would place Plaintiffs at the helm of religious institutions, thus displacing board members chosen by other methods. In my view, this raises a \"substantial danger that the State will become entangled in essentially religious controversies or intervene on behalf of groups espousing particular doctrinal beliefs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Milivojevich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182027\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/696/\">\n    426 U.S. at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6182027\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/696/\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

I disagree, because I conclude the current status of the boards is pertinent to the question whether relief may be granted in this case without violating the First Amendment, as it pertains to the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine. I therefore DENY Plaintiffs' Motion [424] on these grounds.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    I note that Yogi Bhajan appeared to change his mind regarding the intended roles of SSSC and UI, and then-relationships to SDI. As of 1997, SSSC was to play the key leadership role in SDI and act as SDI's sole member. UI then took this role in 2003. And following the settlement agreements in 2012, SSSC took over this leadership role yet again.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Because I conclude the ministerial exception and the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine bar review in this case, I do not reach the parties' other arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Plaintiffs also argue that the Ninth Circuit's decision is law of the case, but the Ninth Circuit clearly stated its decision was based on the pleadings alone.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    In addressing the ministerial exception, I refer to the documents in existence at the time of the \"employment decisions\" Defendants argue are \"protected\" by the exception. This means the 1997 SSSC documents and the 2003 UI and SDI documents. I therefore DENY as moot the parties' Motions to Strike [418, 424, 428] as they pertain to this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The Plaintiffs agreed at oral argument that to decide whether SSSC and UI are religious groups, I should look only to governing documents in existence at the time of the events in question, not to the declarations in the record. Minutes [433].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    There are several reasons why this case does not fit neatly into the precedents set by prior case law. First, it involves a religion not within the Judeo-Christian tradition, which is most commonly addressed by the case law.\n    <em>\n     But see\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Maktab Tarighe Oveyssi Shah Maghsoudi, Inc. v. Kianfar\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"844310,844463\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/179/1244/\">\n     179 F.3d 1244\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (9th Cir. 1999) (addressing the competing claims of individuals in an ancient Sufi order). This precedent presumes there are relatively clear distinctions between religious and secular purposes. Here, by contrast, it is by no means straightforward to determine that, for example, running yoga clinics is a secular endeavor, instead of part of the Sikh Dharma religious message. Additionally, this case addresses a dispute during a time when the Sikh Dharma hierarchy was evolving. During his illness and up to the time of his death, Yogi Bhajan was in the process of creating several new structures to replace him as the leader of Sikh Dharma in the Western Hemisphere.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    SSSC's evolution over the past fifteen years raises the novel question of how to apply the ministerial exception to an organization which has assumed more religious characteristics over time. I have only considered documents describing SSSC prior to Yogi Bhajan's death in analyzing the ministerial exception, because the term \"protected employment decision\" appears to apply to a particular moment in time. But doing so fails to take into account the fact that granting a remedy to Plaintiffs regarding SSSC would affect SSSC now, a significantly religious organization. Viewed in this light, the \"formal title\" factor would weigh in favor of applying the ministerial exception to SSSC, which now requires such titles for board members.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Because I conclude the ministerial exception and the ecclesiastical abstention doctrine bar review in this case, I do not reach the parties' other arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
