The Court has also considered certain documents that are referred to or incorporated by reference in the complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whipple v.

He was terminated as a result of certain charges brought against him, which resulted in a arbitrator's finding that plaintiff was guilty of \"conduct unbecoming a teacher, immoral character, insubordination and neglect of duty.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 23 (referencing arbitrator's decision); Arbitrator's Decision (Dkt. # 32-4) at 3. This mostly related to plaintiff's interactions with students, particularly on several occasions when he lost his temper and shouted at students.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Around 2009, plaintiff, who alleges that he has suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder for many years, sought psychological treatment for problems stemming from several causes, including his wife's illness and other traumatic events. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 52-54. During the 2011-12 academic year, plaintiff also participated in therapy, pursuant to the District's employee assistance program (\"EAP\"). He alleges that he did so at the direction of the District. Complaint \u00b6 106. Plaintiff does not appear to take issue with that directive, as he alleges that his participation in the EAP was a reasonable accommodation for his emotional or psychological difficulties. Complaint \u00b6 104.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The EAP was administered by defendant EHS, pursuant to a contract between EHS and the District. Under the terms of the contract, which is expressly referenced in the complaint, any information provided by an employee using the EAP was to remain confidential.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 32-3 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   According to plaintiff, then-principal Gerard Iuppa, who himself was a licensed psychologist, understood the problems that plaintiff was dealing with, but was generally satisfied with plaintiff's work performance. Iuppa retired in January 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Following Iuppa's retirement, defendant Lisa Buckshaw became the principal. Plaintiff alleges that with the knowledge and support of defendant Superintendent Kimberle Ward, Buckshaw sought to get rid of plaintiff. The reasons for her alleged animus toward plaintiff are not entirely clear, but at least part of it appears to stem from Buckshaw's alleged awareness that plaintiff had opposed Buckshaw's hiring because of her role in prior instances of illegal employment discrimination, against other employees. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 91-93. (Aside from plaintiff's opposition to Buckshaw's appointment, those alleged acts of discrimination are unrelated to the events giving rise to this lawsuit.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Over the course of the 2013-14 school year, Buckshaw allegedly took several disciplinary actions against plaintiff, relating to various incidents involving plaintiff's interactions with students and other teachers. Plaintiff alleges that these were essentially trumped-up charges and that Buckshaw, with Ward's support, was trying to manufacture a pretext for plaintiff's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the 2015-16 academic year, Buckshaw recommended plaintiff's termination. Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n    N.Y. Educ. L. \u00a7 3020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -a, which generally provides that a tenured employee is entitled to a hearing when charges have been brought against him, a hearing was held before an arbitrator/hearing officer. At that hearing, EHS's president/owner, Joseph DiMaria, testified pursuant to a subpoena issued by the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DiMaria testified at the hearing that he met plaintiff in 2014, based on a referral from the District pursuant to the EAP, requesting him to talk to plaintiff about \"some concerns and issues the District had expressed.\" Plaintiff's Ex. 6 (Dkt. # 26-7) at 110. DiMaria stated that those matters generally related to \"[c]oncerns expressed by teachers who worked with Mr. Geer or about either some of his classroom activities [and] their relationships with him ....\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n    at 112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   DiMaria further testified that he met with plaintiff on four occasions, as well as with some other District staff members, roughly between February and April 2014. He stated that in general, those other employees \"felt intimidated, threatened in a sense [by plaintiff]. I don't think physical threat but feeling that Mr. Geer was aggressive and they felt intimidated by him, and they were afraid to express it because they felt some level of intimidation and retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n    at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his testimony, DiMaria said virtually nothing about any communications between plaintiff and him. DiMaria did indicate that he had relayed some of the other teachers' concerns to plaintiff. But following these meetings, DiMaria ultimately recommended that plaintiff be allowed to resume teaching, with \"some more structure and supervision,\" at least initially, so that if further problems arose, they could be dealt with in an orderly way.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n    at 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He testified that pursuant to his usual procedures, he also conducted a mental health screen of plaintiff, to see if any other issues needed to be addressed, but that \"[n]one of the results indicated further treatment or test.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n    at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the end, however, plaintiff was discharged, mostly due to events that occurred after-consistent with DiMaria's recommendation-plaintiff was allowed to return to work. According to Buckshaw (who also testified at the hearing), the decision to terminate plaintiff was prompted in large part by an incident that occurred on September 24, 2015-some\n   <em>\n    fifteen months after\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's EAP sessions with DiMaria had come to an end,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 26-7 at 118. On that date, Buckshaw was told by a staff member, shortly after the end of a fire drill, that there was shouting coming from plaintiff's classroom. Buckshaw stated that she immediately went to the room, where she found plaintiff yelling at his students, apparently because he believed that some of them had misbehaved in some manner during the drill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Buckshaw told plaintiff more than once that she would \"take if from here,\" whereupon plaintiff stopped talking and gestured with his arm as if to say, \"They're all yours,\" and Buckshaw addressed the students, reminding them of the importance of behaving properly during fire drills. Buckshaw then left the room and plaintiff resumed teaching.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n    at 121-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on the timing of the events, including her review of video from a security camera, Buckshaw estimated that plaintiff had been yelling at his students for some six minutes by the time she arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Buckshaw also testified about several other causes for concern about plaintiff. These included complaints or reports from students and at least one parent about certain statements that plaintiff had made to his students. These need not be recited in detail here, but they included comments about plaintiff's belief that women should not be allowed to serve in the military\n   (because their proper role is to stay home and raise children), making joking references to pornography and to menstrual periods, embarrassing a student in front of the entire class because the student had failed a test, and so on.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Buckshaw, Ward and Assistant Superintendent John Brandon consulted with each other, and the decision was made to terminate plaintiff. Buckshaw testified that \"Kim [Ward] really made a decision that that's it. We're done,\" but Buckshaw concurred with that decision. She testified that while she found plaintiff to have a \"huge heart and a lot of passion,\" both staff members and students were afraid of him. She stated that he was simply \"too unpredictable,\" and that she was \"concerned that he will snap at a child and hurt them physically although we already know that he has harmed them emotionally.\" Dkt. # 26-7 at 170-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After that decision was made, plaintiff presumably exercised his right to a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 3020-a.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Educ. L. \u00a7 3020-a(2)(f) (stating that \"[t]he unexcused failure of the employee to notify the clerk or secretary of his or her desire for a hearing within ten days of the receipt of charges shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following the \u00a7 3020-a hearing, the arbitrator issued a forty-two-page decision concluding that plaintiff was guilty of conduct unbecoming a teacher, and insubordination. He also ruled that the appropriate penalty was termination of plaintiff's employment. Dkt. # 32-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on March 15, 2017. The amended complaint asserts eight causes of action: (1) a claim against the District under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (2) an analogous claim against the District, under the New York Human Rights Law, Exec.

Defendants EHS and DiMaria\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   primarily argue that plaintiff's claims against them must be dismissed because: (1) defendants are immune from liability for claims arising out of DiMaria's testimony at plaintiff's Education Law \u00a7 3020-a hearing; (2) plaintiff's emotional-distress claim is time-barred, and not supported by plaintiff's factual allegations; and (3) plaintiff has not alleged sufficient facts to give rise to a claim of fraudulent misrepresentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Educ. L. \u00a7 3020(a) - Immunity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants state that plaintiff's claims against them arise out of DiMaria's testimony as a subpoenaed witness at plaintiff's hearing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Educ.%20L.%20%C2%A7%203020\">\n    N.Y.

There are no actionable claims here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   At the most fundamental level, DiMaria did not say anything in his testimony that would give rise to a claim of IIED or fraudulent misrepresentation, against him or EHS. Having reviewed DiMaria's testimony (which was relatively brief, and takes up ten pages of a double-spaced transcript), the Court has found nothing in that testimony that could reasonably be viewed as disclosing any confidential information, or stating anything obviously likely to cause plaintiff emotional distress. DiMaria's testimony, like his report, was\n   <em>\n    favorable\n   </em>\n   to plaintiff. He recommended that plaintiff be returned to work, with some recommendations for how everyone concerned could best handle any future problems that might arise, and he said that he found no mental or psychological problems warranting further attention. How was plaintiff harmed by such testimony?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nor has plaintiff identified any statements by defendants that could support a fraudulent-misrepresentation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants may have assured plaintiff that statements made, or information disclosed in the course of his EAP sessions would remain confidential, but nothing that DiMaria said in his testimony could reasonably be construed as violating those assurances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   DiMaria's testimony relating directly to his interactions with plaintiff took up only about half of his total testimony, which as noted was brief to begin with.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 26-7 at 113-18. He mostly testified about what he had learned from or about other staff members, regarding their concerns about plaintiff. He said that he had met with plaintiff on five occasions, but in his testimony he disclosed nothing that plaintiff had said to him, or he to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   DiMaria also prepared a three-page handwritten report summarizing his findings and recommendations, which he submitted to the District. That report was admitted into evidence during the \u00a7 3020-a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 26-7 at 115, # 41-1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Like his testimony, DiMaria's written report contains nothing that could remotely be construed as disclosing confidential information. To the extent that DiMaria even wrote about plaintiff directly, he stated that plaintiff had \"been fully cooperating,\" that he was \"in full compliance with [the] referral,\" and that DiMaria could not \"identify any reason for not returning [plaintiff] to the workplace.\" Dkt. # 41-1 at 24. That is hardly the stuff of which tort claims are made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   I also agree with defendants that plaintiff's IIED claim is time-barred. Under New York law, a claim for IIED is subject to a one-year statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rentas v.

Plaintiff's IIED claim is based on DiMaria's testimony at the \u00a7 3020-a hearing, which occurred on February 23, 2016. Plaintiff filed the complaint in this action over a year later, on March 15, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiff argues that his IIED claim did not accrue until the arbitrator issued his decision on April 6, 2016.

Simply repackaging them in a different guise will not save these claims. DiMaria did not divulge any confidential information. In short, there was no malpractice and no breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Plaintiff's Motion to Compel Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff has filed a motion (Dkt. # 45) to compel responses to his discovery demands, against DiMaria and EHS. The basis for the motion is essentially that plaintiff believes there is evidence that prior to his testimony at the \u00a7 3020-a hearing, DiMaria met with counsel for the District. The significance of that eludes the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The motion is denied as moot. Plaintiff has not shown a reasonable basis to believe that the requested discovery would alter the outcome of this case in any way. Even assuming that DiMaria did meet with the District's attorney, plaintiff has not demonstrated how the information that he seeks would be likely to shore up his claims against DiMaria and EHS, which for the ample reasons stated above are fatally flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The motion by DiMaria and Employee Health Referral Systems, Inc., d/b/a Employee Health Systems (\"EHS\") to dismiss\n   the complaint (Dkt. # 24) is granted, and plaintiff's claims against those defendants are dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff's motion by plaintiff for leave to file a second amended complaint (Dkt. # 37), and his motion to compel production of certain discovery-related documents (Dkt. # 45), are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The arbitrator's decision is referenced in the complaint, and the arbitration proceeding is central to plaintiff's claims here. Plaintiff has submitted a copy of the decision, and defendants do not challenge its authenticity. The Court may therefore consider it on a motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Campanella v. County of Monroe\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5866801\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/853/364/\">\n     853 F.Supp.2d 364\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 370 n. 2 (W.D.N.Y. 2012) (since arbitration proceeding was referenced in the complaint, arbitration decision that was issued after the complaint was filed could fairly be considered by the Court on Rule 12(c) motion, as integral to the plaintiffs' claim).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, further references to \"defendants\" will be understood to refer to the moving defendants,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , EHS and DiMaria.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    The Court has considered, and rejects, plaintiff's argument that the subpoena was somehow \"defective.\" Plaintiff's convoluted argument is based on his assertion that the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\"HIPAA\") only authorizes testimony concerning protected health information under certain conditions. The subpoena, however, simply directed DiMaria to testify at a disciplinary hearing. DiMaria did so, and he did not, in his testimony, disclose any protected health information concerning plaintiff.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20160.103\">\n     45 C.F.R. \u00a7 160.103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In addition, plaintiff made no objection to DiMaria's testimony at the time of the hearing, nor did he seek to quash the subpoena. I also note that \"HIPAA does not authorize a private right of action.\"\n    <em>\n     Fero v. Excellus Health Plain, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268140\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/735/#p777\">\n     236 F.Supp.3d 735\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 777 (W.D.N.Y. 2017).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    In his memorandum of law, plaintiff states that he was \"required to submit to an involuntary arbitration proceeding under the terms of Education Law \u00a7 3020(a).\" Dkt. # 26 at 8.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    By its terms, however, \u00a7 3020-a provides for a hearing only if the\n    <em>\n     employee\n    </em>\n    requests a hearing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Educ. L. \u00a7 3020-a(2)(e), (f). If the employee fails to request a hearing within ten days of the receipt of charges, that failure is deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268140\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/236/735/#p777\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    While this is not a dispositive issue, it certainly suggests that plaintiff's characterization that he was \"forced\" to submit to a hearing is inaccurate. Rather, he exercised his right to request a hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    I also note that on February 17, 2014, plaintiff signed a form-a copy of which plaintiff has submitted-entitled \"Authorization to Use or Disclose Protected Health Information (PHI)\" (Dkt. # 26-6.) In that document, plaintiff gave his permission to EHS to use or disclose information to the District for a number of purposes, including whether he was participating in the EAP, his counselor's assessment, and plaintiff's compliance with his counselor's recommendations. Plaintiff also signed a \"Statement of Understanding\" stating,\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    , that EHS could use or disclose plaintiff's protected health information without his consent when required by law, including in \"[j]udicial, administrative or criminal prosecutions.\" Dkt. # 32-3.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Both sides have submitted copies of those documents, and their seems to be no dispute about their authenticity. Since the documents are not expressly referenced in the complaint, they are outside the pleadings, and the present decision does not rest upon them. But it is worth pointing out that by his own admission, plaintiff agreed that EHS could disclose basic information about his participation in the EAP, or other information as required by law. That is essentially all that DiMaria did here, with no contemporaneous objection by plaintiff.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Though captioned separately, the malpractice and contract claims are both listed under the \"Ninth Cause of Action.\" It appears that this may have been a clerical error and that the contract claim should have been designated the tenth cause of action.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
