Dismissal is Appropriate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court dismisses this action without prejudice.

The Court, however, granted Hern\u00e1ndez's request for an extension of time to serve the defendants by March 2018. (Docket Nos. 12, 13.) Subsequently, the Court provided Hern\u00e1ndez a final opportunity to serve defendants by May 2018. (Docket No. 20.) Hern\u00e1ndez never served process on Jane Doe or the conjugal partnership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The summons that Hern\u00e1ndez published in the San Juan\n   <em>\n    Daily Star\n   </em>\n   constitutes inadequate service of process for Jane Doe and the conjugal partnership.

Laws Ann. tit. 32 App. III R. 4.5 (emphasis added). Hern\u00e1ndez set forth no evidence that he attempted to serve Jane Doe at all or the conjugal partnership properly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 14, Ex. 1;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Figueroa v.

Furthermore, even though the published summons includes the N\u00fa\u00f1ez/Doe conjugal partnership, there is nothing in the record that shows that a copy of the summons and complaint were mailed to the conjugal partnership. Consequently, Hern\u00e1ndez remains in violation of the Court's April 27, 2018 order to serve defendants by May 14, 2018.
