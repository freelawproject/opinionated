After reviewing the relevant pleadings and motion, the Court finds that the motion should be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") in 1938. The FLSA mandates that employees earn no less than the federal minimum wage for every hour worked. Employees must also earn one and one-half times their regular pay for each hour worked beyond a forty-hour week. When enacted, the FLSA had several exemptions to the overtime requirement. Specifically, anyone employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity was exempt from the minimum wage and overtime requirements.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is often referred to as the \"white collar\" or \"EAP\" exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At passage, Congress did not define \"bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20213\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rather, the FLSA empowered the Secretary of Labor to define these terms through regulations. The Secretary of Labor further permitted the Department of Labor (the \"DOL\") to issue regulations interpreting the EAP exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March 2014, President Obama directed the DOL to revise the FLSA's overtime exemption for \"executive, administrative, and professional employees.\" Memorandum on Updating and Modernizing Overtime Regulations, 2014 DAILY COMP. PRES. DOC. 201400165 (Mar. 13, 2014). The DOL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   announced its plan to revise Code of Federal Regulations Title 29 Part 541 to increase exempt employees' salaries from $455 per week ($23,660 annually) to $921 per week ($47,892 annually) (the \"Final Rule\"). Soon after, a collection of states (\"State Plaintiffs\") filed suit against the DOL, the DOL's Wage and Hour Division, and their agents, challenging the validity of the Final Rule. On October 12, 2016, the State Plaintiffs moved for emergency preliminary injunctive relief. The Court issued a preliminary injunction against the Final Rule on November 22, 2016, holding the DOL likely lacked statutory authority to enact the Final Rule and the Final Rule would cause irreparable harm if implemented on December 1, 2016 (the \"Court's Order\" or the \"Injunction\"). The Court's Order read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [T]he Court has authority to enjoin the Final Rule on a nationwide basis and decides that it is appropriate in this case, and therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the State Plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. # 10).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Therefore, the Department's Final Rule described at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2032%2C391\">\n    81 Fed.

Alvarez claimed to bring suit on behalf of herself and others \"similarly situated\" so as to certify an FLSA collective action and class action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and (b)(3). Alvarez's counsel-Joseph Sellers (\"Sellers\") and Miriam Nemeth (\"Nemeth\") of Cohen Milstein Sellers &amp; Toll PLLC, Justin Swartz (\"Swartz\") and Melissa Stewart (\"Stewart\") of Outten &amp; Golden LLP, and local counsel Glen Savits (\"Savits\") (the \"Lawyers\")-acknowledged the Injunction in Alvarez's complaint but stated it did not apply to them or to their client:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   32.

Because the Eastern District of Texas's preliminary injunction was limited to implementation and enforcement of the Overtime Rule by the Department of Labor and its officials, it did not affect the ability of persons not party to the\n   <em>\n    Nevada\n   </em>\n   case, including Plaintiff and similarly situated employees, to bring private lawsuits pursuant to the FLSA's\n   private cause of action,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20216\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), to enforce their right to overtime pay under the Rule, nor did it prevent non-parties from bringing lawsuits under state law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Dkt. # 89, Exhibit 1 at pp. 13-14). This is the second lawsuit in which one of Alvarez's counsel-Swartz-has argued that this Court's Injunction of the Final Rule does not apply to him or to his client.

The history of this proceeding shows that Chipotle substantially complied with process requirements and Respondents were not prejudiced by the imperfect process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Chipotle filed its Motion for Contempt with the Court on August 1, 2017 (Dkt. # 89). On August 21, 2017, Chipotle attempted to serve Swartz at his office (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 8 at p. 4). After Swartz allegedly refused to accept service, Chipotle's process server left a copy of the Proposed Order Granting Chipotle's Motion for Contempt, Motion for Judicial Notice, Proposed Order Granting Chipotle's Motion for Judicial Notice, Motion for Contempt, and Exhibits with a security guard of \"suitable age and discretion\" on the premises (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 8 at p. 4). Chipotle's process server inferred that Swartz was deliberately fleeing service:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   CALLED [SWARTZ] AT 212-245-1000. SPOKE TO A FEMALE WHO STATED THAT JUSTIN WILL NOT COME DOWNSTAIRS TO ACCEPT DOCUMENTS AND THAT NO ONE FROM THE OFFICE WILL COME DOWN TO ACCEPT SERVICE ON HIS BEHALF. I FEEL HE IS EVADING SERVICE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 8 at p. 4). After Chipotle could not serve Respondents with process on August 21, 2017, it emailed Respondents to address the process issue. On August 24, 2017, Chipotle's counsel emailed Respondents informing them that \"Chipotle is moving forward with service of the contempt motion, accompanying exhibits and proposed orders, and notice of hearing.\" (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 7 at p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Chipotle's counsel added that \"I am confirming that none of you are willing to waive and accept service of these papers in your individual capacities or on behalf of Ms. Alvarez.\" (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 7 at p. 4). Thereafter, Chipotle's counsel informed Respondents that if Chipotle had to effect personal service, it would seek the fees and costs incurred in doing so pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(2) (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 7 at p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Chipotle also mailed to the Respondents notification of the Motion for Contempt, related filings, and notice of hearing set for August 17, 2017 (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 7 at pp. 346-48). This notification included a request to waive service of process (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 7 at pp. 346-48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Chipotle's attempted notice was effective. Upon learning of the motion for contempt, Sellers deemed it \"regrettable\" that the company \"has mounted a frivolous attack on [Alvarez] and her lawyers\" rather than defending the New Jersey lawsuit. Sellers so elaborated in a Law360 article:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Rather than defend against the FLSA claims in the New Jersey court in which they are pending, Chipotle has rushed to a forum of its choice to argue that a preliminary injunction issued in the [Eastern District of] Texas that applies solely to the Department of Labor has barred the plaintiffs from proceeding with a wholly independent private claim against the company. Chipotle should pay its workers for the overtime they've earned rather than engaging in these legal gymnastics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Dkt. # 113, Exhibit 6 at p. 4). Respondents have not shown that they were actually prejudiced by the imperfect service of process. At each and every step of this contempt proceeding, Chipotle sent notice to Respondents of the ensuing developments in the litigation. This notice permitted Respondents to repeatedly contest Chipotle's contempt motion through briefs and in a contempt hearing before the Court. In turn, Respondents enjoyed substantially compliant service and suffered no prejudice. Thus, the Court has jurisdiction over Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

More planes means more passengers, more sales, more jobs, more profits for all of the businesses involved. Furthermore, a pecuniary interest could be claimed by investors, developers, hotels, restaurants, and other retail interests attracted to the vicinity by the new facility.

That proceeding resulted in the Court enjoining the Final Rule on a nationwide basis and enjoining the DOL from enforcing the Final Rule (Dkt. # 60 at pp. 19-20).

If the DOL had prevailed in the original injunction proceeding, the Final Rule would have been deemed valid and enforced, and Alvarez's cause of action-the recovery of unpaid overtime wages based on the criteria in the Final Rule-would have been unwarranted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whether or not Chipotle ultimately complied with the Final Rule, the DOL advocated for legal interests congruent to those in Alvarez's lawsuit-the validity and enforceability of the Final Rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sw.

These included Professors David C. Vladeck of Georgetown University Law Center (Dkt. # 125, Exhibit A), Professor Alan B. Morrison of The George Washington University School of Law (Dkt. # 125, Exhibit B), and Professor David Marcus of the University of Arizona Rogers College of Law (Dkt. # 125, Exhibit C) (collectively \"the Professors\"). In their respective affidavits, the Professors explained that they believed that the Court's Order did not prevent Respondents from suing to enforce the Final Rule (Dkt. # 125, Exhibits A-C). Sellers also submitted an affidavit explaining that he consulted with the Professors before filing suit in New Jersey (Dkt. # 125, Exhibit D at p. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Good faith is irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Chao\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9453063\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/276/725/#p728\">\n    276 F.3d at 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court's Order enjoined the Final Rule on a nationwide basis (Dkt. # 60 at p. 19). Respondents sued Chipotle to recover overtime wages based on the Final Rule. As previously discussed, the Injunction clearly prohibited Respondents' actions as their lawsuit necessarily required enforcing the Final Rule. Since Respondents did not comply with the Court's Order, contempt is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Court Will Not Limit the Motion for Contempt to Senior Attorneys\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Since contempt is proper, the Court will address Respondents' third argument-the Court should not hold junior attorneys Nemeth, Stewart, and Savits in contempt. Respondents advance that these attorneys had no decision-making authority in bringing the New Jersey Action. To that end, Sellers submitted an affidavit to the Court, explaining that Nemeth, an associate at his law firm, had no decision-making authority over bringing Alvarez's claim (Dkt. # 125, Exhibit D). Swartz also submitted an affidavit, claiming that Stewart, an associate at his law firm, had no decision-making authority over bringing Alvarez's claim (Dkt. # 125, Exhibit E). Chipotle counters that this argument is untimely, claiming that \"Respondents cannot now, at the final hour, raise new arguments attempting to alleviate Nemeth, Stewart, and Savits from responsibility for their actions.\" (Dkt. # 123 at p. 7). Chipotle also argues that if the Court does not find these lawyers in contempt, it would allow their pursuit of the New Jersey action. Further, Chipotle argues that the facts of this case do not support the notion that these lawyers were just following orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   All five of the Lawyers-Sellers, Swartz, Nemeth, Stewart, and Savits-appeared on the New Jersey Class Action Complaint as \"Attorneys for Plaintiff and the Putative Class and Collective.\" (Dkt. # 89, Exhibit 1 at p. 5). At that time, Savits had practiced law for thirty-five years. Savits signed the complaint. Nemeth had practiced law for eight years. Nemeth featured\n   the New Jersey Class Action on her firm biography and listed herself as the sole point of contact for parties looking to join the action. Stewart had also practiced law for eight years. One of Respondents' law firm websites advised the public to contact her with \"any questions, concerns, or information about Chipotle or the overtime issues\" in the New Jersey Class Action (Dkt. # 123, Exhibit 12 at p. 3). After three years of law school and eight to thirty-five years of practice, a lawyer should know that signing his or her name to a document has consequences. Given their experience, avidity, and ownership of this case, it is difficult to accept that these seasoned professionals simply followed orders. Thus, the Court will not limit Chipotle's Motion for Contempt to the Respondents' senior attorneys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

These circumstances warrant both compliance and compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Court will exercise civil contempt to ensure compliance with the Court's Order. Respondents have amply showed that they are ready and willing to violate the Court's Order. In statements to the press, to a New Jersey District Court, to a Massachusetts District Court, and to this Court, Respondents have repeatedly and summarily dismissed the Injunction's bearing on them and on their clients. They have done so despite the Injunction's plain language, clear construction, and self-evident application to their causes of action. The Court's Order enjoined the enforcement of the Final Rule, Respondents were acutely aware of the Court's Order, and Respondents sued to recover wages based on the enforcement of the Final Rule in violation of the Court's Order. Such disobedience mandates coercive action to ensure compliance with the Court's Order. Thus, the Court orders Respondents to withdraw their allegations, both individual and representative, concerning the enforcement of the Final Rule against Chipotle within seven days of this order. Furthermore, the Court affirms that the Court's Order (1) applies to Alvarez and to all proposed plaintiffs similarly situated to her and (2) bars her from enforcing the Final Rule on behalf of herself and on behalf of all others similarly situated to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Compensation for Chipotle's fees and expenses in their pursuit of contempt is also appropriate. \"Any attorney or other person admitted to conduct cases in any court of the United States or any Territory thereof who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201927\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining Counsel's liability for excessive costs).

In doing so, they recklessly disregarded a duty owed to the Court-the long-standing and elementary duty to obey its orders, including a nationwide injunction. In doing so, they pursued a claim that they should have known was unwarranted in fact or law. As mentioned earlier, Respondents uniquely claim that the Court's Order only enjoined the DOL's enforcement of the Final Rule but not the enforcement of the Final Rule itself. When asked to support this claim with precedent, they could not.
