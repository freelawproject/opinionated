First, Commerce applies what it refers to as the \"Cohen's d test,\" which measures the degree of price disparity between two groups of sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9. Commerce calculates the number of standard deviations by which the weighted-average net prices of U.S. sales for a particular purchaser, region, or time period (the \"test group\") differ from the weighted-average net prices of all other U.S. sales of comparable merchandise (the \"comparison group\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The result of this calculation is a coefficient.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   To arrive at the coefficient, Commerce divides the difference in the means of the net prices of the test group and comparison group by the pooled standard deviation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 n.68 (reproducing the formula). The coefficient is the number of standard deviations by which the weighted-average of the comparison group and the test group differ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Decision Memo at 19. A group of sales with a coefficient equal to or greater than 0.8 is said to \"pass\" the test, which signifies to Commerce that a significant\n   pattern of price differences exists within that group of sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ; Final Decision Memo at 9. Commerce then relies on the \"ratio test\" to measure the extent of significant price differences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 8. The \"ratio test\" compares the combined value of sales that passed the Cohen's d test with the value of all sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Decision Memo at 19-20. If the value of sales that passed the test accounts for 66% or more of a respondent's total sales, that indicates to Commerce that the pattern of significant price differences warrants application of the A-to-T method to all sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   However, if the value of sales that passed the Cohen's d test is less than 66%, but more than 33%, Commerce takes a hybrid approach, applying the A-to-T method to the sales that passed its Cohen's d test and applying the A-to-A method to all other sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Alternatively, Commerce will apply the A-to-A method to all sales if 33% or less of a respondent's total sales passed its Cohen's d test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. Finally, Commerce applies the \"meaningful difference\" test, pursuant to which Commerce evaluates whether the difference between the weighted-average dumping margins calculated by the A-to-A method is \"meaningfully\" different than the weighted-average dumping margins calculated by the A-to-T method.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Commerce's differential pricing analysis, as applied, constitutes a reasonable methodology for identifying patterns of prices that differ significantly and is therefore in accordance with law. As applied by Commerce, this tool measures \"the extent to which the net prices to a particular purchaser, region, or time period [i.e., the test group] differ significantly from the net prices of all other sales of comparable merchandise [i.e., the base or comparison group].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prelim. Decision Memo at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Further, it is reasonable for Commerce to apply its differential pricing analysis to determine whether a pattern exists for an individual exporter based on the exporter's purchasers, regions, or time period. The SAA specifically speaks to individual exporters' behavior that may result in masked targeted dumping and suggests that the methodology constructed by Commerce can look for patterns in individual exporter's actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAA at 843, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4178. Moreover, the SAA's explanation that \"Commerce will proceed on a case-by-case\" to determine whether the price differences are significant,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAA at 843, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4178, does not mandate that Commerce amend the test at every application. Instead, it is enough that the resulting methodology is able to detect differences of significant variances across a variety of cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Respondents claim that the SAA demonstrates Congress' intent for Commerce to \"tailor\" its analysis to the different industry or product under investigation\n   or review, and to not indiscriminately apply the same test across all cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Br. at 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Respondents point to nothing in the statute that requires Commerce to construct such a test. In this regard, the Respondents also argue that Commerce's determination is not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-30. However, the Respondents' arguments are derivative of their contrary to law challenges. Specifically, they argue that Commerce's final determination is not supported by substantial evidence because the statute requires Commerce to consider information regarding a specific product or industry in running the differential pricing analysis, and Commerce's analysis does not. Commerce, however, was not required to consider industry-wide information and the Respondents' argument does not demonstrate that what Commerce did was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Respondents also argue that Commerce's differential pricing analysis does not demonstrate that the price differences are of \"practical\" significance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Br. at 15-19. Specifically, the Respondents contend that the threshold categories of \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large\" are arbitrary because the differences they quantify are not informed by industry trends.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Here, the Respondents placed on the record, and addressed directly in their brief to the agency, documents evidencing volatilities in the shrimp and seafood prices in Vietnam.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   VASEP Submission of Factual Info. on Differential Pricing at Ex. 35, PD 274, bar code 3308867-05 (Sept. 25, 2015); VASEP Submission of Factual Info. on Differential Pricing at Exs. 37-42, 44-45, PD 276-77, bar codes 3308867-07-08 (Sept. 25, 2015); Case Br. [to the Agency] on Behalf of [the] Respondents at 29-33, PD 330, bar code 3463452-01 (Apr. 25, 2016). The Respondents contend that Commerce's failure to address industry-specific data rendered the agency unable to evaluate whether a coefficient of 0.8 or higher (Commerce's threshold for a \"large\" price difference) was practically significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Br. at 27-28. The Respondents' argument is unpersuasive because it assumes that Commerce is required to take into account pricing trends in the shrimp and seafood industries. However, as explained above, Commerce's application of the differential pricing analysis to individual exporters, without consideration of the industry at large, is a reasonable way of assessing whether a pattern of significant price differences exists.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Respondents argue that Commerce's methodology unreasonably focuses on internal variances within a respondent's prices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Br. at 13-15. To illustrate their argument, the Respondents provide three sets of numbers for which there is a standard deviation of 1.58, but which represent a 0.158%, 1.58%, and 15.8% deviation from the mean as to their respective number sets.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. The Respondents contend that Commerce's analysis \"completely overlook[s]\" such \"differences in magnitude.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In the final determination, Commerce explained that its differential pricing analysis is reasonable because it looks at price variances in the context of the two means.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 20. Specifically, Commerce explained that, \"[w]hen there is little variation in prices, then a small difference in the mean prices between the two groups may be significant where it would not be significant if the variation in prices were greater.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce's explanation addresses the Respondents' challenge. Commerce's methodology evaluates whether the price variance is significant as compared to the actual prices at issue, and not as compared to some other set of prices. The statute allows Commerce to look at individual pricing behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(d)(B)(1)(i). As a result, it is reasonable for Commerce to determine whether the price variance is significant relative to a respondent's own pricing behavior in the United States market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Respondents also argue that Commerce's exclusion of test group sales from\n   the comparison group sales is not in accordance with law because Commerce's methodology leads to distortions in the dumping comparison and alters what constitutes \"normal\" pricing behavior.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Br. at 31-35;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls. &amp; Pl.-Intervenor's Reply Supp. Rule 56.2 Mot. J. Agency R. at 5, Jan. 22, 2018, ECF No. 59 (\"Respondents' Reply\"). In the final determination, Commerce explained that including test group sales in the comparison group \"would result in the sales prices of purchasers, regions or time periods being compared to themselves.\" Final Decision Memo at 37. Commerce's explanation is reasonable. Respondents' argument presents an alternative methodology, but does not demonstrate that there is anything unreasonable with the way Commerce approaches the test and comparison groups.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Commerce did not rely upon the \"meetings and agreement\" as \"justification for rescinding the review of Minh Phu Group.\" The sole basis for rescinding the review was that rescission was sought by all the parties who had requested review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rescission\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Notice\n   </em>\n   , 81 Fed.

Instead, Commerce concluded that, \"because all parties that requested a review of the Minh Phu Group have withdrawn their requests, the Department is rescinding the review with respect to the Minh Phu Group ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The only decision that Mazzetta's argument implicates is Commerce's decision to extend the deadline to request rescission of the review. The rationale given by each of the parties seeking an extension, and by Commerce granting the extension was that \"[a] mutually satisfactory resolution of these disputes was not effectuated within 90 days of the date of publication of the notice of initiation of the requested review.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Rescission\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Notice\n   </em>\n   , 81 Fed.

The relevant factor, as stated by the parties seeking an extension to submit a request to rescind the review, and by Commerce in granting the extension, was the timing of the settlement at the WTO, not the resulting settlement's substance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The record is therefore complete as to why Commerce granted the parties' requests, and Mazzetta has failed to set forth facts to establish a reasonable basis for determining that the record is incomplete.

Calculation of the All-Others Rate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Mazzetta argues that, even if it was proper to rescind the review as to MPG, Commerce should have included MPG's rate from the preliminary determination in its calculation of the all-others rate, rather than basing the all-others rate solely on the rate calculated for Stapimex, the remaining respondent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mazzetta's Br. at 25-43. In an antidumping investigation or administrative review, if it is not \"practicable\" for Commerce to review or investigate each known exporter or producer, Commerce may limit its examination to a \"reasonable number of exporters or producers\" and determine weighted-average dumping margins only for those selected. 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2). The statute provides Commerce with two options for examination in such cases: it can either select \"exporters and producers accounting for the largest volume of the subject merchandise from the exporting country that can be reasonably examined,\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(B), or examine a statistically representative \"sample of exporters, producers, or types of products[.]\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2)(A). The SAA explains that when Commerce employs the latter sampling method, it will \"select the most representative sample at the early stages of the investigation or review,\" based on the information known to Commerce at that point in time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAA at 873, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4201 (emphasis omitted). By practice, Commerce calculates a rate for the separate rate applicants pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Albemarle Corp. &amp; Subsidiaries v.

Cir. 2016). Section 1673d(c)(5) provides a method to calculate the all-others rate and states that the all-others rate shall be the weighted average of the individually investigated exporter's and producer's dumping margins, excluding any margins that are de minimis, zero or determined entirely by application of an adverse inference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the final determination, Commerce explained its practice to assign to the separate rate respondents the all-others rate pursuant to 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final Decision Memo at 62-63. Here, following the rescission of the review as to MPG, only one mandatory respondent, Stapimex, remained under review. Commerce explained that, as neither 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(A) nor 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(1) address how Commerce is to calculate a rate for the separate rate respondents following either the rescission of a review or when only one mandatory respondent is examined, it followed its practice and assigned as the all-others rate the only remaining calculated rate that was neither de minimis nor the result of applying an adverse inference.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64. Further, Commerce explained that, prior to rescinding the review, it did not calculate a final dumping margin for MPG and only had before it MPG's sales and factors of production (\"FOP\") data that was collected and verified for the preliminary determination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. Accordingly, it assigned Stapimex's rate, the only remaining above de minimis rate, as the all-others rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 63-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Commerce reasonably based the all-others rate on the rate of the only remaining respondent in the review, Stapimex. Nothing in the statutory framework requires Commerce to calculate the all-others rate using multiple rates nor precludes Commerce from relying on just one rate. Mazzetta argues that, because 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c) and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(1)(B), (c)(5) consistently use the plural \"exporters\" and \"producers\" to refer to the individually investigated respondents, the all-others rate must be based on the rates of multiple respondents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mazzetta Br. at 26-27. Under the largest volume exception, however, Commerce may choose to investigate only one exporter or producer, in which case there would not be multiple established rates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677f-1(c)(2). The statute simply provides for the possibility of Commerce having multiple established rates at the end of a given investigation or review; it does not necessitate the calculation of an all-others rate using multiple respondents' rates at the end of every investigation or review. Further, the language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(B) that guides Commerce's actions when an established rate is zero, de minimis, or based entirely on an adverse inference, likewise uses the plural \"exporters and producers.\" It is nevertheless possible that, if any one or all three of those circumstances occur, Commerce can be left with only one respondent. Mazzetta's construction of the statute, however, would imply that Commerce could not rely on just one respondent's rate, while in fact the statute envisions cases when that may happen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mazzetta also argues that the statutory framework requires the resulting all-others rate to be representative, which requires it to be based on multiple rates, where available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mazzetta's Br. at 27-29. The all-others rate here is representative. As explained above, the SAA directs Commerce to narrow its review or investigation to respondents able to provide a representative sample.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAA at 872-73, 1994 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 4200-01. Mazzetta does not challenge the original selection of mandatory respondents for the tenth administrative review. It is not an unforeseeable occurrence for Commerce, at the end of an investigation or administrative review, to be left with only one respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The loss of a respondent does not automatically mean that the resulting all-others rate is not representative. If that was the case, the exception in 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1673d(c)(5)(B) would not exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

For the reasons that follow, the court sustains Commerce's surrogate value selections for head and shell byproduct and ice.

Although the Respondents claim that Commerce should not have defaulted to rejecting the Bangladeshi UN Comtrade Shell &amp; Head data for HTS 0508.00 over capping it because the byproduct value exceeded that of the whole,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Br. at 38, Commerce's decision to reject the data is within its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The Respondents also argue that Commerce did not adequately explain its reasoning for rejecting the Bangladeshi data.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Br. at 36-37;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Respondents' Reply at 20-22.
