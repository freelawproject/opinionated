MCFADDEN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Vantage Commodities Financial Services I, LLC won a multi-million dollar arbitration award against Assured Risk Transfer PCC, LLC, or ART. Now Vantage wants the money. Although the arbitration award represents the proceeds of a credit insurance policy that ART sold to Vantage, ART says it cannot pay by itself because it counted on help from reinsurance companies. And the companies that reinsured ART's liability under the insurance policy have refused to help. So Vantage has sued ART and the reinsurance companies. It has also sued Willis Limited, Willis Re Inc., and Willis Towers Watson Management (Vermont), Ltd.-related companies that Vantage says offered ART their services in captive insurance management and as reinsurance brokers and intermediaries. The reinsurance companies and the Willis companies have filed Motions to Dismiss. Because Vantage failed to establish the Court's personal jurisdiction over the reinsurance companies, their Motions to Dismiss will be granted. And because Vantage did not state a contract claim but has stated several negligence claims against the Willis Defendants, their Motion to Dismiss will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case began with a series of related financial transactions. First, Vantage extended $44 million in credit to an energy company. Compl. \u00b6 93. Second, ART insured Vantage against the risk that the energy company would default, up to $22 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Third, the Willis companies helped ART reinsure 90% of its liability by brokering reinsurance contracts with several other companies, including the seven reinsurance companies that are defendants here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then the energy company defaulted and went bankrupt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82, 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Vantage submitted proof of loss to ART to collect on its insurance policy, but ART denied the claim based on Vantage's purported failure to comply with a collateralization requirement in that policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 94. So Vantage presented its claim to an arbitration panel, which determined that Vantage had met its collateralization obligations and that ART owed Vantage $22 million in damages, plus several million in interest and costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 136. The Supreme Court of New York confirmed the award in the amount of $26,288,351.80\n   plus post-judgment interest that continues to accrue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Vantage has not received the funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. ART told Vantage that the only assets it has to pay the judgment are a $2.2 million letter of credit and its reinsurance policies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 134. And the Reinsurer Defendants have refused to pay ART, claiming that ART and the Willis companies violated the terms of the reinsurance agreements by failing to provide them prompt notice of Vantage's loss.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139-142. The Reinsurer Defendants have also rebuffed Vantage's efforts to collect, claiming that Vantage has no contractual right to demand payment directly from them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 150.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vantage has now turned to federal court, filing a Complaint that names ART, the seven Reinsurer Defendants, and the three Willis companies as defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vantage asserts breach of contract claims against the Reinsurer Defendants and asks the Court for declaratory judgment establishing their contractual obligations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 152-54, 162. It also asserts breach of contract and negligence claims against the Willis Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 163-187.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Reinsurer Defendants have filed two Motions to Dismiss, and the Willis Defendants have filed one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court Cannot Exercise Personal Jurisdiction Over the Reinsurer Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   To hear a claim against a defendant, a court must have personal jurisdiction over that defendant. There are three requirements for a court to exercise personal jurisdiction. First, the state's long-arm statute must reach the defendant.\n   <em>\n    GTE New Media Servs. Inc. v.

The District of Columbia's Long-Arm Statute Reaches the Reinsurers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The District of Columbia's long-arm statute authorizes courts to \"exercise personal jurisdiction over a person, who acts directly or by an agent, as to a claim for relief arising from the person's ... transacting any business in the District of Columbia.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">\n    D.C. Code \u00a7 13-423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). It also authorizes jurisdiction over persons defending against claims that arise from \"contracting to insure or act as surety for or on any person, property, or risk, contract, obligation, or agreement located, executed, or to be performed within the District of Columbia at the time of contracting, unless the parties otherwise provide in writing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">\n    D.C.

Pl.'s Opp. to Reinsurer Defs.' Mots. Dismiss 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the insurance prong of the statute, Vantage correctly observes that the Reinsurer Defendants contracted to insure ART, a legal person located in the District of Columbia at the time of contracting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2013-423\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Reinsurer Defendants do not contest this. Instead, they claim they are beyond the reach of the long-arm statute because Vantage cannot assert rights under their contracts with ART and so can make no claim arising from those contracts. Memo.

Dismiss) 14; Reply ISO First Reinsurer Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 5-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   But this argument goes to the merits rather than to jurisdiction. And in any case, the long-arm's \"arising from\" requirement is satisfied \"when the claim has a discernible relationship\" to the District-related activity.\n   <em>\n    IMark Mktg. Servs., LLC v.

Here, Vantage's claim against the reinsurers has a clear relationship to the reinsurers' contracts with ART. It therefore arises from the Reinsurer Defendants' contracts to insure a person in the District and falls within the scope of the District's long-arm statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Alternatively, this Court has jurisdiction under the \"transacting any business\" prong of the statute for the reasons explained in the due process analysis below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson Hine, LLP v.

First, they argue that the Complaint does not satisfy the heightened pleading requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), which requires a statement of the \"time, place and content of the false misrepresentations, the fact misrepresented and what was retained or given up as a consequence of the fraud, as well as the individuals involved.\" Willis Defs.'

Most important, the Complaint alleges that Willis Captive Management employee Aiden Kelly signed credit insurance binders on December 28, 2012 and August 19, 2013, representing to Vantage that the reinsurance policies ceded ART's liability \"on the same terms, conditions, and settlements as the original\n   policy.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47, 51, 183.

Relatedly, the Complaint alleges that the Willis Defendants failed to disclose to Vantage that the reinsurance agreements contained terms that conflicted with the representations in the credit insurance binders, so that a loss covered under the insurance policy might not be recoverable by Vantage from the reinsurers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 165, 170, 179, 183.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Complaint alleges that Vantage would have tried to insure its risk in other ways except that it reasonably relied on these affirmative misrepresentations and misrepresentations by omission, as the Willis Defendants intended it to do.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54, 186.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   These allegations are inadequate in three ways, according to the Willis Defendants.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , they claim that the statements in the credit insurance binders are not attributable to Willis Captive Management because Mr. Kelly signed them as ART's representative and that the statements have even less connection to the other Willis Defendants. Reply ISO Willis Defs.' Mot. Dismiss 15-16.
