Its business is highly seasonal in nature, with the majority of its sales occurring during the September through December timeframe. (\n  <em>\n   Id.\n  </em>\n  at \u00b6 25). Mattel's securities are listed and actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange, a highly efficient stock market.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 1). He alleges that he purchased Mattel securities at artificially inflated prices during the Class Period and suffered damages as a result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sinclair was Mattel's Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") until February 2017, when he resigned as CEO and became Executive Chairman of Mattel's Board of Directors.

Mattel's Cycle of Seasonally Overselling Inventory to Retailers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the years leading up to the Class Period, Mattel began a downward trend in\n   performance relative to its competitors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26). From 2013 to 2015, Mattel's profit margin declined from 18% to 9.5%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). This decline was the result of deteriorating sales and gross margins as well as higher promotional spending levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mattel had fallen into a cycle of first overselling to retailers in an attempt to meet end-of-year sales targets and then offering concessions to retailers to make up for the inventory the retailers could not sell to consumers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 96-97). To make matters worse, in 2015 Mattel lost the global rights to produce and sell toys based on Disney Princess\u00ae characters to its main competitor, Hasbro. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 4, 98, 102, 117). This was a major loss for Mattel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sinclair and Dickson took control of Mattel's management in the spring of 2015 with the goal of improving Mattel's business. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27). After the loss of the Disney Princess line of fashion dolls, Mattel set lower financial targets for 2015 but adopted a more bullish approach for 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 102). As it had done in years past, Mattel offered generous incentives for retail customers to boost sales during the year-end holiday season, while giving retailers permission to sell products at a steep discount after the holiday season. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 106, 113, 115-19). Mattel told its retail customers that they would not be forced to keep excess inventory, and that Mattel would take it back in 2017 if it would not sell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Mattel put pressure on employees to enact this strategy, in part because upper management bonuses were calculated based on inventory levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 112, 114).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Q3 2016 Results\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Mattel's October 19, 2016 Press Release\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the market closed on October 19, 2016, Mattel issued a press release announcing that for the financial quarter ending September 30, 2016 (\"Q3 2016\"), its worldwide net sales were up 2% year-over-year, on a constant currency basis, and its operating income had increased 5.5% over the comparable prior-year period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' October 20, 2016 Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The day after the October 19, 2016 press release, Defendants made various statements about the outlook for Q4 2016 that were optimistic but excluded important information about Defendants' aggressive efforts to boost sales to retailers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45-46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For example, Sinclair commented on Mattel's Q4 2016 outlook, saying \"while we still have a critical fourth quarter to execute, we remain broadly on track to deliver our full-year outlook.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38). Later, Sinclair held a conference call with securities analysts and investors to discuss Q3 2016 operating results, and stated \"[w]e were especially encouraged by the momentum of our top line where our positive consumer takeaway [sales] is aligning nicely with [Mattel's] shipping. This increases our confidence as we get set for the holiday season and as we look to deliver on our challenging 2016 top-line objectives.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39). Dickson and Farr made similar, optimistic statements on this call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 40-43).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Following these statements, Mattel's stock rose more than 6%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Mattel's October 27, 2018 SEC Filings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 27, 2016, Mattel filed its Form 10-Q with the SEC for Q3 2016 (the \"Q3 Form 10-Q\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 48). This form stated that \"[t]here have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed ... in Mattel's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10K\" and that Mattel's disclosure controls were operating effectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Q3 Form 10-Q also contained Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"Sarbanes Oxley\") certifications on Mattel's disclosure controls and procedures from Sinclair and Farr. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51). The Q3 Form 10-Q noted that it \"does not include sales adjustments such as trade discounts and other allowances in the calculation of segment revenues.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Defendants' November 3, 2016 Analyst Day Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 3, 2016, Defendants conducted a presentation and question and answer session with investors and securities analysts for Mattel's 2016 Analyst Day (\"Analyst Day\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 54). As part of Analyst Day, Sinclair, Dickson, Farr made various positive statements about Mattel's financial condition, and projected positive performance for Mattel in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 54-61).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Q4 2016 Results\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Defendants' January 25, 2017 Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Mattel announced its Q4 2016 and year-end results in a press release on January 25, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 31, 62). Mattel reported that, on a year-over-year basis, worldwide net sales declined by 8% to $1.83 billion, gross margins declined by 14% to 47.0%, and operating income declined by 11% to $262.6 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 63). The press release pointed to several factors to explain these results, including \"a significant U.S. toy category slowdown in the holiday period\" and foreign currency issues which \"triggered elevated retail promotional activity and decreased shipping. All of which had a significant impact on [Mattel's] gross margin.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Later that day, Defendants held a conference call with analysts and investors (\"Q4 conference call\") to discuss Mattel's disappointing Q4 2016 and year-end financial results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 64). During this call, Sinclair stated that Mattel's gross margins were \"significantly impacted by elevated sales adjustments and by heavier discounting\" and that high levels of sales adjustments and discounting were necessary to liquidate excess inventory in the retail channel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants characterized retail inventory levels as being \"moderately\" elevated, and explained that such inventory was within \"a manageable range.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 69). For example, when asked about when Mattel would normalize inventory levels, Sinclair responded that he expected Mattel would \"be in pretty decent shape on inventory as we get through the first quarter, and it's really in pockets. So this is not a horrendous issue at this point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 70). Farr also stated that \"we'll work through the extra inventory quickly, and I don't think we have to discount it.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In response to these statements, the price of Mattel stock fell $5.57 per share on heavy trading volume to close at $25.99 per share on January 26, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    2. On January 30, 2017 Moody's Places Mattel's Credit On Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Moody's put Mattel's credit on review for downgrade citing discounting at retail that contributed to narrow profit margins and lower cash flow. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 73). Mattel's stock price declined in response to Moody's announcement from $25.43 per share on January 27, 2017 to $25.27 per share on January 30, 2017, with further declines in the following days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. February 17, 2017 Toy Fair Conference Call\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On February 17, 2017, Mattel held a conference call with securities analysists and investors as part of its \"Toy Fair.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 75). During the call, Farr stated that \"[w]e expect first quarter revenues to be [down] mid to high single digits as a result\n   of the elevated retail inventory at year-end 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Also during the call, Steven Totzke, Mattel's Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial officer, represented to investors that he receives \"live feedback\" on the state of Mattel's inventory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 77).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Mattel's stock price declined in response to this conference call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 76). From a closing price of $25.43 per share on February 17, 2017 (Friday), Mattel's stock price fell to $25.13 on February 21, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    4. February 21, 2017 Toy Fair Q &amp; A Session\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On February 21, 2017, Mattel held a question and answer session with securities analysts and investors as part of the Toy Fair conference. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 78). Sinclair recognized the poor results of Q4 2015, stating that Mattel \"clearly ... had a difficult fourth quarter and we are disappointed in the results, which we found to be more difficult than anticipated.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He explained that these results were due to a combination of \"discounting to support shipping ... to move product off of retail\" as well as the deterioration of the Euro and Mexican Peso following the November 2016 elections in the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In response to an inquiry regarding the state of the European markets, Sinclair stated that \"on balance ... I think we came out in Europe in reasonably good shape. Our trends were good. Our business there is fairly healthy in terms of inventory.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Mattel's February 23, 2017 SEC Filing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On February 23, 2017, Mattel filed a Form 10-K with the SEC for the year ending in December 31, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 81). This form was signed by Sinclair, Farr, and Johnson. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) It contained various risk factors and represented that Mattel's disclosure controls were operating effectively. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 81-84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Defendants' April 20, 2017 Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On April 20, 2017, Mattel issued a press release announcing its financial results, for the quarter ending March 31, 2017 (\"Q1 2017\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 87). In this press release, Mattel reported a drop in worldwide net sales and gross margin for Q1 2017, and that its operating loss had increased by more than 158% to $127.0 million from $49.1 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   These results were worse than Wall Street analysts had anticipated and what Defendants had predicted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 91). Mattel's newly appointed CEO, Margaret Georgiadis explained that \"[o]ur Q1 results were below our expectations due to the retail inventory overhang coming out of the holiday period,\" but she remained optimistic that \"[Mattel] [has] worked through the majority of this overhang\" and \"see[s] a clear runway to improving growth and profitability over time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 89). In a subsequent conference call, Farr stated that Mattel did not expect \"the prolonged impact from the retail inventory overhang and the resulting slower pace of reorders by retailers\" particularly in North America and Europe. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 90).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In response to these statements, the price of Mattel stock fell nearly 14%, or $3.42 per share, on heavy trading volume to close at $21.79 per share on April 21, 2017.

Totzke's February 17, 2017 Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The statements made by Totzke that are included in the Consolidated Complaint were made at the February 17, 2017 Mattel, Inc. Toy Fair Presentation. (Doc. No. 50, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 77, 94;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   , Doc. No. 56-13). Totzke was asked to speak for his \"observations about the industry, the retail environment, the evolution of the shopper and the selling process\" for about ten minutes. (Doc. No. 56-13 at 20). In these brief remarks, Totzke stated that \"[t]he most visible report card reflecting retail execution is still space, shelf space, promotional space and the stock levels in that space.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22). Addressing this point, he mentioned that \"since the invention of the camera phone, I get a lot of live feedback on the state of our space, and our product placement and our inventory levels. I get comments from my customers, from my brand managers, from my boss, even from many of you.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Doc. No. 50, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 77, 94). Plaintiff alleges that these statements \"support[ ] the conclusion that defendants knew of the level of Mattel's products in the retail channel prior to and during the Class Period.\" (Doc. No. 50, \u00b6 94). The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As Defendants point out, Totzke's fleeting reference to receiving updates on his \"camera phone\" and receiving \"comments\" from such a varied mix of sources suggests that the information he received regarding inventory levels was anecdotal and informal. (Doc. No. 55-1 at 24). Plaintiff's Complaint does not allege additional facts that would support an inference that Totzke received anything more than anecdotal information about Mattel's retail inventory levels, that he communicated such information\n   to Defendants during the Class Period, or that the nature of his position involved communicating such information to Defendants in advance of Defendants' allegedly misleading disclosures. The Court finds that Plaintiff's interpretation of Totzke's remarks are not as \"cogent and at least as compelling as [Defendants'] opposing inference.\"\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v.

According to Plaintiff's Complaint, FE1 is \"a former Mattel Senior Vice President of Global Brands from October 2014 through October 2016\" who was \"responsible for developing product lines, marketing strategies and distribution plans for several of Mattel's brands.\" (Doc. No. 50 at \u00b6 95). FE2 is alleged to be a \"Senior Customer Marketing Analyst for Mattel from February 2016 to August 2017\" who \"helped develop promotional plans for Mattel brands sold at Target retail outlets.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 106). FE3 was \"Mattel's former Senior Vice President and Chief Information Officer from August 2007 to June 2017\" who \"was responsible for Mattel's information technology services.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 111).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Plaintiff's allegations must also indicate that each confidential witness had personal knowledge that would support an inference of scienter, however. The Court finds that Plaintiff has failed in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   First, Defendants argue that the Court should disregard Plaintiff's allegations related to FE1, since FE1 worked in a different office from Defendants and worked on marketing, not sales. (Doc. No. 55-1 at 26). Plaintiff's allegations regarding FE1 tell a different story, however. The Consolidated Complaint indicates FE1 had direct communications with Defendants during the course of his employment. For example, Plaintiff has alleged that FE1 presented an analysis to Defendant Farr on the topic of Mattel's pattern of selling too much product to retailers who later demanded concessions to make up for the resulting shortfall. (Doc. No. 50 at \u00b6 96). Plaintiff's allegations also make clear FE1's job duties required knowledge of Mattel's retail sales and inventory levels. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 95 (\"In the course of his employment, FE1 would routinely speak with representatives of Mattel's major retailers to inquire about retail sales, margins, and promotional activities.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   (\"FE1 had several conversation with Mattel's sales team during his employment, including several meetings each year attended by Mattel's sales team and led by Totzke to discuss sales for the current year and strategies and expectations for sales the following year and into the future.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 101 (FE1 stating that he \"knew precisely how much inventory is in every retailer\" from weekly and monthly point of sale reports) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Despite FE1's access to pertinent information and his direct communication with Defendant Farr, Plaintiff's allegations indicate FE1 left Mattel in October 2016-before the Class Period. (Doc. No. 50 at \u00b6 95). Accordingly, FE1 could not have personal knowledge of the retail inventory levels at the time Defendants' allegedly false statements were made. Since Plaintiff's theory of the case is that Defendants misled investors about unusually high levels of retailer inventory during the Class Period, Plaintiff's allegations regarding FE1 do not support an inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zucco Partners, LLC v.

Although FE2 was employed by Mattel during the Class Period, Plaintiff's description of FE2's role within Mattel indicates she was a relatively junior marketing analyst who focused entirely on one large client of Mattel, Target. (Doc. No. 50 at \u00b6 105). Plaintiff's allegations do not support an inference that FE2 had access to global retail inventory levels that would give FE2 knowledge that Mattel had unusually high levels of retail inventory during the Class Period. Also, since Plaintiff does not allege that FE2 had any meaningful contact with Defendants, the allegations related to FE2 do not support an inference that Defendants had any knowledge of the same inventory reports to which FE2 had access. FE2 was \"simply not positioned to know the information alleged\" to raise a strong inference of scienter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zucco Partners, LLC v.

Although FE3 is alleged to have more direct contact with Defendants than FE2, FE3's role within Mattel was in information technology, not sales or marketing. (Doc. No. 50 at \u00b6 111). While FE3 may have had access to the \"systems that managed Mattel's inventory and manufacturing,\" Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts to permit the inference that FE3 had personal knowledge of Mattel's retail inventory levels during the Class Period, let alone that he communicated such knowledge to Defendants. FE3's allegations regarding the bonus structure for upper-level management, the timing of discounts offered to retailers, knowledge of Defendants' access to sales and inventory data, and knowledge of the financial state of the company lack credibility since these issues appear to be well outside FE3's job description, and are instead based instead upon hearsay and conjecture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As described above, Plaintiff has failed to allege that the confidential witnesses FE1, FE2, and FE3 had the requisite personal knowledge to raise a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Changes in Mattel's Management\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that changes in Mattel's management support an inference of scienter. In particular, Plaintiff points to the replacement of Sinclair as CEO in February 2017 and the resignation of Farr as CFO in July 2017. (Doc. No. 50 at \u00b6 120). Plaintiff states that these changes \"in management [were] significant\" and since they \"occurred immediately following the disclosures concerning Mattel's inventory, [they] suggest[ ] that Sinclair and Farr were in fact fired in connection with their material misrepresentations and fraudulent conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Defendants outline why these allegations are insufficient to establish scienter. (Doc. No. 55-1 at 27-28). Plaintiff offers no response in his opposition to these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   As explained by Defendant, Sinclair may have been replaced as Mattel's CEO, but he stayed with Mattel as its Executive Chairman of Mattel's Board of Directors. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 56-14 at 3 (\"In connection with the appointment of Ms. Georgiadis as CEO, effective as of February 8, 2017, Christopher A. Sinclair will resign from his role as [Mattel's] CEO and will serve as Executive Chairman of the Board.\"). This continuing role at Mattel is inconsistent with a finding that Sinclair was fired for conducting a fraudulent securities scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re NVIDIA Corp. Sec. Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265288\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/1046/#p1052\">\n    768 F.3d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1063 (9th Cir. 2014) (holding that the departures of executives did not support an inference of scienter because two of the three executives remained at the company in an advisory role). Plaintiff's position is further undermined by the generosity of the compensation package given to Sinclair, which included an annual base salary of $1,000,000 and the majority of the benefits he enjoyed as CEO. (Doc. No. 56-14 at 5).

This is narrower than the law requires, however. In the Ninth Circuit's most recent articulation of the test for \"loss causation\", a plaintiff need not plead loss causation based on a revelation of fraud to the marketplace.
