Defendant Pomilla\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   U.S. Underwriters maintains that Pomilla has been properly named as a defendant in this action because there is a justiciable case or controversy between them, thus satisfying the subject matter jurisdiction requirement of The Declaratory Judgment Act. (Pl.'s Mem. at 2-7.) Specifically, U.S. Underwriters argues that Pomilla, as the plaintiff in the Underlying Action, \"seeks to recover under the Policy in that he has asserted claims against Bangiyev, [who] in turn claims that if [sic] he [is] [liable] to Pomilla, that liability should be paid by Orion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) As a result, U.S. Underwriters contends that Pomilla ultimately has an interest in the Court's determination regarding the \"interpretation and/or rescission of the Policy,\" because \"[i]f the Policy does not cover the subject-matter of the [Underlying Action] or if the Policy is rescinded, then Pomilla ... [who] seek[s] recovery from Orion ... would be denied that source of recovery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Plaintiff's argument is attenuated, at best.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In the Underlying Action, Pomilla filed a complaint against Bangiyev and the other individuals and entities allegedly responsible for the demolition and construction on the Property. (Pomilla Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.) None of these defendants are insured by U.S. Underwriters. Indeed, Orion, the only party insured by U.S. Underwriters, became a party in the Underlying Action solely as a result of the third-party claim initiated by Bangiyev. If there is no pending claim between Pomilla and Orion, it cannot be said that Pomilla seeks to recover under the Policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nonetheless, U.S. Underwriters maintains that on these facts the Court can find an actual case and controversy. To buttress this contention, U.S. Underwriters\n   refers the Court to a host of cases where courts have found an actual case or controversy to exist between an injured party and an insured. A review of those cases reveals that they each involved underlying actions where an injured party sued an insured party or the injured party filed an insurance claim with the insured.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gov't Emps.

Such is not the case here. Again, Pomilla has not initiated any claims against U.S. Underwriters or any of its insureds, nor has Pomilla filed any claims with U.S. Underwriters seeking to otherwise recover for his injuries under the Policy. There is simply no factual predicate upon which the Court can determine the existence of a case or controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   U.S. Underwriters insists that pursuant to New York Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 Pomilla could initiate a suit against U.S. Underwriters, if Pomilla obtains a judgment in the Underlying Action and if Orion does not satisfy the judgment, thus creating a case or controversy between them. (Pl.'s Mem. at 6.) The Court disagrees. New York Insurance Law \u00a7 3420 permits an injured party, who has obtained a judgment against an insured, to maintain an action against the insurer to recover the amount of the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Ins.%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n    N.Y.

Pomilla is not seeking a judgment against any U.S. Underwriters insured.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) U.S. Underwriters likewise contends that Bangiyev has an \"interest in recovery from Orion (and therefore from the Policy and from U.S. Underwriters).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Generally, claims involving indemnification obligations are not justiciable until liability has been imposed upon the party to be indemnified.\n   <em>\n    FSP, Inc. v.

Furthermore, as U.S. Underwriters notes, the Bayot Defendants have not yet asserted any claims against Orion in the Underlying Action. (Pl.'s Mem. at 2.) In other words, not only is the issue of liability against Bangiyev unresolved, it is also unclear whether Orion will ever have to face a claim for indemnification by the Bayot Defendants.

Here, the complaint alleges that Plaintiff issued the Policy to Orion. (Compl. \u00b6 16.) The complaint is devoid of any allegation that Pomilla, the Bayot Defendants, or Bangiyev are covered under the Policy thereby creating the requisite contractual relationship that would ordinarily trigger a duty to\n   defend. Particularly problematic, the complaint does not contain any allegation that these Defendants dispute whether they are entitled to a defense. In other words, as to Pomilla, the Bayot Defendants, and Bangiyev, there is simply no identifiable dispute. Where there is no indication that the theory on which a plaintiff seeks declaratory judgment is in dispute between the parties, an actual controversy does not exist.\n   <em>\n    United Fin. Cas.
