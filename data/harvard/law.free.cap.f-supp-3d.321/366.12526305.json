Weinstein, Senior United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendant's motion to reconsider the court's March 6, 2018 Memorandum and Order (\"Order\") denying defendant's motion to dismiss was heard on July 9, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 99. Defendant challenges the court's ruling that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\")'s broad\n   statutory authority, Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1), and regulatory authority, Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.1\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180.1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , extends to fraud in derivatives markets and underlying spot markets.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180.1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Upon reconsideration, defendant's motion to dismiss is denied; no valid basis for a change in the Order has been offered. The court has considered all papers filed before and after March 6, 2018, including all supplemental materials to defendant's motion to reconsider (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 69, 75, 87, 89, 90, 116; July 9, 2018 Hr'g Def. Ex. A), and finds that the Order should not be modified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant's motion is procedurally deficient. The decision relied upon by the defendant,\n   <em>\n    Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n v. Monex Credit Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. SACV 17-01868 JVS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202306863\">\n    2018 WL 2306863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (C.D. Cal. May 1, 2018), is not binding authority that mandates reconsideration. Local Civil Rule 6.3 (memorandum accompanying notice of motion must set \"forth concisely the matters or\n   <em>\n    controlling decisions\n   </em>\n   which counsel believes the court has overlooked.\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11926073\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/255/#p257\">\n    70 F.3d 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 257 (2d Cir. 1995) (\"The standard for granting such a motion is strict, and reconsideration will generally be denied unless the moving party can point to controlling decisions or data that the court overlooked-matters, in other words, that might reasonably be expected to alter the conclusion reached by the court.\");\n   <em>\n    Nielsen v. New York City Dep't of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-CV-2182 (NGG),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%202743678\">\n    2007 WL 2743678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (\"The applicable standard is strict in order to dissuade repetitive arguments on issues that have already been considered fully by the court.\"). Defendant's motion is also untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Local Civil Rule 6.3 (\"A notice of motion for reconsideration or reargument of a court order determining a motion shall be served within fourteen (14) days after the entry of the court's determination of the original motion ...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Notwithstanding these procedural defects, the court has given consideration to the substance of defendant's motion for reconsideration. Defendant makes two primary arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   First, he argues that the \"actual delivery exception\" in Section 2(c)(2)(D) of the Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(D), bars enforcement of the Commodities Exchange Act (\"Act\") against the defendants. The \"actual delivery exception\" applies to certain transactions entered into on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis. Because CFTC's complaint never alleged any transactions entered into on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis, this exception was-and remains-irrelevant to the court's prior decision. Nonetheless, the \"actual delivery exception\" does not bar enforcement of commodity fraud in violation of Section 6(c)(1) of the Act, Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monex Credit Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202306863\">\n    2018 WL 2306863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 ('By its plain language, \u00a7 6(c)(1) applies broadly \"to any swap, or a contract of sale of any commodity in interstate commerce.' ... Thus, it is not similarly limited to transactions regulated by the CEA.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, defendant, relying on\n   <em>\n    Monex\n   </em>\n   , argues that the action should be dismissed because it is absent any claims specifying \"fraud-based manipulation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monex Credit Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202306863\">\n    2018 WL 2306863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10. The district court in\n   <em>\n    Monex\n   </em>\n   found that Title\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) only protects against fraud where \"a particular commodity transaction manipulates or potentially manipulates the derivatives market.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    at *8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Monex\n   </em>\n   took note of this court's Order and distinguished it based on non-substantive grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    at *10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This court has fully considered\n   <em>\n    Monex\n   </em>\n   and reaches a different conclusion.
