Gorton, United States District Judge\n   This case involves seven consolidated actions brought by various taxi medallion holders in the Greater Boston area (\"plaintiffs\"). Plaintiffs allege that Uber Technologies, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Raiser, LLC (\"Uber\" or \"defendant\") competed unlawfully in the on-demand, ride-hail ground transportation market in and around Boston, Massachusetts. More particularly, plaintiffs complain that the subject competition 1) violates the common law and the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, 2) violates state and federal antitrust law and 3) amounts to a civil conspiracy and the aiding and abetting of unfair competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the Court is defendant's motion to dismiss the amended antitrust claims in the\n   <em>\n    Malden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Dot Ave\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Max Luc\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taxi Maintenance\n   </em>\n   amended complaints (Docket No. 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Uber entered the Boston market for private transportation services in 2011 and launched its UberX service in 2013. The company provides a digital tool for requesting private vehicles-for-hire by users who download Uber's free \"smart phone application\" (\"the Uber app\"). Users who open the Uber app on their mobile phones are shown a map of their location or designated pick-up point and the available Uber-affiliated vehicles in that vicinity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   This litigation involves seven groups of plaintiffs that represent over 800 taxi companies in the Greater Boston area. The seven complaints were filed in this district between December, 2016, and April, 2017. The Court consolidated the cases pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a)(2) in October, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malden Transportation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Uber Techs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CV 16-12538-NMG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%206759425\">\n    2017 WL 6759425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.

The Court held that plaintiffs had stated claims for 1) unfair competition under the common law and the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, M.G.L. c. 93A, 2) aiding and abetting unfair competition and 3) civil conspiracy to commit unfair competition.

Plaintiffs generally state that Uber's intent to monopolize \"has been made clear\" through the statements of its former CEO and its advertising materials. However, the amended complaints do not include satisfactory examples of such statements. Finally, plaintiffs argue that the UberX price itself demonstrates specific intent. That argument lacks merit. Without an unlawful intent, \"increasing sales and increasing market share are normal business goals,\" not verboten practices.\n    <em>\n     U.S. Steel Corp.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Fortner Enterprises, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8075\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/610/\">\n     429 U.S. 610\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 612 n.1,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8075\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/610/\">\n     97 S.Ct. 861\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8075\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/610/\">\n     51 L.Ed.2d 80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1977). Low prices are a reasonable way to achieve those goals. No specific facts in the amended complaint demonstrate that Uber intended to obtain a monopoly in the Boston ride-hailing market.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Equally important, plaintiff fails to show an injury to Boston consumers. This omission is fatal because antitrust plaintiffs must show that \"defendants' actions caused an injury to\n    <em>\n     competition\n    </em>\n    , as distinguished from impact on themselves.\"\n    <em>\n     R.W.

According to plaintiff's complaint, Uber's entry caused the supply in the ride-hailing market to increase and the price to diminish. Those allegations fail to demonstrate an injury to competition.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Sullivan\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Football League\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530504\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/1091/#p1096\">\n     34 F.3d 1091\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1096 (1st Cir. 1994),\n    <em>\n     as amended on denial of reh'g\n    </em>\n    (Oct. 26, 1994) (\"Anticompetitive effects, more commonly referred to as injury to competition or harm to the competitive process, are usually measured by a reduction in output and an increase in prices in the relevant market.\") (internal quotation marks omitted) (citation omitted). A decrease in the value of Boston taxi medallions is immaterial. Plaintiffs' allegation that Uber discriminates against the poor and disabled is similarly irrelevant.
