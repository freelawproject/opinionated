Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"I wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school. I wish I could bake a cake filled with rainbows and smiles and everyone would eat and be happy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the circumstances leading to this case started out with rainbows and smiles, it wasn't that way for long; it was high school, after all. To be certain, it was October 16, 2015, the Friday of the annual \"Spirit Week\" at Chariho High School (\"CHS\"): a day marked by \"mayhem\" and \"school-sponsored bad decisions\" leading up to the \"big homecoming football game.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pls.' Second Am. Compl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 39, 41-43, ECF No. 41.) In years past, for example, the high school permitted \"actual hay and live animals\" to fill the halls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) The absence of live animals roaming the halls this year didn't make it any less of a zoo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The day began early with the morning procession. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) Senior students sporting togas and armed with silly string lined up outside and prepared to march through the halls while spraying each other and underclassman who occupied the halls in witness and participation of the fun-filled event. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 40-41, 46.) One such student populating the halls was Plaintiff, K.Z., a then-junior field-hockey player who donned her school spirit in her uniform. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37, 48-49.) K.Z., like many other students who watched the procession, came prepared with her own can of silly string. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As seniors paraded through the halls, K.Z., who had been standing among a group of friends on the right side of the hallway, sprayed her silly string in the air \"indiscriminately\" toward various other students passing her by. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 49, 53.) Many other students sprayed silly string, too, both through the air and directly at other students, including in their faces at close range. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54.) Silly string had been flying from all directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Still standing among her friends, K.Z. took aim at a group of toga-sporting students positioned some distance down and across the hallway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 50, 53, 60-66.) Her silly string rained down on a group of two or more girls, which included Defendant Rachel McGinley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-69.) While K.Z. had her back turned and still conversing with her friends, McGinley began sprinting toward her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 71-74.) With her cell phone in hand and her right arm raised over K.Z.'s head, McGinley used the hard edge of her phone to land several \"hammer blows\" to K.Z.'s head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.) K.Z. fell forward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) With her cell phone in tow, McGinley took a victory lap, laughing and smiling. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84.) K.Z., still confused and feeling head pain, struggled off to class, where she remained only shortly when Dean Bridgham called K.Z. to his office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-87.) When there, K.Z. had difficulty comprehending Dean Bridgham's comments, although K.Z. did understand that McGinley informed school officials that she had struck K.Z. in the head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) After asking very few questions, none of which concerned K.Z.'s wellbeing, Dean Bridgham sent K.Z. back to class. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 90-92.) K.Z. was called back to Dean Bridgham's office shortly after, where Principal Weber was also present.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 95-96.) After little questioning, Dean Bridgham informed K.Z. that she would face a one-day suspension for \"fighting (or instigating a fight)\" because the school concluded she had sprayed silly string in McGinley's face and called her a \"bitch.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-05, 111.) McGinley also received a one-day suspension for the same offense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Visibly shaken and deeply perturbed by the news of her suspension, K.Z. called her father, Plaintiff Mark Zell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115.) K.Z. was then directed to wait in another room where other students had been working. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.) While there, friends of McGinley taunted K.Z. for McGinley \"beat[ing] [her] up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118.) At about 11:00 a.m., Mr. Zell arrived at CHS and inquired whether anyone had evaluated K.Z. for a concussion, to which school officials agreed\n   \"would be a good idea.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 120-21.) The school nurse then evaluated K.Z. and immediately concluded K.Z. was likely concussed; a hospital confirmed that K.Z. had a \"serious concussion\" shortly thereafter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that evening, Mr. and Mrs. Zell visited the Richmond Police Department (\"PD\") to file a police report \"for the assault and battery of their minor daughter.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127.) An officer first told them that McGinley would be immediately arrested; however, without divulging its reasoning, the PD eventually informed Mr. and Mrs. Zell that the School Resource Officer would arrest McGinley at school the following Monday, and then that the PD would not arrest McGinley at all unless K.Z. was also arrested for \"Disorderly Conduct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 128-29, 132-33.) Mr. and Mrs. Zell pressed school officials as to why McGinley would not be arrested, and their response was consistent with the PD's statement that she could only be arrested for \"disorderly conduct\" if K.Z., too, was arrested. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 139-40.) Not satisfied with this response and because they feared \"unjustified criminal charges against K.Z.,\" Mr. and Mrs. Zell dropped criminal charges against McGinley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   From this point, however, Mr. and Mrs. Zell launched a vigorous challenge to the school's decision to suspend K.Z. First, while K.Z. was at home recovering for about six days, Mr. Zell appealed her suspension to Superintendent Ricci and \"wrote a detailed accounting of events as reported by K.Z., her friends, and the video.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 142-44.) Although Superintendent Ricci asked to speak with K.Z., he wrote his decision that upheld the suspension before ever speaking to her directly.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145, 147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs appealed the decision of Superintendent Ricci to the Committee. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 154.) At the Committee hearing on or around February 23, 2016, Defendant Attorney Anderson represented CRSD and Superintendent Ricci, \"prosecuting the upholding of K.Z.'s suspension.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 157, 167.) The hearing was conducted by another attorney for the Committee, who Superintendent Ricci hired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 167.) During Attorney Anderson's presentation, he argued that \"a cell phone is a teenage girl's most prized possession\" never to be used as a weapon despite knowing that McGinley indeed struck K.Z. with her cell phone, while only presenting portions of the video displaying the altercation between K.Z. and McGinley.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 168-70.) The attorney presiding over the Committee's hearing precluded Plaintiff from showing another video that allegedly displayed McGinley striking another student in the head with her cell phone on a school bus. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 173-74.) In a decision signed by Chairperson Louzon, the Committee upheld K.Z.'s suspension. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 180-81.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Following the Committee's decision, Plaintiffs hired present counsel and took\n   another appeal to RIDE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 182.) RIDE held a hearing in the summer of 2016, over which a RIDE Hearing Officer presided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 183, 192.) The hearing \"included two full days with over ten (10) witnesses\" and \"resulted in nearly a foot of transcripts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183.) One such witness was K.Z., who admitted to saying \"bitch\" after McGinley struck her head. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 185.) K.Z.'s former best friend, A. Doe, also testified that K.Z. \"yelled 'bitch' before spraying silly string\" at McGinley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184.) A. Doe, whose truthfulness was called into doubt at the RIDE hearing, also recalled that K.Z. had asked whether she should have sprayed McGinley before she did so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 186-87.) Dean Bridgham also \"explain[ed] that there was a lack of some needed policy or some related failure by the school district to handle the situation, including K.Z.'s concussion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 188.) Dean Bridgham explained that he notified Superintendent Ricci of this \"failure,\" but he was cutoff before continuing his testimony. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 189-92.) The RIDE hearing also included extensive cross examination by Plaintiffs of the various witnesses, and Plaintiffs also presented an expert witness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 194-95.) Despite the length of the hearing and the amount of witnesses produced, the decision that came out of the hearing was, to the Plaintiffs' way of thinking, \"shockingly short\" and omitted citation to much of Plaintiffs' evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During a break at the RIDE hearing, the Hearing Officer and Superintendent Ricci were witnessed alone in a room \"talking with the video playing as [Superintendent] Ricci pointed out parts of the video to the RIDE Hearing Officer ex parte.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 196.) This ex parte meeting was never authorized by or disclosed to Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 197.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nevertheless, Plaintiffs persisted. Viewing RIDE's decision as plagued with error (five specifically), (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 290-95), Plaintiffs appealed to the Council.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 200.) In preparation for their hearing, the Council received the full record encompassing \"nearly a foot-high stack of transcripts,\" Plaintiffs' forty-five page (single spaced) appeal brief infused with hundreds of record and legal citations and allegations of error, CRSD's eighteen-page opposition brief, and Plaintiffs' thirty-six-page reply brief. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 207-08.) After approximately a twenty-minute argument by Plaintiffs' counsel, \"a few comments by\" CRSD's attorney, and a brief, five-minute deliberation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Council delivered an oral decision upholding the decision below. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 209, 212.) The oral decision was followed by a five-page written decision on May 9, 2017, which affirmed K.Z.'s suspension and rejected each of Plaintiffs' five averments of error. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 214-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This eleven-count, forty-nine-page Complaint followed. And then came Defendants' various motions to dismiss. On February 1, 2018, the Court heard oral argument in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II. Legal Standard\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Court must \"accept the truth of all well-pleaded facts and draw all\n   reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader's favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Riggs v.

Indeed, it is baffling, based on how much process Plaintiff (and her parents) received, that she could, with a straight face, assert a procedural-due-process violation in this Court. The process Plaintiff received, as outlined by her complaint, was as follows. Dean Bridgham met with K.Z. with respect to the incident that Defendant McGinley brought to the attention of administration prior to making any discipline determination. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 87-89,\n   91-92.) Indeed, Dean Bridgham interviewed K.Z. twice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.) During the first meeting, Dean Bridgham informed K.Z. that McGinley had informed school officials that \"she had hit K.Z. in the head.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) Principal Weber was also present in at least one of Dean Bridgham's meetings with K.Z. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.) Then, Plaintiff was allowed to challenge her discipline in an appeal before Superintendent Ricci, who was provided with additional evidence including \"a detailed accounting of events as reported by K.Z., her friends, and the video\" composed by Mr. Zell. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144.) Plaintiff was then permitted another layer of process: an evidentiary hearing before the Committee, where she was represented by counsel, who questioned witnesses and presented evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 154, 168-74.) Plaintiff then participated in a hearing before the RIDE Hearing Officer, where more than ten witnesses (including an expert witness for Plaintiff) testified over the course of two full days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 183, 195.) The result of this hearing was nearly one foot of transcripts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 183.) But that's not all.

This claim is premised on Rhode Island's Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\"), R.I. Gen. Laws \u00a7 42-35-15, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 19).

Laws \u00a7 42-35-15(f). As a threshold matter, Count V of Plaintiff's complaint, directed solely at Defendants Council and CRSD, is not so related to Plaintiff's other claims to comprise part of the same case or controversy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Plaintiff's discrete, no-discovery state-court-administrative appeal of the Council's decision is better heard in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Similarly, the Court is not convinced that it should take supplemental jurisdiction over K.Z.'s claims against Defendant McGinley simply because they broadly flow from the same originating facts as Plaintiff's claims against the various \"school-related\" defendants, i.e., the altercation between Plaintiff and Defendant McGinley. The Court is not inclined to find that Plaintiff's purely state-law claims against Defendant McGinley, which solely arise from the events that occurred on October 16, 2015, comprise part of the same constitutional case as Plaintiff's constitutional and state-law claims against all other defendants, which entirely revolve around the way in which these latter defendants responded to the alleged altercation. None of Plaintiff's allegations that relate to what she alleges to be deficient process (i.e., the way in which the various school-related defendants handled and reviewed her one-day in-school suspension) have anything to do with Defendant McGinley (besides, of course, the fact that McGinley participated in the original altercation, which the Court deems insufficient). That Plaintiff brings the same types of state-law claims (i.e., negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and defamation) against both McGinley and the other defendants does not alter that conclusion. \u00a7 1367(c) counsels against taking supplemental jurisdiction over these claims; instead, \"[t]hey are best brought and decided in state court.\"\n   <em>\n    Kando v.

The parties all agree that these state-law claims are sufficiently intertwined with Plaintiff's federal constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Roche v. John Hancock Mut.

Accordingly, the analysis that follows considers Plaintiff's state-law claims in Counts IV, VII, VIII, IX, and X against the defendants implicated by those claims (except McGinley, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   2. Plaintiff's Remaining State-Law Claims\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   a.

Indeed, all Plaintiff offers on this score is a conclusory announcement that, \"[a]s a direct and proximate result of Defendants' acts and omissions, Plaintiffs were harmed by the breach of the standard of care and suffered the aforesaid damages.\" (Compl. \u00b6 329.) Without belaboring the point, \"[n]ot only has Plaintiff failed to plead the element[ ] ... with any specific facts, but Plaintiff's [causation] claims are the epitome of conclusory allegations.\"\n   <em>\n    Picard v.

Count IX\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For many of the same reasons outlined in Count VIII, Plaintiff suggests that Defendants Ricci, CRSD, and the Committee breached its duty of care to hire, train, supervise, and retain competent, properly qualified, and well-performing employees, servants, agents and/or contractors at CHS. Plaintiff's Count IX claim resembles Count VIII in a more fundamental way, though: it, too, does not approach the mark for stating a plausible claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiff's complaint suffers from an express flaw in that it alleges that \"Defendants are vicariously responsible and responsible for the acts and omissions of the Defendants' agents under the theory of respondeat superior.\" (Compl. \u00b6 338.) Yet, under Rhode Island law, \"liability for the harmful acts of employees is not premised on the doctrine of respondeat superior, but on a separate affirmative duty owed by the employer ....\"\n   <em>\n    Liu v.

Indeed, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has unambiguously pronounced, \"[T]he liability of an employer in the negligent supervision or hiring of an unfit employee is an entirely separate and distinct basis from the liability of an employer under the doctrine of respondeat superior.\"\n   <em>\n    Mainella v.

As a matter of law, Count IX fails to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   e.

'instigated a fight,' and that K.Z. committed\n   the crime of 'disorderly conduct,' ....\" (Compl. \u00b6 340.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Like so many others, Plaintiff's claim for defamation per se does not get off the ground. Defamation per se necessitates that \"the false statement must impute to the other: (1) a criminal offense, (2) a loathsome disease, (3) a matter incompatible with his business, trade, profession, or office, or (4) a serious sexual misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Marcil v.

The only remaining factual averment, that Defendants falsely stated K.Z. could be arrested for \"disorderly conduct,\" comes a little closer to alleging a plausible claim.

The only specific allegation the Court can glean from Plaintiff's complaint that references \"disorderly conduct\" concerns oral communications on October 21, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 138-40.) However, the applicable statute of limitations for slander-one year \"after the words are spoken\"-precludes such a claim because Plaintiff filed the complaint on June 6, 2017, well beyond one year from October 21.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Francis v.
