A DIIB sets forth the quantity of raw material allowed to be imported without deposit of import duties under a given DIIB and the quantity of export required to close the DIIB, i.e., to satisfy the export commitment requirements of the DIIB. When a DIIB has been closed, and the closure is approved by Turkish customs, then the DIIB holder is released of any liability for import duties otherwise payable on the entries under the DIIB. The final approval of DIIB closures is within the jurisdiction of the Turkish Foreign Trade ministry; the process is generally completed 3 to 4 years after submission of a closed DIIB for approval.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   When a Turkish company imports or exports goods, it files an entry or exit declaration, respectively, with Turkish Customs. Customs verifies the accuracy of such import and export declarations and inserts the finalized quantities, values, and related information, including DIIB numbers, into a Customs database. A holder of a DIIB can then query the Turkish Customs database, via an internet e-portal, to ascertain the import and export movements under its DIIBs.

Defendant describes the calculation used by Commerce in the following equation:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-40\">Input cost + rebated or forgiven duties -------------------------------------------= Per unit cost of the input, including its duty burden Quantity of all production using that input</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. Tos\u00e7elik argues that the Department's calculation is inconsistent with the statute and the agency's practice of computing exempted and rebated duties over total exports to the U.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. 17, 19. Because the statute contemplates a drawback on duties that are rebated or exempted \"by reason of\" the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States, Tos\u00e7elik contends that Commerce's calculation of the duty drawback adjustment is contrary to the statute's plain language in that the chosen methodology ignores the statute's textual linkage between the adjustment and the act of exporting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. For the following reasons, the court finds that Commerce calculated the amount of duty drawback adjustment not in accordance with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under its previous practice, Commerce divided the amount rebated or forgiven by the exported quantity to determine the duty burden borne by each unit of merchandise sold in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 13. This \"per unit\" amount was then added to the export price.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Commerce changed its practice in this case, and employed a \"duty neutral\" approach when calculating Tos\u00e7elik's duty drawback adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final I&amp;D Memo at 5. Commerce stated that it\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   continue[d] to find in these final results that where duty drawback inputs are\n   sourced from both domestic (Turkish) and foreign [Non-Turkish] sources, a calculation of duty drawback which is based on export volume results in an imbalance in the comparison of export price (EP) or constructed export price (CEP) with NV [normal value].... [T]his imbalance exists because the NV portion of the comparison reflects an average annual cost that reflects both foreign sourced inputs (which incur duties) and domestic inputs for which the Respondent incurs no duties. In contrast, on the EP/CEP side, the duty drawback adjustment to the USP [U.S. Price] employs a smaller denominator than that used on the NV side. As in\n   <em>\n    Rebar Trade\n   </em>\n   , we maintain that the combination of duties included within NV relative to what is included within USP, results in a larger per-unit U.S. sales adjustment than is imbedded within NV. This creates an imbalance in the comparison of the USP to NV.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (footnotes omitted). As a result of these findings, the Department \"based [its] duty drawback calculation on the per-unit costs\" within the cost of production database submitted by Tos\u00e7elik.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Defendant contends that Commerce's methodology is consistent with precedent, specifically\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 15. Defendant argues that the \"matching principle\" illustrated in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   instructs Commerce that export price, cost of production, and constructed value \"should all be increased together, or not at all.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (citing\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051352\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/1335/#p1338\">\n    635 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1342-43 ). The court disagrees with Defendant's reading of the case. The duty drawback regime at issue in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   was one based solely on exemptions. Because the duties in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   were exempted, they were not recorded in the respondent company's books as an expense incurred. Commerce therefore increased the company's cost of production (\"COP\") and constructed value (\"CV\"), which are both part of the Department's normal value calculation, to account for the duties presumably paid on inputs for products sold in the domestic market. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recognized that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [T]he entire purpose of increasing EP is to account for the fact that the import duty costs are reflected in NV (home market sales prices) but not in EP (sales prices in the United States). An import duty exemption granted only for exported merchandise has no effect on home market sales prices, so the duty exemption should have no effect on NV. Thus, because COP and CV are used in the NV calculation, COP and CV should be calculated as if there had been no import duty exemption. It would be illogical to increase EP to account for import duties that are purportedly reflected in NV, while simultaneously calculating NV based on a COP and CV that do not reflect those import duties. Under the \"matching principle,\" EP, COP, and CV should be increased together, or not at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051352\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/1335/#p1338\">\n    635 F.3d at 1342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Commerce adjusted EP in the\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   case to account for the duty drawback adjustment received by the respondent company, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluded that the subsequent adjustment to NV to reflect the duties paid on inputs for products sold in the home market was proper. The \"matching principle\" relates, therefore, to an adjustment to normal value with respect to the particular facts and recordkeeping practices presented in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   , and should not be expanded to encompass all duty drawback adjustment calculations made by Commerce. Here, the Parties do not allege deficiencies in Tos\u00e7elik's recordkeeping or in the normal value calculation with respect to duty drawback to warrant\n   application of the matching principle. When viewed in this context,\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   's matching principle does not support Commerce's methodology in the instant matter before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant argues further that Commerce's methodology is permitted under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 15. The statute allows for an upward adjustment to EP by \"the amount of any import duties imposed by the country of exportation which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B). Commerce's calculation in this case is inconsistent with the statute because allocating duty drawback to total production encompasses home market (Turkish) sales, which could not earn a duty drawback, and fails to adequately connect the adjustment to duties forgiven \"by reason of\" the products' exportation to the United States. By including costs associated with manufacturing goods sold in the domestic market, the Department's methodology lessens the upwards adjustment and conceptually reintroduces an imbalance in the dumping margin calculation. Commerce's method of calculating Tos\u00e7elik's duty drawback adjustment with respect to total production is inconsistent with and contravenes the plain language of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B). The court rejects Defendant's argument and concludes that Commerce's action is unreasonable and is not in accordance with the law, and remands Commerce's determination for further administrative proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Zekelman's Rule 56.2 Motion for Judgment on the Agency Record\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Commerce's Use of Actual Weight as Opposed to Theoretical Weight\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   When calculating Tos\u00e7elik's antidumping margin, Commerce utilized actual weight as opposed to theoretical weight, which is an estimated weight based on the products' dimensions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final I&amp;D Memo at 19. Zekelman argues that Commerce should have either requested that Tos\u00e7elik provide information on the basis of theoretical weight or converted Tos\u00e7elik's information into theoretical weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zekelman's Mot. 12-16. Zekelman further contends that Commerce's failure to explain why it did not take either action alone warrants a remand on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Contrary to Zekelman's arguments, the record supports the Department's decision. Commerce's questionnaire did not specify whether respondents should provide information in either actual or theoretical weight, but rather that respondents should use the \"same unit of measure\" to report sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section B-D Questionnaire Response of Tos\u00e7elik Profil ve Sac End\u00fcstrisi A.S. at 61, PD 75-76, bar code 3400035-01 (Sept. 28, 2015). Tos\u00e7elik prepared all databases for the Department on an actual-weight basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 62. In its supplemental questionnaire response, Tos\u00e7elik explained to the Department its belief that the use of theoretical weight in this case may introduce unwanted distortions into the calculations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Questionnaire Response of Tos\u00e7elik Profil ve Sac End\u00fcstrisi A.S. at 5-7, PD 115, bar code 3546873-01 (Mar. 28, 2016). Although Commerce recognized that it may consider utilizing only theoretical weight in future reviews, it explained that it would continue to use actual weight in the instant review because the respondent provided data in actual weight and had done so in previous administrative reviews.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final I&amp;D Memo at 19. Based on the information available in the record, it was reasonable for Commerce to calculate Tos\u00e7elik's antidumping margin on an actual-weight\n   basis. The court concludes that the Department's decision to calculate Tos\u00e7elik's antidumping margin on an actual-weight basis is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Commerce's Grant of a Circumstance of Sale Adjustment for Warehousing Expenses to Tos\u00e7elik\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Commerce granted Tos\u00e7elik a circumstance of sale adjustment for Tos\u00e7elik's warehousing expenses. Zekelman argues that Commerce's decision was unsupported by substantial evidence because Commerce failed to address contrary evidence on the record allegedly showing that Tos\u00e7elik overstated its warehousing expenses in its questionnaire responses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zekelman's Mot. 16-20. Zekelman contends further that Tos\u00e7elik's refusal to provide information relating to its warehousing expenses should have prompted the Department to apply facts otherwise available with an adverse inference under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-20. Zekelman requests that the court remand this issue so the Department can conduct a proper analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zekelman's Reply 5. The Government defends Commerce's grant of an adjustment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 25-27. For the following reasons, the court concludes that Commerce's decision to grant Tos\u00e7elik an adjustment for warehousing expenses was unsupported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As stated before, in an antidumping duty calculation, normal value represents the price at which the subject merchandise is sold in the exporting country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677b(a)(1)(A). When determining the appropriate price for comparison, Commerce may make certain price adjustments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1677b(a)(6).
