INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Adams Outdoor Advertising Limited Partnership (\"Adams\"), whose Amended Complaint focused on the Interchange Prohibition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   challenges the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's Outdoor Advertising Control Act of 1971, 36 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2718.101 - 2718.115 (the \"Act\").\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   Pa. Code \u00a7\u00a7 445.1-445.9. On February 9, 2018, this Court dismissed Adams's vagueness challenge regarding the 500-feet spacing requirement in the Interchange Prohibition, as well as Adams's substantive due process and equal protection claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claims that survived the Motion to Dismiss are Adams's claim that the Interchange Prohibition fails First Amendment scrutiny, the facial challenge to the Act under the First Amendment based on the absence of any time limits for PennDOT to act on applications for sign permits, and Adams's as-applied challenge under the First Amendment based on the one-year delay before PennDOT decided its permit application. Adams has filed a Motion for Reconsideration asking this Court to reconsider its ruling dismissing Adams's vagueness challenge. The parties have also filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, because Adams does not cite any justification for reconsideration of the decision on the Motion to Dismiss, the Motion for Reconsideration is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Summary judgment is granted in Adams's favor based on the lack of time limits in the Act, and the permit requirement in 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.107 is declared unconstitutional. The need for the existence of time limits in government issuance or denial of permit applications is based on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Freedman v.

UNDISPUTED FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Act was passed in 1971 to \"control the erection and maintenance of outdoor\n   advertising devices in areas adjacent to the interstate and primary systems.\" 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.102. The purpose of the Act is to \"assur[e] the reasonable, orderly and effective display of outdoor advertising while remaining consistent with the national policy to protect the public investment in the interstate and primary systems; to promote the welfare, convenience and recreational value of public travel; and to preserve natural beauty.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1525226\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/51/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Secretary of PennDOT is tasked with enforcing the Act and promulgating rules and regulations governing outdoor advertising devices. 36 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2718.106 - 2718.107. The current Secretary of PennDOT is Defendant Leslie S. Richards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Section 105(c)(2) of the Act contains restrictions, which must be \"strictly adhere[d] to\" by the secretary, on the spacing of outdoor advertising signs. 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.105(a), (c)(2). For sign structures \"outside the boundaries of cities of all classes and boroughs, no structure may be erected adjacent to or within five hundred feet of an interchange or safety rest area, measured along the interstate or limited access primary from the beginning or ending of pavement widening at the exit from or entrance to the main-traveled way.\" 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(i) (\"Interchange Prohibition\"). Since 1997, PennDOT has interpreted and applied the 500-feet spacing restriction in the Interchange Prohibition to both sides of a divided highway, meaning that a structure across from an interchange would be considered nonconforming if within 500 feet of the interchange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Ex. B, ECF No. 10 (\"1997 Strike-Off Letter\"). The Section further provides that \"for purposes of determining spacing requirements,\" \"[o]fficial\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 'on premise' signs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   as defined in section 131(c) of Title 23, United States Code, shall not be counted nor shall measurements be made from them.\" 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Adams \"is in the business of off-premise signs commonly referred to as billboards, ...

Arciszewski Dep. Ex. 3. On the west bound side of Route 22, across from the proposed sign location, is an interchange.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:17-20. The proposed sign would be within 500 feet of the interchange on the opposite side of Route 22.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58:13-20. Adams acknowledges that the location of its proposed sign would be nonconforming with the Act, as interpreted by the 1997 Strike-Off Letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:8-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Adams had acknowledged the nonconforming nature of its sign in July 2014, but contacted PennDOT in early 2015, prior to filing the application, to discuss the proposed sign.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:10-69:4. In March 2015, PennDOT advised Adams that the proposed location would not be permitted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64:19-65:6. Nevertheless, Adams continued to engage in discussions with PennDOT, which maintained its position that the sign location was nonconforming.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65:3-69:5. Adams threatened to file legal action, sending PennDOT a draft of the complaint later filed in the instant action, but then submitted the permit application to PennDOT on March 8, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 9, 2016, PennDOT sent a letter to the Chief of Surveys requesting a survey of the proposed sign location.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stephen R. Kovatis Dec. Ex. B, ECF No. 31-14. On May 15, 2016, PennDOT conducted a site visit, with both PennDOT and Adams representatives present.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:9-57:8. The next communication between PennDOT and Adams was on February 3, 2017, when Adams sent an e-mail to PennDOT inquiring into the status of the application.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62:3-21. On February 6, 2017, PennDOT requested additional information related to the application, which Adams promptly provided.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 75:16-23. The survey was completed on March 6, 2017, and the final drawing was completed on April 24, 2017. The same day, April 24, 2017, PennDOT officially denied the application because the proposed sign would be located within 500 feet of an interchange in violation of the Interchange Prohibition. Arciszewski Dep. at Ex. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Adams timely filed an administrative appeal of the denial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76:8-24. Shortly thereafter, Adams requested a stay of the administrative proceedings due to the pendency of the instant action, which was initiated on March 20, 2017. Kovatis Dec. Ex.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After a decision on the Motion to Dismiss was entered, Adams filed a Motion for Reconsideration, asking this Court to reconsider its decision dismissing the constitutional vagueness challenge to the Act. Shortly after this Motion was ripe for consideration, the parties completed discovery. They have since filed cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Adams argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because: (1) the Act is a content-based restriction on speech that violates Adams's First Amendment rights, as applied through the Fourteenth Amendment, because the restrictions contained in the Interchange Prohibition do not further a compelling governmental interest and are not narrowly tailored; (2) the Act, on its face, violates the First Amendment because it does not contain any deadlines for PennDOT to grant or deny sign permits; and (3) the Act, as-applied, violates the First Amendment because PennDOT's delay of over a year to respond to its permit application was unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Richards contends: (1) Adams lacks standing to pursue a challenge to the on-premise sign exemption and the official sign exemption because Adams engages exclusively in the construction of off-premise signs and has suffered no constitutional injury from either of these exemptions; (2) the exemptions do not change the content-neutrality of the Act, and the Act satisfies constitutional scrutiny; (3) there is no constitutional requirement that the Act, as a content-neutral regulation, provide a time limit for PennDOT to decide permit applications;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   and (4) Adams's as-applied challenge is moot because PennDOT has acted on its permit application and this Court cannot issue an injunction ordering PennDOT to take action that it has already taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. There is no basis to reconsider this Court's decision dismissing Adams's vagueness challenge, and the Motion for Reconsideration is denied.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In the Motion for Reconsideration, Adams does not assert that there was an intervening change in the controlling law, nor does it cite to any new evidence that was not available at the time of the opinion on the Motion to Dismiss. Rather, Adams simply disagrees with this Court's decision to dismiss the constitutional vagueness challenge to the Act, and alleges that manifest injustice will result if reconsideration is not granted.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glendon Energy Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3860003\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/836/1109/#p1122\">\n    836 F.Supp. at 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that it is not proper \"on a motion for reconsideration to ask the Court to rethink what [it] had already thought through-rightly or wrongly\"). Adams argues that this Court erred in relying on the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    George Wash. Motor Lodge Co. v. Commonwealth, Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   , 118 Pa.Cmwlth. 552,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1375530\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/118/552/#p494\">\n    545 A.2d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494 (1988), because PennDOT determined in a Proposed Report in 1989 that the case was not controlling. Adams also disagrees with this Court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Kegerreis Outdoor Adver. Co. v. DOT\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320950\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/1033/#p1039\">\n    157 A.3d 1033\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1039 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 2017), asserting that the case decided the meaning of the term \"interchange\" under the Act, not the meaning of \"main-traveled way\" as it applies to a \"divided highway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After review, this Court concludes that Adams's arguments do not show any need to correct a clear error of law or fact, or that manifest injustice will result if reconsideration is not granted. First, as to this Court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    George Wash. Motor Lodge Co.\n   </em>\n   , that case sets forth the current\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   holding of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court regarding the constitutionality of PennDOT's interpretation of the Interchange Prohibition as applying to structures on both sides of the highway.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    George Wash. Motor Lodge Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1375530\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/118/552/#p494\">\n    545 A.2d at 554-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that PennDOT's interpretation of the Interchange Prohibition as requiring the measurement of the distance between a sign and any intersection to be determined \"no matter where the location,\" whether on the same side or both sides of the main-traveled way, \"was not erroneous\"). Reliance thereupon was therefore proper. Furthermore, this Court is not bound by PennDOT's interpretation of case law and, in light of the 1997 strike-off letter, not even PennDOT currently follows its reasoning in the 1989 Proposed Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, Adams's suggestion that this Court's reference to\n   <em>\n    Kegerreis Outdoor Adver.

Adams argues that the Act is content-based in light of the allegedly content-based exemptions for official signs and on-premise signs contained in 36 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2718.104 and 2718.105(c)(2)(iv). Richards asserts, however, that Adams lacks standing to challenge these exemptions and, regardless, that both the exemptions and the Act are content-neutral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, this Court finds that these exemptions do not apply to the Interchange Prohibition; and the Interchange Prohibition is a content-neutral regulation that passes constitutional scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1.

The italicized portion quoted above is the Interchange Prohibition. Subsection (c)(2) of \u00a7 2718.105 also contains the following exemption: \"[o]fficial and 'on premise' signs, as defined in section 131(c) of Title 23, United States Code, shall not be counted nor shall measurements be made from them for purposes of determining spacing requirements.\" 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(iv).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Based on the limited information before the Court at the motion to dismiss stage, this Court believed that the exemptions for official and on-premise signs in \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(iv) applied to the Interchange Prohibition. However, at that time, this Court was unaware that PennDOT had interpreted the exemptions in \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(iv) as pertaining only to the requirement that \"no two sign structures shall be spaced less than five hundred feet apart,\" (the first part of 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(i) ), and having nothing to do with the Interchange Prohibition. Now, at this stage of the proceedings, the Court has determined that PennDOT's interpretation, which means that there are no exceptions to the Interchange Prohibition, is consistent with the purposes of the Act because an on-premise sign may be as equally distracting to a motorist as an off-premise sign, especially at an interchange.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kegerreis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12320950\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/157/1033/#p1039\">\n    157 A.3d at 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The obvious purpose of [the Interchange P]rohibition is to protect the safety of the traveling public by reducing distractions to the operators of motor vehicles at significant decision points.\");\n   <em>\n    Martin Media v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Adams does not assert that there was an intervening change in the controlling law,\n   nor does it cite to any new evidence that was not available at the time of the Opinion deciding the Motion to Dismiss, nor does Adams show there is any need to correct a clear error of law or fact or to prevent manifest injustice. Rather, Adams merely disagrees with this Court's prior decision dismissing his vagueness challenge, which is not a basis for reconsideration. The Motion for Reconsideration is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Interchange Prohibition, which applies to all structures, is a content-neutral regulation of speech that is narrowly tailored to the Commonwealth's interests in protecting motorists and promoting traffic safety, and leaves open alternative channels of communication. Because Adams's permit application was denied because the proposed sign did not conform to the Interchange Prohibition, Adams suffered no injury as a result of exemptions in 36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.104 and \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(iv), nor would the injury he suffered from the denial of his application be redressed by a favorable decision. He therefore lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of the exemptions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Act, as a whole, is a content-based statute and must include strict time limits for approving or denying permit applications. Because the permit requirement does not include such time limits, it is unconstitutional and is severed from the remainder of the Act. Adams's as-applied challenge to the Act based on the one-year delay before its application was decided is moot because injunctive and declaratory relief are no longer available, and Adams does not have a damages claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   A separate order follows.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    36 P.S. \u00a7 2718.105(c)(2)(i).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Adams's substantive due process as-applied challenge and equal protection claim were dismissed without prejudice as premature.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    The material facts in this case are largely undisputed and are taken directly from the parties' Statements of Undisputed Material Facts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Richards's Stmt Facts, ECF No. 31-2; Adams's Resp., ECF No. 34 (objecting only to the legal arguments in paragraphs 15 to 18 of Richards's Statement of Undisputed Material Facts, to the facts alleged in paragraphs 23, 47, and 48 as contrary to the witness's deposition testimony, and to paragraphs 49 and 50 as incomplete).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    \"Official signs\" are defined as including \"signs and notices pertaining to natural wonders, scenic and historical attractions, which are required or authorized by law.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20131\">\n     23 U.S.C. \u00a7 131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    23 C.F.R. 750.105(a) (defining official signs as \"[d]irectional or other official signs or notices erected and maintained by public officers or agencies pursuant to and in accordance with direction or authorization contained in State or Federal law, for the purpose of carrying out an official duty or responsibility\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    On-premise signs are \"signs, displays, and devices advertising the sale or lease of property upon which they are located.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20131\">\n     23 U.S.C. \u00a7 131\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c).\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    23 C.F.R. 750.105(a) (defining \"on-premise signs\" as \"[s]igns not prohibited by State law which are consistent with the applicable provisions of this section and \u00a7 750.108 and which advertise the sale or lease of, or activities being conducted upon, the real property where the signs are located\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Lois Arciszewski is a Real Estate Manager for Adams.
