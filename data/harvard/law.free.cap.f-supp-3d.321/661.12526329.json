Although the current motion is Ramos's second motion under \u00a7 2255, he did not obtain an appropriate certification from the Fourth Circuit. Accordingly, the government argues that Ramos's motion should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Gov't Opp. 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The government's argument is unavailing because \"it is settled law that not every numerically second petition is a 'second or successive' petition within the meaning\" of \u00a7 2255(h).\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hairston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055624\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/258/#p262\">\n    754 F.3d 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (4th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, a \"claim which did not arise until after a prior petition was filed\" is not barred as \"second or successive,\" which means that \"a numerically second \u00a7 2255 motion should not be considered second or successive pursuant to \u00a7 2255(h) where ... the facts relied on by the movant seeking resentencing did not exist when the numerically first motion was filed and adjudicated.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055624\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/258/#p262\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ramos's motion fits comfortably into this exception. The basis for the motion is the redesignation of his California state conviction as a misdemeanor,\n   which did not occur until February 2017, after his first \u00a7 2255 motion was adjudicated. Accordingly, Ramos is relying on facts that did not exist at the time his first motion was filed and adjudicated, and the current motion is not a \"second or successive\" motion within the meaning of \u00a7 2255(h).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055624\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/754/258/#p262\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (holding that movant's numerically second motion was not covered by \u00a7 2255(h) where his motion was based on the vacatur of a state conviction that occurred after his first motion was adjudicated).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Statutory Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moving to the merits of his claim, Ramos first argues that the redesignation of his California conviction means that he is no longer subject to the enhancement under \u00a7 841 ; however, based on the plain language of the provision, Ramos is incorrect. The sentencing enhancement which was applied to Ramos provides that a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years imprisonment is required if \"any person commits [a violation of the statute involving 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine] after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). \"[A]s a matter of plain statutory meaning there's ... no question that\" Ramos \"engaged in a second drug offense after a conviction for a first one.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dyke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049188\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/1282/#p1292\">\n    718 F.3d 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1292 (10th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This conclusion is bolstered by the analysis in a recent Ninth Circuit case, where the court confronted whether the reclassification of a defendant's felony to a misdemeanor pursuant to California's Proposition 47, which operates similarly to Proposition 64 but with respect to a different set of offenses, required resentencing when the defendant had received an enhancement under \u00a7 841.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174319\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/968/\">\n    838 F.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2016). As the Ninth Circuit explained, the plain language of \u00a7 841 is \"backward-looking,\" as the \"statute tells us what event triggers the enhancement\": a state conviction that is final.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174319\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174319\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/968/\">\n    at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, even where a state such as California has chosen to \"fully eradicate[ ] a predicate state conviction,\" the defendant still \"committed his [federal] crime after a prior state felony conviction ha[d] become final.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174319\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174319\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/968/\">\n    at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit persuasively held that \"Proposition 47, offering post-conviction relief by reclassifying certain past felony convictions as misdemeanors, does not undermine a prior conviction's felony-state for purposes of \u00a7 841.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174319\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/968/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174319\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/838/968/\">\n    at 975\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For these reasons, the Court rejects Ramos's contention that the reclassification of his previous conviction pursuant to Proposition 64 entitles him to resentencing under \u00a7 841 because, regardless of California's subsequent treatment of his felony conviction, he is an individual who committed an offense under \u00a7 841 after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense had become final. Accordingly, under the plain language of the statute, Ramos remains eligible for the enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Constitutional Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although Ramos is not entitled to resentencing under the language of the statute, the necessary analysis does not end there. Ramos also argues that he has a Constitutional right based on due process, the Eighth Amendment, and \"principles of federalism\" to resentencing now that the prior conviction has been vacated. The Court will consider each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As Ramos correctly argues, there is a line of case law establishing that \"[i]f a now-vacated conviction was clearly taken into account in [a defendant's] sentencing\n   determination,\" due process \"requires reconsideration of the sentence based only on accurate information about the defendant's prior criminal history.\"\n   <em>\n    Hammonds v.

By contrast, Ramos does not have any claim that he was actually innocent of the conduct underlying his California conviction, nor does he argue that the conviction was tainted by any error. Instead, Proposition 64 appears to represent a policy determination by the people of California that marijuana-related offenses ought no longer be treated as felonies and that individuals with convictions for such offenses should receive, as a matter of grace, some relief from the collateral consequences that flow from such convictions. Due process does not require the federal courts to give retroactive effect to this policy determination, and the reclassification of Ramos's conviction under Proposition 64 in no way undermines the historical fact of his conviction. Accordingly, in applying the \u00a7 841 enhancement, the sentencing court made no assumption about Ramos's criminal record that was materially untrue or otherwise relied on\n   misinformation of a constitutional nature, and the continued application of the enhanced sentence does not violate Ramos's due process rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moving to Ramos's Eighth Amendment argument, Ramos argues that his twenty-year mandatory sentence violates the Constitution's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Ewing v. California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n    538 U.S. 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n    155 L.Ed.2d 108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003), which upheld the constitutionality of California's \"Three Strikes Law\" as applied to a defendant who received a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for committing felony grand theft of three golf clubs. According to Ramos, the Supreme Court \"ruled that lengthy recidivist sentences were constitutionally justified not by the severity of the offender's instant conviction, but based on the severity of his or her prior crimes\" and, therefore, a \"20-year mandatory recidivist enhancement based on a prior misdemeanor offense\" must be unconstitutional because of the lack of proportionality between the misdemeanor and the 20-year sentence. Mot. 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   This argument is misplaced. Although Ramos is correct that the plurality in\n   <em>\n    Ewing\n   </em>\n   made reference to the defendant's \"long history of felony recidivism,\" the Court more precisely explained that when considering whether a sentence under a recidivism enhancement violates the Eighth Amendment's \"narrow proportionality principle,\"\n   <em>\n    Ewing\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n    538 U.S. at 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted), courts may take into consideration both the current offense and also the triggering predicate offense,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n    at 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9030344\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/538/11/\">\n    123 S.Ct. 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In weighing the gravity of Ewing's offense, we must place on the scales not only his current felony, but also his long history of felony recidivism.\"). Although it may be possible that Ramos's previous California conviction for possessing with intent to sell marijuana does not on its own support a mandatory 20-year sentence,\n   <em>\n    but see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hutto v.

In particular, Ramos was convicted of leading a large-scale drug conspiracy that trafficked in multiple-kilogram quantities of cocaine. Even without considering the prior conviction, the large quantity of cocaine involved meant that Ramos was exposed to a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years imprisonment and a statutory maximum term of life imprisonment under \u00a7 841. Moreover, based on his role in the offense and the large amount of cocaine related to the conspiracy, the Sentencing Guidelines established an advisory range of 292 to 365 months imprisonment. The statutory and guideline ranges at issue in this case make clear that Congress has deemed the specific conduct in which Ramos engaged to be more than sufficiently serious to warrant a sentence of 240 months imprisonment, and Ramos does not have any viable Eighth Amendment claim that such a sentence is disproportionate to the offense he committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, with respect to Ramos's argument that application of the enhancement violates \"principles of federalism,\" as an initial matter, Ramos does not credibly identify any individual right embodied\n   in the Constitution or in a federal statute that allows him to challenge his sentence based on vague notions about the \"principles of federalism.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, in general, \"state law [does not] normally dictate the meaning of a federal statute, at least absent some evidence Congress sought to defer to and incorporate state law,\" and there is \"no such evidence\" that Congress intended to do so with respect to \u00a7 841.\n   <em>\n    Dyke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049188\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/1282/#p1292\">\n    718 F.3d at 1292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the federal courts are not required to incorporate California's retroactive re-determinations about the seriousness of specific criminal conduct and the related reclassifications of previous offenses when applying the federal sentencing enhancement. Moreover, allowing states to fundamentally and retroactively upend federal sentences through processes such as Proposition 64 \"would risk disrupting the uniformity of the federal sentencing structure\" and create a serious burden on judicial economy and the finality of federal convictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dickerson v.

In that case, the Oklahoma courts had upheld the imposition of a mandatory forty-year prison term pursuant to an Oklahoma habitual offender statute that had been declared unconstitutional, reasoning that the error generated by applying the unconstitutional mandatory statute was harmless because the forty-year sentence was within the statutorily authorized range even without the habitual offender enhancement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n     at 345\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n     100 S.Ct. 2227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Supreme Court disagreed, holding that Oklahoma had established a substantive right for a criminal defendant to have his punishment fixed by the jury and that allowing an unconstitutional habitual offender statute to override this right violated the due process of law.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n     at 346\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184369\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/447/343/\">\n     100 S.Ct. 2227\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
