Am. Compl. \u00b6 6. In October of 2016, plaintiff had several incidents at work.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   First, plaintiff became concerned when his superiors attempted to convince plaintiff to violate defendant's corporate policy by leaving a branch of the bank with only one teller working.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-12. Plaintiff attempted to raise his concerns in a meeting with his manager the next day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. But the manager reprimanded plaintiff for not doing as he was told and used discriminatory language in the process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Just a few days later, plaintiff had an altercation with a customer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-46. The customer came into the bank and approached plaintiff's window at the teller counter, trying to cash a suspicious check.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. When plaintiff told the customer that he needed to provide verification, the customer became enraged at plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-32. Plaintiff asked the customer to leave the premises, further angering the customer and causing him to make serious threats to plaintiff's life.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-35. Plaintiff came around the teller line window to try to alert the branch manager, but the customer blocked his path.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 36-41.

Additionally, he wished to file a grievance report with defendant's human resources department.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.

He mentions no other communication with the EEOC in the complaint. The EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter five days later on October 24, 2016 (the \"October 2016 Letter\").\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Ex. B. But the plaintiff did not file suit until over a year later on October 27, 2017. This is well outside of the statutory 90-day deadline.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    But the plaintiff claims in his response to defendant's motion that this was an error by the EEOC and that EEOC issued a \"corrected\" right-to-sue letter on August 24, 2017 (the \"August 2017 Letter\"). Plaintiff attaches \"proof\" of this in his Amended Motion for Leave for Plaintiff to File a Sur-reply to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss [ECF No. 17]. He attaches an email from Monica Colunga, a WFO Enforcement Supervisor at the EEOC, which states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n    On October 20, 2016, you filed a charge of discrimination (EEOC Charge No. 570-2017-00130). That charge included allegations of retaliation and sex/male discrimination. Because the initial charge failed to include additional allegations a second charge (EEOC Charge Number 570-2017-013640) was filed on August 18, 2017. That charge included [sic] of sex/male, national origin, race/Black African American, retaliation and color allegations.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Am.

Because of the August 2017 Letter, plaintiff claims he is within the 90-day time limit and can permissibly bring these claims before the Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Defendant disagrees. First, defendant argues that there is not sufficient proof that the EEOC\n    <em>\n     reconsidered\n    </em>\n    its original position. Plaintiff has not provided the Court with a Notice of Reconsideration. And the second charge has a different charge number altogether. Second, defendant argues that even if the EEOC reconsidered its original decision, it did not withdraw the letter and plaintiff's suit is, therefore, still untimely.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201601.21\">\n     29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1601.21\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(1). \"If the EEOC issues a notice of its intent to reconsider within 90 days after a right to sue letter is issued, and 'the charging party has not filed suit ... the notice of intent to reconsider will vacate the dismissal or letter of determination and revoke the notice of right to sue.' \"\n    <em>\n     Obaseki v.

But as defendant points out, the August 2017 Letter has an entirely different charge number. And as Ms. Colunga states in her email, it includes additional allegations. Reading the plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    complaint most liberally, plaintiff may have been attempting to sue based on both charges. However, the complaint itself does not make any such distinction. And the complaint fails to mention the\n    August 2017 Letter entirely. But if it had distinguished between the two letters, some of the allegations related to the August 2017 charge may be timely. The Court, therefore, believes that justice and equity favor giving the\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    plaintiff a second chance at stating a claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The Court dismisses the hostile work environment and retaliation claims without prejudice. Within thirty (30) days, the plaintiff may make a motion for leave to amend the complaint. If the plaintiff chooses to take this route, the Court directs him to include only those allegations in his complaint from the August 2017 charge and none of the allegations from the October 2016. The Court also notes that if the August 2017 charge was simply a second charge filed\n    <em>\n     by the plaintiff\n    </em>\n    based on the same conduct by defendant, it may be untimely. Title VII requires a complainant to file charges with the EEOC within 180 days after the occurrence of the alleged discrimination, or within 300 days of such occurrence if the complainant has initially instituted state proceedings. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(1). The August 18, 2017 charge was filed over 300 days after the alleged discrimination in October 2016. In short, if the plaintiff decides to move for leave to amend, he should provide as many details as possible related to the substance of the August 2017 charge and its distinctions from the October 2016 charge. Plaintiff should also include allegations related to his communication with EEOC in association therewith so that the Court may properly determine whether the second charge is, itself, timely.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     D. Plaintiff's Wrongful Termination Claim\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    In Count III of the complaint, plaintiff alleges that the defendant terminated him in violation of public policy. Specifically, plaintiff claims \"[d]efendant terminated the [p]laintiff for contacting OSHA, EEOC and calling 911 in direct retaliation for exposing their negligence and unethical practices.\" Am.
