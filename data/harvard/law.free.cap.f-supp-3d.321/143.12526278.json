Also before the Court is [81] the government's unopposed motion for clarification that the August 3, 2018 order was a final, appealable judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The government seeks a stay of the Court's orders in their entirety or, in the alternative, at least insofar as they require the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") to begin accepting applications for initial grants of DACA benefits and for advance parole under the DACA program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. for a Stay Pending Appeal (\"Gov't's Mot.\") [ECF No. 82] at 1-2. Plaintiffs oppose the government's motion in part, urging the Court not to stay its orders in their entirety, but agreeing that a stay as to initial DACA applications would be proper.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

For the reasons that follow, the government's motion to clarify will be granted, and its motion for a stay pending appeal will be granted in part. The Court will stay its order as to new DACA applications and applications for advance parole, but not as to renewal applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Court is mindful that continuing the stay in this case will temporarily deprive certain DACA-eligible individuals, and plaintiffs in these cases, of relief to which the Court has concluded they are legally entitled. But the Court is also aware of the significant confusion and uncertainty that currently surrounds the status of the DACA program, which is now the subject of litigation in multiple federal district courts and courts of appeals. Because that confusion would only be magnified if the Court's order regarding initial DACA applications were to take effect now and later be reversed on appeal, the Court will grant a limited stay of its order and preserve the status quo pending appeal, as plaintiffs themselves suggest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court is unmoved by the government's assertion of injury resulting from its being \"enjoined from implementing an act of Congress.\" Gov't's Mot. at 8. As the Court has already explained, DHS has been implementing that act of Congress (the Immigration and Nationality Act) under an ill-considered (and hence possibly incorrect) understanding of its enforcement authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To the extent that such an injury is cognizable at all, it is insufficient to justify staying the Court's order here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court accepts, however, that the additional staff and other resources required for DHS to process initial DACA applications would constitute a cognizable injury. DHS estimates that full implementation of the Court's order would lead to the filing of over 100,000 initial DACA applications and 30,000 requests for advance parole, which would in turn require the hiring of 72 temporary employees and the reassignment or hiring of 60 full-time employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Mot. at 9-10. But these burdens apply only as to initial DACA applications, since DHS has been accepting renewal applications since mid-2012, with the exception of a brief period in late 2017 and early 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 218-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second factor therefore favors plaintiffs' proposed limited stay, not the government's full stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The third factor, the risk of injury to plaintiffs, again favors continuing the stay as to initial DACA applications and applications for advance parole, but not as to renewal applications. Although the government maintains that the termination of existing DACA benefits-which would immediately end DACA beneficiaries' work authorizations and could lead to their removal from the United States-is not an irreparable harm, this untenable proposition has been rejected by this Court and by several others.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting in the stay-of-vacatur context that \"each day that the agency delays is a day that aliens who might otherwise be eligible for initial grants of DACA benefits are exposed to removal because of an unlawful agency action\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regents of the U. of Cal. v.

And although there are currently two preliminary injunctions in place requiring DHS to continue accepting renewal applications, as the Court has previously noted, \"those injunctions are both on expedited appeals and hence could be reversed in the not-too-distant future.\"\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court's order-which, unlike the preliminary injunctions entered in parallel litigation, is a final judgment-will therefore prevent irreparable harm to plaintiffs and all current DACA beneficiaries should those other injunctions be reversed. Hence, it will not be stayed as to renewal applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   By contrast, the Court agrees with the district court in\n   <em>\n    Regents\n   </em>\n   that \"while plaintiffs have demonstrated that DACA recipients ... are likely to suffer substantial, irreparable harm as a result of the rescission, they have not made a comparable showing as to individuals who have never applied for or obtained DACA\" benefits. 279 F.Supp.3d at 1049 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272941\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/401/#p434\">\n    279 F.Supp.3d at 437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"As in\n   <em>\n    Regents\n   </em>\n   , ... the court finds that the irreparable harms identified by Plaintiffs largely result from Defendants' expected failure to renew existing grants of deferred action and especially work authorization, not from Defendants' refusal to adjudicate new initial DACA applications.\"). The same is\n   true of advance parole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Regents\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 1049 (concluding that \"inability to travel abroad ... do[es] not amount to [a] hardship[ ] justifying a provisional injunction requiring DHS to resume accepting applications for advance parole\");\n   <em>\n    Batalla Vidal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272941\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/279/401/#p434\">\n    279 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   437 (citing\n   <em>\n    Regents\n   </em>\n   , 279 F.Supp.3d at 1048-49 ). Thus, like the second factor, the third factor supports a stay as to initial DACA applications and applications for advance parole, but not as to renewal applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The fourth and final factor-the public interest-also favors this limited stay. The Court has already recognized the disruption that would ensue if DHS were to begin accepting initial DACA applications pursuant to the Court's order but that order were later reversed on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   244-45 (citing\n   <em>\n    Allied-Signal, Inc. v.

Plaintiffs oppose the dismissal of their constitutional claims but agree that the Court's August 3, 2018 order is final and appealable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Initially, the Court deferred ruling on plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to DACA's rescission pending DHS's response to the April 24, 2018 order vacating DACA's rescission on administrative grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that DHS \"could, on remand, alter DACA's rescission in ways that might affect the merits of plaintiffs' constitutional claims\"). Because the Court has since declined to reconsider its April 24, 2018 order, a decision on plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to DACA's rescission is unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alabama Power Co. v.

Moreover, the Court has already entered final judgment on plaintiffs' remaining administrative and constitutional claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NAACP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524134\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/298/209/#p249\">\n    298 F.Supp.3d at 249\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the Court's August 3, 2018 order denying reconsideration \"adjudicat[ed] all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities\" in this action\n   and was therefore a final, appealable order.

P. 54(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the government's motion for a stay pending appeal will be granted in part, and the Court will stay its order of vacatur as it applies to initial DACA applications and applications for DACA-based advance parole. The government's motion to clarify will also be granted.
