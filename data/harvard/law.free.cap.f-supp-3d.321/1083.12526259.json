CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1990, Congress passed and President George H. W. Bush signed the Immigration Act of 1990, creating the \"Temporary Protected Status\" (TPS) program.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pub. L. 102-232 (1991). The TPS statute codifies a long-standing practice: \"every Administration since and including that of President Eisenhower has permitted one or more groups of otherwise deportable aliens to remain temporarily in the United States out of concern that the forced repatriation of these individuals could endanger their lives or safety.\" H.R. Rep. 100-627, at 6 (1988). TPS is thus a humanitarian program: it authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to temporarily permit nationals from certain countries to live and work in the United States when an ongoing armed conflict, environmental disaster, or other conditions prevent the safe return of those persons to their countries of origin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(1)(A)-(C). Since 1990, several countries have received TPS status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At issue here are the designations for El Salvador, Nicaragua, Haiti, and Sudan. Sudan\n   was designated for TPS in 1997 on account of a brutal civil war. Its TPS designation was extended periodically by every administration until late 2017, when Defendants announced that Sudan's status would be terminated. Similarly, Nicaragua was designated in 1999 due to Hurricane Mitch; El Salvador was designated in 2001 and Haiti in 2010, both on the basis of devastating earthquakes. Each country's TPS designation was periodically extended on every occasion until late 2017. Between October 2017 and January 2018, Defendants announced that TPS status for all four countries would be terminated by November 2, 2018 (Sudan), January 5, 2019 (Nicaragua), July 22, 2019 (Haiti), and September 9, 2019 (El Salvador).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   These TPS designations have given rise to a sizeable population of over 200,000 people who have lived in the United States with lawful status pursuant thereto for 10-20 years. Many have built careers, bought homes, married, and had children-children who are U.S. citizens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case are TPS-beneficiaries and their U.S.-citizen children. At the crux of their compliant is an allegation that Defendants, under the President's influence, have adopted a new interpretation of the TPS statute. Whereas prior administrations evaluated the severity of intervening events when considering whether to extend TPS, the present administration allegedly ignores those events and focuses solely on whether the original rationale for TPS continues to exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs assert four legal claims. First, the U.S.-citizen children between the ages of 5 and 18 allege that Defendants' termination violates their substantive due process rights because the Government-without good reason-is forcing them to choose between living in the United States without their parents or leaving their country of citizenship to return to countries they maintain are unsafe. Second, Plaintiffs allege that the termination of TPS and adoption of a new interpretation of the TPS statute violates the Constitution's equal protection guarantee because\n   <s>\n    it\n   </s>\n   they were based on President Trump's racial animus against persons from those countries and his alleged disdain for non-white immigrants. Third, the TPS beneficiaries allege that Defendants have violated their substantive due process rights because they have not advanced a reasonable basis to terminate their TPS status of the countries in question or to change their interpretation of the TPS statute. Finally, the TPS-beneficiaries allege that Defendants' actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because Defendants departed from long-standing policy and practice without acknowledging the change or providing good reasons for it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss on the basis that the Court lacks jurisdiction to hear Plaintiffs' claims or review the Secretary's decisions with respect to TPS. Defendants also maintain that, even if the Court has jurisdiction, Plaintiffs fail to state a claim on any theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A hearing was held on June 22, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 35, 39. On June 25, 2018, this Court issued a summary order denying the motion (Docket No. 34). This order elaborates on that order and addresses intervening case law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs are nine persons who have permission to live and work in the United States because their countries of origin have been designated for \"Temporary Protected Status\" (TPS) and four U.S.-citizen children whose parents currently hold TPS status.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 16-29. The TPS holders come from Sudan, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Haiti, four countries that have continuously been designated for TPS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   since 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2010, respectively. Pursuant to these TPS designations, Plaintiffs with TPS have been lawfully present in the United States from approximately ten to twenty years. Despite long-standing practice periodically extending TPS designations for these four countries, Defendants announced that TPS would be terminated over a three month period between October 2017 and January 2018. As a result, over 200,000 residents who have resided in the United States for years, some for decades, stand to lose their permission to live and work in the United States and will be subject to deportation. Below, the Court summarizes Plaintiffs' personal experiences as well as the history of TPS designations for each of the four countries at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs' Backgrounds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The following is a sample of Plaintiffs' backgrounds alleged in the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Hiwaida Elarabi (Sudan)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff Hiwaida Elarabi is originally Sudanese, but has lived in the United States since 1997 with TPS status.

In context, \"any determination\" means the determination to designate, the determination to terminate, and the determination to extend a designation. \"Any\" modifies but does not define \"determinations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The government cites a House Judiciary Committee report which states that \"none of the [Secretary's] decisions with regard to granting, extending, or terminating TPS will be subject to judicial review,\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-245 (1989), at 14. That citation is inapt for two reasons. First, this committee report concerns the \"Chinese Temporary Protected Status Act of 1989,\" House Resolution 2929 (101st Congress), which was never passed. Although the judicial review provision in that proposed legislation is similar to the language ultimately included in the general TPS statute passed and codified at 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1254a, the latter was part of the Immigration Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-649, Nov. 29, 1990. Defendants have not identified other relevant legislative history pertaining to the legislation actually passed by Congress. In any case, the language cited in this committee report would not provide additional guidance even if it pertained to the TPS statute at issue here. It merely echoes the language of the statute, using the word \"decisions\" instead of \"determinations.\" That is not clear and convincing evidence of Congressional intent to strip jurisdiction of the courts to review generally applicable policies and practices which transcend individual TPS determination for a particular country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Finally, the fact that Plaintiffs' challenge might result in vacating the four TPS determinations at issue in this case is not dispositive to the interpretation question at hand. The same was true in\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    CSS\n   </em>\n   ; both had the effect of vacating individual determinations and requiring the agency to re-consider them after correcting procedural deficiencies and applying the correct legal standard. Similarly, if Plaintiffs prevail here, Defendants would not be compelled to extend each country's TPS designation. Instead, Defendants may make a new determination whether TPS should be extended or terminated once\n   they correct any legal errors identified by the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Section 1254a Does Not Preclude Colorable Constitutional Claims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Plaintiffs' constitutional claims do challenge,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , DHS's determinations to terminate each of the four country's TPS status on grounds that do not depend on DHS's general interpretation of the TPS statute. For example, the U.S.-citizen children allege that Defendants' termination of their parents' TPS status violates their substantive due process rights because \"Defendants have articulated no substantial governmental interest and have failed to adequately tailor their action to promote any legitimate interest they may have,\" and the TPS termination notices do not \"identif[y] any risk to the interests of the United States that would follow from allowing the school-aged U.S. citizen children to remain in the United States with their TPS holder parents until the children reach the age of majority.\" Compl. \u00b6 105. Similarly, Plaintiffs' equal protection claim alleges that \"Defendants' decisions to terminate the TPS designations for El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Sudan are unconstitutional because they were motivated, at least in part, by intentional discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or national origin.\" Compl. \u00b6 110. Finally, the TPS-holder Plaintiffs allege that their due process rights have been violated because \"[t]he government also has not articulated, and cannot establish, any rational basis for ... ignoring the current capability of TPS countries to safely receive longtime TPS holders, their families, and their U.S. citizen children.\" Compl. \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   These challenges are not collateral challenges to broad policies. Rather, they directly attack the determinations themselves. Thus,\n   <em>\n    McNary\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Reno\n   </em>\n   do not apply to these challenges. Nevertheless, as noted above, \"where Congress intends to preclude judicial review of constitutional claims its intent to do so must be clear.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p603\">\n    486 U.S. at 603\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p603\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This argument is not persuasive. Under Plaintiffs' interpretation, the statute only precludes a cause of action arising directly under \u00a7 1254a ; but there is no direct cause of action under \u00a7 1254a, so Plaintiffs' interpretation would render the phrase meaningless. Rather, as the Government contends, \"under this subsection\" is more reasonably read to describe the \"determinations\" for which review is precluded,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , specific TPS determinations made by the Secretary under the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   However, there is no \"clear and convincing\" evidence that Congress intended to preclude the Court from reviewing constitutional challenges of the nature alleged here.

Thus, absent clear evidence of Congressional intent, the jurisdiction-stripping provision should be construed to preclude review only of claims challenging a determination for reasons that are \"closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes\" which are committed by statute to the Secretary's discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cuozzo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597964\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2131/#p2140\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 2141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that lawsuit challenging U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decision to institute inter partes review based on the alleged insufficiency of the petition for review was precluded by jurisdiction-stripping statute, but expressly holding that \"we do not categorically preclude review of a final decision where ... there is a due process problem with the entire proceeding, nor does our interpretation enable the agency to act outside its statutory limits\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Applying that principle here, Section 1254a does not reflect a clear Congressional intent to preclude this Court from reviewing Plaintiffs' constitutional challenges to the Secretary's determinations. The substance of Plaintiffs' constitutional challenges is far afield of fact-based criteria that are \"closely tied\" to administration of the TPS statute. While the Secretary's evaluation of particular facts based on statutory criteria under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254a(b)(1)(A)-(C) may be \"closely tied to the application and interpretation of statutes related to\" the Secretary's decisions, ascertaining whether the decision is driven by unconstitutional racial animus is not. Nor is the purely legal question regarding the scope of a person's substantive due process interests against removal (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , how to balance an\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   's interests with the Government's interests).

Plaintiffs more specifically cite former Secretary Kelly's June 6, 2017 Senate testimony that \"the [TPS] program is for a specific event. In - in Haiti, it was the earthquake. Yes, Haiti had horrible conditions before the earthquake, and those conditions aren't much better after the earthquake. But the earthquake was why TPS was - was granted and - and that's how I have to look at it.\" Compl. \u00b6 76. Additionally, as noted above, Secretary Nielsen later stated that \"[t]he law does not allow me to look at the country conditions of a country writ large.

Indeed, to state a claim, Plaintiffs must plausibly allege not only that Defendants considered only the \"originating conditions\" in terminating TPS here, but also that Defendants' prior practice was to the contrary. They have done so here. Prior to October 2017, extension and/or re-designation notices indicate that DHS consistently considered, at the very least, whether intervening events had frustrated or impeded recovery efforts from the originating conditions in Sudan, Haiti, Nicaragua, and El Salvador. For example, in notices regarding Sudan, DHS emphasized\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the persistence of the armed conflict prompting the original designation\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   consequential problems beyond the conflict itself, which together prevented the safe return of Sudanese nationals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The same is generally true of Nicaragua and Hurricane Mitch,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   El Salvador's earthquake,\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Haiti's\n   earthquake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the highlighted language in these footnotes\n   demonstrates, prior administrations considered subsequent, intervening events such as droughts extending TPS status.

For every country (although to varying degrees), factors that were explicitly considered recently by prior administrations were wholly absent from the four termination notices issued between October 2017 and January 2018. That supports a plausible inference, corroborated by the statements of former Secretary Kelly and Secretary Nielsen, that Defendants changed their interpretation of the TPS statute so as to focus solely (or nearly solely) on the originating condition without considering intervening events in making TPS determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   There are only two exceptions to this observation.

Indeed, a comparison between Secretary Kelly's extension and Acting Secretary Duke's termination six months later supports an\n   inference of an intervening change in policy or practice: although Secretary Kelly explicitly considered intervening events like Hurricane Matthew in October 2016 and heavy rains in late April 2017, Acting Secretary Duke did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Second, arguably the termination notice for Sudan touches, albeit indirectly and with much less specificity, on nearly all of the themes discussed in the most recent extension notice. However, that does not undermine the plausibility that Defendants at some point adopted a new rule or policy as indicated by the discrepancies between the notices for El Salvador, Haiti, and Nicaragua. The arguably more complete discussion with respect to Sudan does not defeat the viability of Plaintiffs' APA claim challenging the change in practice itself; at most, it might affect the scope of Plaintiffs' remedy if, for example, the new rule or policy was not instituted until after Sudan's termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that prior administrations have terminated TPS despite ongoing problems in the designated countries. That fact is not dispositive to the case at bar. The question is whether those ongoing problems were\n   <em>\n    considered\n   </em>\n   when the termination decision was made. The notices confirm Plaintiffs' assertion that under the prior practice, intervening events were at least considered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   In sum, Plaintiffs' allegations and a facial review of the termination notices support a plausible inference that Defendants have adopted a new policy or practice without any explanation for the change.

In those cases, by asserting one right, the individual necessarily extinguished the other.

As set forth in detail above, President Trump has allegedly expressed animus toward \"non-white, non-European people,\" Compl. \u00b6 9, including by labeling Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67, \"compar[ing] immigrants to snakes who will bite and kill anyone foolish enough to take them in,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68, complaining that 40,000 Nigerians in the United States \"would never 'go back to their huts' in Africa,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69, and \"disseminat[ing] a debunked story about celebrations of the September 11, 2001, attacks [by Arabs living in New Jersey],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   President Trump also specifically made derogatory comments about Haitians, including that the 15,000 admitted to the United States \"all have AIDS,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   One week before TPS was terminated, President Trump asked aloud regarding Latin American and African countries, including Haiti and El Salvador, \"Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?\" He expressed a preference instead for Norwegians, who are overwhelmingly white.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. The President also asked \"Why do we need more Haitians?\" and insisted they be removed from an immigration deal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Plaintiffs characterize these statements and other evidence as evidence of \"racial and national-origin animus.\" Compl. \u00b6 66. These allegations are more than sufficient to support a plausible inference of the President's animus based on race and/or national origin/ethnicity against non-white immigrants in general and Haitians, Salvadore\u00f1os, Nicaraguans, and Sudanese people in particular.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that President Trump's animus was a factor in the TPS termination decisions in question. According to Plaintiffs' allegations, President Trump repeatedly expressed his animus towards non-white immigrants on the campaign trail and after entering office, and explicitly linked those sentiments to his proposed immigration policies and priorities. Most directly, at a meeting about TPS on January 11, 2018, President Trump expressed his disdain for persons from Haiti and El Salvador,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   and his administration\n   then took action to terminate TPS status for those countries a mere 7 days later. Compl. \u00b6 70. Although the termination of Sudan and Nicaragua in October and December 2017 pre-date the January 11, 2018 meeting, they post-date the other statements made by President Trump reflecting animus against non-white immigrants and other persons of Latino or African origin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 67 (categorical labels of Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists), 69 (complaining that migrants from Nigeria would never \"go back to their huts\" in Africa);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (disseminating a false anti-Arab rumor about celebrations of the September 11, 2001 attacks in New Jersey). Thus, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that President Trump harbored racial and national origin/ethnic animus as of the time of all four TPS decisions challenged in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs plausibly allege that President Trump influenced DHS's decision to terminate TPS status. Most directly, Secretary Nielsen was present at the January 11, 2018 meeting where the President referred to Haiti and El Salvador (at least) as \"shithole countries\" and questioned why the United States would welcome their people here. Compl. \u00b6 72. Haiti and El Salvador's TPS designations were terminated seven days later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81, 84. Further, Plaintiffs' allege that on November 6, 2017, with respect to Honduras-which is not at issue in this case- the White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly and White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert \"repeatedly called Acting Secretary Duke and pressured her to terminate the TPS designation for Honduras.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. Kelly was reportedly traveling with President Trump at the time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Another news article cited by Plaintiffs (and thus incorporated into the complaint) notes that as early as June 2017 President Trump was \"berating his most senior advisers,\" including then-DHS Secretary John Kelly, about immigrants who had entered the country that year from Afghanistan, Haiti, and Nigeria.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69, n.33. Together, these allegations support a plausible inference that the White House has proactively inserted itself into DHS's TPS termination decisions during the relevant time period of October 2017 to January 2018 when the termination decisions were announced as part of its broader agenda on immigration. Indeed, Defendants effectively concede that President Trump has insinuated himself into the TPS process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 9 (\"Of course something of this nature would involve the White House...\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   In light of the allegations above, Plaintiffs have plausibly pled that President Trump's racial and national-origin/ethnic animus was a motivating factor in DHS's TPS termination decisions and thus have plausibly stated an equal protection claim.

Further, Section 1254a does not preclude judicial review of Plaintiffs' constitutional due process and equal protection claims.

Finally, Plaintiffs have plausibly pled that Defendants' termination decisions violate Plaintiffs' substantive due process rights, at least to the extent that the decisions violated the APA and/or equal protection guarantee and therefore did not involve pursuit of a legitimate governmental interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   This order disposes of Docket No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Extension and Redesignation of Haiti for Temporary Protected Status\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"251\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2029%2C000\">\n     76 Fed.
