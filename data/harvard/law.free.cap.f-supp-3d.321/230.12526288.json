(\"NWNA\"), alleging that NWNA failed to honor one-year agreements for lower prices on its products. In the First Amended Complaint (Docket No. 29) (\"FAC\"), Geis asserts four counts on behalf of a putative class: Count I (breach of contract); Count II (violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7 11 ); Count III (fraud); and Count IV (violation of\n   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7 9 ). NWNA filed a motion to dismiss Counts I-IV (Docket No. 35), based on lack of personal jurisdiction, lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and a failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   NWNA's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Geis has also moved to amend the FAC to add Bristol-Plymouth Moving and Storage, Inc.

Geis alleges that NWNA \"conducts business in Massachusetts through its sale of product in this state and through the maintenance of a call center in this state.\" FAC \u00b6 4. NWNA's business consists of selling and delivering bottled water, iced tea, coolers, and other items to individuals and businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At its Raynham, Massachusetts, call center, NWNA employs a group of over 200 representatives who handle customer complaints about pricing. There is no pricing consistency among customers, so two customers may pay different prices for identical products. If a customer called to say she would be terminating her contract with NWNA, the call center representatives would try to \"save\" the customer. To \"save\" the account, the representative would lower the price that the complaining customer paid for a product. The price reductions negotiated by the representative and complaining customer would remain in effect for one year, and customers were informed of the one-year term over the phone. These one-year reductions were made pursuant to company policy. Call center representatives documented the agreements for one-year reductions in more than 50,000 \"call notes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Price Increase\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On or before January 1, 2016, NWNA \"instituted a plan to raise all prices on its water products.\" FAC \u00b6 31. This price increase was intended to apply to products under the one-year price reduction agreements, per NWNA Executive Vice President Henrik Jelert's instruction. Customers under these one-year agreements were not notified of the price increases. Jelert said \"we will see what happens,\" when discussing the possibility of customers under one-year agreements complaining about or even noticing price increases. FAC \u00b6 35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Nearly 50,000 customers with one-year agreements never complained and therefore paid the increased prices. When customers with one-year agreements did call to complain, the call center representatives would lie about the reason for the price increase, as they had been instructed to do by management. Then, the representatives\n   would always honor the one-year agreement and fix the pricing to align with it. The proposed class is described as: \"All [NWNA] customers who had been provided with a one year agreement as to pricing but as to which [NWNA] raised prices during that one year period.\" FAC \u00b6 83. Total class damages exceed $20 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The FAC includes specific facts relating to a number of putative class members, but Geis's situation will serve as an example. Geis called NWNA on July 5, 2016 (after the policy to increase prices had been implemented), and a call center representative promised her that the price of her water cooler would be reduced to $1.99 each month for one year, and that each three-gallon water bottle would be $5.99 until December 17, 2017. This agreement is reflected in the call notes. On September 27, 2016, NWNA raised the price of the water cooler to $3.49. Then, on October 31, 2016, NWNA increased the price of the three-gallon water bottle to $6.29. Geis paid the increased prices because she did not know they had been raised. She \"paid a total of more than $100.\" FAC \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Bristol-Plymouth\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their proposed Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"), Plaintiffs seek to add Bristol-Plymouth, \"a Massachusetts Corporation with a place of business located at 105 Weaver Street, Fall River, Massachusetts.\" Docket No. 34-1 \u00b6 2. Bristol-Plymouth called NWNA's Massachusetts call center on June 18, 2015, to complain about pricing. NWNA offered to reduce the price by $5 for a period of one year, and Bristol-Plymouth agreed to remain an NWNA customer. This agreement is memorialized in the call notes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On January 6, 2016, NWNA increased the price of Bristol-Plymouth's coolers by $2. Bristol-Plymouth paid the increased price \"not realizing that it had occurred\" and has lost more than $50.

The Court addresses NWNA's personal jurisdiction arguments first, as they apply to all of Geis's putative class action claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Personal Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Gen. Laws ch. 223A, \u00a7 3(a). The definition of \"transacting any business\" is construed broadly, and courts look to whether the defendant attempted to participate in the Commonwealth's economic life.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cossart v.

Geis's complaint alleges facts that easily satisfy the long-arm statute's requirements. NWNA has a call center in Raynham where more than 200 employees worked. The call center handles approximately 50,000 calls per year.

According to Geis, the company also told the Massachusetts call center representatives to lie to callers about one-year pricing terms. Thus, the alleged fraud surged out from Massachusetts and foreseeably brought NWNA into a Massachusetts court.

Geis also asserts that discovery will focus on the call center and that \"discovery outside of Massachusetts will be minimal.\" Docket No. 44 at 13. Second, Massachusetts has an interest in adjudicating consumer protection issues, even when those issues relate to an out-of-state plaintiff, because NWNA may be conducting business in an unfair or deceptive manner within its borders.

Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7 11 (Count II), and is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   , with respect to the fraud claim (Count III).\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The FAC also alleges that Kara Lyndon and Tiffany Morris were wrongfully terminated in violation of public policy by Defendants NWNA and Scott Kelly. Counts V and VI are breach of contract/wrongful termination claims on behalf of Lyndon and Morris. Defendants have not moved to dismiss these counts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Geis does not argue that this Court has general personal jurisdiction over NWNA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Any class under chapter 93A, therefore, must be limited to only those who allegedly suffered a loss as a result of NWNA's actions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    NWNA also briefly advances an argument based on economic loss theory, which is neither well developed nor clear to the Court. And regardless, NWNA does not cite any Massachusetts or federal court cases to support the assertion that the economic loss theory precludes a fraud claim based in breach of contract.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 36 at 18 (citing only an unpublished Connecticut superior court case and a Florida appellate court case). The Court need not wade further into these waters.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
