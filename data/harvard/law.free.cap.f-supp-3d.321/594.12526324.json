ECF No. 50. Accordingly, the Motion is ripe for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 23, 2018, Defendant was indicted for numerous drug and firearm charges resulting from a traffic stop in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina. Defendant filed a Motion to Suppress the drugs and firearms seized during the traffic stop, and the Court held a suppression hearing on May 3, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the suppression hearing, the Government offered the testimony of Officer Ed Gordon, a patrol officer with the Horry County Police Department with more than twenty-years of experience and extensive experience in drug investigations; Officer Gordon testified as follows. On the evening of Defendant's arrest, November 29, 2016, Officer Gordon was conducting surveillance of the Sea Mist Resort. On prior occasions, officers had observed street level drug deals at the Sea Mist Resort, which led to Officer Gordon's surveillance on the evening of Defendant's arrest. Officer Gordon positioned himself across the street from the Sea Mist Resort and observed what appeared to be hand-to-hand drug transactions. Specifically, Officer Gordon observed runners standing outside of a hotel room. These runners appeared to deliver drugs to pedestrians and individuals in vehicles who approached the Sea Mist Resort. When Officer Gordon observed an alleged hand-to-hand drug transaction with an individual in a vehicle,\n   he called out the identity of the vehicle to narcotics officers nearby in unmarked vehicles. Officers in the unmarked vehicles would follow the subjects until they committed a traffic violation, and then a marked unit would pull the subjects over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After witnessing a number of these apparent hand-to-hand drug transactions, Officer Gordon observed Defendant appearing to emerge from the area of the room where the runners were standing and watched Defendant interact with the runners. Additionally, Officer Gordon stated Defendant spoke with another man, but they walked out of Officer Gordon's line of sight. The other man got into a red Cadillac while Defendant got into a white Audi; then, both men left the Sea Mist Resort. Officer Gordon called out the identity of both vehicles and they were stopped by law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Officer Gordon testified that his familiarity with drug dealing in the Horry County area, combined with Defendant's actions, gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that Defendant was engaged in criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On cross-examination, Officer Gordon admitted that he prepared no report on the evening of the arrest. Officer Gordon also admitted that simply being in the proximity of drug transactions does not mean a person is involved in drug dealing. Defendant introduced evidence that Defendant was a registered guest at the Sea Mist Resort on the evening of his arrest. Accordingly, Defendant had a valid reason for being at the Sea Mist Resort; however, this information was not known by law enforcement on the evening of Defendant's arrest. Nevertheless, Officer Gordon testified that his opinion would not have changed even had he known Defendant was a registered guest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Government offered Corporal Justin Miller as its second witness. Corporal Miller conducted the traffic stop on the evening of the arrest and has been employed by the Horry County Police Department for fourteen years. Corporal Miller was assigned to the Street Crimes Unit on the evening of Defendant's arrest. Corporal Miller testified that Officer Gordon called out two vehicles-Defendant's Audi and a red Cadillac. An unmarked vehicle driven by another officer observed Defendant commit a traffic violation, and Corporal Miller then stopped Defendant's vehicle. Corporal Miller testified that he believed he had reasonable suspicion to detain Defendant based on his knowledge of why Officer Gordon was at the Sea Mist Resort and based on Officer Gordon calling out Defendant's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Corporal Miller stopped Defendant and asked him for his license, registration, and proof of insurance. Corporal Miller relayed this information to dispatch, and while he was waiting for a response, asked Defendant to step out of the vehicle for questioning. Defendant explained that he was staying at the Sea Mist Resort while in Myrtle Beach doing hurricane relief work. Corporal Miller asked the Defendant for consent to search his vehicle, and Defendant declined. Corporal Miller then returned to his patrol car and radioed that he needed a drug dog at the scene because he could not get into Defendant's vehicle. While waiting on the canine, Corporal Miller started to write Defendant a ticket. He finished writing the ticket and running Defendant's information through dispatch before the canine officer arrived at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   When the canine officer arrived, she walked her dog around the vehicle. It is\n   not entirely clear from the video's angle, but it appears that the dog alerted on the driver's side of Defendant's vehicle. Officers searched Defendant's vehicle and found a variety of drugs and firearms, which resulted in Defendant's arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    APPLICABLE LAW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Fourth Amendment and Traffic Stops\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that '[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The fact that [the defendant] appeared to be nervous initially adds little, given that law-abiding drivers commonly experience nervousness\n   during a traffic stop. And, even combined with all of the other circumstances, [the defendant's] alleged evasiveness about the where (sic) he had picked up [the passenger] likewise would not tip the balance in favor of reasonable suspicion given that [the defendant] told [the Trooper] he was not familiar with the area but that [the Trooper] could see the location by looking at [the defendant's] GPS unit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516167\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/200/#p213\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations and citations omitted). In conclusion, the Fourth Circuit held that \"[a]lthough the nature of the totality-of-the-circumstances test makes it possible for individually innocuous factors to add up to reasonable suspicion, it is impossible for a combination of wholly innocent factors to combine into a suspicious conglomeration unless there are concrete reasons for such an interpretation.

However, the cases show a recent trend towards more scrupulous examination of the Government's articulated reasons for suspecting criminal activity. The Court turns now to the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Court must first determine whether Corporal Miller prolonged the traffic stop longer than was reasonably necessary to accomplish the \"mission\" of the stop. After reviewing the videos and testimony from the suppression hearing, the Court finds that Corporal Miller actually finished writing Defendant a ticket and conducting the necessary license, registration, and warrant checks several minutes prior to the arrival of the canine unit. Accordingly, the Court holds that Corporal Miller did prolong the traffic stop in order to conduct a canine sniff. Thus, the dispositive question here is whether Corporal Miller had reasonable suspicion to justify the extension of the traffic stop. As detailed below, the Court acknowledges that this is a very close question in light of recent appellate case law. Even so, viewing the totality of the circumstances, the Court concludes that Corporal Miller did not have reasonable suspicion to continue his seizure of Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In its brief, the Government states, \"[Officer] Gordon saw [Defendant] leave the apartment or unit where all of the runners were going both before and after the drug transactions.\" ECF No. 50 at 5. However, at the hearing, Officer Gordon's testimony was far more equivocal. As previously stated, Officer Gordon testified that he set up a position across the street from the Sea Mist Resort so that he could observe hand-to-hand drug transactions and relay that information to his colleagues. Officer Gordon testified that he observed Defendant and another individual \"at a room where [he] saw the runners come and go from,\" and that he then observed Defendant and the other individual talk to the runners who were hanging out in front of the room. On cross-examination, Officer Gordon testified that he saw Defendant in the area of the runners and testified that Defendant \"appeared to come from the room that [the runners] were coming and going from.\" The Court asked Officer Gordon to clarify whether he saw Defendant come out of the room or come from the area of the entrance of the room. Officer Gordon first clarified that he was not directly facing the rooms and was, instead, looking straight down the wall of the hallway. Then, Officer Gordon responded, \"[h]e appeared to be coming from the same place [the runners] had been coming and going from.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   After reviewing Officer Gordon's testimony, the Court remains unclear about exactly what Officer Gordon observed. At times Officer Gordon testified that he thought he saw Defendant leave the room being surveilled. At other times Officer Gordon testified that he saw Defendant in the vicinity of the door of the room. There was certainly no testimony about how long Defendant was in the room (if at all). Perhaps the lack of clarity in Officer Gordon's testimony is attributable to the length of time since Defendant's arrest. This temporal limitation is likely exacerbated by the lack of any police report documenting Officer Gordon's observations. Indeed, Officer Gordon testified that he did not write a police report outlining the details of his observations on the evening of Defendant's arrest. Similarly, Corporal Miller testified that, while he did write a police report, it did not include any operational details from Officer Gordon's observations at the Sea Mist Resort.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Corporal Miller acknowledged during his testimony that he smelled no marijuana emanating from Defendant's car, that Defendant did not appear nervous, and that Defendant did not lie and was not evasive during the traffic stop. Indeed, in many cases, officers go to great lengths to articulate innocuous facts to bolster an apparent finding of reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus, Defendant had an entirely plausible explanation for his presence at the hotel.

While Officer Gordon did observe a number of hand-to-hand drug transactions at the Sea Mist Resort, he did not observe Defendant participating in any of these transactions. Nor did he observe Defendant definitively enter or exit any room, much less the room where the drug runners were coming from. Instead, Officer Gordon merely observed Defendant in the vicinity of a high crime, open air drug market, conversing with other individuals in public.

The Fifth Circuit rejected the Government's argument, holding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   Visiting a house linked to drug activity is similar to being in a high-crime area. While a person's presence in an area known to be high in crime is a relevant contextual consideration in the reasonable suspicion analysis, such presence, standing alone, is not enough to support a reasonable suspicion that anybody found there is involved with drugs. Likewise, the fact that [the defendant] visited [Loera's house], which was linked to drug activity in several ways, is relevant; however, this fact alone is not enough to support a reasonable suspicion that he is involved with drugs. Significantly, neither [the defendant] nor his truck were known to the officers before he visited [Loera's house], and he had not previously been identified as a suspect connected with drug activity, [Loera's house], or Loera. Also, the officers did not observe [the defendant] take any action besides parking in the driveway; specifically, they did not see [the defendant] exit his truck, enter or exit [Loera's house], or talk to Loera. Thus, the officers had no way of differentiating [the defendant] from a law-abiding visitor-for example, a maintenance technician visiting to work on the house, or a relative visiting for social purposes only. For these reasons, additional suspicious activity is needed to give rise to a reasonable suspicion that [the defendant] had committed or was about to commit a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225122\" index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/636/893/#p895\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Further, the Fifth Circuit later evaluated the remaining factors, such as,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's nervousness, a backpack inside the defendant's vehicle, and the defendant's alleged lie to officers during the traffic stop, and determined that \"the totality of circumstances that existed both before the stop and during the initial sixteen and a half minutes of the stop did not create a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225122\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/636/893/#p895\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225122\" index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/636/893/#p895\">\n    at 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court agrees with the reasoning of the\n   <em>\n    Spears\n   </em>\n   court and finds it particularly instructive in this case. Officer Gordon and Corporal Miller based their reasonable suspicion finding solely on Defendant's presence near the hotel room at the Sea Mist Resort and Defendant's interaction with the runners and the unknown male driving the red Cadillac. The Court finds that these facts, taken individually and collectively, are insufficient to constitute reasonable suspicion. This decision is in accord with many other Courts, including several Fourth Circuit decisions detailed above, that find that an individual's presence in a high crime area simply does not\n   establish reasonable suspicion. The other incidental facts present here-including Defendant speaking to the runners and an unknown male-are innocuous and not demonstrably linked to any criminal activity\n   <em>\n    on the part of Defendant.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court understands that law enforcement has a difficult and dangerous job, and commends Officer Gordon and Corporal Miller for their candor during the suppression hearing. Often, drug interdiction efforts are fluid situations that require on-the-fly judgments by experienced police officers. The Fourth Amendment, however, requires law enforcement to have more than a hunch to detain an individual after a traffic stop is completed. Instead, officers must have objective, reasonable suspicion that the individual is involved in drug activity. Under the totality of the circumstances, the Court holds that Officer Gordon and Corporal Miller's testimony does not rise to the level of reasonable, articulable suspicion necessary to justify the detention of Defendant beyond the conclusion of the traffic stop. Thus, the Court must suppress the evidence seized during the search of Defendant's vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   For these reasons, Defendant's Motion to Suppress, ECF No. 43, is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The Government presented no evidence about the result of the traffic stop on the red Cadillac.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Judge Gregory concurred in part with the majority's determination that the district court erred by analyzing the Trooper's interactions with the defendant as two separate incidents.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 788-89 (Gregory, J., dissenting)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    <em>\n     Miranda v.
