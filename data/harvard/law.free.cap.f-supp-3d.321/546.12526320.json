The aesthetic design of the products does not serve as a basis for Britax's patent infringement claims because the patents concern structural features of car seats. Furthermore, accepting Defendants' characterization of the facts, the employee's actions do not constitute manufacturing or use of the product.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N. Am.

Although Nuna B.V. owns the website, Britax fails to show that Nuna B.V. actually sold or offers for sale any infringing product in the United States through the website. Additionally, a user's mere access of a website in a forum, absent a company's affirmative targeting of that forum, is insufficient to confer personal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marvel Mfg.

Wis. June 27, 2012). Furthermore, the sending of promotional emails is still insufficient, even if sent to customers around the nation, because Britax does not allege that such marketing tactics concerned the alleged infringing product or were actually sent by Nuna B.V. The analysis of Nuna B.V.'s employee in Pennsylvania is the same as above, predominantly because Britax does not allege that the employee travels anywhere else in the country and does not suggest any other type of contact with the United States. The conclusion remains the same: the employee's contact with Pennsylvania and the nation as a whole does not give rise to nor relate to Britax's patent infringement claims based on the facts alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Although Britax insists that Nuna B.V. makes sales to residents of the United States, the record does not distinguish whether Nuna B.V. or Nuna B.E. makes the sales. And because the present record lacks sufficient facts to find an agency relationship between Nuna B.V. and Nuna B.E., the Court cannot determine whether any sales by Nuna B.E. can be imputed to Nuna B.V. for purposes of specific jurisdiction. Nuna B.V. specifically argues that it does not sell the accused product in Pennsylvania or elsewhere in the United States. Gerhart Aff. \u00b6 15, ECF No. 23, Ex. 2. Without facts demonstrating sales by Nuna B.V., and because the corporate veil is not easily pierced, the Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Britax's additional argument that Nuna B.V.'s holding a United States patent confers personal jurisdiction fails. Britax fails to allege facts that show\n   <em>\n    Nuna B.V.'s\n   </em>\n   United States patent gives rise to or relates to claims asserting the infringement of\n   <em>\n    Britax's\n   </em>\n   patent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Venmill Indus., Inc. v.

Jurisdiction may depend upon the nature of the relationship between Nuna B.V. and Nuna B.E., Nuna B.V.'s employee's activities in Pennsylvania, and the relative roles of the two entities in operating the website. This Court cannot say that Britax presents a frivolous claim and Britax should be given the opportunity to develop these facts.
