She and her family members, Alexis Lewis, Margrett Lewis, and Jeffrey Lewis, brought suit against the manufacturer, EcoSmart, Inc. (\"EcoSmart\"), and its parent company The Fire Company, Pty, Ltd. (\"TFC\"), and were awarded damages in excess of $45 million. EcoSmart has since declared bankruptcy and plaintiffs now bring this action against EcoSmart and TFC's insurers, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and Liberty International Underwriters (together, \"Liberty Mutual\"), seeking payment on their damages award. The insurance policy contains a mandatory forum selection clause granting exclusive jurisdiction to the Australian Courts, and so Liberty Mutual moves to dismiss on\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   grounds so that the case is litigated in Australia. Because the clause is valid and its enforcement is not unreasonable or unjust, I am constrained to GRANT Liberty Mutual's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 8, 2014, twin sisters Nicolette and Alexis Lewis were using the fire bowl at their home in Sonoma, California. Complaint (\"Compl.\") [Dkt. No. 1-1] \u00b6 6. Alexis was refueling the bowl with a one-gallon fuel container of e-NRG when the vapors from the container ignited and caused an explosive discharge of ethanol fuel and fire, engulfing Nicolette in flames and causing severe third degree burns to her face, neck, chest, arms, legs, and feet.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As their parents Jeffrey and Margrett Lewis rushed to her to attempt to put out the flames, they too suffered burn injuries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. Nicolette spent 30 days in the hospital with life threatening injuries and required multiple surgical procedures, laser treatments, and other medical care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The fuel container was manufactured by EcoSmart, a California corporation headquartered in California.

Liberty Mutual issued an insurance policy to EcoSmart and TFC covering negligence and product defects resulting in bodily injury with a coverage period of April 20, 2013 to April 30, 2014. Compl. \u00b6 11. EcoSmart and TFC renewed that policy from April 30, 2014 to April 30, 2015, but coverage under the second policy period substantially reduced coverage limits.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both policies contained a mandatory forum selection clause granting exclusive jurisdiction to the Australian Courts over all matters arising from or relating to the construction, operation, or interpretation of the policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Milliken Decl. Ex. 1, at \u00a7 8.6; Nicholls Decl.

Liberty Mutual declined to provide a defense and indemnification in that case, and EcoSmart filed for bankruptcy on November 8, 2015, as a result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14. TFC ignored the litigation. Opp. at 4. On January 9, 2018, a judgment in excess of $45 million was entered against EcoSmart and in favor of plaintiffs. Compl. \u00b6 15.

In\n   <em>\n    Haisten\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit reviewed whether the district court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over a Cayman Island insurance company, and noted that \"the state has a manifest interest in providing its residents with a forum for reaching insurance companies who refuse to honor legitimate claims,\" evidenced by Section 11580.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6126584,1548205\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/784/1392/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6126584,1548205\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/784/1392/\">\n    at 1399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But\n   <em>\n    Haisten\n   </em>\n   concerns personal jurisdiction; there, the plaintiff would have had\n   no remedy at all against the insurer under Cayman Island law. It does not stand for the proposition that Section 11580 represents a public policy that relates specifically to venue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 11580 states only that \"whenever judgment is secured against the insured or the executor or administrator of a deceased insured in an action based upon bodily injury, death, or property damage, then an action may be brought....\" The public policy expressed in this section is that plaintiffs have\n   <em>\n    an\n   </em>\n   avenue for relief, but not specifically one in California. As Liberty notes, Australian law has a similar provision that provides plaintiffs with the same ability to bring such an action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rep. at 11 (citing\n   <em>\n    Civil Liability (Third Party Claims Against Insurers) Act 2018\n   </em>\n   (NSW) (Aust.)
