In response, the Government has filed a Motion to Dismiss Count Two (Doc. No. 103), leaving the receipt count for sentencing.

This closer link to the market and its attendant harms is important because \"[a] person who receives these images 'furthers the market ... whether or not the person retains them.' \" ... \"Indeed, even a person who receives the images and never gets around to viewing them still causes these harms.' \" Possession alone, however, does not necessarily contribute to the market, and \"[b]ecause the harms flowing from possession of child pornography differ from those associated with distribution and receipt, differentiating levels of punishment should not be unexpected.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The possessor who creates his own pornography strictly for his personal use is not part of the interstate and international traffic in child pornography, a traffic that not only increases the demand for the production of such pornography but, by virtue of its far-flung scope, makes it extremely difficult to locate, let alone protect, the children exploited by it.

He did so with full awareness that the receipt count carried a five year mandatory sentence. That mandatory sentence was set forth in bold font in the Plea Petition (Doc. No. 83), and was confirmed at the plea hearing. Further, during the plea colloquy, Austin was told by the Court that five years was the minimum sentence, he should expect that the sentence calculation would begin with that number as the baseline, and that, while the worst-case scenario was 20 years, the minimum would be at least five years. Austin clearly and unequivocally acknowledged his understanding of the five year minimum sentence. He is not in a position to argue that his sentence should be less than that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Austin has filed a 46-page Sentencing Memorandum (Doc. No.97), together with a 12-page appendix that notes the increased harshness in the sentencing guidelines for child pornography over the years. The Sentencing Memorandum argues that U.S.S.G \u00a7 2G2.2 pertaining to child pornography cases wholly overstates the crime in a possession case. Among other things, \u00a7 2G2.2 calls for increases based upon the number of images involved, including dictating that videos constitute 75 images. It also increases sentences where (1) the material involves prepubescent minors; (2) the material portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct; and (3) a computer is used. Austin argues that virtually all child pornography cases now involve computers given the Internet, and this ease of access has resulted in those types of enhancement applying in virtually every case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The arguments raised by Austin have become the norm in child pornography cases and this is hardly surprising. Section 2G2.2 has been described as \"an eccentric Guideline of highly unusual provenance which, unless carefully applied, can easily generate unreasonable results.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Dorvee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3768074\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/616/174/#p188\">\n    616 F.3d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188 (2d Cir. 2010). Indeed, \"[r]ecognizing the flaws in this guideline, judges across the country have declined to impose sentence within the range it recommends.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Diaz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4087284\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/720/1039/#p1041\">\n    720 F.Supp.2d 1039\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1041 (E.D.

That said, the Sixth Circuit has held that it will \"scrutinize closely\" a district court's conclusion to disagree with \u00a7 2G2.2 on policy grounds.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the low end of the guideline range this would result in an 87% to 93% reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   That can only be achieved if the receipt count is dismissed. Otherwise, Austin is looking at a minimum sentence of 60 months, which itself would be a significant (38%) departure from the low end of the guidelines.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Despite Austin's best efforts to put a gloss on it, he did not stumble across child pornography and, curiosity piqued, make the mistake of keeping it, nor was he a mere casual purveyor of child pornography. He actively sought out such pornography for many years, if not decades. According to statements he made to investigating agents, he began viewing child pornography a couple of times a week when he was around 20 (he is now 39), meaning that his interest continued for almost 20 years until he was caught. When doing so, he visualized himself having sexual intercourse with the child depicted, and would masturbate. While he has denied making some of those statements, he cannot deny that, according to the Indictment to which he pled guilty, he received child pornography from at least the middle of 2009, until the fall of 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   To find child pornography, Austin did not limit his search to the typical search engines (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Google, Yahoo Search, or Bing), but instead ventured into the \"dark web\" utilizing Tor software (a/k/a the Onion Router) searching for PTCH (\"pre-teen hardcore\"). He also admitted to using peer-to-peer sharing software, such as \"Limewire\" and \"Bearshare\" to access child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   When agents searched Austin's bedroom, they found 8 thumbdrives containing child pornography. A forensic examination revealed that, all totaled, those drives contained 5,234 still images, and 346 videos, which, in Guideline parlance, translates to 31,180 images (346 X 75 = 25,950 + 5,230 = 31,180). Some of the images were of girls as young as eight years of age, and, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children as set forth in the Presentence Report, his collection depicted children from 23 different series. More than 100 of the images depicted the rape of children, while 33 filed depicted the bondage of children. Even if that sort of child pornography is easily found on the Internet, Austin made the conscious choice to download and retain it for future viewing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Ever since\n   <em>\n    United States v.
