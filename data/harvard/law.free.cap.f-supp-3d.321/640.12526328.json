Special prosecutors are not an unfamiliar feature of the American legal landscape; indeed special prosecutors were ubiquitous in the 1980s and 1990s, albeit under a different statutory regime. In the wake of Watergate and the so-called Saturday Night Massacre, Congress enacted the first iteration of the independent counsel statute, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-521,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Stat.%201824\">\n    92 Stat. 1824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20591\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 598 ) (the 1978 Act). The intended purpose of the 1978 Act was to create a mechanism for the investigation and prosecution of high-ranking government officials. Although originally enacted with a five-year sunset provision, Congress revised and reauthorized the 1978 Act in 1983 and again in 1987. In 1988, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the 1978 Act despite substantial separation-of-powers challenges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison v.

Finally, in the event the Attorney General concluded that \"there are reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted,\" then the Attorney General was required by the 1994 Reauthorization Act to apply to the D.C. Circuit for the appointment of an independent counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 592(c)(1).

The lawmakers at that time concluded that the 1994 Reauthorization Act was seriously flawed in several important respects as experience had shown. Indeed, in her testimony before the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, then-Attorney General Janet Reno testified that the statute was \"structurally flawed\" because the independent counsel was unaccountable, \"not...confirmed by the Senate, and...not typically subject to the same sort of oversight or budget constraints that the Department [of Justice (DOJ) ] faces[.]\"\n   <em>\n    The Future of the Independent Counsel Act: Hearings Before the S. Comm. on Gov't Affairs\n   </em>\n   , 106th Cong. 249 (1999) (statement of Janet Reno, Attorney General). Significantly, former independent counsel Kenneth Starr expressed a similar view, stating that the statute was both \"structurally unsound\" and \"constitutionally dubious.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20591\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20591\">\n    at 425, 433\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (statement of Kenneth Starr, former independent counsel). Both Republicans and Democrats had come to the conclusion\n   that in practice the 1994 Reauthorization Act and its predecessors had become more often a political weapon to be unleashed in the ongoing, indeed escalating culture wars, than a tool for ferreting out and prosecuting crimes ostensibly committed by high-ranking government officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   But the expiration of the 1978 Act did not end the appointment of \"independent\" counsel to investigate and prosecute crimes allegedly committed by high-level members of the Executive Branch. Later in 1999, the DOJ, acting pursuant to distinct statutory authority,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   promulgated regulations \"to replace the procedures set out in the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994.\"\n   <em>\n    Office of Special Counsel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2037038\">\n    64 Fed.

Olson\n   </em>\n   are largely cured by the present appointment structure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the regulations do not require\n   the Special Counsel's investigation to be limited as to time\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   or budget. Thus, to provide a Special Counsel with a large budget and to tell him or her to find crimes allows a Special Counsel to pursue his or her targets without the usual time and budget constraints facing ordinary prosecutors, encouraging substantial elements of the public to conclude that the Special Counsel is being deployed as a political weapon.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, although the regulations require the Attorney General to provide a Special Counsel with a factual statement of the matters to be investigated, notably missing from the regulation is any requirement that the Attorney General specify any particular crime or statutes that are believed to have been violated. The failure to specify to the Special Counsel the types of crimes and statutes involved contributes to the public perception that appointment of a Special Counsel is wielded as a political weapon, not as a tool for prosecuting specific crimes believed to have been committed by high-ranking officials as to which the DOJ has a conflict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Furthermore, the Special Counsel regulations' failure to require identification of specific crimes creates strong incentives for Special Counsel to allege that those individuals have committed criminal acts, even if the criminal acts the Special Counsel ultimately prosecutes are unrelated to the original reasons for appointing the Special Counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a Special Counsel discovers\n   no criminal activity then the investigation is likely to be perceived as a waste of time and resources, and thus a Special Counsel has a strong incentive to find criminality and to prosecute criminal conduct by the people he has been charged with investigating-here persons connected with the Trump campaign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cass R. Sunstein,\n   <em>\n    Bad Incentives and Bad Institutions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=86%20Geo.%20L.J.%202267\">\n    86 Geo.

The 1994 Reauthorization Act included a number of provisions requiring progress reports to Congress,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and requiring that the independent counsel adhere to DOJ policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   None of these\n   <em>\n    statutory\n   </em>\n   limitations or oversight mechanisms exists for the current Special Counsel regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In sum, there appears to be little operational difference between the current Special Counsel appointment scheme and the scheme found wanting under the 1978 Act and its reauthorizations. Both schemes are subject to many of the same objections. Like the independent counsel under the 1978 Act, the current Special Counsel has broad authority to investigate and prosecute crimes unburdened by traditional limits placed on an ordinary prosecutor. Many of the same problems that plagued investigations pursued under the 1978 Act-from Kenneth Starr's investigation of Whitewater to Lawrence Walsh's investigation of Iran-Contra-seem equally applicable to the current process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the end, Congress and members of both political parties reached the sound conclusion that the 1978 Act and its reauthorizations should be allowed to expire, as the Act had come to be a tool for pursuing partisan agendas rather\n   than a means of assuring accountability in government by prosecuting crimes committed by high-ranking government officials. That lesson, it seems, has been forgotten.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    It is important to note that despite the fact that\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    was decided 7-1, Justice Scalia's dissent presented a compelling and powerful argument against the constitutionality of the 1978 Act. Beginning with an eloquent description of the Founders' motivations in enshrining separation of powers principles in the Constitution, Justice Scalia's dissent went on to describe the ways in which the 1978 Act infringed upon Executive power:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    the [independent counsel's] investigation ...was commenced, not necessarily because the President or his authorized subordinates believe it is in the interest of the United States, in the sense that it warrants the diversion of resources from other efforts, and is worth the cost in money and in possible damage to other governmental interests; and not even, leaving aside those normally considered factors, because the President or his authorized subordinates necessarily believe that an investigation is likely to unearth a violation worth prosecuting; but only because the Attorney General cannot affirm, as Congress demands, that there are no reasonable grounds to believe that further investigation is warranted. The decisions regarding the scope of that further investigation, its duration, and, finally, whether or not prosecution should ensue, are likewise beyond the control of the President and his subordinates.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Morrison\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     487 U.S. at 703\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1775126\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/487/654/\">\n     108 S.Ct. 2597\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Scalia, J., dissenting). According to Justice Scalia, \"[i]f to describe this case is not to decide it, the concept of a government of separate and coordinate powers no longer has meaning\" because \"it is ultimately irrelevant how much the statute reduces Presidential control\"; any impingement on Presidential control over the Executive Branch was unconstitutional. Justice Scalia also noted significant Appointments Clause problems with the 1978 Act, arguing that the independent counsel was not an inferior officer because neither the President nor the Attorney General could remove the independent counsel. Ultimately, however, Chief Justice Rehnquist and the other Justices involved in the case were not of the same mind as Justice Scalia, and the Court ruled 7-1 that the 1978 Act passed constitutional muster, including the Appointments Clause.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Covered persons under the 1994 Reauthorization Act included the President, Vice President, Attorney General, any Assistant Attorney General, the Director of the CIA, the Deputy Director of the CIA, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the heads of the cabinet departments, and the chairman and treasurers of the principal national campaign committees seeking election or reelection of the President.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20591\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 591\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).

Thus, the only issue is whether the Special Counsel's investigation and prosecution of the matters contained in the Superseding Indictment falls within the valid grant of jurisdiction contained in \u00b6 b(i) of the May 17 Appointment Order.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    It does; the Special Counsel's investigation of defendant falls squarely within the jurisdiction outlined in \u00b6 b(i) of the May 17 Appointment Order, and because \u00b6 b(i) was an appropriate grant of authority, there is no basis for dismissal of the Superseding Indictment on this ground. Specifically, in the May 17 Appointment Order, the Acting Attorney General authorized the Special Counsel to investigate, among other things, \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump ....\" May 17 Appointment Order \u00b6 (b)(i). It is undisputed that defendant is an \"individual[ ] associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump[;]\" indeed, defendant served as the chairman of President Donald Trump's campaign from March 2016 until August 2016. Moreover, the Special Counsel's investigation focused on potential links between defendant and the Russian government. In particular, the Special Counsel investigated defendant's political consulting work on behalf of, and receipt of substantial payments from, then-President Victor Yanukovych of the Ukraine and the Party of Regions, Yanukovych's pro-Russian political party in the Ukraine.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Superseding Indictment \u00b6\u00b6 10-11. To be sure, history is replete with evidence of the existing and longstanding antagonism between the Ukraine and Russia. Indeed, armed conflict in the eastern Ukraine is still underway.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n    Nonetheless, the fact that\n    the Yanukovych was a strongly pro-Russian President warranted the investigation here. The fact that the Russian government did not make payments to defendant directly is not determinative because the text of the May 17 Appointment Order authorizes investigation of \"\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.\" May 17 Appointment Order \u00b6 (b)(i) (emphasis added).\n    <footnotemark>\n     20\n    </footnotemark>\n    Given that, as the Supreme Court has recognized, the term \"any\" \"has an expansive meaning, that is, 'one or some indiscriminately of whatever kind[,]' \"\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n    the May 17 Appointment Order plainly authorizes the investigation of indirect links between Trump campaign officials and the Russian government in addition to more direct connections. In this regard, the May 17 Appointment Order authorizes the Special Counsel to investigate defendant's ties with individuals financially and politically supported by the Russian government, even where, as here, those individuals are not themselves members of the Russian government.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Defendant argues that the Special Counsel's investigation cannot possibly fall within \u00b6 b(i) of the May 17 Appointment Order because the crimes for which defendant was ultimately prosecuted, namely bank fraud and failure to file tax returns, do not involve election interference. At first glance, this argument appears to have some force. After all, defendant argues that the stated reason for the appointment of a Special Counsel was to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 Presidential election. But, upon further review, it becomes clear that this argument misunderstands the structure of the May 17 Appointment Order and the difference between the Special Counsel's investigative and prosecutorial authority. Paragraph b(i) describes the subject of the Special Counsel's\n    <em>\n     investigative\n    </em>\n    authority, namely \"any links\" between President Trump campaign officials and the Russian government. May 17 Appointment Order \u00b6 b(i). Paragraph (c) of the May 17 Appointment Order then describes the Special Counsel's\n    <em>\n     prosecutorial\n    </em>\n    authority, authorizing the Special Counsel \"to prosecute federal crimes arising from these matters\" if the Special Counsel \"believes [prosecution] is necessary and appropriate.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201344\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 (c). The May 17 Appointment Order does not limit the Special Counsel's prosecution authority to federal crimes concerning election interference or collusion; rather, the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes that arise out of his authorized investigation. And the crimes charged in the Superseding Indictment clearly arise out of the Special Counsel's investigation into the payments defendant allegedly received from Russian-backed leaders and pro-Russian political officials. Specifically, the Special Counsel \"followed the money\" paid by pro-Russian officials to defendant, and as a result, claimed to have found evidence that defendant was deliberately hiding these payments from U.S. authorities by disguising the payments as loans from offshore corporate entities and by\n    depositing the payments in offshore accounts and using those accounts to make payments to purchase and to make improvements to U.S. real estate.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Superseding Indictment \u00b6 2. Based on this, the Special Counsel charged defendant with subscribing to false tax returns, failing to report foreign bank accounts, bank fraud, and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    In sum, \u00b6 (b)(i) of the May 17 Appointment Order makes clear that the Special Counsel's investigation into the payments defendant received from Russian-backed Ukrainian officials was authorized because the investigation involved potential links between a Trump campaign official-the defendant-and the Russian government via the Russian-backed Ukrainian President. The May 17 Appointment Order also confirms that the Special Counsel was authorized to prosecute the crimes alleged in the Superseding Indictment because evidence of these alleged crimes was uncovered as part of the Special Counsel's aforementioned investigation. Given that defendant concedes that the Acting Attorney General appropriately exercised his authority in authorizing this jurisdiction in the May 17 Appointment Order, defendant's argument for dismissal of the Superseding Indictment is unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Even assuming,\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    , that the Special Counsel's investigation and the subsequent prosecution of defendant were not authorized by the plain text of \u00b6 (b)(i) of the May 17 Appointment Order, the August 2 Scope Memorandum reflects that the Special Counsel was acting within his authority when he sought and obtained the Superseding Indictment against defendant in February 2018. The August 2 Scope Memorandum explains that the May 17 Appointment Order's description of the Special Counsel's authority was \"worded categorically in order to permit its public release.\" August 2 Scope Memorandum at 1. The August 2 Scope Memorandum then goes on to provide additional detail regarding the Special Counsel's authority, explaining that allegations that defendant \"[c]ommitted a crime or crimes arising out of payments he received from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Viktor Yanukovych\" \"are within the scope of the [Appointment] Order[.]\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201344\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201344\">\n     at 2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    No interpretive gymnastics are necessary to determine that the investigation at issue here falls within this category of allegations described in the August 2 Scope Memorandum. Indeed, the Superseding Indictment alleges that defendant \"generated tens of millions of dollars income as a result of [his] Ukraine work\" and that from approximately 2006 through the present, defendant \"engaged in a scheme to hide [that] income from United States authorities[.]\" Superseding Indictment \u00b6 2. Thus, the Superseding Indictment alleges that defendant committed a crime by engaging in a scheme to hide the payments he received from the Ukrainian government beginning in 2006, before the election of President Yanukovych, and continuing during President Yaunkovych's tenure and through the present. Accordingly, the plain text of the August 2 Scope Memorandum makes clear that the Special Counsel was authorized to conduct the investigation and to seek the Superseding Indictment at issue here.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    In sum, the parties agree that the Acting Attorney General properly delegated to the Special Counsel the authority to investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump ....\" May 17 Appointment Order \u00b6 b(i). And it is clear from the text of the May 17 Appointment Order that the Special Counsel's investigation\n    into defendant, the former chairman of the Trump campaign, and in particular defendant's receipt of payments from Russian-backed officials in the Ukrainian government falls within this appropriately-delegated prosecutorial authority. To the extent the broadly-worded May 17 Appointment Order is lacking in clarity, the August 2 Scope Memorandum seeks to remedy this by stating explicitly that the Special Counsel is authorized to investigate defendant's payments from the Ukrainian government before and during the tenure of President Yanukovych.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    August 2 Scope Memorandum at 1-2. Given that the Special Counsel was authorized to conduct the investigation and to prosecute the violations in the Superseding Indictment, dismissal of the Superseding Indictment is not warranted and defendant's motion must be denied on this ground alone.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     III.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Given that the Special Counsel was authorized to investigate and to prosecute this matter pursuant to \u00b6 (b)(i) of the May 17 Appointment Order and the August 2 Scope Memorandum, that conclusion is dispositive and defendant's arguments with respect to \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order need not be addressed. But they are addressed for purposes of completeness.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Assuming,\n    <em>\n     arguendo\n    </em>\n    , that \u00b6 b(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order is implicated, this question is a closer one. Paragraph (b)(ii) authorizes the Special Counsel to investigate \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" May 17 Appointment Order \u00b6 b(ii). Defendant contends this paragraph exceeds the Acting Attorney General's authority to establish the Special Counsel's jurisdiction pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    because \u00b6 (b)(ii) confers unlimited additional, not original, jurisdiction without the required oversight of the Acting Attorney General. The Special Counsel opposes this argument, contending (i) that the line between original and additional jurisdiction is not as distinct as defendant suggests and (ii) that \u00b6 (b)(ii) cabins the Special Counsel's authority in a manner consistent with the Special Counsel regulations.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    The question whether the Acting Attorney General complied with\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    when he granted the Special Counsel the authority described in \u00b6 b(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order is close. On the one hand, as defendant correctly notes, the Special Counsel regulations distinguish between the Special Counsel's original and additional jurisdiction. With respect to the Special Counsel's original jurisdiction, \u00a7 600.4(a) requires that the Special Counsel \"be provided with a specific factual statement of the matter to be investigated.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a).

Accordingly, in defendant's view, any matter not falling within one of these three categories, including the matters described in \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order, necessarily constitutes additional jurisdiction and can only be assigned to the Special Counsel after consultation with, and approval by, the Attorney General.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    On the other hand, the Special Counsel correctly notes that the text of \u00a7 600.4 neither expressly limits the scope of the Special Counsel's original jurisdiction, nor does it establish a strict boundary line between original and additional jurisdiction. And the Special Counsel contends that such sharp limitations and divisions would require the Special Counsel to consult the Attorney General with respect to every incremental action the Special Counsel anticipated taking as the facts developed in his or her investigation. In this regard, defendant's interpretation of \u00a7 600.4 would lead to results inconsistent with other sections of the Special Counsel's regulations, which make clear that the Special Counsel \"shall not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official of the [DOJ].\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353857\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/55/#p65\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 600.7(b).\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The government also argues that \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order is not, as defendant suggests, a \"blank check\" granting the Special Counsel unlimited and unreviewable authority. Def't. Mot. at 14. Indeed, the text of \u00b6 (b)(ii) circumscribes the Special Counsel's authority in two key ways: (i) by requiring that the matter at issue \"arise from\" the Special Counsel's investigation and (ii) by requiring that the matter arise \"directly\" from this investigation. May 17 Appointment Order \u00b6 (b)(ii). In this regard, the Special Counsel is not entitled to investigate and prosecute criminal conduct that is entirely incidental to, or disconnected from, the specific factual statement of matters to be investigated; rather, the Special Counsel is entitled to investigate only those matters that arise \"in the usual or regular course or order\" of investigating the matters included in the specific factual statement.\n    <em>\n     Black's Law Dictionary\n    </em>\n    557 (10th ed. 2014).\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Special Counsel regulations also make clear that the Special Counsel remains subject to the Attorney General's oversight following the Special Counsel's appointment, notwithstanding the specific grant of original jurisdiction. For example, the regulations require the Special Counsel (i) to \"comply with the rules, regulations, procedures, practices, and policies of the [DOJ,]\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.7\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.7\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), and (ii) to \"notify the Attorney General of events\n    in the course of his or her investigation in conformity with the Departmental guidelines with respect to Urgent Reports[,]\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.7\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 600.8. And importantly, the Attorney General \"may request that the Special Counsel provide an explanation for any investigative or prosecutorial step, and may after review conclude that the action is so inappropriate or unwarranted under established Departmental practices that it should not be pursued.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.7\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 600.7(b).

In sum, because \u00b6 (b)(ii) itself and the regulations cabin the Special Counsel's authority, the Special Counsel argues that defendant's concern that \u00b6 (b)(ii) grants unlimited and unreviewable discretion to the Special Counsel is unfounded.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In the end, it is unnecessary to resolve the question whether \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order, which authorizes the Special Counsel to investigate \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,\" is an improper grant of original jurisdiction for two reasons. First, as described\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , the Special Counsel's investigation and prosecution of defendant is supported by \u00b6 (b)(i) of the May 17 Appointment Order. Second, the record makes clear that the Acting Attorney General has required the Special Counsel to consult with the Acting Attorney General before investigating matters that might fall under \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order. Specifically, the August 2 Scope Memorandum, consistent with\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , identifies specific factual matters to be investigated by the Special Counsel, including allegations that defendant \"[c]omitted a crime or crimes by colluding with Russian government officials with respect to the Russian government's efforts to interfere with the 2016 election for President of the United States, in violation of United States law[.]\" August 2 Scope Memorandum at 2. And notably, the August 2 Scope Memorandum limits the Special Counsel's ability to investigate \"additional matters that otherwise may have arisen or may arise directly from the Investigation\" by requiring the Special Counsel to \"consult [the Acting Attorney General] for a determination of whether such matters should be within the scope of [the Special Counsel's] authority.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     at 3\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Thus, for the matters encompassed in \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order, namely \"matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation,\" the Acting Attorney General has required the Special Counsel to follow precisely the procedures the Special Counsel must follow should he wish to request additional jurisdiction. Put differently, it is immaterial whether \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order was actually a grant of additional jurisdiction because the Acting Attorney General has required the Special Counsel to follow the procedures for gaining additional jurisdiction should the Special Counsel wish to exercise the authority set out in \u00b6 (b)(ii).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    In sum, whether \u00b6 (b)(ii) of the May 17 Appointment Order is a valid grant of original jurisdiction pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) is a close question; defendant's argument that \u00b6 (b)(ii) grants overbroad original jurisdiction is not without some merit.

Specifically, defendant argues that a Special Counsel, appointed in a manner that violates the Special Counsel regulations, does not have the requisite legal authority to represent the United States in investigating and prosecuting this case. But this argument misidentifies the source of the Special Counsel's legal authority. The Special Counsel's legal authority is not grounded in the procedural regulations at issue here, but in the Constitution and in the statutes that vest the authority to conduct criminal litigation in the Attorney General and authorize the Attorney General to delegate these functions when necessary. And because the Special Counsel was appointed in a manner consistent with both these sources of legal authority, there is no basis for dismissal of the Superseding Indictment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    To begin with, the parties do not dispute that the Special Counsel's appointment was consistent with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution, which empowers Congress to vest appointment of \"inferior officers,\" in the \"president alone\" or in \"heads of departments.\" U.S. Const. art.

First, the\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    Court considered an issue different from the issue in this case; instead of deciding whether the special prosecutor there had legal authority to conduct criminal litigation, the\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    Court considered whether the political question doctrine barred judicial review of conflicts between the special prosecutor and the President. Specifically, the\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    Court had to determine whether the President's attempt to quash a special prosecutor's subpoena was an intrabranch conflict concerning delegation of authority or a case or controversy capable of resolution by the judiciary. As such,\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    is inapposite inasmuch as the holding there did not adjudicate the legal authority of a special prosecutor.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Even assuming\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    's discussion of the political question doctrine was to govern here,\n    <em>\n     Nixon\n    </em>\n    is distinguishable because the regulation at issue there appointed a special prosecutor and specifically defined that special prosecutor's authority.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/\">\n     at 694-96\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6174416\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/418/683/\">\n     94 S.Ct. 3090\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

By contrast, defendant here is not attempting to enforce a regulation delegating specific authority to the Special Counsel; rather, defendant is attempting to enforce a more general regulation governing the process by which the DOJ allocates authority and divides responsibility internally.

Moreover, a violation of the Special Counsel regulations would not deprive the Special Counsel of the requisite legal authority to investigate and prosecute this matter because the Special Counsel's appointment was consistent with both the Constitution and relevant federal statutes, and the Constitution and federal statutes do not mandate that the Attorney General adopt any particular procedures prior to appointing a Special Counsel. Accordingly, dismissal of the Superseding Indictment is not appropriate here, and for this reason, as well as those described\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , defendant's motion must be denied.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    <strong>\n     V.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    In sum, dismissal of the Superseding Indictment on the grounds urged by defendant is not warranted here. But that conclusion should not be read as approval of the practice of appointing Special Counsel to prosecute cases of alleged high-level misconduct. Here, we have a prosecution of a campaign official, not a government official, for acts that occurred well before the Presidential election. To be sure, it is plausible, indeed ultimately persuasive here, to argue that the investigation and prosecution has some relevance to the election which occurred months if not years after the alleged misconduct. But in the end, that fact does not warrant dismissal of the Superseding Indictment. The Constitution's system of checks and balances, reflected to some extent in the regulations at issue, are designed to ensure that no single individual or branch of government has plenary or absolute power. The appointment of special prosecutors has the potential to disrupt these checks and balances, and to inject a level of toxic partisanship into investigation of matters of public importance.\n    <footnotemark>\n     27\n    </footnotemark>\n    This case is a reminder that ultimately, our system of checks and balances and limitations on each branch's powers, although exquisitely designed, ultimately works only if people of virtue, sensitivity, and courage, not affected by the winds of public opinion, choose to work within the confines of the law. Let us hope that the people in charge of this prosecution, including the Special Counsel and the Assistant Attorney General, are such people. Although this case will\n    continue, those involved should be sensitive to the danger unleashed when political disagreements are transformed into partisan prosecutions.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"13\">\n    <p id=\"p-92\">\n     On March 2, 2017, the Attorney General recused himself \"from any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States.\" Press Release, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Attorney General Sessions Statement on Recusal (Mar. 2, 2017), https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/attorney-general-sessions-statement-recusal.
