Randall's (\"Plaintiff\") Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 46), and Defendants' Motion to Strike Portions of the Plaintiff's Reply in Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 56).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff is a resident of Pinal County and is employed by the Casa Grande Elementary School District. (Doc. 46 at 2.) Plaintiff owned her primary residence, which was located in Pinal County, until it was foreclosed upon in 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As the owner of her primary residence, Plaintiff was obligated to pay homeowners' assessments to her homeowners' association (the \"Association\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After Plaintiff failed to pay her homeowners' assessments, an action was filed against her by the Association in the Casa Grande Justice Court of Pinal County. (Doc. 45 at 3-4.) The Association was granted summary judgment in that action against Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The judgment awarded, among other things, the unpaid homeowners' assessments and \"all reasonable costs and attorneys' fees incurred by [the Association] after entry of this judgment in collecting the amounts awarded therein.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 31, 2017, Defendants commenced a garnishment action on behalf of the Association (the \"Garnishment Action\") by filing an Application for Garnishment in the Maricopa County Superior Court against Plaintiff's employer, the Casa Grande Elementary School District. (Doc. 46 at 2.) The Garnishment Action sought payment of the amount adjudged due, \"including attorney fees and costs as may be awarded by [the] Court.\" (Doc. 45 at 4.) Defendants also filed an Application for Amount of Attorney Fees, a\n   <em>\n    China Doll\n   </em>\n   Affidavit in support of the Fee Application, and a statement of costs in the Garnishment Action to seek court approval of the fees and costs identified in the Application for Garnishment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On February 8, 2017, the Maricopa County Superior Court issued a Writ of\n   Garnishment to Plaintiff's employer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff's employer submitted an Answer of Garnishee, and on February 21, 2017, the Maricopa County Superior Court approved the application for fees and statement of costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 9, 2017, Plaintiff objected to and moved to quash the Writ of Garnishment and vacate the order approving the application for attorneys' fees and statement of costs on the grounds that they were filed in an improper venue. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) The Maricopa County Superior Court denied the objection and both motions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 22, 2017, Plaintiff filed the First Amended Complaint, (Doc. 37). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In it, Plaintiff alleges that, by commencing a garnishment action and requesting post-judgment fees and costs in Maricopa County, Defendants violated \u00a7 1692i of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges that under \u00a7 1692i, Defendants were required to file the garnishment action and supporting papers in Pinal County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 12, 2018, Defendants filed the pending Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings requesting that this Court grant judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.) Plaintiff filed a brief in opposition to the Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings, (Doc. 51), as well as a Motion for Summary Judgment. Defendants filed a brief in opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, (Doc. 52), as well as a Motion to Strike Portions of Plaintiff's Reply in Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n   <em>\n    Muhammad v.

In\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   , on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim and a motion for judgement on the pleadings, the court found that the first step of the two-step process was not satisfied because the underlying judgment was obtained in \"a distant and inconvenient court, in a venue not proper under the FDCPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. While the court in\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   did not engage in both steps of the two-step process, it did acknowledge that the two-step process \"makes sense, notwithstanding\n   <em>\n    Fox\n   </em>\n   's lack of clarity on the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.

First, Plaintiff does not contest the fact that the underlying judgment was obtained in the proper venue in compliance with \u00a7 1692i. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 47 at 2.) Second, similar to the examination performed in\n   <em>\n    Muhammad\n   </em>\n   and the other circuit courts, an examination of Arizona's garnishment scheme shows that a garnishment action is against the garnishee, not the judgment debtor.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Part II.B.1.b. Thus, Plaintiff's claim that Defendants violated \u00a7 1692i by bringing the Garnishment Action on behalf of the Association in Maricopa County fails as a matter of law, and Defendants' Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings regarding the garnishment action is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

(Doc. 37 at 4.) Defendant argues that the request for court approval of post-judgment fees and costs does not violate \u00a7 1692i because it is merely a procedural step in the Garnishment Action. (Doc. 45 at 9.) Defendant reasons that, because \u00a7 1692i does not apply to the Garnishment Action, \u00a7 1692i should not apply to the request for post-judgment fees and costs that is simply a procedural step in the Garnishment Action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Therefore, the Court must determine if Defendants' request for fees and costs was a separate action on a debt, or just a step in the underlying garnishment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Supreme Court has made clear that garnishment actions are not wholly new actions, but are simply \"supplemental proceedings\" to satisfy the underlying judgments.\n   <em>\n    Endicott-Johnson Corp. v.
