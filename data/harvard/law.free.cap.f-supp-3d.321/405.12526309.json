Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The sentencing hearing and pre-sentence report reveal the following:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant, Sammy Smith, a forty year old naturalized citizen came to this country in 2004. He is a high school graduate making a living as a truck driver delivering produce at night. He has a Turkish music college degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Married and divorced, defendant has a ten year old son he adores and drives to and from school, cooperating with his ex-wife in bringing up the boy. Defendant lives alone in a small apartment. And he recently acquired a cocaine habit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Smith is na\u00efve: he has no criminal record. But he was convinced by a friend to pack in his luggage internal operating parts of a popular handgun, the Glock, fly to Turkey and sell them; if he was stopped at John F. Kennedy Airport (\"JFK\") he could explain he was taking them to be engraved in the ancient Turkish tradition. The explanation made no sense since the internal parts he carried could not be seen after the covering portions of the gun were attached. The parts in his luggage required an export license, as the United States agents explained to him after they seized the gun parts he was trying to smuggle out of the country.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following further advice from his friend, he packed more of the parts for which he obtained no license, and boarded a plane in Cleveland to avoid agents at JFK. The plane stopped at JFK as scheduled. His baggage was searched, and he was arrested for violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202778\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Arms Export Control Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Denying the government's request for a guideline sentence-a long, four or five year sentence of incarceration followed by years of supervised release-the court sentenced defendant to two months of incarceration followed by six months of supervised release. The sentence will probably be served in New York City, where his son can visit. He can pay two months' rent in advance, thus preserving a place to live in on release, and he can drive his son to and from school when it begins in two months. The short supervised release period is explained as a policy matter in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Trotter\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CR-382,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203421313\">\n    2018 WL 3421313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526304\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/321/337/\">\n    321 F.Supp.3d 337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. July 5, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendant's aberrational criminal conduct was apparently fueled by a cocaine addiction. In the five years preceding his crime, he spent $200,000 on the drug, forcing him to supplement his income. Prior to his arrest, he had gone to inpatient rehabilitation treatment twice, but failed to maintain sobriety. The addiction is now apparently dormant; he is said to have gone almost a year without using cocaine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sentencing Hearing Transcript (July 9, 2018) (\"Sent. Hr'g Tr.\") at 18:21-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the court made it clear to Smith that he must remain sober. \"Stay out of trouble and stay away from all drugs because your mind gets clouded and you can't make intelligent decisions, and if you continue with narcotics you can ... go to prison.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:12-15. Supervised release will include drug treatment. His probation officer and attorney\n   should press on defendant the importance of sobriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   II. Offense\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On June 3, 2016, Smith was stopped at JFK before boarding a flight to Istanbul, Turkey. PSR at \u00b6 6. Customs and Boarder Protection (\"CBP\") officers seized handgun components from defendant's checked bag and explained to him that an export license was required to export the parts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. Defendant told the agents that he had planned to sell the firearm parts in Turkey after he had them engraved-an explanation that made no sense since any engraving would be concealed when the gun covers were attached.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6. He acknowledged that he did not have an export license.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Despite the warning, on July 23, 2016, defendant boarded a flight traveling from Cleveland, Ohio to Istanbul, Turkey, with the same type of firearm parts in his luggage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. During a layover at JFK, he was stopped by CBP officers, who seized the parts from his checked bag and verified that he did not possess a license for their export.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Homeland Security Investigations (\"HSI\") arrested Smith at his home in New York on January 24, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   III.
