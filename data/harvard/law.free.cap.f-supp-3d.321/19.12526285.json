Manouchehr Jafarzadeh, an Iranian national seeking to become a lawful permanent resident (\"LPR\") of the United States, alleges that his application was placed in a government program that delays and denies immigration petitions on overly broad national security grounds. The government filed a motion to dismiss the first complaint in this matter, arguing, among other things, that the issues in the case must be adjudicated in removal proceedings, to which the government had already consigned Jafarzadeh. The Court granted the motion as to some aspects of the complaint, but rejected the idea that the Court lacked jurisdiction and denied the motion as to most of the claims raised. That complaint has since been amended, but the new version includes many of the same allegations and causes of action as the original. And the government has responded in kind, with another motion to dismiss that raises many-but not all-of the same arguments it raised the first time around. As before, the Court finds that it has jurisdiction, and that some-but not all-claims can proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jafarzadeh is an Iranian citizen who has lived legally and continuously in the United States since he entered the country on a student visa in 1979.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. [ECF No. 30] \u00b6 8. He has been married since 1982 to plaintiff Shahnaz Karami, an Iranian citizen and American LPR who has continuously resided in the United States since 1978.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9. Plaintiffs have three adult daughters, all of whom are American citizens and reside in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Jafarzadeh worked for the Interests Section of the Islamic Republic of Iran, which is housed in the Pakistani Embassy in Washington, D.C., from June 1991 until he was denied LPR status in 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 25, 2010, plaintiffs' daughter Razeyeh filed a Form I-130 Petition for Alien Relative on behalf of Jafarzadeh, and Jafarzadeh concurrently filed a Form I-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status as her immediate relative.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 21. Both petitions remained pending at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a component of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), for over six years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. During those years, Jafarzadeh was interviewed twice by USCIS-once in 2011 and once in 2014-and was interviewed or contacted a number of times by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-23. Jafarzadeh believed, based on the \"content and nature of these interviews,\" that the FBI wanted him to become a government informant,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24, and that the FBI \"would have used its power to remove the roadblocks hindering the adjudication of his applications before USCIS\" if he had agreed,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Jafarzadeh cooperated with the agents' questioning, but refused to become an informant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He also \"consistently denied ever having provided support to, expressed support for, or of having engaged in, terrorism or terrorist-related activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For six years, USCIS did not act on Jafarzadeh and Razeyeh's applications. Plaintiffs allege that the applications were funneled into a secret, alternate claims-processing system known as the Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program (CARRP), which was created in April 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 28-29. Plaintiffs allege that applications on this separate track \"are reviewed under protocols that lack any authority or foundation in statute or regulation,\" and which \"mandate[ ] denial or perpetual delay\" of those applications, \"regardless of the applicant's statutory eligibility for a particular immigration benefit.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that applications are selected for inclusion in CARRP if the applicant is a \"Known or\n   <em>\n    Suspected\n   </em>\n   Terrorist\" (\"KST\"), which in turn is based on whether the individual is listed in the \"Terrorism Screening Database\" (\"TSDB\"); or is a \"Non-Known or Suspected Terrorist[ ]\" (\"non-KST\"), meaning she has an \"articulable link to ... an activity, individual or organization that has engaged in terrorist activity or been a member of a terrorist organization.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30-32 (internal quotation marks omitted). According to plaintiffs, the TSDB is maintained by the FBI, and that agency, among others, is authorized to add individuals to the database.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 34. Under CARRP, once an individual is deemed a KST, USCIS field officers are prohibited from granting that immigration application, \"even if the applicant has satisfied all statutory and regulatory criteria.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Thus, plaintiffs argue, CARRP unlawfully delegates authority over immigration to the FBI and other agencies that add names to the TSDB.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Plaintiffs also allege that CARRP requires USCIS to deny applications on national security grounds far broader than those listed in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Jafarzadeh and Razeyeh filed this action in June 2016, more than six years after filing their applications with DHS. The original complaint challenged CARRP on a number of administrative and constitutional grounds. On December 2, 2016, USCIS granted Razeyeh's petition, thereby recognizing Jafarzadeh as her immediate relative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Collett Decl. [ECF No. 12-1] \u00b6 3; Pls.' Response [ECF No. 21] at 1. But on February 10, 2017, USCIS denied Jafarzadeh's application for adjustment of status and placed him in removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Collett Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; USCIS Decision [ECF No. 15-2]; Notice to Appear [ECF No. 17-1]. The government argued that\n   because plaintiffs sought an order requiring USCIS to act on their applications, their complaint had become moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss [ECF No. 12] at 7-8. DHS also asserted that the relief plaintiffs sought can only be obtained through the administrative process before an immigration judge (\"IJ\") and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), followed by appeal to the appropriate circuit court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Reply Br. [ECF No. 17] at 5-7 &amp; n.1. Additionally, DHS argued that plaintiffs' claims should be dismissed on the merits. Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss at 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In September 2017, the Court granted in part and denied in part defendants' motion to dismiss the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sept. 7, 2017 Order [ECF No. 25]; Mem. Op. [ECF No. 26]. The Court first determined that the claim seeking adjudication of Jafarzadeh's and Razeyeh's petitions was moot, but that the other claims in the case-seeking invalidation of CARRP and a new adjudication free of CARRP-were not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 8-10. The Court then found that the claims remaining in the case were ripe and free of finality or exhaustion concerns, because Jafarzadeh did not seek review of the ultimate decision USCIS had made on his LPR application (which would have to go through the administrative process outlined above) but rather had brought a collateral challenge to the\n   <em>\n    procedure\n   </em>\n   by which his application had been adjudicated-a claim which, under the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    McNary v. Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    498 U.S. 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    111 S.Ct. 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6230772\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/498/479/\">\n    112 L.Ed.2d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991), the text of the INA did not funnel into the administrative process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. at 10-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After determining that it had jurisdiction to hear the case, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' claim to compel compliance with the INA, reasoning that the same claim could be and had been asserted under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and that neither the Mandamus Act nor the Court's inherent power to correct\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   agency action applied when relief was available elsewhere.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22. Because the government's only response to plaintiffs' substantive APA claim was that it was moot-an argument the Court rejected-the Court denied the motion to dismiss that claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. The Court denied without prejudice the motion to dismiss plaintiffs' notice-and-comment claim, observing that the Court did not have enough information to resolve the issue because neither party had placed any CARRP materials in the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23. However, the Court granted the motion to dismiss plaintiffs' due process claim, finding that Jafarzadeh had no liberty or property interest protected by the Due Process Clause and that Razeyeh had not asserted such an interest herself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-25, 25 n.7. Finally, the Court found that joining the Director of the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR) as a defendant, as plaintiffs requested, was unnecessary because the Attorney General was already a defendant and \"is certainly empowered to grant the relief sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs have since filed an amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. The new complaint substituted Karami, Jafarzadeh's wife, for his daughter Razeyeh as the second plaintiff. Otherwise, the amended complaint makes factual allegations essentially identical to those in the original. Plaintiffs also bring many of the same claims for relief, though they have adjusted some in response to the Court's prior opinion. They claim that USCIS must re-adjudicate Jafarzadeh's LPR application \"exclusive of CARRP\" (Count I),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-53; that CARRP violates the separation of powers by creating criteria and procedures not authorized by the INA (Count II),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-57; that CARRP violates the APA because it is not in accordance\n   with the INA or the Constitution (Count III),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-59; that adjudicating Jafarzadeh's application under CARRP without explanation or a process to challenge his subjection to CARRP violates Karami's due process rights to family unity and the maintenance and enjoyment of her marriage in the United States (Count IV),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-64; and that CARRP is an agency rule that was improperly promulgated without notice and comment in violation of the APA (Count V),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-70. The government has filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, which is now ripe for decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Pls.' Am. Compl.

For reasons explained in Part I.C,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the answer to that question is yes: Jafarzadeh has suffered a procedural injury which continues to affect his concrete interests in remaining and working in this country. Renewing Jafarzadeh's application in the removal proceedings will not cleanse him of his injury, unless the IJ actually grants him LPR status. The Court, by sending Jafarzadeh's application back to USCIS for reconsideration, would be able to provide plaintiffs one chance more at achieving LPR status than they would receive from an IJ alone-a fact that suffices to keep the case alive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knox v.

But this assertion misunderstands the nature of the harm in a procedural injury case. In such cases, the procedural violation is almost always in the past; it is only the injury to the concrete interest protected by the procedural right that is ongoing. In\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Court provided two examples of cognizable procedural injuries: \"the procedural requirement for a hearing prior to denial of [plaintiffs'] license application, or the procedural requirement for an environmental impact statement before a federal facility is constructed next door to them.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In those situations, the license will have already been denied without a hearing, and the deadline to conduct the environmental impact statement will have already passed. The fact that the plaintiff might apply for a license again the next year while his procedural challenge gets litigated, and may get a hearing in that second application process, does not mean that the injury to his concrete interest in the license from the prior procedural violation has suddenly ended-he still does not have the license. Nor would it negate the landowners' injury to their interest in avoiding having a federal facility next door if a second agency, with a separate duty to conduct an environmental impact study, does conduct such a study-because the facility may still be built.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similarly, here, the alleged procedural violations stemming from CARRP continue to injure plaintiffs' concrete interests in travel, work, and maintenance of the marriage and family unit, even if a second, separate adjudicatory body (the IJ) may not commit the same violation. Plaintiffs' concrete interests remain injured; Jafarzadeh still cannot travel or work, and indeed now finds himself in removal proceedings, where the injury to his interests is even more acute.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clinton v.

There is certainly \"some possibility\" that USCIS, faced with a court determination that CARRP is illegal and that it must hew to the strictures of the INA, would come to a different conclusion about Jafarzadeh's application.

Rather, it is part of the Rule 12(b)(6) inquiry into whether plaintiffs have a valid cause of action. As the Supreme Court has explained, \"the fundamental distinction between arguing no cause of action and arguing no Article III redressability\" is \"that the former argument is not squarely directed at jurisdiction itself, but rather at\n   <em>\n    the existence of a remedy\n   </em>\n   for the alleged violation of ... federal rights, which issue is not of the jurisdictional sort which the Court raises on its own motion.\"\n   <em>\n    Steel Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503308\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/83/#p89\">\n    523 U.S. at 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503308\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/83/#p89\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1003\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).

While Congress would certainly \"suffer[ ] an[ ] invasion of a legally protected interest as a result of\" a violation of the Uniform Rule of Naturalization Clause, 2d Mot. to Dismiss at 14, it is not the constitutional violation alone that provides plaintiffs with standing in separation of powers cases. Rather, that violation must itself cause a separate injury to a plaintiff's interests, and it is\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   harm that provides standing to sue. In\n   <em>\n    Patchak\n   </em>\n   , for instance, an allegedly unconstitutional statute forbade Patchak from suing to prevent the federal government from taking a neighboring property-on which a Native American tribe wished to build a casino-into trust. 138 S.Ct. at 903-04. The alleged separation of powers violation most directly affected the federal judiciary rather than Patchak, as the statute at issue stripped the courts' jurisdiction over claims involving the fought-over property. Yet Patchak, who would be deprived of access to the federal courts and might be forced to live near a casino because of the statute, had standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The same principles apply here. At least two district courts in the past year have held that plaintiffs have standing to claim that agencies violated the Uniform Rule of Naturalization Clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirwa v.

But there are significant indications from the CARRP memo itself that it creates the legal consequences necessary to be considered final agency action.

But more recent guidance implies that there is a difference between the \"articulable link\" standard for NS concerns and the INA's inadmissibility standards, and outlines a process for adjudicating KST cases that is at least consistent with plaintiffs' claim that CARRP is geared toward finding a way to deny applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Revision Mem. at 2 (\"[I]f, after completing the vetting and deconfliction process in KST cases, there continue to be national security concerns, and there is insufficient evidence or other grounds to deny the application, offices are to seek further guidance from their respective HQ Directorate, in consultation with local and HQ counsel when appropriate.\"); USCIS Operational Guidance for Vetting and Adjudicating Cases with Nat'l Sec.

At this stage, the Court must accept plaintiffs' allegations regarding CARRP as true unless the record before the Court squarely disproves it. And, as explained, the CARRP materials themselves provide some support for plaintiffs' reading of the original CARRP memo and policy. Thus, plaintiffs have plausibly claimed that CARRP meets\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   's test for final agency action and is subject to the APA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Other than its bare assertion that CARRP \"does not change the statutory requirements for any immigration benefit,\" 2d Mot. to Dismiss at 17-a statement that is also central to the final agency action question-the government does not argue that CARRP affirmatively complies with the Constitution and the INA.

P. 12(h)(2) (allowing defendants to raise failure to state a claim defenses in later motions or at trial). The Court's ultimate decision on plaintiffs' substantive APA claim may depend on several issues which are simply not discussed in the papers before the Court. For instance, the strength of plaintiffs' claim may depend on whether and how much the Court must defer to DHS's interpretation of the INA's inadmissibility standards or of its own memo; whether individuals are submitted to the TSDB, and therefore subjected to CARRP, \"even if there is no reasonable suspicion that the person is actually involved in terrorist activity,\" Am.

The APA claims in Counts III and V, however, have run the gauntlet of the government's present objections, and therefore the motion to dismiss these claims will be denied. None of this is to say that the government may not be successful later on in this suit, particularly if it provides more specific arguments on the remaining claims and if the record, as it develops, shows reality to be closer to the government's conception than to plaintiffs'.

The Court is unpersuaded by these attempts to relitigate its reading of those provisions. However, the government did raise two points at argument that merit attention. First, the government cited the Second Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Rajah v.

The regulations challenged in\n    <em>\n     Rajah\n    </em>\n    were published in the Code of Federal Regulations, and the petitioners argued that they were facially invalid on a number of grounds.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842431\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/427/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3842431\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/544/427/\">\n     at 434-43\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, by contrast, plaintiffs challenge a program some of the details of which have been withheld from the public, and Jafarzadeh's subjection to which the government refuses to admit. Some of plaintiffs' claims thus require developing a record, which was not the casein\n    <em>\n     Rajah\n    </em>\n    . In any event, foreclosure of judicial review is only one of several \"general guideposts\" used to determine whether a claim must be channeled to an administrative review process.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Jarkesy v.

Even hewing to the D.C. Circuit's baseline that \u00a7 2401(a) is jurisdictional, that determination can and should be read in harmony with these more recent Supreme Court cases.
