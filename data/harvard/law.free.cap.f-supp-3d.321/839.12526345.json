Shoap brings federal and state claims against Crossville and state claims against Kerley. Crossville and Kerley have each filed Motions for Summary Judgment. (Doc. Nos. 31, 36.) Shoap has responded (Doc. Nos. 42, 47) and Crossville and Kerley have filed replies (Doc. Nos. 45, 51). For the following reasons, Crossville's motion will be granted in part and the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over remaining state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Facts\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Shoap had a long career in law enforcement. Under the Crossville City Charter, only the City Manager had the power to hire and fire Shoap. (Doc. No. 49 at \u00b6 10.) In January 2015, Shoap was hired to be the interim Police Chief of Crossville for a period not to exceed 18 months, reporting to City Manager David Rutherford. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.) Shoap's relationship with Rutherford was \"good.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3.) Shoap understood that he worked for the City Manager and \"not for the City Council or any City Council member at all times during his employment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.) According to Shoap, he was under the supervision of the City Manager \"every day\" that he was an employee of Crossville. (Doc. No. 33-1 at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2015, Kerley, a Crossville Councilman, asked Shoap to investigate a report that a child had been inappropriately touched by another child in the cafeteria of one of the local schools. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Shoap has testified that there was \"nothing wrong\" about Kerley, or anyone, bringing this to his attention, even if a later investigation revealed that no crime was committed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 18; Doc. No. 49 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13.) Shoap never had an issue with Kerley before this incident. (Doc. No. 33-1 at 20.) Shoap did not have another interaction with Kerley until February 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) So from the beginning of his time as interim Police Chief in January 2015 through February 2016, Shoap had only one incident with Kerley. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) During that same time, Shoap had \"no\" incident with \"any other employee or leader with the City of Crossville.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In fact, during his deposition, Shoap testified that he \"couldn't think of any\" incidents with \"anyone from the City of Crossville besides Mr. Kerley.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2016, Rutherford indicated that he wished to hire Shoap on a permanent basis. However, his status remained as \"employment at-will and not a contract.\" (Doc. No. 42-2 at 3.) As part of his employment, Shoap certified that he received a copy of the personnel rules and regulations of Crossville, that Crossville was an at-will employer, and that he could be \"discharged at any time with or without right of appeal.\" (Doc. No. 33-2 at 6.) In April 2016, Rutherford was terminated before he could \"finalize the paperwork,\" as he had intended, on July 28, 2016. (Doc. Nos. 42-2 at 3; 33-1 at 47.) Thus, when asked during his deposition \"so [Rutherford] never did get you hired as permanent police chief, because he was terminated,\n   correct?\" Shoap replied, \"[t]hat's correct.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 33-1 at 48.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Rutherford was replaced as City Manager by Steve Hill. Shoap's relationship with Hill was \"good.\" (Doc. No. 49 at \u00b6 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Around this time, Shoap had a second encounter with Kerley. Kerley complained to Shoap that another Crossville Councilman had assaulted him. (Doc. No. 33-1 at 37.) Again, Shoap testified that it was \"entirely appropriate\" for Kerley to report what he believed to be a crime, and for Shoap to investigate it. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39; Doc. No. 49 at \u00b6 16.) Kerley \"demanded\" that Shoap write an assault complaint, but, after investigation, Shoap determined that doing so was not appropriate. (Doc. No. 33-1 at 37-39.) Shoap explained that this was \"how the system is supposed to work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.) Kerley objected to Shoap's conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-41.) Shoap went to Kerley's house, and asked Hill to accompany him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.) Kerley complained that Shoap \"wouldn't write an assault complaint for him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42.) Shoap felt that Hill did not intercede in the meeting to protect him from Kerley's statements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Hill initially told Shoap that he would decide on his permanent hiring within a month, but it was stretched to several months, and then to possibly after the election. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45-46.) As time went on, Shoap became tired of waiting for Hill to make a decision to hire him. (Doc. No. 49 at \u00b6 19.) He was tired of \"excuse after excuse.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20) He was angered by Hill's \"putting him off.\" (Doc. No. 33-1 at 45.) Shoap was also upset that on two occasions Hill had said he would hire Shoap if there was enough support from City Council members, but then would not immediately call the Council members to \"poll\" them in Shoap's presence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Major Mark Rosser was second in command in the Crossville Police Department. (Doc. No. 49 at \u00b6 5.) Rosser was a good officer about whom Shoap had no complaints. (Id. at \u00b6 6.) On June 30, 2016, Shoap encountered Rosser coming out of Hill's office and, according to Shoap, Rosser and Hill gave him a \"real funny look, surprised look.\" (Doc. No. 33-1 at 30.) Soon thereafter, Rosser told Shoap that he had intended to support Shoap's candidacy, but had asked Hill to hire him if Rosser did not hire Shoap. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rosser told Shoap that he and Hill discussed permanent employment with a contract. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Shoap testified that this caused him \"a little consternation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.) Shoap tried to talk Rosser out of applying for the job on the ground that that it would potentially do harm to Rosser's retirement benefits. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Later that day, Shoap resigned. Shoap made statements the same day, reported\n   in an article on www.crossville-chronicle.com by Gary Nelson, entitled \"Interim police chief resigns, 'Tired of waiting,' \" to the effect that Shoap had grown tired of the City Manager and the delay in the decision to hire him. (Doc. Nos. 33-1 at 44, 49; 33-2 at 7-8.) Prior to the resignation, Hill did not fire Shoap or say he was going to fire Shoap. (Doc. No. 49 at \u00b6 15.) Shoap has filed an Affidavit stating that the conditions were \"so intolerable\" for him as of June 30, 2016, that he could not continue working. (Doc. No. 42-1 at \u00b6 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Shoap did not utilize any grievance or appeal mechanisms that Crossville provides to resolve employee dissatisfaction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.) Shoap also did not make any written complaint to Crossville. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.) Shoap was not subjected to discipline by Crossville at any time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Legal Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, this Court will only consider the narrow question of whether there are \"genuine issues as to any material fact and [whether] the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

Under that approach, Shoap first has\n   the burden of stating a prima facie case of discrimination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that: (1) he was a member of a protected class; (2) he suffered an adverse employment action; (3) he was qualified for the position he held; and (4) he was replaced by someone outside of his protected class or treated differently from similarly situated, non-protected employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7325753\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/320/777/#p779\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Here, Shoap fails to make a prima facie case because there was no adverse employment action.

Shoap can only point to minor hassles, delays with the decision-making process for the permanent position, and several incidents with Kerley, who was not Shoap's supervisor/employer.

Shoap relies primarily on two incidents over the course of fifteen months - the disagreements with Kerley about the child abuse report and Kerley's complaint of assault by another Councilman. The Complaint also mentions several alleged derogatory statements made by Kerley about \"old men\", and one derogatory text sent by Kerley about Shoap's Christian faith, even though evidence of these was completely absent from Shoap's Statement of Facts. Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that all of these events occurred, Shoap falls far short of establishing a question of fact as to whether the totality of Kerley's conduct was \"severe or pervasive\" enough to alter the conditions of Shoap's employment. These events were infrequent in the overall course of Shoap's employment, not severe, and were not physically threatening or humiliating.\n   <em>\n    Compare with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Randolph v.

Importantly, Shoap has introduced no evidence that the conditions of his work environment unreasonably interfered with his work performance. Indeed, Shoap testified that Kerley absolutely had the right to advocate for himself and to publicly disagree with Shoap, and that Shoap stuck to his guns and performed his job properly. At most, Shoap has offered evidence of Kerley being politically vindictive, obnoxious, or prone to occasional offensive utterances, but not of a workplace \"permeated with discriminatory intimidation\" that \"compelled\" Shoap to resign.

The case will be closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   An appropriate Order will enter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Shoap includes a factual narrative in his summary judgment response brief (Doc. No. 48 at 1-4), supported in part by self-serving affidavits, that aver numerous facts that he failed to set forth in his response to Crossville's Statement of Undisputed Facts or his own Statement of Additional Facts, many of which concern irrelevant matters or events that occurred after Shoap resigned his position. The Court, however, only discusses the material facts necessary for disposition of Shoap's federal claims. Events that occurred after Shoap resigned are not relevant in this regard.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Shoap has adduced testimony of (1) Rutherford that he \"believes\" that he was fired because he supported Shoap for the permanent position and (2) City Clerk Oglesby that she \"think[s]\" one of the reasons Rutherford was fired was a concern that he was going to hire Shoap. (Doc. No. 52 at \u00b6 1; 42-2; 42-3.) The firing of Rutherford is of no relevance to the dispositive legal issues in this case. Moreover, these opinions are mere supposition about the motivations of individual City Council members; they do not material establish facts.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In his deposition, Shoap expressed dissatisfaction with Hill because Hill told Shoap that he was going to supervise him for one month before making a recommendation as to permanent hiring, but then told the Council that he was going to supervise Shoap for two months. (Doc. No. 33-1 at 22-23.) Shoap acknowledged, however, that as City Manager, his supervisor, and the hiring authority, Hill was entitled to supervise Shoap for as long as he wanted. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 23-26.) Shoap also complained that Hill refused to pay for him to attend a conference in late July 2016, but then acknowledged that it overlapped with the end of his employment term. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 29.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    It is not even logical that Crossville would \"intend\" for Shoap to quit in June 2016, as (1) Shoap was an at-will employee who could be easily replaced at any time and (2) Shoap's 18-month tenure as interim Police Chief would expire by its terms at the end of July 2016 if he was not formally hired by Hill.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Shoap did not check the box for \"retaliation\" in his EEOC Charge. (Doc. No. 36-9.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
