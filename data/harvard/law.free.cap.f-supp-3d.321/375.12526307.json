The Plaintiff alleges gender discrimination and retaliation, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\") and New York Executive Law \u00a7 290,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"NYHRL\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is a motion by the Defendants, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"FED.

P.\" or \"Rule\") 12(b)(6), seeking to dismiss the Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, the Court denies the Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are drawn from the Plaintiff's Complaint, and for the purposes of the instant motion, are construed in favor of the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Plaintiff is a male heterosexual. Compl. \u00b6 10. At the time of the facts underlying the Complaint, the Plaintiff was a resident of Suffolk County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Smithtown Volkswagen is an automobile dealership located in Suffolk County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 14. Bindels is an officer and owner of Smithtown Volkswagen.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. In this role, Bindels possesses the authority to hire, fire and make personnel decisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Plaintiff worked at Smithtown Volkswagen from September 21, 2015 to September 4, 2016 as a general sales manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 42. According to the Complaint,\n   Bindels set out the Plaintiff's job responsibilities, which included ordering inventory and providing pricing to salespersons for transactions with customers; overseeing the preparation and delivery of sales; overseeing the finance department; appraising used cars; handling issues with the manufacturer; and administering various customer retention and outreach programs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-21. During his time at Smithtown Volkswagen, the Plaintiff purportedly performed all of his duties in a satisfactory manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Plaintiff alleges that, over a roughly six month period, Bindels engaged in an ongoing series of harassing behavior to him consisting of overt sexual advances; the sending of graphic sexual imagery; and promises of job security in exchange for sexual favors. Furthermore, the Plaintiff claims that Bindels continued this conduct despite multiple objections and protests from the Plaintiff, culminating in Bindels directing another Smithtown Volkswagen employee to fire the Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Bindels's alleged harassment began on February 20, 2016, when, from his work e-mail address, he sent the Plaintiff several full body naked pictures of himself masturbating.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. These pictures included a close-up enlarged picture of the head of Bindels's penis with white fluid dripping down, as well as pictures of Bindels lying totally naked on his back with his legs spread and his penis fully erect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Less than a week later, on February 26, 2016, the Complaint alleges that Bindels went to the Plaintiff's office and asked him if he liked the pictures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. The Plaintiff responded by asking Bindels why he sent the pictures, telling Bindels he did not like them, and expressing his desire for Bindels to leave him alone.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to the Complaint, Bindels continued making sexual advances despite the Plaintiff's objections in their February 26, 2016 confrontation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. Specifically, Bindels told the Plaintiff on several additional occasions that he wanted to have sex with him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Each time, the Plaintiff refused and told Bindels to stop.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 32, 36, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For instance, the Complaint alleges that on or about April 15, 2016, Bindels approached the Plaintiff again asking if he liked his photographs and told the Plaintiff that \"we should get together and have some fun.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As time progressed, Bindels allegedly began tying his advances to promises of job security. Specifically, on or about June 15, 2016, Bindels told the Plaintiff that his job at Smithtown Volkswagen would be secure in the future if he had sex with Bindels.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. And on August 24, 2016, Bindels told the Plaintiff that he would make more money and have a secure future at Smithtown Volkswagen if he succumbed to Bindels's advances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After this last incident, the Plaintiff lodged an informal complaint with another Smithtown Volkswagen employee, telling the newly hired general manager, David Hovell (\"Hovell\"), about the naked pictures from Bindels and imploring him that something needed to be done to stop the harassment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the Complaint alleges that, on September 4, 2016, Bindels ordered Hovell to fire the Plaintiff for rejecting his advances and for complaining to Hovell.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Upon receiving this directive, Hovell called the Plaintiff and told him that \"they\" were going to go in a different direction, and that his services were no longer needed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. When the Plaintiff asked why he was fired, Hovell did not describe any performance issues or other business reasons for the\n   decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. Rather, Hovell simply stated: \"Joe (Bindels) no longer wants you here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On these facts, the Plaintiff alleges causes of action based on gender discrimination through sexual harassment and retaliation in violation of Title VII and the NYHRL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 16, 2017, the Plaintiff filed the present action against Volkswagen Group of America, Smithtown Volkswagen, and Joe Bindels claiming violations of Title VII and the NYHRL. The Plaintiff filed this action prior to the expiration of 90 days after receiving a Notice of Right to Sue from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 20, 2017 the Defendants moved under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss the Complaint, contending that the Plaintiff's allegations, even if taken as true, fail to plausibly state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On December 22, 2017, the Plaintiff dismissed the action with prejudice against Volkswagen Group of America pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Unlike these cases, where the plaintiffs failed to articulate\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   facts supporting an inference of discrimination, the Complaint details multiple sexual advances tied to promises of job security made by Bindels, and specifically alleges that Bindels directed a general manager to fire the Plaintiff based on his reaction to those advances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lenart v.

Bindels sent the lewd pictures to the Plaintiff in February, but did not fire the Plaintiff until September. Therefore, according to the Defendants, the harassment could not have been the cause of the adverse employment action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   However, this characterization misstates the allegations in the Complaint. While the first advance may have happened in February, several intermediate incidents allegedly occurred between when Bindels sent the pictures and the Plaintiff's termination. In addition, the Complaint states that as time progressed the advances became more serious and were tied to promises of job security. Considering that the last overture by Bindels occurred merely eight days before the Plaintiff's firing, it is plausible that - taking the allegations in the Complaint as true and drawing all reasonable\n   inferences in favor of the Plaintiff - the Plaintiff's refusal to relent in his opposition to Bindels's sexual advances drove the decision underlying his termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court also rejects the Defendants' argument that the Plaintiff failed to plausibly allege that he was not terminated for bona fide job-related reasons. For the reasons previously discussed, the Court declines to consider the extrinsic evidence attached to the motion to dismiss purportedly showing that Plaintiff was discharged due to unsatisfactory performance.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   II.B. Looking at the Complaint alone, the Plaintiff alleges that he performed all of his responsibilities in a satisfactory manner and that the Defendants did not tell him that performance was the reason for his termination.
