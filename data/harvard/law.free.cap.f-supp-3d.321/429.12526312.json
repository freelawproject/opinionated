Charles and Richard are the father and brother, respectively, of Charles Quincy Reed, Jr. (\"Quincy\"). At the time of the events at issue, Quincy was under parole supervision by the New York State Division of Parole (\"Parole Division\"). Plaintiffs assert that Quincy's parole officer, Curt Cashman (\"Cashman\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and various named and unnamed law enforcement officers employed by the City of Rochester Police Department (\"the RPD Defendants\") and the New York State Police, violated their Fourth Amendment rights when they conducted a warrantless search of a location they believed to be Quincy's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cashman has filed a renewed motion for summary judgment (ECF # 64). The RPD Defendants also have filed a renewed motion for summary judgment (ECF # 66). Plaintiffs filed a reply in opposition (ECF # 69). The Court subsequently requested (ECF # 71) additional briefing on certain issues as well clarification of the layout of the apartments at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard where Quincy and Plaintiffs resided. These materials were provided by Cashman (ECF # 73) and the RPD Defendants (ECF # 72). For the reasons discussed herein, Cashman's motion for summary judgment is granted; the RPD Defendants' motion for summary judgment is granted; and Plaintiffs' complaint is dismissed in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Because this case is at the summary judgment stage, the Court is required to view all facts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmoving parties.\n   <em>\n    Matsushita Elec. Indus.

Quincy's Parole Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Quincy, who has a 2007 New York State court conviction for third-degree criminal possession of a weapon and second-degree\n   burglary, was released to the custody of the Parole Division on August 5, 2011. Prior to his release, he signed a \"Certificate of Release to Parole Supervision,\" pursuant to which he agreed to abide by certain conditions, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4. I will permit my Parole Officer to visit me at my residence and/or place or employment and I will permit the search and inspection of my person, residence and property. I will discuss any proposed changes in my residence, employment or program status with my Parole Officer.

F to Declaration of Gary Levine, Esq., dated August 8, 2017 (\"8/8/17 Levine Decl.\") (ECF # 64-3),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   pp. 408-415 of 415).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Quincy Moves Into Apartment 2 at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In preparation for Quincy's release to parole, his living arrangements were coordinated between the Parole Division and his mother, non-party Lisa Reed (\"Lisa\"). Lisa proposed to have Quincy reside with her and her husband, Charles, at their residence at 14 Lavender Circle in the Town of Henrietta, New York. Because Charles has a criminal record, including multiple felony convictions, the NYS Parole Division denied that request. As an alternative, Lisa proposed that Quincy reside in a building she owned located at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard in Rochester, New York.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The building was vacant and the upstairs, which was residential space, had not been renovated. Lisa stated that she was planning to divide the upstairs into two apartments and proposed having Quincy live in the front apartment. This apartment is denominated \"Apt. 2\" on the diagram marked as Deposition Exhibit (\"Dep. Ex.\") # 7 (ECF # 64-3, p. 383 of 415). It is on the south-side of the building and is through the door on the left at the top of the stairwell leading from the outside door that opens onto Upper Falls Boulevard. At the time Lisa was negotiating arrangements with the Parole Division, the north-side apartment to the right at the top of the stairwell was uninhabitable. This apartment is denominated \"Apt. 1\" on the diagram marked as Dep. Ex. # 7 (ECF # 64-3, p. 383 of 415). There was a common bathroom on the second floor of 532 Upper Falls Boulevard, which had doors opening into both Apt. 1 on the north-side\n   and Apt. 2 on the south-side. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8/8/17 Levine Decl., Ex. F (ECF # 64-3), pp. 116-19, 197, 343-44, 362, &amp; 383 of 415).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Upon his release to parole in August 2011, Quincy began residing in Apt. 2, the left-hand or south-side apartment at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard. Quincy resided alone in the building at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard until the end of 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Quincy Moves to 14 Lavender Circle and Charles Moves to 532 Upper Falls Boulevard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the end of 2011, Quincy secured employment at a company in Henrietta, New York. He proposed moving in with his parents at 14 Lavender Circle because Lisa was willing to drive him back and forth to work. Lisa and Charles agreed, and Quincy moved to 14 Lavender Circle at the beginning of 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the course of a home visit by Quincy's former parole officer to 14 Lavender Circle, Charles was present. This parole officer reminded them that according to the terms of Quincy's parole agreement, Charles and Quincy could not reside there together due to Charles' history of felony convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Charles then moved to 532 Upper Falls Boulevard and took up residence in Apt. 2, the left-hand or south-side apartment that Quincy previously had occupied. Quincy remained at 14 Lavender Circle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Quincy Moves Back to 532 Upper Falls Boulevard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In or about March of 2012, Quincy quarreled with his sister, who also was living at Lavender Circle. Consequently, the Parole Division directed him to move out of that residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Quincy decided to return to 532 Upper Falls Boulevard. However, Charles and Richard\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   were living in Apt. 2 on the south-side, where Quincy had lived when he first was released on parole. By this time, Apt. 1 on the north-side apartment had been renovated, so Quincy moved into that apartment. The apartments still were connected by the common bathroom which could be accessed from both apartments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt # 64-3, pp. 19-21 &amp; 383 of 415). Charles and Richard were both well aware of Quincy's parole status, and the fact that he was subject to a search condition. Quincy admitted that he did not \"technically\" get permission to live in Apt. 1 while Richard and Charles were living in Apt. 2, but Cashman \"never came in the house\" to \"check it.\" (Deposition of Charles Quincy Reed (\"Quincy Dep.\") at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Sometime prior to May 1, 2012, Quincy requested, on behalf of the Parole Division, that Lisa draw up a lease in connection with his residence at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard. (Dkt # 64-3, p. 72 of 415). On May 1, 2012, Quincy executed a lease pertaining to \"apartment 1.\" However, Lisa had not ascribed numbers to the two apartments, and the number itself meant nothing to her. (Dkt # 64-3, p. 73 of 415).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Cashman's Conducts a Home Visit in May 2012\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Cashman was assigned as Quincy's parole officer in May of 2012. The Parole Division's case management system (\"CMS\") indicated that, at the time of Quincy's release to parole in August 2011, only one apartment had been remodeled, it was on the front or south end of the\n   building (Apt. 2); the CMS entry, which had been made by former parole officer Maria Rhodes, indicated that \"the bedroom\" was on the west side of the apartment, and that the remodeled apartment included a living room, a kitchen, an office, and a bathroom, and that Quincy's mother was continuing with the remodeling. (Transcript at 58-59, 77). On May 31, 2012, after reviewing Quincy's parole file which still indicated that Quincy was living in Apt. 2, the south-side apartment at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard, Cashman made a home visit. Cashman and Quincy only met outside, and Cashman did not go into the building. Thus, Cashman did not see the actual arrangement of the apartments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The Decision to Conduct a Parole Search of Quincy's Residence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In late July of 2012, Cashman had received information from a daily email bulletin distributed by the Monroe Crime Analysis Center (\"MCAC\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   that an individual named Taiquan Gatson (\"Gatson\"), a former State parolee, had been shot. The MCAC bulletin indicated that the person believed to have shot Gatson was named \"Charles Reed.\" Cashman deduced that the Charles Reed referenced in the MCAC bulletin was the Charles Reed on his case load, i.e., Quincy. According to Cashman, Quincy had a history of gang involvement, and there was, at that time, a feud between Gatson's gang and Quincy's gang. Cashman determined that it was good time to search Quincy's apartment since he still might have the weapon with which Gatson was shot or a weapon for his own protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On July 27, 2012, Cashman and parole officer Kimberly Smith attended the roll-call of Operation IMPACT, a county-wide task force with which they were working. Cashman informed the officers present that he was planning on doing a parole search of Quincy's apartment that evening and would appreciate assistance from the RPD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    F. The July 27, 2012 Search of 532 Upper Falls Boulevard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Initial Entry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Cashman, along with the RPD Defendants, arrived at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard at about 9:30 p.m. Richard testified that he first encountered Cashman and the other officers \"at the outside door\" to the building. (Deposition Transcript of Richard Lee Reed (\"Richard Dep.\") at 30, Ex. C to 8/8/17 Levine Decl. (ECF # 64-3) ). Cashman asked, \"[W]here's your brother?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31). Richard said he did not know if Quincy was \"up there,\" which led Cashman to ask, \"[W]hat are you doing here?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Richard replied that he lived there, \"on the other side\" and that he was going upstairs to get something from his apartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31-32). Cashman said, \"[']I'm [Quincy's] parole officer,['] and that's when he identified himself\" and \"said we're doing a routine in-home visit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31). Richard then testified as to his internal monologue or thought process during his encounter with Cashman:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [T]hat's fine, okay, do what you have to do. I still have to be somewhere in Buffalo. This is a routine home visit, so I have no issue with me [sic], I don't care, do your home visit. [Quincy]'s on parole and this is a stipulation, it [is] part of his parole and you want to come in here, do that, whatever. It was surprising it was so many people, but I'm still going up to\n   my apartment. I go up into my apartment ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Richard Dep. at 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Richard testified that Cashman began following him up the stairs from the exterior door. Richard asked him why he was \"coming up here,\" to which Cashman replied, \"this is a routine home visit. We don't need any warrants, we don't need anything, we're going up and we're going up here.\" (Richard Dep. at 32). Then, \"[a]ll\" of the officers followed Cashman, who was \"kind of leading the pack[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Richard testified that it \"was weird,\" but he was \"thinking at a routine home visit this is what happens, so I let them do it[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Richard claimed that he \"didn't let them come inside[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Rather, Cashman's \"words of, [']this is a routine home visit,['] ... made [Richard] think [Cashman] can do whatever he wants to do at that point.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Richard then asked Cashman, \"do you have a search warrant? Why are you coming up here?\" (Richard Dep. at 32). Cashman reiterated, \"we don't have to have a search warrant\" because \"[t]his [is] a routine home visit, I'm [Quincy's] parole officer.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While they were on the landing, Richard did not explain to the officers which apartment was his and which was Quincy's, since he \"assumed\" that Cashman, as Quincy's parole officer, already knew. (Richard Dep. at 33). In addition, Cashman did not ask which apartment was Quincy's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Richard \"opened the door [to the left, leading to Apt. 2], to go and get [his] stuff.\" (Richard Dep. at 34). Cashman and the officers \"push[ed] past [him]\" into the hallway. Richard saw Quincy \"standing down here [sic] by the door to [Richard's] bedroom.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Cashman saw Quincy at the same time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Quincy \"froze\" and \"put his hands up[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35). Quincy was handcuffed first and then Richard was placed in handcuffs within \"probably two minutes\" of being upstairs; it is not clear from the deposition transcript where he was handcuffed, however. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He eventually ended up in the living room with Quincy and Quincy's girlfriend, who also had been handcuffed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Cashman, on the other hand, testified that when he encountered Richard at the exterior door and asked if Quincy was home, Richard replied, \"yeah, he should be upstairs.\" Richard then \"walked up the stairs\" and \"opened the door to the left.\" (Transcript of Suppression Hearing dated March 8, 2013 (\"Supp. Tr.\"), Ex. E to 8/8/17 Levine Decl. (ECF # 64-3) at 74-75).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Cashman, Richard pointed out his bedroom, which was on the west side of the building (marked \"Richard Bedroom\" on Dep. Ex. # 7), and said that the doorway at the end of the hall (which is marked \"office/Quincy found\" on Dep. Ex. # 7) was Quincy's bedroom. (Supp. Tr. at 81). Cashman knocked on the door; Quincy answered the door and looked like he had perhaps just been sleeping. He was wearing boxer shorts and a t-shirt. There was a futon in the room on which Quincy's girlfriend was lying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Cashman testified that as soon as he walked through the door to the room marked \"office,\" he saw a little fake plant in a pot on a stand; inside the pot was a small black pistol, with the magazine \"sort of out of it.\" (Supp. Tr. at 26). Cashman then turned the scene over to the RPD because there was a possible new violation of law. Cashman assisted the RPD officers with a full search of the room and found a\n   pair of pants and a wallet with Quincy's driver's license in it. (Supp. Tr. at 44). However, Cashman did not assist the RPD officers in searching the remainder of Apt. 2, and left about a half-hour after he arrived. (Supp. Tr. at 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Quincy testified to a slightly different version. He related that he and his girlfriend, Brittany Breedlove, were in the room marked \"office\" on Dep. Ex. # 7 sleeping on a pull-out futon. Quincy was sitting on the futon when Cashman came into the room. (Quincy Dep. at 26-28). Quincy said he had woken up when he heard Richard arguing with the officers outside in the hallway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Richard testified that he remained upstairs in the living room, handcuffed, until the point that Cashman and the RPD Defendants found the handgun in the room denominated as \"office\" on Dep. Ex. # 7. (Richard Dep. at 37). After that, Richard recalled, a black detective in a suit asked him if he would consent to a search of the entire premises; Richard refused, and he was taken downstairs and placed in a patrol car. Quincy and his girlfriend already had been brought downstairs. (Richard Dep. at 39). Also, prior to Richard being removed from the apartment, Charles and his grandson (Quincy's son) arrived at the residence. Charles and the grandson were allowed to remain upstairs during the search. According to Charles, he heard Cashman say to the RPD officers that \"in order to do the proper search you have to get, you have to do the proper paperwork,\" and \"I don't have no more control over nothing there because I found what I came and look for.\" (Deposition of Charles Reed, Sr. (\"Charles Dep.\") at 63, 91). Charles testified that Cashman then left and the search continued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Charles testified that Quincy was over in his (Charles's) office on the night of July 27, 2012, because Charles had an air conditioner in that room, and Quincy did not have cable in his apartment, so he and his girlfriend were \"just over there chilling....\" (Charles Dep. at 58). Charles admitted that Quincy would \"be over there [in Charles and Richard's apartment] all the time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62). Charles testified, \"We watched TV together, we conspire, you what I'm saying, my son, so he'd be over there all the time. You know, his brother's there.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Richard remained in the patrol car for a couple of hours while the apartment was searched. He was not placed under arrest. During this time, he observed a safe being removed from the apartment by the RPD Defendants. A narcotics dog had alerted on the safe, which had been in the closet in the room where Quincy, his girlfriend, and the gun were found. However, the safe was empty. According to Charles, Investigator Powell of the RPD seized the safe. (Charles Dep. at 88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Overview of the Parties' Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   This is not a run-of-the-mill parole search case, because the plaintiffs here, Richard and Charles, are not parolees. Rather, they were co-tenants or co-residents with a parolee (Quincy). Plaintiffs' basic contention is that what is permissible as to parolees is not permissible as against non-parolees because a non-parolee should not be made to suffer the consequences of a parole search directed at a parolee. Plaintiffs argue that Cashman and the RPD Defendants actions were unreasonable because they searched an apartment that they knew did not belong to Quincy, the parolee. Plaintiffs further contend that the search was unreasonable because Cashman and the RPD Defendants did not have their consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Cashman and the RPD Defendants raise similar arguments. They contend that\n   Richard provided consent to enter the apartment and search the room in which Quincy was found by virtue of his words and actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Charles was absent, they argue, he could not withhold consent and they were not required to obtain his consent. In the alternative, the contend that\n   <em>\n    Georgia v.

In light of this reduced expectation of privacy, they argue, search was reasonable as to Richard and Charles. Cashman and the RPD Defendants also contend that even if a constitutional violation occurred, they are entitled to qualified immunity because the law is in flux concerning the issues raised in the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The Court finds that Cashman's belief was reasonable. The last entry in the Parole Division's CMS system was that Quincy's approved residence was the south-side or left-hand apartment (denominated Apt. 2 on Dep. Ex. # 7), and that Apt. 1 was not renovated or habitable. Quincy admitted that he did not update the Parole Division about his change in living arrangements when he returned to 532 Upper Falls Boulevard in 2012 and moved into Apt. 1; nor was the Parole Division updated that Quincy's mother had finished remodeling Apt. 1. Thus, when Cashman made a home-visit in May of 2012, the only information available in CMS was that there was one habitable apartment at 532 Upper Falls Boulevard, Apt. 2. Moreover, Quincy could have, but did not, notify Cashman during that home visit that he actually was living in Apt. 1, not Apt. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The facts surrounding where Quincy was located at the time Cashman and the RPD Defendants entered Apt. 2 are disputed. Cashman testified, as noted above, that Richard directed him to the door at the end of the hallway (the room marked \"office\") and said that was Quincy's bedroom. Cashman also testified that he \"went straight to Quincy's bedroom, which is the first door on the south side, straight at the end of the hall.\" (Supp. Tr. at 25). Cashman knocked on the door, and Quincy\n   answered. Cashman testified that he knew it was Quincy's bedroom because Quincy's former parole officer Maria Rhodes (\"Rhodes\") had made a notation in CMS of exactly where Quincy's bedroom was in relations to his brother's bedroom. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, that does not make sense, because at the time that Rhodes was supervising Quincy, in 2011, he was not living with Richard. In addition, the text of the CMS entry by Rhodes, which was read into the record at Quincy's suppression hearing, refers to \"[t]he bedroom\" in Apt. 2, not multiple bedrooms. \"[T]he bedroom\" in Apt. 2 is not at the end of the hallway; it is the second door on the west or right side of the hallway. (Dep. Ex. # 7 (ECF # 64-3, p. 383 of 415) ). Further inconsistency is found in Cashman's declaration submitted in connection with the prior summary judgment motion wherein Cashman said that he had a \"prior meeting with [Quincy] in that apartment.\" (Cashman Decl. (ECF # 16-3) \u00b6 17). However, Cashman admitted at Quincy's suppression hearing that he never had been inside of 532 Upper Falls Boulevard prior to July 27, 2012. (Supp. Tr. at 61). When Cashman went to that location at the end of May 2012, he spoke with Quincy outside by the front door. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 71).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For his part, Quincy testified that he was in the room marked \"office\" when Cashman entered the room, and that he was sitting on the futon wearing a t-shirt and boxer shorts, and had just woken up.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Richard, on the other hand, testified that Quincy was out in the hallway near the doorway to the room marked \"Richard Bedroom\" on Dep. Ex. # 7 when Cashman and the RPD Defendants pushed past him and went into the \"office.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Notwithstanding all of the foregoing factual inconsistencies about where Quincy was located when Cashman and the RPD Defendants first entered Apt. 2, it is undisputed that the last information provided by Quincy to the Parole Division was that he did, in fact, reside in Apt. 2. As a condition of his parole, Quincy was required to allow his parole officer to visit him at his residence. By virtue of the Certificate of Release to Parole Supervision, which Quincy signed, he agreed to permit his parole officer to conduct a \"search and inspection of [his] person, residence and property\" and to \"discuss any proposed changes in [his] residence ... with [his] Parole Officer.\" Ex. A to Cashman Decl. (ECF # 16-3). Prior to July 27, 2012, Quincy admittedly did not notify the Parole Division that he had moved into Apt. 1, and none of his family members did so either. On the night of July 27, 2012, neither Quincy nor Richard informed Cashman or the RPD Defendants that Quincy did not live in Apt. 2 but instead lived in Apt. 1. On the present record, the Court finds that Cashman had probable cause to believe that he was in Quincy's apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The RPD Defendants, in turn, were reasonably entitled to rely on the information obtained from Cashman about the location of Quincy's residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556389\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/1072/#p1079\">\n    432 F.3d at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Effective and efficient law enforcement requires cooperation and division of labor to function.

May 8, 2007). The\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   panel upheld the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's Section 1983 claims on qualified immunity grounds, reasoning that it was not clearly established that\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   created an exception to the probation-search rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 990.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   was the mother of a probationer whom the police believed was involved in a crime. The police came to the mother's house, which the probationer had indicated was her residence on various items of official paperwork, and executed a warrantless search. The district court acknowledged that, with regard to the plaintiff's refusal to consent to the search, by the time of the incident in 2010,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   the Supreme Court had decided\n   <em>\n    Georgia v.

However, it was not clear at the time-and indeed, is still unclear-whether this rule applies to a probation search. Indeed, [c]ourts have explained again and again that probation and parole are special situations with needs that differ from other types of situations. Thus, officers would be reasonable to believe that a rule that applies to searches generally does not apply the same way to probation searches. At the very least, the\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   rule is in tension with the rule allowing probation searches on a finding of probable cause that the target lives at the address. It was thus not clearly established that [the p]laintiff's refusal could or should\n   trump the consent included as a condition of [her daughter]'s probation. Because it was not clearly established that the\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   rule would apply in such a situation, the officers are immune from suit on this issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20164191\">\n    2013 WL 164191\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (internal citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barajas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4328108\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/159/1016/#p1031\">\n    159 F.Supp.3d at 1033-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   applied, but granting summary judgment in defendants' favor; homeowners' right to not have police conduct probation search of their home over their objections while probationer resided with them was not clearly established at time of the search, and therefore, police officers were entitled to qualified immunity in \u00a7 1983 action alleging that search over their objections violated the Fourth Amendment);\n   <em>\n    Lipford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203474534\">\n    2018 WL 3474534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (\"[T]he law remains unsettled (and thus could not have been settled in 2013) on the question of exactly how living with a probationer affects a non-probationer's expectation of privacy; some courts have found a reduced expectation of privacy for people who know about their roommate's probation conditions....

Moreover, the Court finds that this case does not present the appropriate vehicle for developing the law. Accordingly, the Court finds that Cashman and the RPD Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Plaintiffs' claim that the refusal to consent by Richard, as a present and objecting co-tenant, overrides the consent given by Quincy as a condition of his parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
