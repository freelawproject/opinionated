(Dkt. 16). Having considered the parties' arguments, the factual record, and the relevant law, the Court will deny Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Shiyan Jiang (\"Jiang\") is a civil engineer who spent 23 years working for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (\"TCEQ\") as a hydrologist. (Jiang Decl., Dkt. 19-2, at 1-2). Jiang is 73 years old; he was born in China. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). In November 2014, Jiang filed an internal complaint that a supervisor had discriminated against him on the basis of his age and race. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). He alleges that he began to receive unjustified differential treatment after making that first complaint; he later filed a second internal complaint in August 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In December 2015, Jiang's department director Kim Wilson (\"Wilson\") placed him on six-month disciplinary probation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). According to Wilson, she placed Jiang on probation because he failed to follow policy directives from supervisors, reinitiated closed policy debates, and conducted himself unprofessionally. (Dec. 3 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 194-196). While on probation, Jiang participated in two progress meetings: one on February 11, 2016, and another on April 21, 2016. (Jiang Decl., Dkt. 19-2, at 3). At the April 21 meeting, he again complained that he was being discriminated against on the basis of his age and race. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). On April 22, Jiang's team leader Christine Peters (\"Peters\") drafted a recommendation to fire him. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 16, at 11). Wilson agreed with Peters' recommendation and issued a notice of intent to discharge to Jiang on April 29. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). After unsuccessfully appealing the decision to terminate his employment, Jiang was fired in June 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jiang then filed this action against Defendants, alleging claims for: (1) discrimination on the basis of his race and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"Title VII\") and the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (\"TCHRA\"); (2) retaliation for engaging in protected activities under Title VII and the TCHRA; and (3) a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   by denying him \"equal rights and benefits.\" (Orig.

SUMMARY JUDGMENT EVIDENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jiang began working for TCEQ in 1993. (Jiang Decl., Dkt. 19-2, at 1). According to Defendants, Jiang had a decade-long history of raising policy disagreements with management, such as disputing the correct criteria for evaluating stream-diversion applications. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 16, at 4-6). Nonetheless, Jiang asserts without contradiction that he was not formally disciplined for any reason from 1993 until December 2015. (Jiang Decl., Dkt. 19-2, at 3). In fact, Jiang appears to have received satisfactory or better performance reviews until December 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In October 2014, Jiang's supervisor confronted him about placing certain papers in permit application folders. (Complaint Form, Dkt. 16-1, at 183-89). Jiang thought the encounter reflected race- and age-related bias, and he filed a discrimination complaint within a week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The investigative report for that complaint was sent to the Action Review Committee (\"ARC\"), which included Human Resources Director Melissa Applegate (\"Applegate\") and Wilson. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 16, at 7). The ARC met on June 29, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Wilson became head of the Surface Water Availability Team (\"SWAT\") on July 1, 2015, making her part of the ARC that considered Jiang's complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 19, at 8). The ARC dismissed Jiang's complaint on July 1, 2015. (July 1 Memo, Dkt. 16-1, at 190).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Wilson became the SWAT director, four employees-half of SWAT-filed discrimination complaints based on age or race. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Wilson Dep., Dkt. 16-2, at 17; Nov. 6 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 191). Within a month of reporting those discrimination complaints to human resources, Wilson placed two of those employees, including Jiang, on disciplinary probation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 19, at 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jiang's six-month disciplinary probation began on December 3, 2015. (Dec. 3 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 194).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   TCEQ listed a number of bases for Jiang's probation. First, Jiang had not complied with a directive not to place draft documents in permit application folders. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Second, Jiang had taken too long to complete a project (the \"Enterprise application\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Third, Jiang reinitiated debates\n   about policy matters already considered and decided by management. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Finally, Jiang raised his voice in meetings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Jiang filed a memo disputing the bases for his probation, (Jiang Rebuttal Memo, Dkt. 19-2, at 6-9), and he now produces evidence suggesting that those bases are pretextual, (Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 19, at 9-11). According to one coworker, other SWAT employees kept draft documents in permit application folders while they worked on the application, but only Jiang was reprimanded for it. (Mughal Interview Notes, Dkt. 19-3, at 78). Jiang argues that he completed the Enterprise application as directed, (Jiang Rebuttal Memo, Dkt. 19-2, at 7-8), and that his supervisor had no issues with his memo, (Alexander Dep., Dkt. 16-3, at 92). Finally, Jiang's coworkers say that others use raised voices, (Peters Dep., Doc. 16-2, at 242-43; Mughal Dep., Doc. 16-3, at 497-98), but Wilson admits that she has not formally reprimanded anyone else for doing so, (Wilson Corp. Dep., Dkt. 16-3, at 135).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jiang had two progress meetings while he was on probation. According to TCEQ's agenda for the first meeting in February 2016, Defendants told Jiang he had not complied with all of the requirements for probation, such as not reinitiating policy debates with his supervisors. (Feb. 11 Meeting Agenda, Dkt. 16-2, at 210). His second progress meeting took place on April 21, 2016. (Apr. 21 Meeting Agenda, Dkt. 16-2, at 213). According to TCEQ's agenda for that meeting, Defendants again told Jiang that he failed to comply with all of the requirements, including the policy-debate requirement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 213-14). During the April 21 meeting, Jiang complained about race and age discrimination. (Jiang Decl., Dkt. 19-2, at 4). The meeting agenda indicates that Jiang was told that he \"needs to demonstrate improvement\" and that TCEQ was \"hopeful that [Jiang's] attention to this matter will cause immediate correction.\" (Apr. 21 Meeting Agenda, Dkt. 16-2, at 217). The agenda says that Jiang's \"failure to address\" the concerns raised in the meeting \"would result in further disciplinary action, including discharge.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the morning after Jiang's second progress meeting, Peters drafted a memo recommending that Jiang be fired. (Peters email, Dkt. 16-2, at 261; Peters Apr. 21 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 315). Peters admits that there were no incidents between the second meeting and her discharge recommendation. (Peters Dep., Dkt. 16-2, at 251). On April 28, Peters and another supervisor, Lori Hamilton, issued a formal recommendation to Wilson recommending Jiang's termination. (Hamilton and Peters Apr. 28 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 391).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In their recommendation, Peters and Hamilton cite Jiang's failure to comply with TCEQ's internal policy on professional conduct, OPP 12.01. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Specifically, they found that Jiang \"continue[d] to argue with management and staff\" and \"sometimes uses an elevated tone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Jiang also \"attempted to reinitiate debates on policies\" and \"fail[ed] to consistently follow reasonable instructions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). They concluded that this conduct violated OPP 12.01. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 392). Wilson agreed with Peters' recommendation and issued a notice of intent to discharge to Jiang on April 29. (Apr. 29 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 321-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On May 11, Jiang filed an internal complaint alleging race and age discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 16, at 12). The ARC investigated Jiang's discrimination claim and concluded that he had not been discriminated against. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508389\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/5/119/#p123\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Wilson then fired Jiang, he appealed her decision, and the head of TCEQ upheld Wilson's decision. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10508389\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/5/119/#p123\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

First, Jiang has produced evidence from which a reasonable jury might infer that TCEQ's bases for placing him on probation-which relate to his eventual termination-were untrue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 743-44. Second, Jiang states that he was treated differently than other employees because of his race. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jiang Decl., Dkt. 19-2 at 2; Jiang Dep., Dkt. 16-2, at 67-68 (stating that management had a \"double standard\" for him and for white employees, such as directing junior employees not to talk to him, having junior white employees review his work, or being less lenient about his punctuality) ). Third, other employees corroborate Jiang's allegations of differential treatment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mughal Dep., Dkt. 16-3, at 171-75 (stating that he believed Jiang was discriminated against on the basis of race and discussing specific examples of differential treatment, such as speaking to him rudely); Mughal Decl., Dkt. 19-3, at 66 (same); Gable Interview Notes, Dkt. 19-3, at 11 (stating that management \"targeted\" Jiang for discriminatory reasons) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fourth, other TCEQ employees dispute the bases for Jiang's termination. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mughal Decl., Dkt. 19-3, at 66-68 (stating that Jiang was not rude to coworkers, did not raise his voice, or disrupt SWAT by debating policies) ). Fifth, despite evidence that Jiang had debated multiple policy decisions with TCEQ management since at least as far back as 2008, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 16, at 4-6), he was never formally disciplined-and there is no evidence that his conduct was unprofessional or disruptive-until Wilson took over SWAT in December 2015. A reasonable jury could conclude from this evidence that Defendants' stated reasons for terminating Jiang are untrue and that the decision to fire him was in fact motivated by his race.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendants argue that Jiang fails to raise a genuine fact issue for several reasons. First, they argue that Jiang's denials of TCEQ's asserted bases for firing him are not competent summary judgment evidence. (Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 16, at 18). While it is true that an \"employee's subjective\n   belief that he was discriminated against, standing alone, is not adequate evidence to survive a motion for summary judgment,\"\n   <em>\n    Raina v.

Summ. J., Dkt. 16, at 18-19). This argument is a request that the Court weigh the evidence, something normally prohibited at this stage but implicitly permitted by\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   's contemplation of granting judgment to an employer in cases where a plaintiff created only a weak issue of fact regarding pretext and there was abundant uncontroverted evidence that no discrimination had occurred.\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p146\">\n    530 U.S. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413371\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/133/#p146\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is not the rare case in which\n   <em>\n    Reeves\n   </em>\n   's exception to the usual prohibition against weighing the evidence at summary judgment applies. Even crediting the strength of the Defendants' evidence, the Court finds neither that Defendants' evidence is uncontroverted nor that Jiang's evidence is so weak that no reasonable jury could find in Jiang's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, Defendants argue that Jiang has only presented evidence relevant to some of the reasons he was given for his termination but has not disputed other bases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply, Dkt. 20, at 5 (\"Dr. Jiang was not terminated for speaking at an elevated volume. He was terminated for unprofessional conduct in violation of TCEQ's OPP 12.01.\") ).

More is required for his claim arising out of his placement on probation, which occurred\n   almost four months after his discrimination complaint on August 21, 2015. (Jiang Decl., Dkt. 19-2, at 3). But there is sufficient evidence to satisfy Jiang's prima facie burden with respect to that complaint, as well. On October 27, 2015, another SWAT employee, Grant Gibson, told Wilson he was being discriminated against on the basis of his age. (Nov. 6 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 191). Wilson placed him on disciplinary probation two weeks later. (Nov. 13 Memo, Dkt. 19-3, at 54). Another SWAT employee, Kathy Buckley, told Hamilton on October 27, 2015, that she felt she was being discriminated against on the basis of her age. (Nov. 6 Memo, Dkt. 16-2, at 191). Hamilton drafted a performance improvement plan for Buckley within a month of Buckley's complaint, (Buckley Draft PIP, Dkt. 19-3, at 57), but Buckley transferred out of SWAT before the plan could take effect. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. Mot. Summ. J., Dkt. 19, at 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In June 2017, SWAT employee Fayyaz Mughal told Peters that he believed that he was subject to discrimination on the basis of age and race. (Mughal email, Dkt. 19-3, at 70). Peters placed Mughal on a performance improvement plan in November 2017. (Mughal PIP, Dkt. 19-3, at 71). Viewed collectively, a reasonable jury could view these incidents as a pattern of complaint-based retaliation by SWAT's management personnel, which would be circumstantial evidence of retaliatory intent against Jiang. Additionally, there is evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that TCEQ's stated reasons for placing Jiang on probation were untrue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 743-44, from which they could further infer that Wilson placed Jiang on probation in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint. Taken together, this evidence is sufficient circumstantial evidence to satisfy Jiang's prima facie burden to establish causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As with Jiang's race-discrimination claim, there is no question that Defendants have met their burden to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the decision to fire Jiang.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 745-46.

Even TCEQ's human resources director admits that it is \"unusual\" to \"indicate that [the supervisor] is giving additional time for correction\" and then to recommend the employee's termination the next day.
