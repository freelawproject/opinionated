Having independently analyzed the record, the Court concludes that plaintiff has met the burden of proof required in a mortgage foreclosure action, and defendants have not put forth any evidence (nor is there any evidence in the record) that would support a defense to the foreclosure claim. In short, the Court concludes that the uncontroverted evidence demonstrates that plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment in this mortgage foreclosure action. Accordingly, plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted. In light of the Court's ruling on the summary judgment motion, the motion to strike defendant Bent's answer and affirmative defenses is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.

Sept. 28, 2006) (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As set forth above, the Court has examined plaintiff's submission to determine that no disputes as to material facts remain for trial. The Court examined not only plaintiff's motion and Rule 56.1 statement, but also verified facts presented in these submissions in plaintiff's exhibits, such as the copies of the Mortgage and Note, assignments, and the Default and Pre-Foreclosure Notices. Thus, the summary of the facts below is fully supported by the evidence submitted by plaintiff in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff brings this action against defendants pursuant to RPAPL \u00a7 1301\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   to foreclose upon the Subject Property pursuant to the terms of a Note and Mortgage executed on May 27, 2005. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.) Defendant Bent\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   executed and delivered the Note and Mortgage to Golden First Mortgage Corp. for $65,800.00 and interest, secured by a lien on the Subject Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12; Pl.'s Motion Ex. A at 15, 29.) The Note and Mortgage were then assigned through Mesne Assignments of Mortgage and endorsements upon the promissory note to plaintiff. (Compl. \u00b6 13; Pl.'s Motion Ex. A at 31-47.) The Assignment of Mortgage to plaintiff is dated June 16, 2016,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and was filed with the Nassau County Clerk's Office. (Compl. \u00b6 13; Pl.'s Motion Ex. A at 45-47.) Beginning on July 1, 2011, defendant failed to comply with the terms and provisions of the Mortgage by failing to make the monthly payments that were due. (Compl. \u00b6 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiff's servicer mailed defendant a 30-day notice to cure (the \"Default Notice\") on January 13, 2016. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 5; ECF No. 17-3 (\"Dotoli Aff.\") \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.) The Default Notice advised defendant that, if he failed to cure the default, the Mortgage and Note might be accelerated and the entire principal balance would become\n   due. (Dotoli Aff. \u00b6 27; Pl.'s Motion Ex. A at 49.) Additionally, that same day, the servicer mailed defendant the 90-day \"Pre-Foreclosure Notice\" required under RPAPL \u00a7 1304(1). (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 6; Dotoli Aff. \u00b6 29; Pl.'s Motion Ex. A at 53.) Defendant has failed to cure the default under the Note and Mortgage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7; Dotoli Aff. \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff commenced this action on July 19, 2016, and was the owner and holder of, and in physical possession of, the Note and Mortgage at that time. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9; Dotoli Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 5, 24-25.) On August 9, 2016, defendant filed an answer \"denying, or claiming to lack knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief\" regarding each of the allegations in the complaint, and asserting twenty-one affirmative defenses. (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 10; ECF No. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B. Procedural Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As stated\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff filed its complaint in this action on July 19, 2016, and defendant answered on August 9, 2016. Plaintiff moved for summary judgment on November 17, 2017. Defendants have not opposed plaintiff's motion. In light of defendants' failure to file an opposition by the Court's December 18, 2017 deadline, on January 10, 2018, plaintiff requested that its motion \"be submitted for decision without opposition and without the need for oral argument.\" (ECF No. 18.) On January 17, 2018, the Court ordered defendants to submit a letter advising the Court as to why no opposition had been filed by January 24, 2018. Defendants failed to file a letter. Thus, on January 25, 2018, plaintiff submitted a letter renewing its request. That same day, the Court granted plaintiff's request, cancelling the oral argument and ruling that the Court would decide plaintiff's motion for summary judgment unopposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court has fully considered the parties' submissions and decides this motion based on the uncontroverted facts set forth in plaintiff's Rule 56.1 statement (which are fully supported by the accompanying affidavit and exhibits).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II.

Ct. 1991) ). Here, plaintiff submitted such evidence in the form of an affidavit from Jared Dotoli, plaintiff's single member. This affidavit includes Dotoli's statement, based on \"[his] own knowledge and from reviewing Plaintiff's business records kept in the ordinary course of Plaintiff's business,\" that defendant failed to cure the default.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Pl.'s 56.1 \u00b6 7; Dotoli Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 31.) In light of this uncontroverted evidence, the Court concludes that plaintiff established its prima facie case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Although defendant failed to submit an opposition and a Rule 56.1 statement, the Court has examined the affirmative defenses raised in his answer to ensure that none of those defenses raise a triable issue of fact in light of the record, and thus preclude summary judgment. After examining defendant's answer to determine if it contained any facts that might conflict with plaintiff's evidence, the Court concludes that it does not. Plaintiff describes\n   defendant's answer as \"a series of general denials and 21 baseless affirmative defenses lacking any evidentiary substantiation.\" (Pl.'s Mem. at 4.) The Court agrees that the answer contains only unsupported assertions, including that: \"Plaintiff has not established possession, delivery or ownership\" (Answer \u00b6 1); \"there is no sufficient evidence to prove that GOLDEN FIRST MORTGAGE CORP. extended its own money\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5); \"Plaintiff has not perfected any claim of title or security interest in the Property\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); \"Plaintiff ... was not the legal holder or owner of the subject Notes or Mortgages\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29); \"Plaintiff failed to credit or apply any and all collateral source payments that the Plaintiff or the servicer received or will be entitled to receive from any source as a result of the default claimed under the mortgage insurance provision of the subject Mortgage\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39); \"Defendant specifically denies the authenticity of any uncertified 'duplicate' (COPY) alleged to be the Notes and Mortgages\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41); \"Plaintiff failed to serve Defendant with the requisite pre-foreclosure notice(s) under the mortgage contract, state law and[/]or federal law\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47); and \"[t]he applicable statute of limitations regarding this matter has run and plaintiff cannot bring a foreclosure action against the Defendant\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendant does not provide evidentiary support for any of these statements, nor is there any support for such assertions in the record. For instance, other than asserting that plaintiff has not established ownership or delivery, and has not perfected claim of title, defendant does not provide evidence demonstrating that the Note and Mortgage were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   delivered or that plaintiff failed to perfect title. Plaintiff, on the other hand, has provided copies of these documents, thereby satisfying its burden of establishing ownership. Similarly, the Court rejects defendant's statement denying the authenticity of the copies of the Note and Mortgage. Plaintiff had no obligation to provide the original documents as exhibits; the copies were more than sufficient. The Second Circuit has even held that statements in affidavits confirming possession of a note are sufficient to establish standing to foreclose.\n   <em>\n    OneWest Bank, N.A. v. Melina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4334307\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/214/#p217\">\n    827 F.3d 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 217, 223 (2d Cir. 2016) (\"New York courts have repeatedly held that proof of physical possession-such as the affidavits of OneWest's corporate representative and counsel in this case-is sufficient on its own to prove a plaintiff's standing to foreclose on the mortgage associated with the note.\" (collecting cases) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that defendant failed to provide evidentiary support for the abandoned denials and defenses in his answer, and no such support exists in the record. Thus, in light of the uncontroverted evidence in the record, the Court concludes that plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment in this mortgage foreclosure action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IV. CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, based upon a review of the record, the Court concludes that (1) plaintiff has met its burden of establishing a prima facie case for mortgage foreclosure, based upon the evidence submitted in connection with its summary judgment motion, and (2) no issue of material fact remains for trial. The Court,\n   therefore, grants plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. The Court denies the motion to strike defendant Bent's answer and affirmative defenses as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Plaintiff, a single-member limited liability company, is a citizen of Florida, the state in which it has its principal place of business and in which its single member is domiciled.

The Allonge to the Promissory Note, however, which states \"[p]ay to the order of Gustavia Home, LLC,\" and that it \"is to be attached and made part of the [Note and Mortgage] executed by Nicolas Bent to the order of Golden First Mortgage Corp.,\" is dated June 18, 2016.
