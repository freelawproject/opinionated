As so modified, order affirmed insofar as appealed from. H Order entered September 29, 1983 affirmed insofar as appealed from. | Plaintiffs are awarded one bill of costs. I The interrogatories not stricken by Special Term are relevant and have a \u201cbearing on the controversy which will assist preparation for trial by sharpening the issues and reducing delay and prolixity\u201d <em>(Allen v Crowell-Collier Pub. Co., </em>21 NY2d 403, 406). Because this action concerns plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that defendant Honeywell\u2019s model number T8082A thermostat was defective, plaintiffs\u2019 interrogatories seeking disclosure of customer complaints regarding this item are relevant. Plaintiffs are entitled to disclosure of information regarding claims similar in nature to their own (see <em>Peluso v Rochester Gen. Hosp., </em>64 AD2d 1013; <em>Abrams v Vaughan &amp; Bushnell Mfg. Co., </em>37 AD2d 833). Although plaintiffs may have some of the requested information in their possession, the interrogatories requesting such information are still proper, in order to sharpen the disputed issues and to eliminate undisputed issues (see <em>Allen v Crowell-Collier Pub. Co., supra; </em>3A Weinstein-Korn-Miller, NY Civ Prac, par 3131.01). The fact that plaintiffs may no longer maintain a cause of action for economic loss based on strict products liability <em>(Schiavone Constr. Co. v Mayo Corp., </em>56 NY2d 667; <em>Mid-Hudson Mack v Dutchess Quarry &amp; Supply Co., </em>99 AD2d 751) does not require striking of the interrogatories, in view of plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of a cause of action based on breach of express warranty. H However, we find that the order requiring further answers to certain other interrogatories should be modified, by requiring defendant Honeywell, Inc., to serve further responses only to interrogatories numbered \u201c21\u201d and \u201c22\u201d, and the other defendants to serve further responses only to the interrogatory numbered \u201c17\u201d. The answers served by defendants to these interrogatories were nonresponsive. More firm responses, whether affirmative or negative, are required. However, defendant Honeywell\u2019s response to the interrogatory numbered \u201c25\u201d, and the other defendants\u2019 responses to the interrogatories numbered \u201c19\u201d, \u201c20\u201d, \u201c22\u201d and \u201c23\u201d were adequate and do not warrant the service of further answers.
