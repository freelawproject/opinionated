(\"Bayou\"), appeals a trial court judgment which granted an exception of prematurity filed by defendant/appellee, Morris Bart, L.L.C. (\"Bart\"), and dismissed the case. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bayou owns and operates a medical specialty business that provides medical prosthetics\n   and related services and equipment. In 2006, Bayou provided Leroy Davis with an above-the-knee prosthesis after he had been injured in an accident in Orleans Parish on February 5, 2006. On September 19, 2006, Bart sent a letter to Bayou stating that it was representing Mr. Davis for injuries he sustained in said accident and it was requesting a copy of Mr. Davis's medical records. On January 4, 2007, Bart sent another letter to Bayou stating that it would protect Bayou's medical charges in the amount of $29,124.76 for the fitting of Mr. Davis's prosthesis, as outlined in an October 20, 2006 invoice, \"out of any net settlement or proceeds obtained during this firm's representation in this matter as a result of any claims for damages\" arising out of Mr. Davis's February 5, 2006 accident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 11, 2007, Bart sent a similar letter to Bayou, again assuring Bayou that it would protect the $29,124.76 \"out of any net settlement or proceeds obtained during this firm's representation in this matter as a result of any claims for damages\" arising out of Mr. Davis's accident. Bayou continued to treat Mr. Davis for almost ten years thereafter for a number of services valued by Bayou at $125,923.40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 4, 2017, Bayou filed a Petition for Damages against Bart, claiming that it had not been paid any amount from Bart on Mr. Davis's outstanding balance for services rendered, despite assurances of payment having been made by Bart, both by letters and orally.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its petition, Bayou alleged that it had never agreed to an arrangement with Bart to operate on a \"lien basis,\" nor to only be paid out of a settlement. Bayou argued that it was a specialty provider that did not operate in that manner. The petition made several claims against Bart, including detrimental reliance, breach of contract, negligence, and \"promissory and equitable estoppel.\" Bayou prayed that it be compensated for the full value of all medical services it provided to Mr. Davis, \"allowable\" interest on the balance of Mr. Davis's account, and reasonable attorney's fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In response to the petition, Bart filed various exceptions, including an exception of prematurity in which Bart argued that Bayou's claims were premature since its obligation to make payment to Bayou was dependent upon the occurrence of a suspensive condition-the payment to Bart of settlement proceeds-which had not yet occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its memorandum in support of its exceptions, Bart acknowledged that through its January 4, 2007 and January 11, 2007 letters, it guaranteed payment to Bayou of $29,124.76 out of any net settlement or proceeds obtained during its representation of Mr. Davis. Bart further provided that on December 7, 2009, a settlement in the amount of $1,890,872.00 had been reached in Mr. Davis's personal injury case, and a stipulated judgment in the settlement amount had been rendered against the City of New Orleans on that\n   date; however, to date, the City had not appropriated the funds to pay the judgment, and thus, no settlement proceeds had been obtained. Bart argued that since the obligation to pay the medical expenses was predicated upon the receipt of proceeds through settlement or judgment, which had not yet occurred, Bayou's suit was premature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In opposition to the exception, Bayou argued that the agreement between the parties was based on a term, not on a suspensive condition, and accordingly, payment had to be made within a reasonable time. Bayou argued that Bart did not perform as agreed to at the time of the settlement, nor did it perform within a reasonable time after the settlement. Alternatively, Bayou argued that the term and/or condition is not based upon when Bart\n   <em>\n    received\n   </em>\n   the settlement or proceeds, but rather when Bart\n   <em>\n    obtained\n   </em>\n   a settlement or proceeds. Since Bart obtained the settlement on December 7, 2009, Bayou argued that the term had expired and/or the condition had occurred and was therefore enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court conducted a hearing on the exceptions on May 24, 2017. At the end of the hearing, the trial judge orally sustained the exception of prematurity and dismissed the case. A written judgment to this effect was signed on May 31, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, Bayou assigns the following errors, to-wit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   1. The claims brought against Bart are not premature; the case needs a full trial based on the positions of both parties regarding the responsibility of payment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   2.

Bayou argues that Bart did not perform as promised at the time of the settlement and judgment, nor did it perform within a reasonable time thereafter, since nearly ten years had passed since Bayou first treated Mr. Davis. Bayou further argues that although there was no formal agreement between the parties, only promises to protect one bill, Bart made oral assurances to Bayou that Bayou would be paid in full. Bayou also argues that it put Bart in default within a reasonable time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Upon review, we find that the trial court did not commit manifest error in its granting of the exception of prematurity. The trial court was presented with Bart's letters that clearly state that Bart would only protect Bayou's charges \"out of any net settlement or proceeds obtained\" as a result of any claims for damages arising out of Mr. Davis's February 5, 2006 accident. Although Bayou argues that it never agreed to be paid on a lien basis and oral assurances from Bart led it to continue treating Mr. Davis, based on the evidence and arguments presented at the hearing on the exceptions, the trial court apparently did not credit Bayou's assertions of oral agreements between the parties, and for purposes of the exception, chose to believe that Bart's letters were the extent of the agreement reached by the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon review of the entirety of the record, we cannot say that the trial court was manifestly erroneous in its assessment of the evidence and arguments presented to\n   it at the hearing on the exception of prematurity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In brief, Bayou cites this Court to\n   <em>\n    Tymeless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , in support of its argument that the contract in question contained a \"pay-when-paid\" clause, rather than a \"pay-if-paid\" clause. In\n   <em>\n    Tymeless\n   </em>\n   , the court focused on the language in the construction contract at issue to determine if the payment provision would qualify as a \"pay-when-paid\" clause or a \"pay-if-paid\" clause, and looked for definitive terms such as \"unless and until\" or even \"if\" when making its determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon review, we find that\n   <em>\n    Tymeless\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the present case. First,\n   <em>\n    Tymeless\n   </em>\n   deals with payment provisions of a construction contract, specifically the process of payment by contractors to subcontractors under a construction contract.\n   <em>\n    Tymeless\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6852333\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/145/\">\n    172 So.3d at 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In contrast, the present case deals with an entirely different type of contract: an agreement between an attorney and a medical treatment provider in relation to a personal injury claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Second, in contrast to the language contained in the construction contract under review in\n   <em>\n    Tymeless\n   </em>\n   , Bart's letters to Bayou in the present case expressly include the \"condition precedent\" that payment would be made by Bart to Bayou out of any net settlement or proceeds \"obtained\" by Bart, an uncertain event which has not yet occurred,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   thus qualifying the language contained in Bart's letters to Bayou as a \"pay-if-paid\" clause, rather than a \"pay-when-paid\" clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Third, the court in\n   <em>\n    Tymeless\n   </em>\n   found that \"pay-if-paid\" language in the context of a construction contract resulted in the \"harsh\" consequence of shifting the risk of the owner's lack of payment from the contractor to the subcontractor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6852333\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/145/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6852333\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/172/145/\">\n    at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, Bayou obviously appreciated and accepted the risk of nonpayment by its continued treatment of Mr. Davis after receipt of Bart's letters, as Bart's letters to Bayou provide that payment to Bayou was conditioned upon Bart's obtaining proceeds from a judgment or settlement in Mr. Davis's personal injury lawsuit, an uncertain event then and now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Thus, based on the evidence presented for purposes of the exception, we find that the trial court did not err in granting the exception of prematurity. The \"prerequisite condition\" that Bart would pay \"out of any net settlement or proceeds obtained,\" established in Bart's letters to Bayou, has not yet occurred, and therefore, Bayou's claim is premature: it was brought \"before the right to enforce the claim sued upon has accrued.\"\n   <em>\n    Floyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This assignment of error is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR NUMBERS TWO AND THREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Considering our finding that the trial court properly granted Bart's exception of prematurity, we pretermit any review or discussion of Bayou's remaining alternative assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the trial court's judgment that granted Bart's exception of prematurity is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     AFFIRMED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Bart had previously entered into a contingency fee contract with Mr. Davis to represent him in connection with his accident.
