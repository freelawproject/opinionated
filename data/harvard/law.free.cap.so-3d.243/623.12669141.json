For the reasons that follow, we convert the appeal to a writ, grant the writ, deny relief, and remand for further proceedings.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellants filed a petition for writ of mandamus August 9, 2017, stating they were CPNC taxi cab drivers whose vehicles were regulated by the City of New Orleans Department of Safety and Permits (\"the Department\"), through its director, Jared Munster. Appellants noted that the Department requires taxi cab drivers and owners to submit their vehicles for inspection pursuant to the City of New Orleans Code of Ordinances, and that such inspection requires an application and payment of a fee. However, Appellants alleged that the Department does not enforce these requirements for \"transportation network company\" (\"TNC\") vehicles, which they describe as vehicles driving for \"app-based services such as Uber and Lyft[.]\" Appellants argued that the Department's failure in this regard \"puts the public at risk, causes extra time constraints and expense to taxicab drivers and creates an unlevel playing field as to competition, as well as denying taxi drivers equal protection under the law.\" Accordingly, Appellants sought the issuance of a writ of mandamus ordering the Department to comply with the ordinances as they applied to TNCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 21, 2017, the City filed an exception of no right of action in opposition to Appellant's petition, arguing, in part, that Appellants lacked standing to seek mandamus directed at a public official absent a showing of a special interest, separate and distinct from that of the public at large. The City argued that \"mere competitive disadvantage\" failed to meet such requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The district court heard arguments on August 25, 2017, ultimately sustaining the exception filed by the City. In its reasons for judgment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the district court found Appellants to have alleged a \"special interest\" in the form of \"competitive disadvantage,\" which the district court found \"insufficient ... to maintain a cause of action.\" Accordingly, the district court did not address the writ of mandamus further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We note that the judgment in question lacks the necessary decretal language to invoke this Court's appellate jurisdiction. Specifically, the judgment merely states, \"the Defendant's exception of no right of action is hereby sustained.\" However, as our jurisprudence has made clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-14\">\n   A final judgment shall be identified as such by appropriate language.

In\n    <em>\n     Sewell\n    </em>\n    , plaintiff filed a petition for writ of mandamus directed to the Orleans Parish Levee Board (\"the Board\"), which had granted rent relief to a casino.

Such interests are common to the public at large.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127902\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/779/1003/#p1005\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11127902\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/779/1003/#p1005\">\n     at 1006\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The City advances the same argument here; that is, Appellants have failed to allege a special interest in requiring the Department to enforce the relevant sections of the City Ordinances against TNCs.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    We agree that Appellants have no standing to seek mandamus relief by arguing the Department's failure to regulate TNCs in the same manner as taxi cabs puts the public at risk. As in\n    <em>\n     Sewell\n    </em>\n    , the Department's failure in this regard places the public at large at risk, such that Appellants can assert no \"special interest.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Appellants' argument that the Department's inaction places them at a competitive disadvantage also fails. Although Appellants disputed its applicability to the facts of this case, we find the City's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Lauer v. City of Kenner\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7549927\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/536/767/\">\n     536 So.2d 767\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (La.App. 5 Cir. 1988), is not misplaced. In\n    <em>\n     Lauer\n    </em>\n    , plaintiff sought damages resulting from declined business after the City of Kenner granted a land use variance to plaintiff's business competitor.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7549927\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/536/767/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7549927\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/536/767/\">\n     at 768\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In affirming the district court's judgment in favor of the City of Kenner, the Fifth Circuit reasoned:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n    In the present case, Lauer's only complaint is that competition from the [business competitor's] grocery has hurt his grocery business. This competition is a factor shared by all other grocers in the municipality, and is therefore not distinct to him. In the factual circumstances of this case, we hold that this mere competitive disadvantage is not such a particular interest as to confer standing upon Lauer to bring this suit.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7549927\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/536/767/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7549927\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/536/767/\">\n     at 772\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Though not a case concerning an exception of no cause of action, the same issue of standing to bring suit is implicated. Here, in order to bring suit, Appellants were required to show that\n    they had standing by virtue of a special interest. The Court in\n    <em>\n     Lauer\n    </em>\n    squarely held that \"competitive disadvantage\" is insufficient to confer standing, as that disadvantage was not unique to plaintiff, but shared by all other similarly-situated grocers.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Here, only two New Orleans CPNC taxi cab drivers have filed suit, asserting a competitive disadvantage presented by the Department's failure to enforce the City Ordinance, as written. However, as the Court did in\n    <em>\n     Lauer\n    </em>\n    , we find that mere competitive disadvantage does not confer the requisite standing, as this disadvantage is shared by all other taxi cab drivers in the City of New Orleans.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Notwithstanding the aforementioned, we find that the granting of the exception of no right of action, without allowing for an amendment violates the mandates set forth in La.C.C.P. art. 934, which states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n    When the grounds of the objection pleaded by the peremptory exception [e.g., no right of action] may be removed by amendment of the petition, the judgment sustaining the exception shall order such amendment within the delay allowed by the court. If the grounds of the objection raised through the exception cannot be so removed, or if the plaintiff fails to comply with the order to amend, the action, claim, demand, issue, or theory shall be dismissed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The district court did not provide Appellants an opportunity to amend their petition as required by the Code of Civil Procedure. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this decision.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, we convert Appellants' appeal to a writ. The writ is granted, and relief is denied, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <strong>\n     APPEAL CONVERTED TO WRIT; WRIT GRANTED, RELIEF DENIED; REMANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
