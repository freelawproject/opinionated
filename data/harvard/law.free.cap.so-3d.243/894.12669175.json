If after a reasonable period of negotiation which shall not exceed 14 days, a dispute exists between the public employer and the bargaining agent, an impasse shall be deemed to have occurred, and one of the parties shall so declare in writing to the other party and to the commission. The parties shall then proceed pursuant to the provisions of s. 447.403. An unfair labor practice charge shall not be filed during the 14 days\n   during which negotiations are occurring pursuant to this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00a7 447.4095, Fla. Stat. (2010). In response, Petitioner, Fraternal Order of Police, Miami Lodge 20 (FOP), moved for a declaratory judgment against the City and challenged the facial constitutionality of the statute, arguing that it is void for vagueness, deprives the FOP of due process, and denies equal protection. The trial court granted the City's motion for summary judgment and the FOP appealed. The Third District affirmed the trial court.\n   <em>\n    Fraternal Order of Police\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6928545,6928524\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/143/953/\">\n    143 So.3d at 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

A statute is void for vagueness when persons of common intelligence must guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application.\n   <em>\n    Samples v. Florida Birth-Related Neurological Injury Comp. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7007009\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/114/912/#p919\">\n    114 So.3d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 919-20 (Fla. 2013). A statute is also void for vagueness if it lends itself to arbitrary enforcement at an officer's discretion.\n   <em>\n    D'Alemberte v. Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9702412\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/349/164/#p166\">\n    349 So.2d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 166 (Fla. 1977). Petitioner argues that section 447.4095 is vague because the legislature did not define the term \"financial urgency.\" According to Petitioner, this allows a city unfettered discretion to unilaterally modify an agreement because the legislature did not define what circumstances must be met before a financial urgency can be declared. In support of this claim, Petitioner points to the staff analysis for the bill, which notes that the term \"financial urgency\" \"is undefined in the bill or in chapter 447 and ... its interpretation is left to practice.\" Fla. S. Comm. on Govt. Ops., CS for SB 888 (1995) Staff Analysis (Mar. 27, 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The legislature's failure to define a statutory term does not in and of itself render a provision unconstitutionally vague.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Hagan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9587405\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/387/943/#p945\">\n    387 So.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 945 (Fla. 1980). We have previously held that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   the specificity with which the legislature must set out statutory standards and guidelines may depend upon the subject matter dealt with and the degree of difficulty involved in articulating finite standards. The same conditions that may operate to make direct legislative control impractical or ineffective may also, for the same reasons, make the drafting of detailed or specific legislation for the guidance of administrative agencies impractical or undesirable.... [C]ourts cannot realistically require the legislature to dictate every conceivable application of the law down to the most minute detail.... [C]omplex areas such as taxation should be left to the appropriate agency having expertise and flexibility. Otherwise, the legislature would be forced to remain in perpetual session\n   and devote a large portion of its time to regulation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    In re Advisory Opinion to Governor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572878\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/509/292/#p311\">\n    509 So.2d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311 (Fla. 1987) (citations omitted). Thus, \"the legislature may 'enact a law, complete in itself, designed to accomplish a general public purpose, and may expressly authorize designated officials within definite valid limitations to provide rules and regulations for the complete operation and enforcement of the law within its expressed general purpose.' \"\n   <em>\n    Sims v.

Stat. (2010). After the legislature enacted section 447.4095, district courts of appeal deferred to PERC to provide a definition of financial urgency.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Manatee Educ. Ass'n, FEA AFT (Local 3821), v. Sch.

On this question, we defer initially to PERC.\"). Ultimately, PERC defined the term to mean \"a dire financial condition requiring immediate attention and demanding prompt and decisive action, but not necessarily a financial emergency or bankruptcy,\" which we accepted.\n   <em>\n    Walter E. Headley, Jr. Miami Lodge No. 20 v. City of Miami (Headley Miami Lodge)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12361209\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/215/1/#p6\">\n    215 So.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 6 (Fla. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It does not appear that section 447.4095 is void for vagueness. Instead, it seems that the legislature purposely declined to define the term in order to defer to PERC's expertise. Based on our precedent, that is permissible, as it would be impossible to draft legislation that could adequately cover every instance where a public employer may need to invoke the statute. While the union may not agree with PERC's definition of the term, that does not render the statute unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    In re Advisory\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7572878\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/509/292/#p311\">\n    509 So.2d at 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that section 447.4095 is not unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Secondly, Petitioner argues that the statute violates substantive due process. Under substantive due process, a statute must not be unreasonable, arbitrary or capricious, and must have a reasonable and substantial relation to a legitimate government objective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Robinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248986\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/873/1205/#p1214\">\n    873 So.2d 1205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1214 (Fla. 2004). When a statute encroaches on fundamental constitutional rights, the statute must be narrowly tailored to achieve the state's purpose.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9248986\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/873/1205/#p1214\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We have previously considered section 447.4095 and found that while the statute implicates fundamental rights, i.e., the right to contract and collectively bargain, the statute satisfies strict scrutiny. In\n   <em>\n    Headley Miami Lodge\n   </em>\n   , we stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 447.4095 is the codification of the strict scrutiny standard we outlined in\n   <em>\n    Chiles\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v. United Faculty of Florida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7471435\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/615/671/\">\n    615 So.2d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Fla. 1993) ]. The term \"financial urgency\" represents the first prong of strict scrutiny. As previously stated, a financial urgency is \"a dire financial condition requiring immediate attention and demanding prompt and decisive action, but not necessarily a financial emergency or bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Headley[ v. City of Miami]\n   </em>\n   , 118 So.3d [885] at 892 [ (Fla. 1st DCA 2013) ] ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollywood Fire Fighters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6952915\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/133/1042/\">\n    133 So.3d at 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Headley\n   </em>\n   ). In showing that its current financial condition is dire and requires immediate attention, the local government establishes a compelling state interest and satisfies the first prong of strict scrutiny.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The phrase \"requiring modification of an agreement\" represents the second\n   prong of strict scrutiny. While a local government may be able to show that its financial condition requires immediate attention and demands prompt and decisive action, this may not necessarily require modification of the agreement. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Chiles\n   </em>\n   , \"the mere fact that it is politically more expedient to eliminate all or part of the contracted funds is not in itself a compelling reason.\"\n   <em>\n    Chiles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7471435\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/615/671/\">\n    615 So.2d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the term \"requiring modification\" forces the local government to demonstrate that the only way of addressing its dire financial condition is through modification of the CBA. To do this, the local government must demonstrate that the funds are available from no other reasonable source. This satisfies the second requirement of strict scrutiny, that the law be narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12361209\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/215/1/#p6\">\n    215 So.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we have already found that the statute is narrowly tailored to achieve a legitimate state interest, we also conclude that the statute does not violate substantive due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Similarly, we deny Petitioner's equal protection claim. Equal protection is not violated merely because some individuals are treated differently than others.\n   <em>\n    Duncan v. Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11538359\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/754/708/#p712\">\n    754 So.2d 708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 712 (Fla. 2000). Instead, it requires that persons similarly situated be treated similarly.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11538359\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/754/708/#p712\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"[I]f the interest which is being taken is a fundamental interest ... then the means or method employed by the statute to remedy the asserted problem must meet not only the rational basis test, but also the strict scrutiny test.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitchell v.

While Petitioner compares public employees to private employees, employee bargaining in the public sector is different from that of the private sector, as limitations on the right to collectively bargain are involved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Because public employees bargain over public money, the control of which is a legislative function, there exists a legitimate government purpose in treating collective bargaining agreements of public employees differently than those of private employees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7484813\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/613/415/#p417\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As previously stated, we have already determined that the statute satisfies strict scrutiny in\n   <em>\n    Headley Miami Lodge.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Headley Miami Lodge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12361209\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/215/1/#p6\">\n    215 So.3d at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
