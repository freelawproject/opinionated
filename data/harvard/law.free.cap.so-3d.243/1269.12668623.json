For the reasons that follow, the State's appeal is dismissed, and we reserve the State's right to file an application for supervisory writs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF THE CASE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 27, 2017, the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office filed a bill of information charging defendant, Jonathan Lopez, with possession of marijuana, third offense, in violation of La. R.S. 40:966(C). Defendant pled not guilty at his arraignment on March 29, 2017. Thereafter, on May 12, 2017, defendant filed a motion to quash the bill of information, arguing that one of his prior convictions could not be used as a predicate conviction for enhancement purposes. The trial court granted defendant's motion following a hearing on May 30, 2017. The State timely sought the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Only a final judgment or ruling is appealable. La. C.Cr.P. art. 912(A). A final judgment is one which puts an end to the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Arceneaux\n   </em>\n   , 13-953 (La. App. 5 Cir. 04/23/14),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20So.%203d%20304\">\n    140 So.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306. A motion to quash an indictment or any count thereof may be appealed by the State. La. C.Cr.P. art. 912 (B)(1). When read and interpreted in reference to subsection A, a ruling on a motion to quash must be a final judgment that puts an end to the proceedings in order to be appealable.\n   <em>\n    Arceneaux\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=140%20So.%203d%20304\">\n    140 So.3d at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The quashing of a predicate offense does not put an end to the proceedings and, instead simply reduces the grade of the offense.\n   <em>\n    State v. Millette\n   </em>\n   , 14-76 (La. App. 5 Cir. 10/29/14),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874065\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/865/\">\n    164 So.3d 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In this case, the trial court's quashing of the 2009 predicate only reduced the grade of the offense from a possession of marijuana, third offense to a possession of marijuana, second offense. Therefore, it is not a final, appealable judgment. The State's proper avenue to seek review is by an application for a writ of review under our supervisory jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Arceneaux, supra\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Millette,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6874065\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/164/865/\">\n     supra\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DECREE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Accordingly, we dismiss the present appeal. We reserve to the State the right to file a proper application for supervisory writs, in compliance with U.R.C.A. Rule 4-3, within fifteen days from the date of this decision. Further, we construe the motion for appeal as a notice of intent to seek a supervisory writ so the State is not required to file a notice of intent nor obtain an order setting a return date pursuant to U.R.C.A. Rule 4-3.\n   <em>\n    State v. Donaldson\n   </em>\n   , 13-703 (La. App. 5 Cir. 11/19/13),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7273864\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/130/394/\">\n    130 So.3d 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APPEAL DISMISSED\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
