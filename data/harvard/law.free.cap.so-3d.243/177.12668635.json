The trial court granted the Lincoln County Board of Supervisors' and the City of Brookhaven, Mississippi's motions to dismiss Samuel Wilcher, Jr.'s personal injury suit, finding both governmental entities enjoyed discretionary-function immunity. In doing so, the judge employed this Court's recently created \"\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   \" test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. On appeal, we face head on one of the unintended but predicted consequences of\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   -that the test forces parties and judges to wade through an ever-deepening quagmire of regulations and ordinances to locate \"ministerial\" or \"discretionary\" duties, overcomplicating the process of litigating and deciding claims involving governmental entities. Unfortunately, this methodology, though well-intentioned, has over time proved unworkable. Instead of trying to retool the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   test to somehow make it workable, we concede this short-lived idea, which was meant to be a course correction, has ultimately led this Court even farther adrift. Because the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   line of cases has not fulfilled its purpose-getting our discretionary-function analysis back on track-we abandon this failed venture. We find it best to return to our original course of applying the widely recognized public-policy function test-the original Mississippi Tort Claims Act (MTCA) test first adopted by this Court in 1999 in\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Applying the\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   test to this case, we hold that Wilcher's claim that County and City employees negligently left an unfinished culvert installation overnight, without warning drivers they had removed but not yet replaced a bridge, is not barred by discretionary-function immunity. Wilcher is not trying to second-guess a policy decision through tort. He is seeking to recover for injuries caused by run-of-the-mill negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. Because, from the face of the complaint, the County and City are not immune, we reverse the grant of their motions to dismiss. We thus remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n   \u00b6 5. According to Wilcher's complaint,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   he was driving at night on Washington Street in Brookhaven when his vehicle suddenly crashed into a big hole. This \"pit or ditch\" was left in the road where the County and City were repairing or constructing a bridge. Wilcher had not been made aware the bridge was under construction. And there were no warning signs, flag persons, lights, or any other devices that would warn Wilcher the bridge or roadway was missing, closed, or under repair or construction. Wilcher's vehicle crashed into the hole, injuring Wilcher and damaging his vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6. After giving the requisite statutory notice,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wilcher sued the Lincoln County Board of Supervisors (County) and the City of Brookhaven (City) for negligence. Wilcher alleged both entities-who had been working jointly to replace the bridge with a culvert-had failed in their duty to warn motorists the bridge was closed or under construction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This failure, he asserted, violated both entities' statutory duty under Mississippi Code Section 63-3-305 (Rev. 2013). It also fell below the required specifications of the \"state manual,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   showing a reckless disregard for motorists' safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7. Both the County and City filed motions to dismiss, insisting Wilcher's claims were barred by the MTCA. Specifically, they argued the duty imposed by Section 63-3-305 was discretionary, thus entitling them to discretionary-function immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-9\">\n    Miss.

Under the MTCA, the default rule is that political subdivisions like Lincoln County and Brookhaven are not immune from tort claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Legislature carved out several exceptions, reinstating immunity for certain types of claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Miss.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2011-46-9\">\n    Miss.

This particular section confers \"discretionary-function immunity.\" Under this provision, \"A governmental entity and its employees acting within the course and scope of their employment or duties shall not be liable for any claim ...

Four years ago, however, five members of this Court decided to abandon the two-part, public-policy function test. The\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   majority claimed to have detected in Section 11-46-9(1)(d)\"a requirement not present in the Federal Tort Claims Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Brantley v.

So the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   majority crafted a new and completely different test. The\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   test directed the Court to first \"consider the broadest function involved in order\n   to make a baseline determination of whether the overarching function is discretionary or ministerial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914517\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/1106/#p1112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914517\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/1106/#p1112\">\n    at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The Court then must examine any narrower duty associated with the activity at issue to determine whether a statute, regulation, or other binding directive renders that particular duty a ministerial one, notwithstanding that it may have been performed within the scope of a broader discretionary function.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914517\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/1106/#p1112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914517\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/1106/#p1112\">\n    at 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But in reality, the new test \"marked an unwise and unworkable departure from longstanding precedent,\" and by failing to consider whether the activity in question involved policy, ignored the Legislative intent behind discretionary-function immunity.\n   <em>\n    Crider v.

Were we to apply\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   here, we would start with arguably the broadest function possible-the placement of traffic-control devices, which Section 63-3-305 leaves to the discretion of the controlling political subdivision. But we could not stop there, as the trial court did. Instead, we would then have to scour the state manual. After that, we would have to hunt for other regulations and ordinances to see if the narrower duty in question has somehow been \"rendered ministerial.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   This tedious and scattered quest exemplifies one of the major criticisms of\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   analysis-that \"it overcomplicates the process of litigating a claim and places the success of a claim on the ability of the injured party's attorney to sift through myriad and sometimes arcane regulations-creating extra layers of proof,\n   <em>\n    which may have little or no practical effect on the actual negligent act\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Crum v.

Here,\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   analysis would require this Court to take a deep dive into the Mississippi Code, the City of Brookhaven's Code of Ordinances, the Mississippi Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction (a/k/a \"Red Book\"), and the Mississippi Administrative Code to justify what should be blatantly obvious. Both common sense and the common law dictate that if a road crew removes a bridge to install a culvert, leaves a giant hole overnight, and fails to either barricade or sufficiently warn about the gaping hole it created, then the entity in charge could be liable in tort if someone drives his car into the hole. This would certainly be true in the context of a premises-liability claim against a private property owner. So why should it be any different when the government owns or controls the premises? In other words, the government does not have the \"discretion\"-let alone legislatively conferred discretion-to create a dangerous condition and leave it exposed without warning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 17. But the problems with\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   run much deeper than just placing a hodgepodge of local ordinances and regulations\n   front and center in our sovereign-immunity analysis. As a result of\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   , what the Legislature intended as a shield-discretionary-function immunity under Section 11-46-9(1)(d) -is flipped on its head and is being used as a sword. Parties are now citing\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   to bring actions based solely on violations of statutes and/or local ordinances or regulations, which they argue impose \"ministerial\" duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Horton v.

Despite this,\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   's analysis wrongly zeroes in on applicable regulations and ordinances. And if a regulation was \"ministerial,\" this Court began to presume that the alleged violation of that regulation or ordinance, itself, established a viable cause of action without even questioning if a claim would exist\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   the regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 19. Though its problems are aplenty, Justice Kitchens continues to defend\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   . He insists \"seasoned practitioners and jurists understand\" that our law should be confusing. This, he suggests, \"is what the lawyers who represent parties and the judges who sort through and decide complex legal issues, often involving myriad statutes, ordinances, and regulations, have done from time immemorial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 20. But whether a practitioner is long in the tooth, or fresh out of law school, it is obvious to all who have been involved in these cases recently that the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   approach is\n   <em>\n    unnecessarily\n   </em>\n   complex. It also improperly turns regulations into causes of action, and is not based on the text of Mississippi's Tort Claims Act. But perhaps the most practical truth is that it has made it little more than a gamble when lawyers advise clients whether they have valid tort claims or defenses in MTCA cases. And that is not how our law should operate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 21.

Wilcher's complaint is evidence of the confusion\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   has created. According to his factual allegations, the County and City removed a bridge and failed to warn oncoming motorists the road had not yet been replaced. These allegations support a common-law premises-based claim of failure to warn of a dangerous condition created by the County and City. Yet, Wilcher did not plead his claim as negligent failure to warn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Wilcher apparently found the statutory duty that most closely fit the factual scenario. And he argued the County and City breached the ministerial duties the statute imposed. He then turned to the state manual. He did this to establish a claim that, should the broader statutory function be discretionary, the defendants still had violated mandatory regulatory duties. In other words, even though Wilcher's allegations support an obvious common-law negligence claim against the defendants, under\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   , he was forced to present his claim as a statutory and/or regulatory violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 23. This leads us to the inescapable conclusion that, instead of being a course correction,\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   has led this Court even farther astray. And this Court finds itself in a deep hole of our own making. But rather than try to dig our way out by further modifying the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   test, we find the better course is to put down the shovel. We thus abandon and overrule the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   line of cases and return to our original course of applying the widely-recognized, easily understood, public-policy function test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

So, while the phrase \"acting within the course and scope of their employment or duties\" does limit discretionary-function immunity, it is inaccurate to say the federal counterpart has no comparable limitation. Taken to its logical conclusion, the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   position-that our immunity provision has an additional limitation-suggests that federal employees can claim sovereign immunity for actions taken outside the course and scope of their employment, when this is certainly not the case.

Our Legislature did not draft Section 11-46-9(1)(d) in a vacuum. Instead, as even the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   majority had to acknowledge, the Legislature patterned Mississippi's immunity provision after its federal counterpart.\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914517\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/1106/#p1112\">\n    152 So.3d at 1112\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b6 29.

Reason also dictates that, in light of the fact the purported course corrections have proved more and more unworkable with every case, we should return to this test. The justification for why we had to abandon the\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   test-that our provision has an additional \"acting within the course and scope\" requirement-simply fails under scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Return to the Traditional Public-Policy Function Test\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 30. Mississippi's public-policy function test has two parts. \"This Court first must ascertain whether the activity in question involved an element of choice or judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7023840\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/80/789/#p795\">\n    80 So.3d at 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If so, this Court also must decide whether that choice or judgment involved social, economic, or political-policy considerations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7023840\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/80/789/#p795\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Only when both parts of the test are met does a government defendant enjoy discretionary-function immunity. This test, of course, presupposes the court has correctly identified \"the activity in question\"-the allegedly tortious act giving rise to the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b6 31. The County and City insist the placement of traffic-control devices is a \"discretionary function\" under Section 63-3-305. But what the parties-and Justice Kitchens-miss is that the placement or lack of placement of a traffic-control device is not the government function being challenged. This is not a case, for example, where the plaintiff alleges the County or City decided against installing warning lights or signs at dangerous intersections, and that particular decision contributed to his accident with another vehicle. In such a scenario, it would be arguable that the\n   plaintiff was trying to use his tort action to second-guess the government's discretionary policy decision on how best to regulate traffic within the confines of the government's limited resources-something the discretionary-function provision was designed to curb.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Gaubert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    499 U.S. at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318818\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/315/#p322\">\n    111 S.Ct. at 1273-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But again, that is not what Wilcher is claiming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b6 32.

And applying the public-policy function test, it certainly was not the result of a policy decision. Rather, if indeed there was such a failure, it was the result of straight-up negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 33. We admit the public-policy function test is not perfect and has been misapplied in the past. We are particularly mindful of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   , which stretched the bounds of \"policy\" beyond credulity.\n   <em>\n    Pratt v.

Because discretionary-function immunity \"protects only governmental actions and decisions based on considerations of public policy,\" when \"applying the discretionary-function exception, this Court must distinguish between\n   <em>\n    real policy decisions\n   </em>\n   implicating governmental functions and\n   <em>\n    simple acts of negligence\n   </em>\n   which injure innocent citizens.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003229\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/97/68/#p75\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7003229\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/97/68/#p75\">\n    at 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Waller, C.J., dissenting) (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

Any concept of the sort of policy decisions implicit in deciding how to place nonslip tape on airstairs was completely subsumed by the fact that the decision to operate an airport was discretionary and implicated economic policy considerations. Clearly, this Court looked at the broad governmental function of airport operation implicated by the suit when it determined that discretionary-function immunity applied, rather than analyzing the specific activity of placing nonslip tape on stairs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Further, in\n   <em>\n    City of Jackson v.

Instead, the Court stated that the \"creation and operation of a city park is within the discretion of the municipality[,]\" and thus immunity applied.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7036999\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/68/1285/#p1288\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, the Court did not focus on the specific activity in question, but rather on the overarching function of the operation of a public park. So, while the dissent in the present case may argue that this approach arises from some novel understanding of the law, in actuality, this Court has been focusing on the function, rather than on the act, for some time now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   , this Court recognized that, although a broad function, such as the operation of an airport, may be discretionary, or that road maintenance may be ministerial, within those functions may lie more narrowly defined duties which may be rendered ministerial or discretionary through other legislative enactments or through regulations. Accordingly, the language in\n   <em>\n    Little\n   </em>\n   which provides that the Court must look only at the function can be misunderstood. The Court first must consider the broadest function involved in order to make a baseline determination of whether the overarching function is discretionary or ministerial. The Court then must examine any narrower duty associated with the activity at issue to determine whether a statute, regulation, or other binding directive renders that particular duty a ministerial one, notwithstanding that it may have been performed within the scope of a broader discretionary function.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   For example, in the context of\n   <em>\n    Pratt\n   </em>\n   , operators of an airport are, of course, required to conduct security screenings of passengers who are attempting to board airplanes. A municipality's decision to operate an airport may be discretionary; but once that discretion has been exercised to operate the airport, the municipality must comply with security regulations promulgated by the\n   Transportation Security Administration. In this way, it is useful to think of the operation of an airport as an overarching discretionary function that shelters several narrower functions or duties, many of which, such as the provision of security and compliance with federal security regulations, are ministerial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6914517\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/152/1106/#p1112\">\n    152 So.3d at 1113-1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b6 52.

So the public policy function test involved the same sort of \"tedious and scattered quest\" the majority accuses\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   of having created and it certainly \"made it little more than a gamble when lawyers advise[d] clients whether they [had] valid tort claims or defenses in MTCA cases\" causing attorneys and litigants to have to \"wait until their case shakes out in the appellate courts to know what the law is.\" Maj.

The majority pontificates that, \"[a]s a result of\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   , what the Legislature intended as a shield-discretionary-function immunity under Section 11-46-9(1)(d) -is flipped on its head and is being used as a sword.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 17. But surely, in a context such as this, if what Wilcher has alleged is true (and we must consider it as such at the Mississippi Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) stage), the failure of the city and county to abide not only by the regulations mandated under State law but also by the ordinances which they themselves adopted, does not permit the application of discretionary-function immunity. If what Wilcher alleges is more likely true than not, the city's and county's nonfeasance removes the blanket of immunity. Conversely, local and State authorities may decide-even if a broad statute creates a mandatory duty and to the extent the legislature declines to impose narrower ministerial duties-to render discretionary whichever narrower functions or duties those authorities deems appropriate. The\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   formula, in effect, makes it possible for the legislature and State and local authorities to control immunity, or the lack thereof, by making discretionary any narrower functions or duties which otherwise would have rendered them ministerial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b6 61. Because\n   <em>\n    Brantley v.

The majority decries\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   's forcing \"parties and judges to wade through an ever-deepening quagmire of regulations and ordinances to locate 'ministerial' or 'discretionary' duties, overcomplicating the process ....\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 2. Its predominant complaint about\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   is that it \"overcomplicates the process of litigating a claim and places the success of a claim on the ability of the injured party's attorney to sift through myriad and sometimes arcane regulations-creating extra layers of proof, which may have little or no practical effect on the actual negligent act.\" Maj. Op. \u00b6 15 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Crum v. City of Corinth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6829203\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/183/847/#p854\">\n    183 So.3d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854 (Miss. 2016) (Randolph, P.J., concurring in result only) ). But, upon this Court's return to the public policy function test, litigants and courts will continue to be required to \"scour the state manual\" and \"hunt for other regulations and ordinances\" in order to make arguments about whether the activity in question involved any policy considerations. Maj. Op. \u00b6 15. Yet courts and litigants will enjoy no longer the certainty of knowing that if the most narrow duty associated with an overarching function is discretionary, the government has immunity; and if the most narrow duty associated with an overarching function is ministerial, the government does not retain its immunity and the case can proceed. Moreover, seasoned practitioners and jurists understand and accept that this is what the lawyers who represent parties and the judges who sort through and decide complex legal issues, often involving myriad statutes, ordinances, and regulations, have done from time immemorial; we \"scour\" through an ever-deepening morass of material, solving people's problems and searching for answers, undaunted by the\n   volume or complexity of the issues. This is what we do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   \u00b6 63. The Mississippi Tort Claims Act itself can be a perplexing thing to understand, and has, since its inception, been so recognized by Bench and Bar. Particularly confusing, as demonstrated by legion pre-\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   pronouncements by this Court, have been the exceptions to outright governmental tort immunity found in cases in which negligence is alleged concerning the performance or lack of performance of ministerial, or mandatory, governmental duties. What\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   did, in full accord with the Mississippi statute, was to clarify and make that process relatively simple and easy. In some cases, the\n   <em>\n    Brantley\n   </em>\n   analysis has upheld governmental immunity. In others, immunity has been found inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b6 64. And that process is not exactly a \"recently created test,\" as the majority characterizes it. Maj. Op. \u00b6 1. It has been in use since 2014. Today, a majority of the Court chooses to abolish it, primarily because, notwithstanding its simplicity, it is accused falsely of being too complicated.
