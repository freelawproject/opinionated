Lee appeals his convictions, by jury verdict, of aggravated battery, indecent behavior with juveniles, and contributing to the delinquency of juveniles, and his sentences totaling nine years at hard labor, plus fines and default time in lieu thereof. For the reasons expressed, we amend to vacate the default time but otherwise affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The victim, KM, was 14 years old in May 2014 and lived with her mother and aunt in the Queensborough area of Shreveport. On May 5, she phoned her uncle, JM, in Monroe, to report that her boyfriend, \"Roshawn,\" had put his hands on her and hit her with a coat hanger. JM was surprised, not knowing that KM even had a boyfriend, and drove to Shreveport to confront Roshawn. By the time he arrived, however, he and KM decided it was better to call the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Corporal Clinton Grigsby was dispatched to Roshawn's house, in the Lakeside area. When he knocked on the door, the person who answered said he was not Roshawn (he claimed that Roshawn was his cousin), but Cpl. Grigsby positively identified him as KM's boyfriend, from pictures on her cellphone. Roshawn's real name was Roosevelt Lee, and he was 46 years old. Cpl. Grigsby placed him under arrest and\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   him; Lee denied knowing who KM was. Lee also told a sex crimes unit investigator, Det. Deandre Bell, that he did not know KM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next day, KM was examined by Olivia Jones, a sexual assault forensic examiner at University Health. She told Ms. Jones that while she was at his house, Lee accused her of texting with other men and told her, \"I'm gonna treat you like a ho'.\" He then pulled his pants down, tried several times to stick his penis in her mouth, grabbed her by the neck and choked her, struck her with a coat hanger and an extension cord, and stopped only when her cellphone rang. Ms. Jones confirmed that KM had scratches around her neck and on her left flank, and bruises on her right arm and right thigh, consistent with the conduct she described. Ms. Jones took a rape kit test of KM, including an oral swab, but no DNA was recovered. She was uncertain why she had not been called to examine KM until 24 hours after the initial report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   About two weeks later, Detective Michael Jones\n   <em>\n    Mirandized\n   </em>\n   Lee, again; this time, Lee admitted he had met KM walking on the street about two or three months earlier, and she started coming to his house to watch movies. He insisted they were \"just friends,\" with no sexual relationship, but admitted that while \"play fighting\" with coat hangers, she had hit him, and he hit her back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state charged Lee with indecent behavior with juveniles, R.S. 14:81 ; second degree battery, R.S. 14:34.1 ; and contributing to the delinquency of juveniles, R.S. 14:92 A(7). By amended bill of information, the state upgraded the second charge to aggravated battery, R.S. 14:34. Lee proceeded to jury trial over three days in October 2015. In addition to the facts outlined above, both KM and Lee testified extensively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   KM testified that she knew Lee as \"Roshawn,\" and met him in February 2014 as she was walking home from school and he offered her a ride. She told him she was 14; she thought he was around 50. She went to his house that day, and then almost daily; after a few attempts at \"dry humping,\" they started having sex regularly, and she considered him to be her boyfriend. However, they argued often, and he slapped her for refusing to have sex with him. On May 5, while she was in the bathroom, Lee searched her cellphone and saw she had a 16-year-old boyfriend. Lee got angry and called her a \"whore.\" He grabbed her, choked her, threw her on the bed, and hit her in the head, back and buttocks with an extension cord; he then grabbed a clothes hanger and hit her on the arm and head. Next, he pulled down his pants, positioned himself over her face, and tried to make her perform oral sex on him, but she kept her mouth closed. He\n   eventually stopped, and dropped her off near her house. He threatened her not to tell anyone what had just happened. KM added that the last time they had sex was the previous day, May 4. On cross-examination, she admitted all her bruises healed within three or four days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   KM identified a CD containing photos and audio recordings of herself and Lee, taken from her cellphone, as well as images printed from the CD.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She specifically identified a photo of her, taken May 5, 2014, showing a large welt on her buttocks, and one showing redness to her neck, where Lee had struck and choked her. In various audio clips, a male voice is heard to say, \"Don't be taking no picture of my thing,\" \"It's not hard,\" and \"Come on\"-according to KM, spoken by Lee when they were trying to have sex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Lee elected to testify and gave a strikingly different account of his relationship with KM. He denied ever using the name \"Roshawn\" (he said his 11-year-old son has that name), and said that KM never used\n   <em>\n    her\n   </em>\n   real name: she said she was \"NuNu.\" He met KM at the Save-A-Lot store on Jewella Avenue, where she and her mother were shopping, and he gave the mother a business card in case she needed a DJ for a party she was planning. KM came to his house four or five times, but only to borrow CDs or movies; there was no sexual intercourse and no inappropriate sexual contact between them. Lee admitted that he struck KM with a clothes hanger on May 5, but only because she would not stop hitting him. He testified that he is disabled, with diabetes and neuropathy, and had to defend himself. Finally, he never looked at KM's cellphone: it had a security code, and she never disclosed it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On rebuttal, KM's mother testified that she had never met Lee, either at Save-A-Lot or anywhere else.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After deliberating under one hour, the six-member jury unanimously found Lee guilty as charged on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The court later sentenced Lee to seven years at hard labor for indecent behavior with juveniles, to a consecutive two years for contributing to the delinquency of juveniles, and to a concurrent two years for aggravated battery, for a total of nine years at hard labor. The court also imposed three concurrent fines of $1,000, with 60 days in jail in lieu of payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Lee filed motions for post verdict judgment of acquittal and reconsideration of sentence, both of which were denied. This appeal followed. Counsel has filed a brief advancing two assignments of error; Lee has filed a pro se brief advancing three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   By his second counseled assignment of error, Lee urges the evidence was insufficient to support his convictions. He acknowledges that in the absence of internal contradiction or irreconcilable conflict with physical evidence, the testimony of one witness, if believed by the trier of fact, is sufficient to support a requisite factual conclusion,\n   <em>\n    State v. Ford\n   </em>\n   , 28,724 (La. App. 2 Cir. 10/30/96),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7436925\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/682/847/\">\n    682 So.2d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    writ denied\n   </em>\n   , 99-0210 (La. 5/14/99),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11495850,11495794,11495824\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/745/12/\">\n    745 So.2d 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He contends, however, that of the state's seven witnesses, only KM had firsthand knowledge or direct evidence of the crimes of conviction; there was no physical, DNA or other scientific evidence to support her claims; and KM's testimony was conflicting and contradictory. He also contends,\n   with respect to the aggravated battery charge, that KM's bruises went away very quickly, and hence the state failed to prove that the coat hanger and electrical cord were used in a manner \"calculated or likely to produce death or great bodily harm,\" La. R.S. 14:2 (3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The state responds that KM's testimony was internally consistent and reliable. Moreover, various witnesses and photos confirmed that she sustained bodily injuries in the encounter, and cellphone pictures and videos confirmed the intimate nature of her relationship with Lee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The standard of review for a sufficiency of the evidence claim is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Lack of knowledge of the child's age is not a defense. La. R.S. 14:81 A(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   KM testified that she was born in April 2000; Lee testified that he was born in April 1968. This obviously proves that in May 2014 KM was under the age of 17, and Lee was more than two years her senior. KM testified unequivocally that they had frequent sexual encounters between February and May 2014, describing how the relationship started and evolved; crucially, her testimony was substantially similar to her statements to police detectives, to Nurse Jones and to her uncle. This consistent testimony was sufficient to\n   prove that Lee committed a lewd or lascivious act on her person. In addition, the photos and audio clips from her phone corroborated that they were frequently together. The absence of DNA from her oral swab is not exculpatory, in light of her testimony that he never successfully ejaculated in her mouth on May 5. Finally, the jury could reasonably reject Lee's self-serving and improbable claim that he brought KM to his bedroom multiple times but never had sex with her. The evidence is sufficient to support this conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Contributing to the delinquency of juveniles is defined,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , as the intentional enticing, aiding, soliciting, or permitting, by anyone over the age of 17, of any child under the age of 17, to perform any sexually immoral act. La. R.S. 14:92 A(7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the risk of redundancy, we reiterate KM's candid testimony that she and Lee engaged in various sexual acts-vaginal intercourse, forced oral sex, \"dry humping.\" Her testimony was substantially similar to the statements she gave to police detectives and Nurse Jones; her cellphone pictures and recordings showed her intimacy with Lee; and reasonable jurors using their human experience could rationally reject Lee's alternative account.

It specifically noted that Lee was 46 years old, and KM just 14, when the offense occurred; she was especially vulnerable given the apparent lack of parental guidance in her life; and Lee \"preyed\" on her while she was walking home from school. Crucially, on these facts the state could have charged Lee with much more serious crimes, including sexual battery, carnal knowledge, or rape; this justified imposing the maximum sentences for indecent behavior with juveniles and contributing to the delinquency\n   of juveniles. We find the district court adequately considered the Art. 894.1 factors and the facts of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Indecent behavior with juveniles, when the victim is not under the age of 13, is punishable by not more than seven years, with or without hard labor, and a fine of up to $5,000. La. R.S. 14:81 H(1). Lee obviously received the maximum for this offense, but in light the great age difference and KM's testimony that the lewd and lascivious acts of sexual intercourse occurred frequently for over two months, the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding him a \"worst offender\" and sentencing him accordingly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Contributing to the delinquency of juveniles, when the conduct involved is performing any sexually immoral act, is punishable by not more than two years, with or without hard labor, and a fine of up to $1,000. La. R.S. 14:92 D. Again, Lee received the maximum, but given the prolonged incidence of his conduct, we cannot say the court abused its discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   We also find no abuse of discretion in directing these sentences to be consecutive: although it was one course of conduct, Lee engaged KM in many, many acts of indecent behavior and enticing her to perform sexually immoral acts over their three-month relationship. The court adequately justified this sentencing choice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Aggravated battery is punishable by not more than 10 years, with or without hard labor, and a fine of up to $5,000. La. R.S. 14:34 B. The sentence imposed was on the lower end of the range and probably reflects the court's appreciation that KM's injuries were minimal, consisting of bruises that fully healed within three or four days. We perceive no abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In addition to the hard time, the district court ordered Lee to pay concurrent fines of $1,000 and 60 days in jail in default.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   An indigent defendant cannot be subjected to default time in lieu of payment of a fine, costs or restitution.\n   <em>\n    Bearden v.
