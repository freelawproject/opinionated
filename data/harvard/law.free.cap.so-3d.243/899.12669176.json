Andrews was 17 years old at the time she committed the offenses. Subsequently, the United States Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Defense counsel argued that he was requesting public funds for experts and that he sought an ex parte determination because he did not \"think the State should be involved in the process of the defense having experts.\" The trial court denied the motion for an ex parte hearing without explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Andrews' counsel filed a petition for writ of certiorari in the First District, asserting that the hearing regarding experts should be ex parte because the discussion of experts might reveal the defense's trial strategy to the State. The First District denied the petition but also certified the above question.\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12363369\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/218/466/\">\n    218 So.3d at 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Andrews argues that \"comparable defendants represented by private counsel would not be required to divulge details to the prosecution regarding the hiring of experts, nor would similarly-situated defendants who are represented by the Office of the Public Defender or the Office of Criminal Conflict and Civil Regional Counsel.\" We agree with Andrews.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To be entitled to public funds for the appointment of an expert, the Eleventh Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Moore v.

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11876638\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/705/1337/#p1347\">\n    705 So.2d 1337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1347 (Fla. 1997), this Court explained that, when evaluating whether a trial court abuses its discretion in refusing public funds, \"courts have applied a two-part test: (1) whether the defendant made a particularized showing of need; and (2) whether the defendant was prejudiced by the court's denial of the motion requesting the expert assistance.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In making a showing of particularized need, a defendant may be required to expose privileged information or attorney work product, depending on the type of expert assistance requested. Requiring a defendant to reveal to the prosecutor the name of an expert witness whom the defendant may wish to consider calling, along with the reasons why this witness may be\n   of value to the defense, is \"contrary to the work-product doctrine because it would serve to highlight the thought processes and legal analysis of the attorneys involved.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7452969\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/678/1356/#p1358\">\n    678 So.2d 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1358 (Fla. 3d DCA 1996) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Even if the defendant is only required to disclose the expert's name and area of expertise, that is information that the State would otherwise not be entitled to know at that stage. In fact, the State's presence at the hearing puts the defendant in the difficult situation of having to choose between fully supporting the motion for the appointment of an expert and not revealing information to the State that it would not otherwise be privy to. And as Judge Wolf explained, \"[n]on-indigent and, more importantly, other indigent defendants represented by public defenders can obtain expert witnesses and investigative support without revealing their thought processes in front of the prosecuting authority.\"\n   <em>\n    Andrews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12363369\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/218/466/\">\n    218 So.3d at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wolf, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Additionally, depending on the reason for the expert requested, it is possible that a defendant may be forced to disclose self-incriminating information, in violation of the defendant's Fifth Amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Moody\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7419867\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/684/114/#p120\">\n    684 So.2d 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 120 (Ala. 1996) (\"Requiring an indigent defendant to prematurely disclose evidence in a hearing where the state is present encroaches on the privilege against self-incrimination, which applies at all stages of a criminal proceeding.\"). This privilege against self-incrimination is not limited to \"evidence which may lead to criminal conviction, but includes information which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence that could lead to prosecution, as well as evidence which an individual reasonably believes could be used against him in a criminal prosecution.\"\n   <em>\n    Maness v.
