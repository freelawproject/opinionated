Dysart\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is an appeal by Erroll G. Williams, the Assessor for the Parish of Orleans\n   (\"Assessor\") of a district court judgment reversing a ruling of the Louisiana Tax Commission (\"Tax Commission\") which found that plaintiff-appellee, the New Orleans Riverwalk Marketplace, LLC (\"Riverwalk\"), was not entitled to a refund of taxes it paid in 2012. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the district court's judgment and find that Riverwalk is not entitled to a refund of its 2012 ad valorem tax payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   According to the Riverwalk's Petition for Judicial Review and Appeal of Decision of the Louisiana Tax Commission (the \"Petition\") filed on March 17, 2016, the City of New Orleans (the \"City\") issued tax bill numbered 103100121 to Riverwalk for the 2012 tax year. The bill assessed Riverwalk's property interest as follows: $2,284,450 for the land and $158,670.00 for the improvements. Riverwalk paid the tax bill in January, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the Petition, after the bill was paid, \"Riverwalk and the Assessor determined that the land assessed in [the tax bill], and which was assessed and taxed to Riverwalk in the subject tax bill, was actually owned by the Port of New Orleans [\"the Port\"].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Riverwalk maintained that the land was exempt from taxation under the Louisiana Constitution. The Assessor corrected the error and made appropriate adjustments for the year 2013, and for each year thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 20, 2014, Riverwalk requested a refund from the Tax Commission. A hearing on Riverwalk's refund request was held by the Tax Commission on December 8, 2015. The Tax Commission issued its ruling on February 12, 2016, denying Riverwalk's \"request for refund of taxes paid in error.\" Its ruling was based on the \"evidence presented by all parties ... and based upon the entirety of the record,\" and the Tax Commission's finding that \"Riverwalk accepted the valuation and withdrew [its] appeal.\" More particularly, the Tax Commission found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The request [by the Riverwalk for a refund of the 2012 ad valorem taxes paid to the City] was made timely; however, the request was made subsequent to the withdrawal of an appeal to the Orleans Parish Board of Review.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The Riverwalk appealed to the Board and indicated a total requested assessed value of $1,884,050. T.J. Schoenemann of Thomas Reuters, Inc., a Property Tax Service, represented Riverwalk at the time of the appeal. Mr. Schoenemann formed his value using the income approach, a very reliable approach to value land and improvement as a total. Riverwalk later withdrew the appeal and accepted the assessor's value of $2,273,080.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Schoenemann's appeal withdrawal states, \"Please accept this correspondence as acceptance of the 2012 valuation or assessment number 103100121 and withdrawal of the pending protest ....\" Emphasis is given to \"acceptance of valuation\", not land valuation or improvement valuation, but the acceptance of the 2012 valuation of Assessment Number 103100121.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Riverwalk then filed the instant action in Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans on March 17, 2016, seeking a reversal of the Tax Commission's ruling and further seeking a refund of the taxes it maintains it erroneously paid. Named as defendants in this suit are the Tax Commission; the Assessor; Norman Foster, in his capacity as the City's ex-officio tax collector; and the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After briefing by the parties, a hearing was held on the Petition on May 5, 2017. The district court issued a final judgment on May 22, 2017, reversing the Tax Commission's denial of Riverwalk's request for refund, granting Riverwalk's request and ordering Mr. Foster, as the City's tax collector, to refund $369,648.22 to Riverwalk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A suspensive appeal was timely taken by the Assessor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Record on appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The record before us includes the following documents (the Administrative Record) and information submitted to the Commission and filed in the record in Civil District Court (listed in date order, where the date is known):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   - A November 12, 2012 form 3103.A, Appeal to the Tax Commission, appealing the Board of Review on the assessment of Riverwalk's property.

The letter noted that the \"taxpayer had consistently paid the taxes each year which included the land and building assessments because this allocation reduced the assessment of the building's valuation by 5%. After the property was sold in 2010 to the Howard Hughes Corporation, \"[t]he practice of allocating the majority of the building value to the land assessment was obvious because it was common knowledge that the land along the riverfront ... is owned by the Port[,] a tax exempt agency.\" This resulted in a loss of tax revenue to Orleans Parish \"because that portion of this commercial building value was only being assessed at 10% instead of the required 15%.\" The Assessor maintained that there had been no erroneous payment of taxes given the arrangement to allocate a \"major portion of the building value to land\" and because the payments by Riverwalk each year (on [its] $30,000,000 shopping center) were consensual. Attached as exhibits to this letter are:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   - A Letter of Authorization executed by Riverwalk on August 12, 2011, by which Thomson Reuters (Property Tax Services) was appointed as Riverwalk's authorized representative \"on all matters pertaining to ad valorem taxes;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   - An \"Orleans Parish Board of Review Assessment Appeal Form BOR 3\" filled out by T.J.

The form contained in the record is undated (a handwritten date is contained on the form, but the copy is cut off and the date is incomplete); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   - A facsimile sent on September 20, 2011 to the then-Assessor for Orleans Parish, by which Mr. Schoenemann advised that the 2012 valuation of the assessment contained in tax bill number 103100121 was accepted with \"withdrawal of the pending protest.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   - A July 20, 2015 letter from the Commission to Riverwalk advising that, after a meeting on June 23, 2015, the Commission denied the request for a refund.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   - The Commission's February 12, 2016 Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the hearing on Riverwalk's Petition, the district court found that \"there [was] a legal error in this case that the Tax Commission made by not considering the legality of the tax payment\" which it concluded was \"erroneous as a matter of law\" and warranted Riverwalk's request for a refund.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   This action was instituted pursuant to the provisions of La. R.S. 47:2132 which, under subpart A, authorizes \"[a]ny person who has a claim against a political subdivision for ad valorem taxes erroneously paid into the funds of that political subdivision\" to \"present the claim to the Louisiana Tax Commission within three years of the date of the payment, in such form and together with such proof as the tax commission may require by its rules and regulations ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Assessor contends that the Commission correctly denied Riverwalk's refund request for three reasons: (1) Riverwalk\n   knew that it was not the owner of the land for which it voluntarily paid ad valorem taxes (because, he asserts, Riverwalk obtained a \"favorable break on its overall ad valorem tax assessment\"); (2) In 2012, Riverwalk challenged the assessment, but then withdrew its challenge; thus, Riverwalk did not pay the taxes erroneously nor under protest and, under La. R.S. 47:2132, relief may be obtained only when a taxpayer makes an erroneous payment; (3) Riverwalk did not meet its burden of proof to establish the erroneous payment of the taxes. The Assessor framed the issues for review by this Court as whether the Tax Commission's decision to deny the refund request is \"[n]ot supported and sustainable by a preponderance of the evidence\" (pursuant to La. R.S. 49:964 G), and whether Riverwalk is estopped from claiming a refund on equitable grounds, as the Tax Commission found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Under the Louisiana Constitution, public property is exempt from taxation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   La. Const. Art. 7, \u00a7 21 (\"In addition to the homestead exemption provided for in Section 20 of this Article, the following property ... shall be exempt from ad valorem taxation: (A) Public lands and other public property used for public purposes ....). It is under this constitutional provision that Riverwalk asserted that its payment was erroneous under La. R.S. 47:2132.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   As Riverwalk acknowledges, the Louisiana Supreme Court has made clear that there are two challenges which may be made to property tax assessments. \"One track encompasses challenges to the 'correctness of assessments' by the assessor, while the other track covers challenges to the legality of the tax levied.\"\n   <em>\n    Gisclair v.

As such, it is a legality challenge and Riverwalk improperly sought review of this assessment with the Tax Commission. The Tax Commission does not have jurisdiction to consider legality challenges; as noted, \"[t]he correctness of assessments by the assessor shall be subject to review first by the parish governing authority, then by the Louisiana Tax Commission or its successor, and finally by the courts, all in\n   accordance with procedures established by law.\" La.

R.S. 47:2134, on the other hand, entitled \"Suits to recover taxes paid under protest,\" recognizes the two distinct categories of challenges to ad valorem taxes. Subpart B concerns challenges to \"the correctness of an assessment.\" Subpart C, however, concerns challenges to the legality of an assessment.

(1) A person resisting the payment of an amount of ad valorem tax due or the enforcement of a provision of the ad valorem tax law\n   <em>\n    and thereby intending to maintain a legality challenge shall timely pay the disputed amount due under protest\n   </em>\n   to the officer or officers designated by law for the collection of the tax and shall give such officer or officers, notice at the time of payment of his intention to file suit for the recovery of the protested tax. The portion of the taxes that is paid by the taxpayer to the collecting officer or officers that is neither in dispute nor the subject of a suit contesting the legality of the assessment shall not be made subject to the protest. The taxpayer shall submit separate payments for the disputed amount of tax due and the amount that is not in dispute and not subject to the protest. Upon receipt of a notice, the protested amount shall be segregated and held by the collecting officer for a period of thirty days.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    A legality challenge suit must be filed within thirty days from the date of the protested payment.\n   </em>\n   If a suit is timely filed contesting the legality of the tax or the enforcement of a provision of the tax law and seeking recovery of the tax, then that portion of the taxes paid that are in dispute shall be further deemed as paid under protest, and that amount shall be segregated and shall be further held pending the outcome of the suit. The portion of the taxes that is paid by the taxpayer to the collecting officer or officers that is neither in dispute nor the subject of a suit contesting the legality of the tax shall not be made subject to the protest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   La. R.S. 47:2134 (C) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   It is clear that Riverwalk initially challenged the valuation of the 2012 assessment and then withdrew that challenge, expressly accepting \"the 2012 valuation of the assessment contained in tax bill number 103100121.\" It then sought a refund of the taxes it paid, claiming to have paid those taxes in error. While the record does not contain a dated copy of its request for a refund, in its Petition, Riverwalk indicates that the claim for a refund was made on October 20, 2014. Riverwalk maintains that the request for a refund was \"timely.\" Indeed, a claim for taxes erroneously paid under La. R.S. 47:2132 (A) may be made \"to the Louisiana Tax Commission within three years of the date of the payment.\" There is no jurisprudence defining the term \"taxes erroneously paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, as we have found, this is not simply a case of an erroneous payment, but rather, a challenge as to the legality of the tax assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Under La. R.S. 47:2134 C, a challenge to the legality of an ad valorem tax must pay the tax under protest and then file suit within thirty days of the date of the payment. The record contains no evidence that Riverwalk paid the tax at issue herein\n   under protest. Moreover, it paid the tax in January, 2012 and its request for a refund was admittedly first made in October, 2014. Clearly, Riverwalk did not file its suit (after paying the tax under protest) within thirty days of its payment. Our decision is consistent with our limited jurisprudence on this issue. In\n   <em>\n    Side by Side Redevelopment, Inc. v. Marshall\n   </em>\n   , 09-1430, p. 3 (La.

R.S. 49:964 A(1), \"a person who is aggrieved by a final decision or order in an adjudication proceeding is entitled to judicial review ....\" Review is obtained by instituting proceedings \"by filing a petition in the district court of the parish in which the agency is located within thirty days after the transmittal of notice of the final decision by the agency[.]\" La. R.S. 49:964 B. Subpart G provides for judicial review of the administrative body's ruling and allows the court to \"affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings.\" It further allows the court to reverse or modify the decision or remand for further proceedings when certain conditions are found and the ruling reflects that \"substantial rights... have been prejudiced.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    As discussed more fully herein, this suit was improperly classified as a suit to recover taxes erroneously paid, and as such, the Administrative Procedures Act, and its review process, are inapplicable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    La. R.S. 47:2110 is now La. R.S. 47:2134. It was repealed and substantially reenacted by 2008 La. Acts, No. 819, \u00a7 1. It was amended in 2009 to add to subparts B and C separate provisions for a challenge to \"the correctness of an assessment\" and a \"legality challenge.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    We note that there are several Attorney General Opinions applying La.
