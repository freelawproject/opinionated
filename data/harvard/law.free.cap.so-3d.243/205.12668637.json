Shalonda Vale and Kawaskei Bender\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   were charged as codefendants with burglary of a dwelling. After Vale's jury trial in the Circuit Court of Jones County, she was sentenced to twenty-one years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections (MDOC), with seventeen years to serve, and the remaining four years suspended for postrelease supervision (PRS). Vale filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, a new trial, which was denied. Vale appeals, raising two issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Whether the indictment was fatally defective; and\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Whether the indictment was constructively amended by jury instruction S-1.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After review of the record, we find Vale's indictment neglected to allege an essential element of the crime of burglary of a dwelling under Mississippi law. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court and render a dismissal of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 2. After arriving home from work, Carolyn Mulloy observed dust by her apartment door. Inside her apartment, Mulloy noticed a white envelope of coins and other valuables were missing. Mulloy filed a police report with the Laurel Police Department, and an officer advised her to check the local pawn shops to see if any of the shops were in possession of her missing items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 3. An employee at \"The Gold Shop\" notified Mulloy that a bag of jewelry and several other items had been sold to the shop. Mulloy testified the shop had several items of jewelry she did not even realize were missing. These items included a wedding-ring set, earrings, and various gold rings. The shop employee also noted that a high-school class ring and a University of Massachusetts class ring had already been sent to be melted down. The Gold Shop provided Mulloy with the names of two individuals responsible for selling the jewelry. Mulloy recognized the names of Vale and Bender, because the individuals lived together above her in the same apartment complex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 4. Mulloy submitted both Vale and Bender's names to Brandon Evans, an investigator with the Laurel Police Department. Shortly thereafter, Vale was arrested at her home. After waiving her right to an attorney, Vale confessed on videotape to burglarizing Mulloy's apartment. Vale confessed that she broke the lock on Mulloy's apartment door with a fingernail file\n   and took the jewelry from Mulloy's night stand. Vale also confessed that she took coins in a white envelope from Mulloy's apartment. Vale told Detective Evans where all the items were located in Mulloy's home at the time she broke in, and that Bender was not with her during the time of the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 5. However, at trial, she vehemently denied burglarizing Mulloy's home. Vale testified she confessed to the burglary because Bender stated he could not \"take another charge.\" She testified Bender gave her the items of jewelry and said they belonged to his grandmother. Vale stated she took the jewelry to The Gold Shop, along with Bender's identification, and sold the items for cash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 6. Also at trial, Bender testified he broke into Mulloy's apartment alone, gave the stolen items to Vale, and asked her to find out whether the jewelry was real to possibly sell for cash. Bender stated he told Vale the jewelry belonged to his grandmother. Bender testified that Vale likely made up the story about her burglarizing Mulloy's apartment, because he would face life in jail for a conviction of burglary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 7. A jury found Vale guilty of burglary of a dwelling. She was sentenced to twenty-one years in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections, with seventeen years to serve, and with four years suspended, based upon the successful completion of four years of PRS. Vale filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) or, in the alternative, a new trial. The motion was denied.

Vale's indictment failed to include the element \"with intent to commit some crime therein.\" The words \"wherein valuable things were kept for use, and did carry away jewelry\" do not equate to the statutory element needed to indict Vale on the charge of burglary of a dwelling. \"It has been uniformly holden, that where the evil intent accompanying an act is necessary to constitute such act a crime, the intent must be alleged in the indictment, and proved; and the intent with which the act was done, must be proved to be the same with that charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844872\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/214/263/#p268\">\n    214 Miss. at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1844872\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/miss/214/263/#p268\">\n    58 So.2d at 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6792086\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/195/801/#p805\">\n    195 So.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805 (\u00b6 14) (Miss. Ct. App. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dixon v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9731736\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/240/289/#p290\">\n    240 So.2d 289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (Miss. 1970) ). As such, the indictment fully notified Vale of the crime she was charged with committing-burglary of a dwelling-as well as the specific underlying crime she intended to and did commit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 25. \"The ultimate test, when considering the validity of an indictment on appeal, is whether the defendant was prejudiced in the preparation of h[er] defense.\"\n   <em>\n    Warren v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6815346\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/187/616/#p621\">\n    187 So.3d 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621-22 (\u00b6 10) (Miss. 2016) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Medina v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7430513\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/688/727/#p730\">\n    688 So.2d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 730 (Miss. 1996) ). In the instant case, Vale was not in any way prejudiced in the preparation of her defense. Vale did not, at any point before or during her trial, object to the indictment. Vale did not raise the issue in her posttrial motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial. And Vale's defense did not center on an argument regarding intent. Rather, Vale's defense was that she did not break and enter the dwelling or steal the jewelry at all-that she was not present during the commission of the crime, despite having previously confessed to the crime. Moreover, Vale cannot state on appeal that her defense was prejudiced in that she did not know she was charged with the element of intent. The record clearly shows that the jury instructions proposed by Vale's defense required the jury to find that Vale had broken and entered the dwelling of another \"with intent to commit to steal valuable things once inside.\" As such, it is clear Vale had full knowledge that the crime with which she was charged contained the element of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 26. \"The Mississippi Supreme Court has stated, 'so long as a fair reading of the indictment, taken as a whole, clearly describes the nature and cause of the charge against the accused, the indictment is legally\n   sufficient.' \"\n   <em>\n    Martin v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7033445\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/65/882/#p884\">\n    65 So.3d 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884 (\u00b6 7) (Miss. Ct. App. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sanderson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9155630\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/883/558/#p561\">\n    883 So.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561 (\u00b6 9) (Miss. 2004) ). With regard to intent, Vale's indictment expressly charged that she did carry away jewelry-evidencing her intent-in violation of section 97-17-23, which expressly states the element of intent. Here, I find that Vale's indictment, read as a whole, clearly charges her with all the essential elements of the crime of burglary and that Vale was not prejudiced in her defense. Thus, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b6 27. The majority also finds that Vale's indictment was constructively amended due to the variance in the indictment and jury instruction S-1. Though the majority acknowledges that the issue is procedurally barred by Vale's failure to object, the majority goes on to find the indictment was constructively altered by the jury instructions. I disagree. Not only is the issue barred from our appellate review, I do not find-as the majority apparently does-that the change materially alters the facts which are the essence of the offense. As such, with respect to this issue, I also dissent and would affirm Vale's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   GRIFFIS, P.J., CARLTON AND GREENLEE, JJ., JOIN THIS OPINION.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
