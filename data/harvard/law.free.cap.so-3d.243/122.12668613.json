Appellant, Helen Scott Ehle Barrois (\"Helen\"), is the executrix of the succession of Antoinette Bernice Cognevich Barrois (\"Bernice\"). Appellees, Russell E. Barrois, Jr. and Kenneth B. Barrois, Jr. (the \"Mancil Executors\"), are the co-executors of the succession of Bernice's husband, Mancil Joseph Barrois (\"Mancil\"). Helen appeals the trial court's judgments: (1) granting the Mancil Executors' Motion for Summary Judgment; (2) denying her Motion for New Trial; and (3) denying her Exception of Prescription. For the reasons that follow, we amend the judgment granting summary judgment in favor of the Mancil Executors and, as amended, affirm. We also affirm the judgment denying Helen's Motion for New Trial, and the judgment denying Helen's Exception of Prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    The Barrois Successions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 1930, Mancil and Bernice were married, and thereafter resided in Plaquemines Parish. In the 1960s and 1970s, during their marriage, Bernice applied for and acquired eight oyster leases from the State of Louisiana. In 1975, Mancil died testate, and in 1978, Mancil's succession (the \"Succession of Mancil\") was judicially opened in the 25\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District Court for the Parish of Plaquemines. In 1981, Bernice died intestate, and in 1983, Bernice's succession (the \"Succession of Bernice\") was judicially opened in Plaquemines Parish. The two successions were consolidated in 1984. To date, both successions remain\n   open. In forty years, no judgments of possession have been rendered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Before Mancil's marriage to Bernice, he had been married twice, first to Melanie Bruney (\"Melanie\"), from whom he was divorced, and second to Flora Messimore (\"Flora\"), who predeceased him in 1929. There were four children born of Mancil's first two marriages. The Mancil Executors are the direct descendants of Mancil and his second wife, Flora. During Mancil's third marriage to Bernice, two children were born, Austin Francis Barrois (\"Austin\") and Bernita Joan Barrois (\"Bernita\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 1989, Austin was named sole administrator of Bernice's estate. In 1990, Bernita renounced her mother's succession, and all of Bernita's interest was adjudicated to her brother, Austin. Austin died testate in 2011, and bequeathed his entire estate to his wife, Helen. In 2012, Helen opened Austin's succession (the \"Succession of Austin\") in Plaquemines Parish, and was named independent testamentary executrix. In December 2014, Helen was named the independent executrix of the Succession of Bernice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    BP Oil Spill Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2013, Helen retained attorneys to file a $384,000.00 claim with the Deepwater Horizon Claims Center (\"BP Claims Center\") for damage to the Barrois oyster leases caused by the BP oil spill in 2010. As of the date of the summary judgment at issue in this case, the BP Settlement Trust (\"BP Trust\") had paid Helen an initial disbursement of $384,000.00, and a second payment of $155,725.33, for a total of $539,725.33. Helen deposited these funds in her personal checking account. With these funds, Helen paid her attorneys $137,874.46 (20 percent), purchased a $200,000.00 annuity, and then depleted the remaining funds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Helen did not pay any of these BP settlement funds to the Mancil Executors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Lawsuit by Mancil Executors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 1, 2014, the Mancil Executors filed a \"Petition for Delivery of Funds and Property, for Accounting, for Declaratory Judgment, for Sequestration, for Damages and for Other Relief\" (the \"Petition\") against Helen individually, and as the independent testamentary executrix of the Succession of Austin. In the Petition, the Mancil Executors asserted that, because the oyster leases were the community property of the Mancil and Bernice successions, Helen had: (1) wrongfully asserted full ownership of the oyster leases; (2) wrongfully converted monetary compensation owed to the Succession of Mancil; (3) wrongfully failed to turn over such compensation to the Succession of Mancil; and (4) wrongfully failed to account to the Succession of Mancil for proceeds derived from the oyster leases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Motions for Partial Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In January 2015, Helen, individually, and as the independent executrix of the Succession of Bernice, filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment seeking a declaration that the oyster leases were the separate property of Bernice and, upon her death, were the separate property of\n   the Succession of Bernice. In March 2015, the Mancil Executors filed a Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment seeking a declaration that the oyster leases were community property, and that the money derived from the oyster leases, including the BP settlement funds, were community property. The Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment further stated, \"[i]f the Court grants partial summary judgment as requested, the Mancil Succession further moves the Court to order [Helen] to deliver one-half of all payments and distributions from [the BP settlement fund] to the co-executors of the Mancil Succession.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 10, 2015, the trial court granted the Mancil Executors' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment, and denied Helen's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. In the judgment, the trial court decreed that the oyster leases acquired by Bernice during her marriage to Mancil were community property. The trial court, however, did not order Helen to pay the Mancil Executors one half of the BP payments. On April 21, 2015, the Mancil Executors filed a Motion to Amend and Supplement the Judgment, asking the trial court to order Helen to pay one half of the BP settlement funds to the Succession of Mancil. The trial court denied the motion pursuant to La. C.C.P. art. 1951, which authorizes amendment of judgments only to \"alter the phraseology of the judgment, but not its substance, or to correct errors of calculation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In May 2015, Helen appealed the April 10, 2015 judgment. The Mancil Executors filed an Answer to Appeal in which they asked the court to modify the trial court's judgment to instruct Helen to pay one half of the BP settlement funds to the Succession of Mancil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Fourth Circuit: Oyster Leases Are Community Property\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On January 6, 2016, this court affirmed the trial court's April 10, 2015 judgment declaring that the oyster leases were community property.\n   <em>\n    In re Succession of Barrois\n   </em>\n   , 15-0692, 15-0693 (La.

Specifically, the judgment in favor of the Mancil Executors and against Helen provides the following relief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) Ordering that Helen immediately provide a full and complete accounting for all money or other things of value that Helen has received relating in any manner to the oyster leases at issue in the lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) A money judgment in favor of the Mancil Executors and against Helen in the amount of 50% of all monies or other things of value received by Helen with regard to the ownership, use or damage to the oyster leases that are the subject of this lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (3) Judgment ordering that Helen immediately pay over to the Mancil Executors 50% of all monies or other things of value received by Helen with regard to the oyster leases that are the subject of this lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (4) A money judgment in favor of the Mancil Executors and against Helen in the amount of 50% of all money or other things of value received by Helen or which Helen receives in the future with regard to the ownership, use or damage to the oyster leases that are the subject of this lawsuit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (5) Judgment declaring that the Mancil Executors are the owners of and are entitled to receive from the Deepwater Horizon Settlement Program the next $539,725.33 to be paid from the Settlement Program on the claims previously asserted in the name of Austin F.

Barrois) with regard to the oyster leases whether as a result of a Seafood Program claim or as a result of a claim under the HESI Punitive Damages and Assigned Claims Settlement and the Transocean Punitive Damages and Assigned Claims Settlement Agreement. Further the judgment is to declare that after payment to the Mancil Executors of that $539,725.33, the Mancil Executors are then entitled to payment from any further settlement 50% of all further payments with regard to the Austin/Helen claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (6) Costs as to their motion are assessed against Helen Barrois.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    Helen's Motion for New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Thereafter, Helen filed a Motion for New Trial, arguing that the December 29, 2016 judgment should be vacated because the Mancil Executors failed to post a security\n   bond, as required for a writ of sequestration. Helen also argued that because she did not receive all of the $539,725.33 from the BP settlement fund, the Mancil Executors were not entitled to half of this sum as their share of the community property. On January 19, 2017, the trial court denied Helen's Motion for New Trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    Helen's Exception of Prescription\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On October 19, 2016, Helen filed a Peremptory Exception of Prescription, arguing that the right of recovery of Mancil's heirs from his first two marriages was barred by the 30-year liberative prescriptive period in La. C.C. art. 3502. According to Helen, because these heirs \"had not filed a pleading, document or record of any kind in Mancil's Succession,\" their claims are prescribed, so that she is the sole successor (as the universal legatee of Austin) to all property of both the Mancil and Bernice estates. On February 14, 2017, the trial court denied Helen's Exception of Prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 17, 2017, Helen filed a Motion for Devolutive Appeal of the December 29, 2016 judgment granting the Mancil Executors' Motion for Summary Judgment, the January 19, 2017 judgment denying Helen's Motion for New Trial,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the February 14, 2017 judgment denying Helen's Exception of Prescription.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In this appeal, Helen lists four assignments of error:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) The trial court erred by improperly granting summary judgment despite the presence of disputed issues of material fact and the complete absence of legal authority for its actions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) The trial court erred by improperly issuing a sequestration order with no bond.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (3) The trial court's judgment improperly ordered payment of 50% of all BP settlement funds released to date as well as $539,725.33 in future funds, which constitutes a double or triple open-ended award of the maximum amount possibly at issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (4) The trial court erred in denying Helen's Peremptory Exception of Prescription, which would have terminated this litigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    Assignment of Error Nos. 1 and 3: Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We address these two assignments of error together, as they both relate to the trial court's summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Appellate courts review the granting of a motion for summary judgment under the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Filmore Parc Apartments II v.

First, she argues that there is a disputed issue of material fact as to how\n   much money she received from the BP settlement fund. Helen asserts that she received only $401,850.87, which were the \"net\" proceeds after payment of her legal fees. We disagree. The record reflects that, up through the date of the summary judgment at issue here, BP paid Helen in two disbursements of $384,000.00 and $155,725.33 as compensation for her claim for damage to the oyster leases. Helen, who hired several attorneys to represent her in the claims process, then allowed her attorneys to deduct $137,874.46 from the settlement to pay her attorney's fees. It is not disputed that the entire $539,725.33 was paid to Helen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Helen also argues that, as a matter of law, upon Austin's death, she became the owner of at least a 7/9th share of the oyster leases and BP payments, and that the Mancil heirs (other than Austin) own at most 2/9th of the oyster leases and BP payments. According to Helen, the trial court erred in not awarding her 7/9th of the $401,850.87 \"net\" proceeds (after payment of her legal fees), or approximately $309,425.00. She also contends that the trial court should have awarded the Mancil Executors only 2/9th of this amount, or approximately $92,425.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Helen is confusing two separate issues in this case. The issue before this court on summary judgment is how the BP settlement proceeds are to be split between the two successions. The issue of what fractional share of the BP proceeds will go to each Barrois heir/legatee after administration of the two successions is\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   before the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Helen, nevertheless, spends much of her brief explaining how to calculate her share of the BP settlement funds that will be disbursed personally to her through a judgment of possession in the Mancil and Bernice successions. She also devotes a significant part of her brief addressing whether the heirs' fractional shares are to be taken from the \"net\" or the \"gross\" settlement proceeds (before and after payment of attorney's fees). We find that Helen's argument is premature, and thus is immaterial for purposes of our review of the trial court's summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Despite the mathematical complexities presented by Helen, the resolution of this issue is relatively straightforward. In 2016, this court established that, as a matter of law, the Succession of Mancil owns 50% of the community-property oyster leases, and the Succession of Bernice owns the other 50%. In granting summary judgment, the trial court found that the Succession of Mancil is entitled to 50% of the total compensation paid by BP for damage to the oyster leases, and the Succession of Bernice is entitled to the other 50%. The trial court, therefore, split the past and future BP proceeds 50/50 between the two successions. We find no error in that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Double/Triple Recovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Helen contends that the trial court improperly awarded the Mancil Executors \"double or triple\" the amount due by requiring Helen to pay them 50% of all amounts already paid to her, and then giving the Mancil Executors \"the next $539,725.33.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The trial court correctly rendered a \"money judgment\" in favor of the Mancil Executors and against Helen in the amount of 50% of all money or other\n   things of value already received by Helen, or which Helen may receive in the future, with respect to the oyster leases, which includes the BP settlement proceeds. The relief awarded in Section 3 and Section 5 of the judgment, however, creates inconsistencies within the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Section 3 orders \"that Helen\n   <strong>\n    immediately pay over\n   </strong>\n   to the Mancil Executors 50% of all monies or other things of value received by Helen with regard to the oyster leases.\" Section 5 declares that the Mancil Executors are entitled to receive the \"\n   <strong>\n    next $539,725.33 to be paid\n   </strong>\n   from the BP Settlement Fund.\" We understand that, because additional BP settlement payments were anticipated, the trial court's intent was to \"equalize\" the amounts due to the two successions by ordering that the Mancil Executors be paid the next $539,725.33 from the BP settlement payments (the same amount already received by Helen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The result, however, is that Helen must \"immediately pay over\" to the Mancil Executors the sum of $269,862.66, and thereafter, the Mancil Executors shall receive the \"next\" $539,725.33 paid by BP. The Mancil Executors, therefore, will receive $809,587.99, while Helen will receive only $269,862.66. Thereafter, the two successions will split the BP payments on a 50/50 basis. The trial court's judgment plainly does not \"equalize\" the payments to each succession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Pursuant to the authority granted under La. C.C.P. art. 2164 to \"render any judgment which is just, legal, and proper upon the record on appeal,\" we accordingly amend the December 29, 2016 judgment to strike out Section 3. We also strike Section 2, which is repeated in Section 4. Accordingly, we amend the trial court's judgment as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that the Motion for Summary Judgment by the Mancil Executors and against Helen is hereby GRANTED.

Helen also argues that, because this Court in 2014 reversed the trial court's sequestration order against Helen on the grounds that the Mancil Executors did not post a bond, this Court should likewise vacate the trial court's December 29, 2016 judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On April 1, 2014, the Mancil Executors filed a \"Rule for Sequestration\" without bond,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which they sought an order directing the Sheriff to seize all funds received by Helen from the BP settlement, and placing the sum of $384,000.00 in the registry of the court. On July 24, 2014, the trial court signed a judgment ordering Helen to deposit $40,000.00 in cash into the registry of the court within five business days. The trial court also decreed that Helen could not sell, transfer, encumber, or otherwise alienate the $200,000.00 annuity contract that she purchased in July 2013. Helen filed an application for supervisory\n   writs. On August 21, 2014, this Court granted Helen's writ application, and vacated the July 24, 2014 judgment based on the trial court's failure to set an appropriate bond under La. C.C.P. arts. 3574 (sequestration) and 3610 (injunction).\n   <em>\n    Succession of Barrois\n   </em>\n   , 14-0846 (La.

On August 13, 2015, the trial court denied the Motion to Sequester for failure to comply with La. C.C.P. art. 3501, which requires that the applicant furnish security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Sequestration is a provisional remedy available for the seizure of property as to which the seizing party claims a property, possessory, or security interest, to prevent the disposal or concealment of the property by another party.

A writ of sequestration, therefore, was the appropriate procedural mechanism to prevent Helen from dissipating the settlement funds pending the outcome of the Mancil Executors' claim for these proceeds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   On December 29, 2016, however, the trial court rendered a money judgment in favor of the Mancil Executors and against Helen in the amount of 50% of all money already received by Helen, or received in the future, with regard to the ownership, use, or damage to the oyster leases. This judgment was not a provisional remedy to preserve the status quo pending a judgment on the merits.

App. 2d Cir.1990), in which the court held that the liberative prescription period of 30 years applicable to an action for recognition of the right of inheritance and recovery of whole or part of a succession does not accrue when the parties hold the succession property as co-heirs or co-owners in indivision. This Court agreed with\n   <em>\n    Fleniken\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    In re Succession of Moore\n   </em>\n   , 97-1668, 97-1669, p. 19 (La.

C.C. art. 934. \"Immediately at the death of the decedent, universal successors acquire ownership of the estate....\" La. C.C. art. 935. \"Universal successors\" is a term of art defined in La. C.C. art. 3506(8) to include heirs by intestacy and general and universal legatees. \"Ownership of the same thing by two or more persons is ownership in indivision,\" or co-ownership. La. C.C. art. 797. Thus, we find that all of the Mancil heirs (which include Helen) are co-owners in indivision of the succession property of Mancil. The 30-year prescriptive period in La. C.C. art. 3502, therefore, does not accrue. Accordingly, the trial court's decision to deny Helen's Exception of Prescription is legally correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   For the reasons stated above, we amend the trial court's December 29, 2016 judgment granting the Mancil Executors' Motion for Summary Judgment and, as amended, we affirm.

On March 10, 2017, the trial court ordered that the remaining $119,520.23 be deposited in the registry of the court. On March 22, 2017, the Mancil Executors filed a Motion to Withdraw the $119,520.23 from the registry of court, which the trial court granted on March 28, 2017.
