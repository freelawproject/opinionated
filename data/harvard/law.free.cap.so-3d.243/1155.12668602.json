For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the judgment of the juvenile court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   K.K., who was 11 years old, was removed from her mother K.A.'s custody on August 8, 2014, based on allegations that K.K. was a child in need of care pursuant to La. Ch. C. art. 606(A) due to neglect, lack of supervision and inadequate shelter. Because of instances of domestic violence between the mother and her ex-husband, he had secured a restraining order against her. After a recent altercation, the mother was arrested and detained overnight for violation of the restraining order. Because the mother and her daughter had been kicked out of the home they had previously shared with the mother's ex-husband, the child was forced to find a place to stay with neighbors while her mother was in custody. Also included in the child in need of care allegations were concerns about the effects that the mother's neglect of her mental health issues had on the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The child was placed in the custody of the Louisiana Department of Children and Family Services (\"DCFS\"). A continued custody hearing was held on August 12, 2014. The juvenile court vacated the custody of the DCFS and granted custody of K.K. to her adult brother, Chad Cherry, a resident of Colorado, pursuant to La. Ch. C. art. 627(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 24, 2014, after an evidentiary hearing, the mother stipulated that the child was a child in need of care. The juvenile court accepted the stipulation and adjudicated the child as a child in need of care under Title VI of the Louisiana Children's Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A disposition hearing was held on November 21, 2014. The juvenile court found that the child continued to be in need of care and entered a judgment of disposition which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , maintained custody of the child with her brother and listed reunification as the case plan goal. The court minutes also show that the judge entered an order allowing the mother to communicate with the child via text messaging and by telephoning the mother once every other week.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a motion for modification of visitation filed by counsel for the child on March 12, 2015, it was alleged that the phone calls and texts from the mother were adversarial in nature and stressful to the child. Attached to the motion was a copy of a letter in support from the child's counselor in Colorado. After a contradictory hearing held on March 31, 2015, the visitation order was revised to allow contact between the child and the mother only if or when initiated by the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A permanency hearing was held on August 6, 2015. The DCFS report to the court indicated that the mother had secured housing and employment. The mother advised the court that she had begun counseling with a new therapist, Shari Moncla, and her counsel requested additional time during which her client could demonstrate compliance with her case plan. The juvenile court agreed to give the mother additional time before closing the case and declined to approve reunification as a case plan goal at that time. Thus, the \"Permanency/Case Review Judgment\" rendered on August 19, 2015, did not contain a ruling setting forth the court's findings regarding the permanent plan that it considered to be in the best interest of the child. The court set the matter for a case review hearing on October 29, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Evidence was adduced at the review hearing on October 29, 2015. The mother's attorney filed a motion for a continuance\n   and an objection to the latest case plan filed by the DCFS; this plan had as its goal guardianship with the child's older brother rather than reunification with the mother. The motion for continuance was granted, and the matter was reset for a review hearing on December 11, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At the review hearing, counsel for the mother filed a motion to modify disposition pursuant to La. Ch. C. art. 714. In her motion, the mother reiterated her objection to the latest case plan proposed by DCFS, and asserted that her counselor was available to testify as to her significant progress in treatment. Attorneys for the other parties sought a continuance as they were served with the motion and supporting memorandum in court. The matter was reset, and the parties were informed that a contested hearing would be held on January 28, 2016. Prior to this hearing, counsel for the child filed a motion for guardianship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The hearing on the parties' competing motions, both of which addressed the issue of the appropriate permanency plan for the child that had been left unresolved by the court at the August 6, 2016, hearing, took place over the course of several days, with live testimony from witnesses, before concluding on March 30, 2016. After receiving memoranda from the parties, the juvenile court rendered its judgment on October 31, 2016, denying the mother's motion to modify disposition and granting the child's motion to have her brother Chad appointed as her guardian. The judgment also relieved the DCFS from further involvement in the case. The mother filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In her first assignment of error, the mother asserts that the juvenile court erred in granting custody of the child to her half-brother Chad at the continued custody hearing held on August 12, 2014. This assignment of error is without merit. As set forth in La. Ch. C. art. 330 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (A) An appeal may be taken from any final judgment of a court and shall be to the appropriate court of appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (B) In ... child in need of care proceedings pursuant to Title VI ... an appeal may be taken\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only after a judgment of disposition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . The appeal shall include all errors assigned concerning the adjudication and disposition. (Emphasis added).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In her second assignment of error, the mother argues that the juvenile court erred in denying her motion to modify disposition, which granted custody of the child to her half-brother, Chad. The mother urges this Court to reverse the juvenile court's judgment granting guardianship to Chad and order the immediate return of the child so mother and daughter can reconnect and rebuild their lives together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The purpose of Title VI of the Children's Code, entitled \"Child in Need of Care,\" is \"to protect children whose physical or mental health and welfare are substantially at risk of harm by physical abuse, neglect, or exploitation and who may be further threatened by the conduct of others[.]\" La.

La. Ch. C. art. 720(A). The purpose of guardianship is to provide a permanent placement for children when neither reunification with a parent nor adoption has been found to be in their best interest; to\n   encourage stability and permanence in the lives of children who have been adjudicated to be in need of care and have been removed from the custody of their parent; and to increase the opportunities for the prompt permanent placement of children, especially with relatives, without ongoing supervision by the department.

Specifically, the court wrote:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court has made findings that the mother, did not carry her burden of proof to modify the disposition placing the child in the legal custody of the child's adult brother and his wife in Colorado. The Court found that this custodial placement has been extremely beneficial for the child, stabilizing her life and providing much needed structure in which the child is thriving.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court also found that, while the mother has sustained employment and a stable place to live, she has consistently refused to acknowledge her past behavioral instability, her continued exposure of the child to her own domestic violence with her latest partner, and ignores her serious need for intensive mental health treatment. Allegations of physical abuse against the child committed by the mother surfaced after the initial removal, allegations which the mother reluctantly admitted but failed to obtain counseling to resolve.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   While the mother argued that the Court should not have placed the child out of state with the adult brother, the Court was required by Children's Code Article 627(B) to place the child with a relative who could provide a good home for the child as an alternative to being with strangers in foster care. The Court made this determination at the Continued Custody Hearing, at the Disposition, and at the Permanency Hearing. The mother did not appeal these Judgments and stipulated in court and in argument to the appropriateness of the removal of the child from the mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [T]he Court, looking forward at Disposition, could not conclude that the mother would be unable to rehabilitate herself regarding her mental health treatment and family issues. Accordingly, while not required by law, the Court exercised its discretion to allow the mother this opportunity and attempted to afford her a reasonable opportunity by ordering the Department of Children and Family Services to assist with a case plan of services and supervision and reporting to the Court. The Court ultimately found, however that the mother did not cooperate with the mental health treatment deemed necessary. ... She also did not deal with the physical abuse issues, and did not act reasonably in exercising the Court authorized contact with her child. Rather, she regressed to blaming [K.K.'s] adult brother and sister, whose only fault was to come to the rescue of their 11-year-old baby sister.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Accordingly, it was contrary to the best interest of the child to return the child to her mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   The child's interest in the stability and structure offered by her adult brother is clearly paramount to the desire of the mother to disrupt this placement without having worked to alleviate her mental health needs and her physical abuse issues. While the Court remains hopeful that as the child matures, she will be better able to cope with her mother and develop a healthy relationship, considering the mother's lack of cooperation and the dysfunctional relationship with her adult children, the Court is no longer optimistic this will occur. Nevertheless, the Court's Judgment sets up parameters within which this can occur with the child's emotional safety being protected by her brother as guardian and the Court's Social Worker to assure fairness to the mother.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   After a thorough review of the record and due consideration of the arguments of the parties on appeal, this Court does not find that the juvenile court was manifestly erroneous in denying the mother's motion to modify disposition and in concluding that guardianship was the permanent plan that is the most appropriate and is in the child's best interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the judgment of the juvenile court awarding guardianship of the child, K.K., to Chad Cherry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    La.
