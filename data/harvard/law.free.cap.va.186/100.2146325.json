Upon arraignment he pleaded not guilty and at the trial admitted the shooting, but claimed that it was in self-defense. A jury found the accused guilty of murder in the second degree, fixed his punishment at confinement in the State penitentiary for fifteen years, and the trial court entered judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The sole contention made before us is that the trial court committed prejudicial error in excluding from the jury evidence that shortly before the shooting Carr uttered threats against the accused and expressed the intention of killing him. This evidence was excluded on the ground that the threats had never been communicated to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The principals in this tragedy are members of the colored race. About six months before the shooting, Virginia Peterson, with whom Carr had been keeping company for some time, transferred her affections to Riddick. Angered by this, Carr cursed and abused the girl, and on one occasion shot at her with a pistol. On her complaint Carr was placed under a peace bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The accused knew of these occurrences. Because of them, and because of the fact that he had heard that Carr carried a pistol and had made threats against his (the accused\u2019s) life, the accused armed himself with a pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">On the night of April 15, 1946, the accused met Virginia Peterson at the end of her day\u2019s work at the Navy Y. M. C. A., in the city of Norfolk. As the girl came out of the building to keep her appointment with Riddick, Carr came across the street and said to her: \u201cYou are going with me tonight.\u201d With this Carr caught hold of her, tore her clothes, and broke her glasses. He then pulled or shoved the girl along the street in a disorderly manner for a distance of several blocks. All the while Riddick, who accompanied them, remonstrated with Carr, telling him that unless he desisted from such disorderly conduct the police would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>probably be attracted thereby and would take the three of them into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">When they had reached a point on Brewer street, some seven blocks from the place where the fracas had been started, the girl, by slipping out of her coat, escaped from Carr\u2019s grasp and ran from the scene. As she did so she saw Riddick fire a single shot at Carr.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Riddick testified that just prior to the shooting Carr advanced upon him with a knife, and that he (Riddick), apprehending that his own life was in danger, shot Carr when the latter was about six feet away.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">According to Riddick\u2019s further testimony, Carr, who was a powerful man, weighing more than two hundred pounds, although mortally stricken, caught Riddick, a man of slight build, disarmed him, and threw him over his shoulder into the street. Carr, badly wounded, stumbled a short distance away, while Riddick escaped in the opposite direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">Shortly thereafter the police arrived upon the scene and found Carr in a dying condition. In his hand he held Rid-dick\u2019s pistol. At the scene of the accident were found the knife with which Riddick said he had been attacked by Carr, and the girl\u2019s torn pocketbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-9\">The girl testified that just prior to the shooting she did not see Carr advancing upon the accused, nor did she see any knife in Carr\u2019s hand. On cross-examination she admitted, however, that she was badly frightened by the whole affair and was mainly bent upon making her escape from the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">Bud Riddick, a cousin of the accused, testified that several days prior to the shooting Carr came to his (Bud Riddick\u2019s) house, uttered threats against the accused, saying that he was going to \u201ckill the son-of-a-bitch.\u201d Bud Riddick told the accused of this incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">The defense then offered to prove by John Johnson, who lived at the same address where the accused resided, that about two hours before the shooting Carr came to the accused\u2019s residence and inquired as to the latter\u2019s whereabouts. Upon being told where the accused was, Carr became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>violent, banged on the door, saying that he was going to find the accused and \u201ckill the son-of-a-bitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">As has been said, this latter evidence was excluded upon the ground that these particular threats had never been communicated to the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Counsel for the accused contend before us, as they did in the lower court, that the evidence was admissible, not to justify the homicide, but in order to show the evil disposition of the deceased toward the accused and that the deceased was the aggressor, and also to corroborate Bud Riddick\u2019s testimony of other threats which Carr had made against the accused and about which the accused had been told.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">We are of opinion that the lower court erred in excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">Wigmore on Evidence, 3d Ed., Vol. 1, sec. 110, p. 546, says this on the subject: \u201cWhere on a charge of homicide the excuse is self-defence, and the controversy is whether the deceased was the aggressor, the deceased\u2019s threats against the accused are relevant. The deceased\u2019s design to do violence upon the defendant is of some value to show that on the occasion in question he did carry out, or attempt to carry out, his design. Moreover, it is the fact of his design, irrespective of its communication to the defendant, that is evidential.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-9\">Continuing, in section 111, page 547, the author says: \u201cThis evidence is now conceded to be admissible, by virtually all Courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-10\">The text is supported by numerous cases from various jurisdictions throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">In 26 Am. Jur., Homicide, sec. 364, pp. 408, 409, the same view is taken. As this authority says, where self-defense is in issue, evidence of uncommunicated threats is admissible as showing \u201cthe disposition of the deceased toward the accused,\u201d and the fact that the deceased \u201cwas the aggressor\u201d in the controversy. \u201cAlso, such threats are held to be admissible when corroborative of communicated threats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>See also, 1 Greenleaf on Evidence, 16th Ed., sec. 14 K, p. 55; 40 C. J. S., Homicide, sec. 276 (d), p. 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Among the recent cases approving the principles thus laid down are <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>318 Mass. 587, 63 N. E. (2d) 344, 345-6; <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>294 Mich. 20, 292 N. W. 539, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">While the precise question has not been previously presented to our court,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> it has been before the highest court of West Virginia in a number of cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>88 W. Va. 152, 106 S. E. 445, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">In the latter case the syllabus by the court reads thus: \u201cWhere on a charge of homicide the excuse is self-defense, and the testimony is conflicting as to the aggressor, there being some to show that it was the deceased, his threats against the accused, though not communicated to the latter, are relevant and admissible to show the deceased\u2019s attitude of mind shortly prior to the combat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">We are not unmindful of the fact that in the case before us the jury has rejected the accused\u2019s version of the homicide. Whether it should have done so is not now before us. The relevancy of the excluded testimony, however, must be viewed in the light of his story which the jury might have accepted. According to his testimony the deceased was the aggressor. Plainly, the deceased was looking for trouble when he intruded himself upon the accused and the girl. Moreover, according to the further testimony of the accused, at the time of the actual shooting his adversary was advancing on him (the accused) with a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The excluded testimony of Johnson was that Carr, only about two hours before the shooting, came- to the accused\u2019s residence, swearing vengeance against the accused and expressing the intent to kill him. This evidence was not only corroborative of the threats which Bud Riddick had heard Carr make against the accused, but tended to show Carr\u2019s design- to do violence to the accused at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>earliest opportunity,\u2014an opportunity which he promptly sought and quickly found.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">For this reason we are of opinion that the verdict must be set aside, the judgment reversed, and the case remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-10\">Compare, <em>Hardy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>110 Va. 910, 918, 67 S.
