On appeal, Penaloza-Carlon contends that the district court erred in applying the twelve-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) (2015) based on his Oregon conviction of rape in the third degree. He contends that the Oregon statute sweeps more broadly than the generic definitions of statutory rape, forcible sex offense, and sexual abuse of a minor for purposes of the \u00a7 2L1.2 crime-of-violence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">In the district court, Penaloza-Car-lon urged that the \u00a7 2L1.2 enhancement did not apply because the Oregon statute lacks an age difference. Thus, we review <em>de novo </em>whether that conviction is a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2 on that basis. <em>See United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 651-52 (5th Cir. 2008). Because Penaloza-Carlon did not maintain, in the district court, that the conduct proscribed by the Oregon statute is broader than the generic, contemporary meaning of, <em>inter alia, </em>sexual abuse of a minor, we review that point for plain error. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Perez, </em>779 F.3d 278, 281 &amp; n.2 (5th Cir. 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">The Oregon statute defines rape in the third degree as \u201csexual intercourse with another person under 16 years of age.\u201d Or. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 163.355(1). To determine whether conduct criminalized under a statute constitutes \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d this court examines (1) whether the conduct involved a minor; (2) whether the conduct was \u201csexual\u201d; and (3) whether the conduct constituted \u201cabus[e].\u201d <em>United States v. Puga-Yanez, </em>829 F.3d 317, 320-21 (5th Cir. 2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The first two prongs are satisfied. First, the Oregon offense requires the involvement of a minor because it calls for the victim to be under the age of sixteen. Penaloza-Carlon\u2019s argument to the contrary is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>711 F.3d 541, 560 (5th Cir. 2013) (en banc). Second, the offense is \u201csexual\u201d in nature because it has \u201csexual arousal or gratification as its purpose.\u201d <em>United States v. Olalde-Hernandez, </em>630 F.3d 372, 375 (5th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Penaloza-Carlon disputes the third element\u2014whether the conduct was \u201cabusive.\u201d He relies on decisions of the Ninth Circuit that the Oregon offense does not qualify as sexual abuse of a minor because it lacks the abuse element in that it does not expressly prohibit conduct that causes physical or psychological harm in light of the age of the victim. Those decisions, however, are not binding authority in this circuit and are inconsistent with our precedent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-10\">Penaloza-Carlon therefore has failed to show that the district court committed clear or obvious error by finding that the Oregon conviction was categorically sexual abuse of a minor. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). Accordingly, he has not shown that the court erred in applying the twelve-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-7\">. <em>See United States v. Sauseda, </em>596 F.3d 279, 282 (5th Cir. 2010) (holding that other circuits\u2019 decisions are persuasive only); <em>Puga-Yanez, </em>829 F.3d at 322 &amp; n.10 (holding that, even though psychological or physical harm to the minor often stems from the defendant\u2019s conduct, \"harm to the minor is not an element of the generic crime of \u2018sexual abuse of a minor\u2019 [under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
