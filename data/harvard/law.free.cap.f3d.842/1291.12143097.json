The sole issue before the Tax Court, and before us on appeal, is whether petitioner-appellant Marvel Entertainment, LLC\u2019s consolidated group must reduce its consolidated net operating loss (\u201cCNOL\u201d) under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 108(b)(2)(A) by the total amount of the group\u2019s previously excluded cancellation of indebtedness income under a \u201csingle entity\u201d approach as opposed to determining the amount of CNOL apportionable to each member and applying \u00a7 108(b)(2)(A) on a member-by-member basis. The Tax Court applied a \u201csingle entity\u201d approach to reduce the CNOL, finding deficiencies in income tax due for the taxable years 2003 and 2004 in the amounts of $2,144,756 and $14,453,653, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-23\">Applying <em>de novo </em>review, <em>Scheidelman v. Comm\u2019r, </em>682 F.3d 189, 193 (2d Cir. 2012), we affirm for substantially the reasons stated by the Tax Court in its complete and well-reasoned opinion, 145 T.C. 69 (2015).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
