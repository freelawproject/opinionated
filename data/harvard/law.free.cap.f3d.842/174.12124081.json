Arbitration under one provision, set out in the body of the form, states that \u201c[a]ll arbitrators will be disinterested active or former officers of insurance or reinsurance companies.\u201d J. App\u2019x at 150. Arbitration under the other provision, introduced by endorsement, does not limit the arbitrators to current or former insurance executives. This difference is evidently of considerable significance to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">First Mutual Transportation Assurance Company (\u201cFirst' Mutual\u201d), the ceding company, sought to compel its reinsurer, Infrassure, Ltd., to submit to arbitration governed by the endorsement. Infrassure initiated this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking a declaratory judgment that the arbitration provision contained in the body of the form is controlling. First Mutual\u2019s counterclaims requested the district court to find that the endorsement governs the dispute, and to compel Infras-sure to submit to arbitration under that provision. The district court held that the form\u2019s procedures governed, granted declaratory relief in favor of Infrassure, dismissed First Mutual\u2019s counterclaims, and denied the request to compel arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-16\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b221-17\">Because we construe the district court\u2019s declaratory judgment as a grant of summary judgment, see Garanti Finansal Kiralama A.S. v. Aqua Marine &amp; Trading Inc., 697 F.3d 59, 63-64 (2d Cir. 2012), we review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the reinsurance certificate at issue here de novo, see Dormitory Auth. of N.Y. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Com, 756 F.3d 166, 169 (2d Cir. 2014); Bank of N.Y. Tr. Co. v. Franklin Advisers, Inc., 726 F.3d 269, 275 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-19\">The printed body of the certificate, after setting out the declarations and other standard provisions, contains a provision that requires \u201cany dispute arising out of the interpretation, performance or breach of this Certificate\u201d to be submitted to arbitration pursuant to a specified set of rules. J. App\u2019x at 150. Infrassure, the reinsurer, stands upon these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-20\">First Mutual, the ceding company, contends that the other provision, contained in Endorsement No. 2, must control. This provision also purports to cover \u201c[a]ny dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement or the-breach, termination or invalidity thereof,\u201d and prescribes separate rules governing the arbitration. J. App\u2019x at 160. The endorsement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>is headed \u201cLONDON ARBITRATION AND GOVERNING LAW (UK AND BERMUDA INSURERS ONLY).\u201d J. App\u2019x at 160 (bolding in original). Since Infrassure, a Swiss company, is neither a United Kingdom insurer nor a Bermuda insurer, it argues that the endorsement is inapplicable on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The salient argument of First Mutual is that the tension between the two competing arbitration clauses is resolved by Paragraph AA (the \u201cTitles Clause\u201d), which states: \u201cThe several titles of the various paragraphs of this Certificate (and endorsements ... attached hereto) are inserted solely for convenience of reference and will not be deemed in any way to limit or affect the provisions to which they relate.\u201d J. App\u2019x at 153. First Mutual argues that the parenthetical \u201c(UK AND BERMUDA INSURERS ONLY)\u201d is part of the endorsement\u2019s title, and by operation of the Titles Clause, does not limit the endorsement to insurers of those countries.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">This is a thin argument, but it requires us to construe wording that apparently has not been construed before, and that is in a contract that may share features with other standard forms and endorsements. Hence, this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">We conclude that the contract is unambiguous. The arbitration clause in the body of the certificate controls: it is not displaced by the endorsement because the endorsement is expressly limited to UK and Bermuda insurers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That limitation is not part of the title itself, though it shares the same line and bolded format. The purpose of the Titles Clause is not to strip away an express indication as to the context in which a particular provision is operative, but to ensure that the text of a provision is not discounted or altered by the words of its heading.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u25a0 Our reading of the facultative certificate is easily confirmed by consulting other provisions. In some instances, critical clauses would have no meaning at all if the Titles Clause were mechanically applied. For example, Paragraph 14 of the Certificate reads in its entirety:</p>\n<p id=\"b222-12\">14. Program Policy Limits</p>\n<p id=\"b222-13\">Various as per the attached schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-14\">J. App\u2019x at 144 (bolding and underlining in original). If we were to apply the Titles Clause to this paragraph in the same way that First Mutual asks us to apply it to Endorsement No. 2, we would be left with the cryptic provision, \u201cVarious as per the attached schedule.\u201d The heading \u201cProgram Policy Limits\u201d instructs the reader that the phrase \u201cVarious as per the attached schedule\u201d refers to program policy limits, as opposed to some other concern of the reinsurance agreement. Other provisions beside Paragraph 14 likewise would be rendered meaningless if the Titles Clause were applied in the way pressed by First Mutual.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-15\">Infrassure argues that even if the endorsement is held to control, certain provisions of the arbitration clause in the body of the certificate should nevertheless be enforced, such as the requirement that all arbitrators be former or current insurance executives. We need not reach this argument, which is just as well for Infrassure.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-16\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b222-17\">For the foregoing reasons, and finding no merit in the appellant\u2019s other argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>ments, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b222-8\">. Given this conclusion, we also find that the district court correctly dismissed First Mutual\u2019s counterclaims and properly declined to compel arbitration under the endorsement\u2019s arbitral provisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
