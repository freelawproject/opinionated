NEWMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b837-26\">The principal issue on this appeal from a conviction for sex trafficking involving a minor is whether information from a global positioning system (\u201cGPS\u201d) can be obtained and used without a warrant to locate a suspect. This issue arises on an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>appeal by Jabar Gilliam from the January 28, 2015, judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Thomas P. Griesa, District Judge). Gilliam was convicted of sex trafficking offenses after a jury trial and sentenced to imprisonment for 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">We conclude that exigent circumstances justified obtaining and using GPS location information without a warrant and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\"><em>Offense conduct </em>The Defendant\u2019s offenses concern sex trafficking of a minor known as Jasmin. She recounted at trial the facts concerning Gilliam\u2019s offenses. Gilliam. met Jasmin in Maryland in late October or early November 2011. She was sixteen at the time, but told Gilliam that she was seventeen. Gilliam asked Jasmin to work for him as a prostitute after she told him she was working for another pimp. Gilliam told Jasmin that he was going to take her to New York, where she could work for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Jasmin worked for Gilliam as a prostitute in Maryland in November 2011. On two occasions he punched her. On one occasion he had sex with her against her will in a hotel room and on November 30, Gilliam brought Jasmin to New York City after threatening to require her fifteen-year-old sister to work as a prostitute for him if Jasmin refused to go. Gilliam purchased Jasmin\u2019s bus ticket for the trip, and on the ride to New York City, Gilliam told Jasmin to sit near the window and then put his legs up beside her so that Jasmin could not get out of her seat. Gilliam brought Jasmin to his mother\u2019s apartment in the Bronx, where he had sex with her against her will. Jasmin worked as a prostitute for Gilliam in the Bronx, giving him all the money that she earned.</p>\n<p id=\"AZv\"><em>Locating and arresting Gilliam. </em>On November 30, Jasmin\u2019s foster mother reported to the Sheriffs Office in Frederick County, Maryland, that Jasmin was missing from home. The foster mother told authorities that Jasmin had mentioned a \u201cboyfriend,\u201d known to her as \u201cJabar,\u201d who was later identified as Gilliam. On December 2, the case was referred to the Maryland State Police, which assigned Corporal Chris Heid to investigate. Corporal Heid spoke with -Jasmin\u2019s social worker, who expressed concern that Jasmin was being forced into prostitution by Jabar Gilliam. The social worker based her concern on conversations with Jasmin\u2019s biological mother. Heid then spoke with Jasmin\u2019s biological mother, who confirmed this information. She told Heid that Gilliam had communicated with her directly and told her that he was planning to take Jasmin to New York to work there as a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">On that same day, based on this information, Heid contacted Sprint Corporation (\u201cSprint\u201d), a telecommunications company. He told Sprint that he was \u201cinvestigating a missing child who is ... being prostituted,\u201d and requested GPS location information for Gilliam\u2019s cell phone. Heid said that he was making the request because of \u201can exigent situation involving ... immediate danger of death or serious bodily injury to a[] person.\u201d Sprint complied with Heid\u2019s request and began providing real-time GPS location information to the Maryland State Police, which passed the information on to the FBI and the New York City Police Department (\u201cNYPD)\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-10\">Also on December 2, Jasmin placed a phone call to her biological mother from the Bronx apartment of Gilliam\u2019s mother. NYPD officers went to that apartment and questioned Gilliam\u2019s mother. Location information provided by Sprint indicated that Gilliam\u2019s cell phone was a few blocks away. Canvassing the' neighborhood, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>NYPD officers saw Gilliam and Jasmin on the street and followed them to the third floor of an apartment building. When an officer confronted Gilliam, he attempted to flee. A scuffle ensued, after which Gilliam was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\"><em>Charges, trial, and conviction. </em>A grand jury charged Gilliam in Count One with sex trafficking of a minor by force, fraud, or coercion in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1591(a), (b)(1), and (b)(2), and in Count Two with transporting a minor in interstate commerce for purposes of prostitution in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2428(a). Gilliam was convicted on both counts after a jury trial and sentenced to imprisonment for 240 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">I. Use of GPS Location Information</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The District Court denied Gilliam\u2019s motion challenging the use of GPS location information to determine where Gilliam was, information that led to his arrest. The Court ruled that the Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702(c)(4), authorized, and exigent circumstances permitted, Corporal Heid to obtain location information from Sprint without a warrant.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-9\">Section 2702(c)(4) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-10\">A provider ... may divulge a record or <em>other information </em>pertaining to a subscriber ... (not including the contents of communications covered by [other subsections] )\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAf3\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-11\">(4) to a governmental entity, if the provider, in good faith, believes that an emergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure without delay of information relating to the emergency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702(c)(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">The initial statutory issue presented by Sprint\u2019s disclosure of GPS location information is whether it was \u201cother information\u201d within the meaning of subsection 2702(c)(4). Congress intended the phrase \u201cother information\u201d to cover \u201cinformation about the customer\u2019s use of the service.\u201d S. Rep. No. 99-541, at 38 (1986). Several district courts have interpreted the phrase to include the location of a customer\u2019s cell phone. <em>See United States v. Graham, </em>846 F.Supp.2d 384, 396 (D. Md. 2012) (subsequent history omitted); <em>In re Application of the United States for an Order Authorizing the Release of Historical Cell-Site Info., </em>809 F.Supp.2d 113, 125 (E.D.N.Y. 2011); <em>In re Application of the United States for Prospective Cell Site Location Info. on a Certain Cellular Telephone, </em>460 F.Supp.2d 448, 460-61 (S.D.N.Y. 2006). We agree that \u201cother information\u201d includes the location of a subscriber\u2019s cell phone.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">The second statutory question is whether the circumstances presented to Sprint showed \u201can emergency involving danger of ... serious physical injury to any person.\u201d We think it obvious that \u201cinvolving,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2702(c)(4), includes a realistic threat of such injury, not just a completed injury. That statutory question also arises in connection with the constitutional issue presented by Sprint\u2019s disclosure at the request of a law enforcement officer and the use of that information to locate and arrest Gilliam without a warrant. That issue is whether such a disclosure and arrest with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>out a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Both the second statutory issue and the Fourth Amendment issue turn on whether the circumstances known to law enforcement and presented to Sprint were within the category of \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d that permit warrantless searches. <em>See Riley v. California, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2487, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014). \u201cThe core question is whether the facts ... would lead a reasonable, experienced officer, to believe that there was an urgent need to ... take action.\u201d <em>United States v. Klump, </em>536 F.3d 113, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). \u201cA district court\u2019s determination as to whether exigent circumstances existed is fact-specific, and will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>916 F.2d 766, 769 (2d Cir. 1990) (in banc) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">We agree with the District Court that exigent circumstances justified GPS tracking of Gilliam\u2019s cell phone. The . evidence available to law enforcement at the time of the search for Gilliam\u2019s location was compelling. Based on Heid\u2019s discussions with Jasmin\u2019s foster mother, social worker, and biological mother, law enforcement officers had a substantial basis to believe that Gilliam was bringing Jas-min to New York City to require her to work there as a prostitute. That type of sexual exploitation of a minor has often been found to pose a significant risk of serious bodily injury. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Daye, </em>571 F.3d 225, 234 (2d Cir. 2009), <em>abrogated on other, grounds by Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015); <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>481 F.3d 836, 838-39 (D.C. Cir. 2007). As the Ninth Circuit has observed, prostitution of a child involves \u201cthe risk of assault or physical abuse by the pimp\u2019s customers or by the pimp himself\u2019 and \u201ca serious potential risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>266 F.3d 1089, 1091 (9th Cir. 2001) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Several courts have found that exigent circumstances justified warrantless entry into premises to avoid risk of injury to a minor held there. <em>See, e.g., Hunsberger v. Wood, </em>570 F.3d 546, 555 (4th Cir. 2009); <em>United States v. Kenfield, </em>270 Fed.Appx. 695, 696-97 (9th Cir. 2008); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>No. 3:14-CR-00031 (RNC), 2015 WL 164075, *4-5 (D. Conn. Jan. 13, 2015); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>No. 12-CR-6152G(MWP), 2015 WL 429087, at *12-13 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 2, 2015), <em>report and recommendation adopted, </em>No. 12-CR-6152(FPG), 2015 WL 3454430 (W.D.N.Y. May 29, 2015). Locating on the streets a victim of sexual exploitation might seem to present a less immediate need for police action than entering premises where such a victim is being held, but it is nonetheless sufficient to constitute exigent circumstances..</p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">Gilliam contends that the time required to obtain a warrant would not have significantly added to the risk of ipjpry to Jas-min. That argument, calls to mind the plight of social workers who have to decide whether to face a lawsuit for quickly removing a child from the home of an abusive parent or for failing to act in time to pr\u00e9vent the child\u2019s injury. \u201cIf they err in interrupting parental custody, they may be accused of infringing the parents\u2019 constitutional rights. If they err in not removing the child, they risk injury to the child and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>may be accused of infringing the child\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Van Emrik v. Chemung County Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>911 F.2d 863, 866 (2d Cir. 1990). Faced with exigent circumstances based on credible information that Gilliam was engaged in prostituting a missing child across state lines, Corporal Heid acted reasonably in obtaining Gilliam\u2019s cell phone location information without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Congress has \u201cdeemed it reasonable to subordinate any individual privacy interest in cell phone location information to society\u2019s more compelling interest in preventing an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury,\u201d and has therefore given service providers the authority to decide whether there existed an \u201cemergency involving danger of death or serious physical injury to any person.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>963 F.Supp.2d 341, 360 (D. Vt. 2013) (citations omitted), <em>aff'd, </em>831 F.3d 96 (2d Cir. 2016). Based on Heid\u2019s affirmation, Sprint had a good faith basis for believing that the disclosure of Gilliam\u2019s cell phone, location was necessary to protect a missing child from being prostituted and subject to serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">II. Other Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Gilliam\u2019s other claims do not require extended discussion. His arrest was supported by probable cause, based both on events occurring at the scene of his arrest and his sex trafficking with respect to Jasmin. There was no error in the jury charge, and the evidence fully supported the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"ALl\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">.The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-12\">. The cited cases involve interpretation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2703, a statute different from, but closely related to, section 2702. Section 2703 concerns mandatory disclosures pursuant to a warrant. Subsection 2703(c) requires disclosure of \"a record or other information pertaining to a subscriber .,. (not including the contents of <em>communications)....,\" </em>language identical to the language of subsection 2702(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-10\">. \u201c[T]he Government assumes for purposes of this appeal that cell phone users have a reasonable expectation of privacy in [location] information under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Br. for Appellee 14 n,3 at 15.
