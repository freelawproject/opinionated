No. 90-321, 82 Stat. 146 (1968) (codified as amended at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1601 <em>et seq.). </em>On this appeal from an award of summary judgment-in-favor of Comenity, Strubel argues that the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (P. Kevin Castel, Judge) erred in concluding that she failed, as a matter of law, to demonstrate that four billing-rights disclosures made to her by Comenity in connection with Strubel\u2019s opening of a credit card account violated the TILA. Co-menity defends the district court\u2019s judgment on the merits but, for the first time on appeal, also challenges Strubel\u2019s standing to maintain this action. We conclude that Strubel fails to demonstrate the concrete injury required for standing to pursue two of-her disclosure challenges and, therefore, we dismiss those two TILA claims for lack of jurisdiction. While Stru-bel adequately establishes standing to pursue her two remaining disclosure challenges, we agree with- the district court that those challenges fail as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm summary judgment in favor of Comenity on those TILA claims. Further, because Strubel\u2019s claims do not survive, we also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of her cross-motion for class certification as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">The following facts are either undisputed or viewed in the light most favorable to Strubel.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">On June 27, 2012, Strubel opened a Victoria\u2019s Secret brand credit card account, using the card to purchase a $19.99 article of clothing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The credit card agreement provided by Comenity to Strubel disclosed certain consumer rights under amendments to the TILA effected by the Fair Credit Billing Act, Pub. L. No. 93-495, 88 Stat. 1500 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">One year later, on June 27,2013, Strubel filed this putative class action, seeking statutory damages under the TILA for alleged defects in the aforementioned disclosures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Specifically, Strubel faulted Co-menity for failing clearly to disclose that (1) cardholders wishing to stop payment on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>an automatic payment plan had to satisfy certain obligations; (2) the bank was statutorily obliged not only to acknowledge billing error claims within 30 days of receipt but also to advise of any corrections made during that .time; (3) certain identified rights pertained only to disputed credit card purchases for which full payment had not yet been made, and did not apply to cash advances or checks that accessed credit card accounts; and (4) consumers dissatisfied with a credit card purchase had to contact Comenity in writing or electronically. <em>See </em>J.A. 21-22.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">At the close of discovery, Comenity moved for summary judgment, and Strubel cross-moved for class certification. The district court granted Comenity\u2019s motion, concluding that Strubel\u2019s claims failed as a matter of law, and it denied Strubel\u2019s certification motion as moot. <em>See Strubel v. Comenity Bank, </em>No. 13-cv-4462 (PKC), 2015 WL 321859, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">II, Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">A. Statutory and Regulatory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The TILA was enacted in 1968 to \u201c \u2018protect consumers against inaccurate and unfair credit billing and credit card practices\u2019 and promote \u2018the informed use of credit\u2019 by \u2018assuring a meaningful disclosure\u2019 of credit terms.\u201d <em>Vincent v. The Money Store, </em>736 F.3d 88, 105 (2d Cir. 2013) (alterations omitted) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a)). The TILA promotes this goal largely by \u201cimposing mandatory disclosure requirements on those who extend credit to consumers in the American market.\u201d <em>Mourning v. Family Publ\u2019ns Serv., Inc., </em>411 U.S. 356, 363, 93 S.Ct. 1652, 36 L.Ed.2d 318 (1973). The TILA provision codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640(a) affords consumers a cause of action for damages\u2014including statutory damages<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014against a creditor who fails to comply-with certain enumerated statutory provisions, including, as pertinent here, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7). That provision requires creditors to provide credit card holders (referred to as \u201cobli-gors\u201d) with \u201c[a] statement, in a form prescribed by regulations of the Bureau[,] of the protection provided by sections 1666 and 1666i of this title to an obligor and the creditor\u2019s responsibilities under sections 1666a and 1666i of this title.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7). The \u201cBureau\u201d referred to in this text is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (hereinafter \u201cCFPB\u201d or \u201cBureau\u201d), which is statutorily empowered to prescribe regulations and to publish model disclosure forms to carry out the TILA\u2019s purposes. <em>See id, </em>\u00a7 1604(a)-(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>tection and responsibilities detailed in \u00a7\u00a7 1666 and 1666i generally pertain to claimed billing errors and unsatisfactory purchases. We discuss them in more detail herein as pertinent to resolving the issues on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The CFPB\u2019s regulatory interpretations of and addenda to the TILA are collectively known as \u201cRegulation Z,\u201d which is codified at 12 C.F.R. Part 1026. The Supreme Court has afforded <em>Chevron </em>deference to Regulation Z, insofar as it reflects reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguities in the TILA <em>See Household Credit Servs., Inc. v. Pfennig, </em>541 U.S. 232, 238-39, 124 S.Ct. 1741, 158 L.Ed.2d 450 (2004) (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)); <em>Vincent v. The Money Store, </em>736 F.3d at 105-06.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">As pertains to the statement mandated by \u00a7 1637(a)(7), Regulation Z states in part that a creditor must provide a consumer to whom it issues a credit card with \u201c[a] statement that outlines the consumer\u2019s rights and the creditor\u2019s responsibilities under [regulatory] \u00a7\u00a7 1026.12(c) and 1026.13 and that is substantially similar to the statement found in Model Form G-3(A) in appendix G to this part.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.6(b)(5)(iii). Referenced regulatory \u00a7\u00a7 1026.12(c) and 1026.13 largely reiterate statutory \u00a7\u00a7 1666i and 1666, respectively. Meanwhile the \u201csubstantially similar\u201d requirement strives to implement statutory \u00a7 1637(a)(7)\u2019s mandate for a creditor statement \u201cin a form prescribed\u201d by Bureau regulations' consistently with statutory \u00a7 1604(b)\u2019s admonition that \u201c[n]othing\u2019 in this, subchapter may be construed to require a creditor ,.. to use any such model form.\u201d Thus, the formal staff interpretation states that \u201c[creditors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms and clauses and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a transaction or a plan without losing the Act\u2019s protection from liability,\u201d provided the changes are not \u201cso extensive as to affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the forms and clauses.\u201d 12 C.F.R. pt. 1026, supp. I, pt. 5, apps. G &amp; H(l). Formatting changes, however, \u201cmay not be made\u201d to Model Form G-3(A). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Strubel claims that Comenity\u2019s four challenged disclosures violate 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7) because they impermissibly deviate from Model Form G~3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">B. Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">Comenity argues that Strubel cannot maintain her TILA claims because she lacks constitutional standing. <em>See </em>U.S, Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2. Athough Comenity challenges Strubel\u2019s standing for the first time on appeal, because standing is necessary to our jurisdiction, we are obliged to decide the question at the outset. <em>See Jennifer Matthew Nursing &amp; Rehab. Ctr. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>607 F.3d 951, 955 (2d Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-16\">To satisfy the \u201cirreducible constitutional minimum\u201d of Article III standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate (1) \u201cinjury in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>fact,\u201d (2) a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between that injury and the .complained-of conduct, and (3) a likelihood \u201cthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks omitted). Co-menity argues that.Strubel fails to satisfy the first requirement: injury in fact. To demonstrate injury in fact, a plaintiff must show the \u201cinvasion of a legally protected interest\u201d that is \u201cconcrete and particularized\u201d and \u201cactual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">1. The Legal-Interest Requirement of Injury in Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">We easily conclude that Strubel satisfies the legal-interest requirement of injury in fact. As already detailed, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7) obligates a creditor to make specified disclosures \u201cto the person to whom credit is to be extended.\u201d Congress\u2019s authority to create new legal interests by statute, the invasion of which can support standing, is beyond question. <em>See Warth v. Seldin, </em>422 U.S. 490, 500, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975) (recognizing that injury required by Art. Ill may be based on \u201cstatutes creating legal rights\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>accord Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 578, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (recognizing Congress\u2019s authority to \u201celevat[e] to the status of legally cognizable injuries concrete, <em>de facto </em>injuries that were previously inadequate in law\u201d). But even where, as here, Congress has statutorily conferred legal interests on consumers, a plaintiff only has standing to sue if she can allege concrete and particularized injury to that interest. As discussed in the next section of this opinion, Strubel satisfies these requirements only as to two of her challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">2, The \u201cConcrete and Particularized\u201d Injury Requirements for Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">To satisfy the particularity requirement of standing, Strubel must show that, as to each of her four TILA disclosure challenges, Comenity\u2019s actions (or in-actions) injured her in a way distinct from the body politic. <em>See Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 734-40, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972); <em>accord DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, </em>547 U.S. 332, 344, 126 S.Ct. 1854, 164 L.Ed.2d 589 (2006). Moreover, as the Supreme Court recently clarified, injury to a legal interest must be \u201cconcrete\u201d as well as \u201cparticularized\u201d to satisfy the injury-in-fact element of standing. <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 136 S.Ct. 1540, 1548, 194 L.Ed.2d 635 (2016) (stating that requirements are distinct and must each be satisfied). To be \u201cconcrete,\u201d an injury \u201cmust actually exist,\u201d <em>id. </em>that is, it must be \u201creal, and not abstract,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Because we conclude that only two of Strubel\u2019s four TILA challenges manifest concrete injury, we begin by discussing that standing requirement in more detail, particularly in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Spokeo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-10\">a. Concrete Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">While tangible harms are most easily recognized as concrete injuries, <em>Spokeo </em>acknowledged that some intangible harms can also qualify as such. <em>See id. </em>at 1549. In deciding whether an intangible harm\u2014 such as the failure to receive a required disclosure\u2014manifests concrete injury, a court is properly respectful of Congress\u2019s judgment in affording a legal remedy for the harm. <em>See id. </em>(observing that \u201cbecause Congress is well positioned to identify intangible harms that meet minimum Article III requirements, its judgment is ... instructive and important\u201d). At the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>time, however, a court properly recognizes that Congress\u2019s \u201crole in identifying and elevating intangible harms does not mean that a plaintiff automatically satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement whenever a statute grants a person a statutory right and purports to authorize that person to sue to vindicate that right.\u201d <em>Id.; </em>see <em>Raines v. Byrd, </em>521 U.S. 811, 820 n.3, 117 S.Ct. 2312, 138 L.Ed.2d 849 (1997) (\u201cIt is settled that Congress cannot erase Article Ill\u2019s standing requirements by statutorily granting the right to sue to a plaintiff who would not otherwise have standing.\u201d). Making this point in <em>Spokeo, </em>the Supreme Court stated that a plaintiff cannot \u201callege a bare [statutory] procedural violation, divorced from any concrete harm, and satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III.\u201d <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1549.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Relying on this statement, Comenity argues that Strubel necessarily lacks standing because her TILA notice challenges allege only \u201ca bare procedural violation,\u201d with no showing of ensuing adverse consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We do not understand <em>Spokeo </em>categorically to have precluded violations of statutorily mandated procedures from qualifying as concrete injuries supporting standing. Indeed, if that had been the Court\u2019s ruling, it would not have remanded the case for further consideration of whether the particular procedural violations alleged \u201centail a degree of risk sufficient to meet the concreteness requirement\u201d as clarified in <em>Spokeo. Id. </em>at 1550. In short, some violations of statutorily mandated procedures may entail the concrete injury necessary for standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">The Supreme Court\u2019s citation in <em>Spokeo </em>to <em>Summers v. Earth Island Institute, </em>555 U.S. 488, 496, 129 S.Ct. 1142, 173 L.Ed.2d 1 (2009), and <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 572, 112 S.Ct. 2130, is instructive. These cases indicate that, to determine whether a procedural violation manifests injury in fact, a court properly considers whether Congress conferred the procedural right in order to protect \u2022 an individual\u2019s concrete interests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b235-9\">[Deprivation of a procedural right without some concrete interest that is affected by the deprivation\u2014a procedural right <em>in </em>vacuo\u2014is insufficient to create Article III standing. Only a \u201cperson who ' has been accorded a procedural right to protect <em>his concrete interests </em>can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b235-10\"><em>Summers v. Earth Island Inst., </em>555 U.S. at 496, 129 S.Ct. 1142 (emphasis added in Summers) (quoting <em>Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 572 n.7, 112 S.Ct. 2130). Thus, in the absence of a connection between a procedural violation and a concrete interest, a bare violation of the former does not manifest injury in fact. But where Congress confers a procedural right in order to protect a concrete interest, a violation of the procedure may demonstrate a sufficient \u201crisk of real harm\u201d to the underlying interest to establish concrete injury without \u201cneed [to] allege any <em>additional </em>harm beyond the one Congress has identified.\u201d <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1549 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-11\">In reaching this conclusion, the Supreme Court cited approvingly to <em>Federal Election Commission v. Akins, </em>524 U.S. 11, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>20-25, 118 S.Ct. 1777, 141 L.Ed.2d 10 (1998), which ruled that a group of voters\u2019 \u201cinability to obtain information\u201d that Congress had decided to make public is. a sufficient injury in fact to satisfy Article III, and to <em>Public Citizen v. Department of Justice, </em>491 U.S. 440, 449, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989), which held- that two advocacy organizations\u2019 inability to obtain information subject to disclosure under the Federal Advisory Committee Act \u201cconstitutes a sufficiently, distinct injury to provide standing to sue.\u201d <em>See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1549-50.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> At the same time, however, the Court held in <em>Spokeo </em>that, even though Congress enacted certain procedures in the Fair Credit Reporting Act to protect consumers against the dissemination of false information, a bare procedural violation with respect to the required notice to users of disseminated information may not demonstrate concrete injury because (1) the disseminated \u201cinformation regardless may be entirely accurate\u201d or (2) the misinformation may be too trivial to \u201ccause harm or present any material risk of harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1550 (observing as to latter possibility that \u201c[i]t is difficult to imagine how the dissemination of an incorrect zip code, without more, could work any concrete harm,\u201d <em>id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Thus,' we understand <em>Spokeo, </em>and the cases cited therein, to instruct that an alleged procedural violation can by itself manifest concrete injury where Congress conferred the procedural right to protect a plaintiffs concrete interests and where the procedural violation presents a \u201crisk of real harm\u201d to that concrete interest. <em>Id. </em>at 1549. But even where Congress has accorded procedural rights to protect a concrete interest, a plaintiff may fail to demonstrate concrete injury where violation of the procedure at issue presents no material risk of harm to that underlying interest. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">b. Strubel\u2019s Challenges Satisfying Concreteness and ' Particularity</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Applying these principles here, we conclude that two of Strubel\u2019s disclosure challenges demonstrate concrete and particularized injury: those pertaining to required notice that (1) certain identified consumer rights pertain only to disputed credit card purchases not yet paid in full, and (2) a consumer dissatisfied with a credit card purchase must contact the creditor in writing or electronically.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">These disclosure requirements do not operate in a vacuum, the concern identified in <em>Summers v. Earth Island Institute, </em>555 U.S. at 496, 129 S.Ct. 1142. Rather, each serves to protect. a consumer\u2019s concrete interest in \u201cavoiding] the uninformed use of credit,\u201d a core object of the TILA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1601(a). These procedures afford such protection by requiring a creditor to notify a consumer, at the time he opens a credit account, of how the consumer\u2019s own actions can affect his rights with respect to credit transactions. A consumer who is not given notice of <em>his </em>obligations is likely not to satisfy them and, thereby, unwittingly to lose the very credit rights that the law affords him. For that reason, a creditor\u2019s alleged violation of each notice requirement, by itself, gives rise to a \u201crisk of real harm\u201d to the consumer\u2019s concrete interest in the informed use of credit. <em>Spokeo, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number><em>v. </em>Robins, 136 S.Ct. at 1549.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Having alleged such procedural violations, Strubel was not required to allege \u201cany <em>additional </em>harm\u201d to demonstrate the concrete injury necessary for standing. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Further, as to these two challenges, Strubel sues to vindicate interests particular to her\u2014specifically, access to disclosures of her own obligations\u2014as a person to whom credit is being extended, preliminary to making use of that credit consistent with TILA fights. The failure to provide such required disclosure of consumer obligations thus affects Strubel \u201cin a'personal and individual way,\u201d <em>Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 560 n.1, 112 S.Ct. 2130, and her suit is not \u201ca vehicle for the vindication' of the value interests of concerned bystanders\u201d or the public at large, <em>Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 473, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">- Because Strubel has sufficiently alleged that she is at a risk of concrete <em>and </em>particularized harm from these two challenged disclosures, we reject Comenity\u2019s standing challenge to these two TILA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">3. Strubel\u2019s Challenges Failing to Demonstrate Concrete Injury</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">a. Notice Pertaining to Billing-Error - Claims under Automatic \u2022' Payment Plans</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Strubel asserts that Comenity violated statutory \u00a7 1637(a)(7) by failing to disclose a consumer\u2019s obligation to provide a creditor with timely notice to stop automatic payment of a disputed charge.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-12\">Strubel, however, cannot show that Co-menity\u2019s failure to provide such notice to her risked concrete injury because, as the district court found, it is undisputed that Comenity did not offer an automatic payment plan at the time Strubel held the credit card at issue. <em>See Strubel v. Comenity Bank, </em>2015 WL 321859, at *4. Certainly, Strubel does not adduce evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>she agreed to an automatic payment plan. Thus, she cannot establish that Comenity\u2019s failure to make this disclosure created a \u201cmaterial risk of harm\u201d\u2014or, indeed, any risk of harm at all\u2014to StrubeTs interest in avoiding the uninformed use of credit. <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1550.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">In seeking to avoid this conclusion, Stru-bel argues that Comenity\u2019s assertion that it did not offer an automatic payment at the relevant time is (1) an affirmative defense not raised in its Answer, (2) unsupported by facts proffered by Comenity, and (3) not dispositive of Strubel\u2019s challenge in any event because Comenity does not state that it lacked the ability to debit automatically. These arguments fail because Strubel does not dispute Comenity\u2019s assertion\u2014supported by a sworn declaration\u2014that it did not offer an automatic payment plan on the credit card that Stru-bel held, and Strubel fails otherwise to carry her burden to proffer evidence sufficient to manifest concrete injury. <em>See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. at 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130 (observing that \u201c[t]he party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing\u201d elements of standing). This defect pertains without regard to Co-menity\u2019s pleading obligations in its Answer. Thus, the automatic-payment-plan-notice TILA claim is properly dismissed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">b. Notice of Comenity\u2019s 30-Day Response Obligations to Reported Billing Error</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Strubel also sues Comenity for failing clearly to advise her of its obligation not only to acknowledge a reported billing error within 30 days of the consumer\u2019s communication, but also to tell the consumer, at the same time, if the error has already been corrected. Strubel contends that Comenity\u2019s notice to her was deficient in the latter respect. We detail in the margin the notice required by law, the notice language of the Model Form, and Comenity\u2019s challenged notice.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> For pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>poses of determining Strubel\u2019s standing, we assume that Comenity\u2019s notice fails clearly to report its response obligation in circumstances where it has corrected a noticed billing error within 30 days .of receiving consumer notification.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We nevertheless conclude that such a bare procedural violation does not create the material risk of harm necessary to demonstrate concrete injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">To explain, we note at the outset that the creditor-response obligations that are the subject of the required notice arise only if a consumer reports a billing error. Strubel concedes that she never had reason to report any billing error in her credit card statements. Thus, she does not\u2014and cannot\u2014claim concrete injury because' the challenged notice denied her information that she actually needed to deal with Co-menity regarding a billing error.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">This is not to suggest that a consumer must have occasion to us\u00e9 ch\u00e1llenged procedures to demonstrate concrete injury from defective notice. Indeed, we conclude otherwise with respect to the two notices discussed in Section II.B.2.b. of this opinion. But, by contrast to those notices, this \u201cparticular procedural violation! ],\u201d the alleged defect in 30-day notice of correction, does not, by itself, \u201cpresent any material risk of harm.\u201d <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1550. Notably, Strubel does not assert that the allegedly flawed notice caused her credit behavior to be different from what it would have been had the credit agreement tracked the pertinent 30-day notice language of Model Form G-3(A). Nor is it apparent that the challenged disclosure would have such an ef-feet on consumers generally. This is in contrast to the procedural violations already discussed, where we can reasonably assume that defective notices about a consumer\u2019s own obligations raise a sufficient degree of real risk that the unaware consumer will not meet those obligations, with ensuing harm to, if not loss of, rights under credit agreements. But, in the absence of any plausible claim of adverse effects on consumer behavior, the procedural violation here might well cause no harm to a consumer\u2019s concrete TILA interests in informed credit decisions. Two considerations inform that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">First, the alleged defect in Comenity\u2019s notice pertained to its obligation to respond within 30 days to a reported billing error when, in fact, it had already <em>corrected </em>the error\u2014indeed, corrected sooner than it was required to do by law. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(a)(3)(B). While a consumer would undoubtedly appreciate prompt notification of such favorable action, it is not apparent how a creditor\u2019s failure to tell the consumer that he will be so advised, by itself, risks real harm to any concrete consumer interest protected by the TILA. <em>Cf. Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1550 (finding it difficult to imagine how dissemination of incorrect zip code for consumer could work any concrete harm). Insofar as Strubel argues that a consumer might be left \u201cfretting needlessly for ... a long time\u201d about the status of a reported billing error, Appellant\u2019s Br. 62, such fretting would arise only if the creditor failed to report the correction within 30 days of a consumer\u2019s actual report of billing error, a separate violation from the one here at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>issue. Fretting would not be caused by the failure to provide the notice complained of here, a notice that is given when the consumer applies for credit, before any billing error has occurred, much less been reported or corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">In short, the creditor has two distinct disclosure obligations regarding the correction of reported billing errors. One\u2014 not at issue here\u2014requires the creditor to notify the consumer within 30 days of a reported billing error if the creditor has corrected the error within that time. The other\u2014here at issue\u2014requires the creditor to notify the consumer of the preceding obligation. The distinction between the two informs the <em>second </em>consideration relevant to our assessment of the risk of harm here. Despite the challenged defect in Comeni-t/s notice to Strubel of what its response obligations are in the event of reported billing error, Comenity could still comply with its obligation to give notice of correction within 30 days of receiving such a report. Thus, if Strubel had reported a billing error, Comenity might have corrected it <em>and </em>advised her of that fact within 30 days of receiving her claim. It would be more than curious, to conclude that a consumer sustains real injury to concrete TILA interests simply from a creditor\u2019s failure to advise of a reporting obligation that, in the end, the creditor honors. Indeed, ' such a conclusion is at odds with a parallel scenario- hypothesized by the Supreme Court to illustrate when a procedural error would \u201cresult in no harm.\u201d <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1550 (observing that, despite procedural failure to provide user of agency\u2019s consumer information with required notice, \u201cinformation regardless may be entirely accurate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">Our conclusion that Strubel lacks standing to sue for this particular bare procedural violation does not mean that creditors can ignore Congress\u2019s mandate to provide consumers the requisite notices\u2014 including the correction notice creditors will have to provide in their 30-day responses to reported billing errors. A consumer who sustains actual harm from such a defective notice can still sue under \u00a7 1640 for damages , and, even when there is no such consumer, the CFPB may initiate its own enforcement proceedings, <em>see </em>12 U.S.Q. \u00a7\u00a7 5481(14), 5562. We here conclude only that the bare procedural violation alleged by Strubel presents an insufficient risk of harm to satisfy the concrete injury requirement of standing, particularly where, as here, plaintiff fails to show either (1) that the creditor\u2019s challenged notice caused her to alter her credit behavior from what it would have been upon proper notice,, or (2) that, upon reported billing error, the creditor failed to honor its statutory response obligations to consumers.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Accordingly, this disclosure challenge is properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">C. Comenity Was Entitled to Judgment as a Matter of Law on the Disclosure Challenges for Which Standing Exists</p>\n<p id=\"AvV\">1. The Availability of a Statutory Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">To pursue the disclosure challenges for which we identify standing, Strubel must show that, contrary to the district court\u2019s ruling, she adduced sufficient evidence to preclude summary judgment in favor of Comenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Comenity defends the judgment in the first instance on a ground not relied on by the district court. It argues that, to the extent Strubel\u2019s disclosure challenges rely on notice requirements established by Regulation Z and Model Form G-3(A), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1640 affords her no statutory action. The argument fails on the merits. As already noted, \u00a7 1640(a) provides an action for statutory damages \u201cfor failing to comply with the requirements of\u2019 certain specified statutory provisions, including \u00a7 1637(a)(7), which requires a creditor \u201cto disclose to the person to whom credit is to be extended , [a] statement, <em>in a form prescribed by regulations .of the Bureau\u201d </em>of both the protection provided to a consumer and the responsibilities imposed on a creditor by \u00a7\u00a7 1666 and 1666i, 15 \u00da.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">. Comenity nevertheless argues, that district courts in this circuit have held that \u201cstatutory damages are not available for violations of. Regulation Z,\u201d <em>Schwartz v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., </em>No. 13 Civ. 769 (PAE), 2013 WL 5677059, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18, 2013) (collecting cases), and that the Seventh Circuit has ruled that \u201cthe TILA does not support [a] theory of derivative violations under which errors in the <em>form </em>of. disclosure must be treated as nondisclosure of the key statutory terms,\u201d <em>Brown v. Payday Check Advance, Inc., </em>202 F.3d 987, 992 (7th Cir. 2000) (emphases in original). The cited cases are factually distinguishable in an important respect: they reject statutory- damages claims for violations of parts of Regulation Z that do <em>not </em>implement one of the statutory provisions of the \u25a0 TILA enumerated in \u00a7 1640(a). <em>See, e.g., Brown v. Payday Check Advance, Inc., </em>202 F.3d at 992 (concluding in context of claims that disclosures violated \u00a7\u00a7 1632(a), 1638(a)(8), and 1638(b)(1) \u201cthat \u00a7 1640(a) means what it says, that \u2018only\u2019 violations of the subsections specifically enumerated in that clause support statutory damages,, and that' the TILA does not support plaintiffs\u2019 theory of derivative violations under which errors in the <em>form </em>of disclosure .must be treated as now-disclosure of the key statutory terms\u201d); <em>Schwartz v. HSBC Bank USA, N.A., </em>2013 WL 5677059, at *7 (\u201c[T]he statute\u2019s plain language limits the avenues for recovery of statutory damages; to permit an award of statutory damages .based on an-implementing regulation that tracks a statutory provision that does not provide for statutory damages would, as <em>Kelen </em>observed, flout Congress\u2019s intent.\u201d (citing <em>Kelen v.

With respect to such enumerated provisions, neither the TILA nor precedent supports Comenity\u2019s efforts to segregate a statute from its implementing regulations. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1602(z) (\u201cAny reference to any requirement imposed under this subchapter or any provision thereof includes reference to the regulations of the Bureau under this subchapter or the provision thereof in question.\u201d). Indeed, the law generally treats the two as one. <em>See Global Crossing Telecomms., Inc. v. Metrophones Telecomms., Inc., </em>550 U.S. 45, 54, 127 S.Ct. 1513, 167 L.Ed.2d 422 (2007) (\u201cInsofar as the statute\u2019s language is concerned, to violate a regulation that lawfully implements [the statute\u2019s] requirements <em>is </em>to -violate the statute.\u201d (emphasis in original)); <em>Alexander v. Sandoval, </em>532 U.S. 275, 284, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (\u201cSuch regulations, if valid and reasonable, authoritatively construe the statute itself, and it is therefore meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute. A Congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">Such segregation is particularly unwarranted\u2014likely, impossible\u2014here because \u00a7 1637(a)(7) does not simply require a creditor to disclose the protection and responsibilities specified in \u00a7\u00a7 1666 and 1666i. By its terms, the statute requires a creditor to make such disclosure \u201cin a form prescribed by regulations of the Bureau.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7). To be sure, the TILA itself instructs that this language cannot be construed \u201cto require\u201d a creditor to use the particular model form prescribed by the Bureau. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1604(b). Nevertheless, the plain language of \u00a7 1637(a)(7) indicates that the disclosure requirement imposed therein can only be understood by reference to the \u201cform prescribed by regulations.\u201d To conclude otherwise would violate the \u201cbasic canon of statutory interpretation ... to avoid readings that render statutory language surplusage or redundant.\u201d <em>Sacirbey v. Guccione, </em>589 F.3d 52, 66 (2d Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, because Congress itself has mandated that \u00a7 1637(a)(7) disclosures be in a form prescribed by regulations, we conclude that Strubel can sue for statutory damages under \u00a7 1640(a) for a violation of \u00a7 1637(a)(7) that relies on Model Form G-3(A), as prescribed by Regulation Z.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">We proceed to consider Strubel\u2019s argument that the district court erred in concluding that her disclosure challenges fail as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">2. Purchase and Outstanding Balance Limitations on Rights Pertaining to Unsatisfactory Credit Card Purchases</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">Strubel contends that Comenity violated \u00a7 1637(a)(7) by departing from the Model Form in notifying her that \u00a7 1666i(a) affords claims and defenses only with respect to unsatisfactory purchases made with credit cards\u2014not purchases made with cash advances or checks acquired by credit card<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u2014and that \u00a7 1666i(b) limits protection to amounts still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>due on the purchase.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We reproduce the relevant parts of the Model Form notice and Comenity\u2019s notice in the margin.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Strubel specifically faults Comenity for omitting from its own notice the Model Form\u2019s second and third numbered paragraphs, which reiterate limitations to credit card transactions and amounts outstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">In rejecting this challenge, the district court characterized the differences as \u201cinsubstantial and inconsequential.\u201d <em>Strubel </em>v. <em>Comenity Bank, </em>2015 WL 321859, at *6. The district court reasoned that, \u201c[o]n its face, the Agreement applies only to credit card purchases,\u201d and, \u201c[i]f there is a \u2018remaining amount due\u2019 on the purchase, it is implicit that the consumer has \u2018not yet fully paid for the purchase.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(ellipsis omitted) (quoting Comenity\u2019s notice and Model Form, respectively). We agree that the billing-rights notice is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d \u2018to Model Form G-3(A) and, thus, fails as a matter of law to demonstrate a violation of \u00a7 1637(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">The model forms were promulgated pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604(b), which,- as we have already observed, specifically states that \u201c[njothing in this subchapter may be construed to r\u00e9quire a creditor ... to use any such model form.\u201d The same statute nevertheless creates a \u201csafe harbor\u201d from liability, <em>Gibson v. Bob Watson Chevrolet-Geo, Inc., </em>112 F.3d 283, 286 (7th Cir. 1997), stating that a creditor \u201cshall be deemed to be in compliance with the disclosure provisions of this subchapter with respect to other than numerical disclosures\u201d if the creditor (1) uses the appropriate model form, or (2) uses the model form, changing it (A) to delete information not required by the applicable law, or (B) to rearrange the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>format if, by doing so, the creditor \u201cdoes not affect the substance, clarity, or meaningful sequence of the disclosure,\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">In implementing \u00a7 1637(a)(7)\u2019s mandate consistent with \u00a7 1604(b), Regulation Z both provides a model form\u2014Model Form G-3(A)\u2014and acknowledges that: a creditor can satisfy its statutory obligation by providing a consumer with a statement of billing rights that is \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to that model form. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.6(b)(5)(iii), The official staff interpretation acknowledges that creditors may make certain changes to model forms \u201cwithout losing the Act\u2019s protection from liability,\u201d citing, as examples, the deletion of inapplicable disclosures or the rearrangement of the sequences of disclosures. 12 C.F.R. pt. 1026, supp. I, pt. 5, apps. G &amp; H, G(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">Strubel urges us to construe these examples as defining the outer perimeter of a statement qualifying as \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to Model Form G-3(A). To the extent Comenity\u2019s statement includes further changes from the model form, Strubel argues that the district court could not conclude that her challenge failed as a matter of law. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">The two cited examples are not the only permissible changes identified in the staff interpretation. <em>See id. </em>at apps. G &amp; H(l) (further identifying pronoun substitutions and type changes). In any event, the staff interpretation statqs that it is identifying permissible changes that can be made \u201cwithout losing the Act\u2019s protection from liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This \u201cprotection\u201d is a reference to the statute\u2019s safe harbor provision, within which a creditor <em>\u201cshall be </em>deemed to be in compliance\u201d with TILA disclosure obligations. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604(b) (emphasis added). Indeed, that is evident from the fact that the two changes highlighted by Strubel derive from the safe harbor provision of- \u00a7 1604(b). But the statements that qualify for a safe harbor are necessarily a smaller number than - the statements that <em>can </em>satisfy the TILA because they are \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the applicable model form. Indeed, to equate the two might run afoul of the \u00a7 1604(b) mandate that nothing in the subchapter be construed to require a creditor to use a model form.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Thus, Regulation Z, like the TILA itself, must be understood to. recognize that statements seeking to comply with \u00a7 1637(a)(7) can fall into three categories: (1) those that \u201cshall be deemed to be in compliance\u201d because they use the model form or depart from that form only in specifically approved ways, (2) those that can be in compliance if \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to the model form, and (3) those that cannot be deemed compliant because they deviate substantively from the model form.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Comenity\u2019s disclosure statement does not fall within the first category because a safe harbor is available only for the deletion of disclosures that are <em>inapplicable </em>to the transaction at issue, not for the deletion of disclosures that are applicable but possibly redundant. Thus, we consider whether, as the district court concluded, the challenged disclosure can be deemed \u201csubstantially similar\u201d as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">While our court has not articulated the precise bounds of a \u201csubstantially similar\u201d disclosure, decisions from our sister circuits support conducting the inquiry by reference to an \u201caverage consumer,\u201d that is, one who is \u201cneither particularly sophisticated nor particularly dense.\u201d <em>Palmer v. Champion Mortg., </em>465 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir. 2006); <em>see Rossman v. Fleet Bank (R.I.) Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, </em>280 F.3d 384, 394 (3d Cir. 2002); <em>Smith v. Cash Store Mgmt., Inc., </em>195 F.3d 325, 327-28 (7th Cir. 1999). Further properly informing the inquiry is our own recognition that \u201c[although the TILA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>is a disclosure statute, its purpose is to require \u2018meaningful disclosure,\u2019 not \u2018more disclosure,\u201d\u2019 <em>Turner v. Gen. Motors Acceptance Corp., </em>180 F.3d 451, 457 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting <em>Ford Motor Credit Co. v. Milhollin, </em>444 U.S. 555, 568, 100 S.Ct. 790, 63 L.Ed.2d 22 (1980)), and that the TILA \u201cdoes not require perfect disclosure, but only disclosure which clearly reveals to consumers the cost of credit,\u201d <em>Gambardella v. G. Fox &amp; Co., </em>716 F.2d 104, 118 (2d Cir. 1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">With these principles in mind, we consider Strubel\u2019s.argument that Comenity\u2019s challenged statement cannot be deemed \u201csubstantially similar\u201d to Model Form G-3(A) because the challenged statement\u2019s failure to include the form\u2019s numbered paragraphs \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d could mislead an average consumer into thinking that (a) cash advances or convenience checks drawn from credit card accounts are covered by the phrase \u201cproperty or services that you purchased With a credit card\u201d and \u201ccredit card purchases,\u201d and (b) relief from unsatisfactory purchases was available even after full payment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">An average consumer would readily understand the word \u201cpurchase,\u201d particularly when used with respect to \u201cproperty\u201d or \u201cservices,\u201d to bear its ordinary -meaning, that - is, -a transaction where. payment is made so that something sold can be acquired. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (Unabridged) </em>1844 (1986 ed.) (defining \u201cpurchase\u201d as \u201cto obtain (as merchandise) by paying money or its equivalent : buy for a price\u201d). The word \u201cpurchase\u201d would not usually be applied to the procurement of a cash advance or convenience check, either of which simply converts credit into a monetary instrument. One might charge such a cash advance or check against a credit card and then use these instruments. to \u201cpurchase\u201d desired property or services. But the average person would not characterize the use of a credit card to acquire the instruments as a credit card purchase, nor would such a person characterize the acquisition of merchandise with cash or checks obtained by credit card as a credit card purchase of the merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Further, an average consumer would understand the statement that he \u201cmay have the right not to pay <em>the remaining amount due\u201d </em>on the unsatisfactory property or services to reference a right limited to payment of an outstanding balance. J.A. 37 (emphasis added). Only a \u201cparticularly dense\u201d reader would think that the rule afforded rights when <em>no </em>amount remained owing. <em>Palmer v. Champion Mortg., </em>465 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">Accordingly, like the district court, we conclude that Strubel\u2019s challenge to Co-menity\u2019s disclosure of \u201cpurchase\u201d and \u201coutstanding balance\u201d limitations on consumer rights to dispute unsatisfactory credit card purchases fails as a matter of law because the disclosure is substantially similar to the relevant- part of Model Form G-3(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">3. Requirement for Written Notice of Unsatisfactory Purchases</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">Strubel argues that Comenity violated \u00a7 1637(a)(7) by failing to advise her that a consumer must report an unsatisfactory purchase to a creditor in writing. The argument fails because, while \u00a7 1637(a)(7) requires a creditor to disclose the protections and obligations of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666i\u2014which pertain to unsatisfactory credit card purchases\u2014\u201cin a form prescribed by regulations of the Bureau,\u201d nothing in \u00a7 1666i conditions the protections on a consumer giving <em>written </em>notice. Strubel nevertheless locates such a limitation on consumer rights in that part of Model Form G-3(A) that has a creditor advise the consumer.that if \u201cstill dissatisfied with the purchase, -contact us in writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ing [or electronically] at\u201d a location to be specified by the creditor. 12 C.F.R. pt. 1026, app. G~3(A) (bracketed text in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Model Form G-3(A) could itself impose a written notice limitation on \u00a7 1666i protections\u2014a matter we do not decide here\u2014the form language cited by Strubel imposes no such limitation because it is, in fact, optional.-As the official interpretation to Regulation Z states, ii. The model billing rights statements also contain <em>optional </em>language that creditors may use. For example, the creditor may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">A. Include a statement to the effect that notice of a billing error must be submitted on something other than the payment ticket or other material accompanying the periodic disclosures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">B. Insert its address or refer to the address that appears elsewhere on the bill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">C. <em>Include instructions for consumers, at the consumer\u2019s option, to communicate with the creditor electronically or in writing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">12 C.F.R. pt. 1026, supp. I, pt. 5, app. G(3)(ii) (emphases added). Because the model form language is explicitly optional, Comenity cannot be found to have violated statutory \u00a7 1637(a)(7) by failing to include such language in its own disclosure. Accordingly, summary judgment was correctly entered in favor of Comenity on Stru-bel\u2019s written-notice challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">In sum, insofar as we have recognized Strubel\u2019s standing to sue Comenity for alleged violation of \u00a7 1637(a)(7) in giving inadequate notice of (1) limitations on rights pertaining to credit card purchases, and (2) a writing requirement to challenge unsatisfactory purchases, we conclude that these disclosure challenges fail on the merits and, accordingly, affirm the award of summary judgment to Comenity on these challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">To summarize, we conclude as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">1. Because alleged defects in Comenity\u2019s notice of consumer rights with respect to (a) limitations on rights in the event of unsatisfactory credit card purchases, and (b) requirement of written notice of unsatisfactory purchases could cause consumers unwittingly not to satisfy their own obligations and thereby to lose their rights, the alleged defects raise a sufficient degree of the risk of real ham necessary to concrete injury and Article III standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">2. Because Strubel fails to demonstrate sufficient risk of harm to a concrete TILA interest from Comenity\u2019s alleged failure to give notice about (a) time limitations applicable to automatic payment plans and (b) the obligation to acknowledge a reported billing error within 30 days if the error had already been corrected, she lacks standing to pursue these bare procedural violations and, thus, these TILA claims must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">3. Comenity\u2019s notice that certain TILA protections applied only to unsatisfactory credit card purchases that were not paid in full is substantially similar to Model Form G-3(A) and, therefore, cannot as a matter of law demonstrate a violation of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1637(a)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-18\">4. Because neither the TILA nor its implementing regulations require unsatisfactory purchases to be reported in writing, Comenity\u2019s alleged failure to disclose such a requirement cannot support a \u00a7 1637(a)(7) claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-19\">Accordingly, the appeal is DISMISSED in part, the award of summary judgment is otherwise AFFIRMED, and the termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>nation of the motion for class certification as moot is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-6\">.

In supplemental briefing, Comenity argues that Strubel\u2019s injury is not particularized because it is not distinct from that sustained by other members of the putative class. The argument fails because, again, particularity requires that one sustain a grievance distinct from the body politic, <em>see Sierra Club v. Morton, </em>405 U.S. 727, 734-40, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972), not a grievance unique from that of any identifiable group of persons. Indeed, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3) conditions class actions on the claims or defenses of representative parties being \"typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\u201d Comenity\u2019s urged interpretation of particularized injury would render class actions inherently incompatible with Article III, a conclusion .for which it cites no support in law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b237-14\">.The obligation can be traced to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666, which obliges a creditor to satisfy certain requirements \u201cprior to taking any action to collect the amount\u201d contested in a billing-error dispute, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1666(a)(3)(B). Regulation Z prohibits a creditor from automatically deducting the amount of a disputed charge from a consumer\u2019s deposit account if the consumer gives notice of the dispute at least three business days before the scheduled payment date. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.13(d)(1). Thus, disclosure of this right (and its triggering notice obligation) is required by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.6(b)(5)(iii) and incorporated into Model Form G-3(A) as follows: \"You must contact us ... [a]t least 3 business days before an automatic payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b238-5\">. Judge Kearse would also find standing lacking as to this challenge based on the absence of particularity, given that, even if there were any evidence that Comenity offered an automatic payment plan, Strubel has in no way suggested that she \u201cagreed,\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 1026.13(d)(1), to such a plan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">. The relevant statutory text obligates a creditor, \"not later than thirty days after the receipt of the [consumer] notice [of billing error],\u201d to \"send a written acknowledgment thereof to the obligor, <em>unless </em>the action required in subparagraph (B) is taken within such thirty-day period.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1666(a)(3)(A) (emphasis added). The referenced subparagraph B \"action\u201d is either the creditor\u2019s correction of the error in the consumer's account <em>\"and </em>transmit[tal] to the ob-ligor [of] a notification of such corrections,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1666(a)(3)(B)(i) (emphasis added), or the creditor's \"written explanation\u201d to the consumer of \"the reasons why the creditor believes the account of the obligor was correctly shown in the statement,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1666(a)(3)(B)(ii). The highlighted language suggests that the creditor\u2019s notice obligations are in the disjunctive, <em>i.e., </em>within 30 days of receiving a consumer report of billing error, the creditor must either acknowledge receipt or notify the consumer that the error has been corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"AIj\">Model Form G~3(A), however, casts the creditor's obligations in the conjunctive: \"Within 30 days of receiving your letter [reporting billing error], we must tell you that we received your letter. We will <em>also </em>tell you if we have already corrected the error.\u201d 12 C.F.R. pt. 1026, app. G-3(A) (emphasis added). Regardless of whether the creditor\u2019s response obligation is disjunctive or conjunctive, Stru-bel asserts that Comenity\u2019s notice is deficient because it suggests that there is <em>no </em>30-day response obligation if the creditor corrects a billing error within that time: \"We must acknowledge your letter [reporting billing error] within 30 days, unless we have corrected the error by then,\u201d J.A. 36. As the district court observed, this text \"does not expressly provide that [Comenity] will provide notice of receipt in the event that it corrects the error.\u201d <em>Strubel v. Comenity Bank, </em>2015 WL 321859, at *5.

Strubel does not contend that Comenity\u2019s notice would be deficient in circumstances where a reported error\u2019has not been corrected within 30 days of receipt.
