The Government concedes that the District Court (Mae A. D\u2019Agostino, <em>Judge) </em>committed \u201cplain error\u201d by accepting Powers\u2019s plea to the count challenged on appeal and that Powers\u2019s conviction as to that count must be vacated, but argues that resentencing is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>unnecessary. We disagree with the Government with respect to the appropriate remedy. Because the error below was a so-called \u201cconviction error,\u201d <em>de novo </em>resen-tencing is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Accordingly, we REMAND the cause to the District Court with instruction to vacate the erroneous count of conviction and for <em>de novo </em>resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">While working as a babysitter, Powers took sexually explicit photos of, and engaged in sexual acts involving, a seven-year-old girl (\u201cV-l\u201d). On August 4, 2014, Powers took four pornographic photographs of V-l. That same day, Powers connected with an undercover FBI agent through an online site used to swap pornographic pictures of children, and sent all four images to the agent. On August 5, 2014, Powers took seven more photographs of V-l and, on August 7, 2014, sent four of these seven to the same undercover agent. One of the images in this second batch was unique; unlike the other images of V-l (in either batch), it did not focus on the child\u2019s pubic area and instead \u201cthe child\u2019s bare chest [wa]s the focus of .the image.\u201d PSR \u00b6 9(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">On August 10, 2014, Powers was babysitting when law enforcement agents executed a search warrant at the home of V-l. In the course of questioning, Powers admitted to taking sexually explicit photographs of V-l, to distributing them online, and to receiving pornographic images of other children. Powers provided his iPhone 4 (and its passcode) to the agents, which revealed approximately 125 photographs of V-l as well as other pornographic photos of children. In a search of Powers\u2019 residence, agents found other electronic devices that contained more child pornography.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-11\">The following month, a federal grand jury returned an indictment charging Powers with eleven counts of production of child pornography (Counts One through Eleven, or \u201cthe production counts\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), (e); one count of distribution of child pornography (Count Twelve), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(l)(A) [sic]<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (b)(1), and 2256(8)(A); and one count of possession of child pornography (Count Thirteen), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2), and 2256(8)(A.). Although it is not necessarily apparent from the record on appeal which image corresponded to which production count, the Government submits in its appellate brief that Count Six had as its factual basis the production of the \u201cbare chest\u201d image-.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-12\">On June 2, 2015, Powers pleaded guilty to all counts in the indictment without a plea agreement. On November 19, 2015, the District Court sentenced Powers to a below-Guidelines 480-month (forty-year) term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">The Government concedes that the District Court committed \u201cplain error\u201d by allowing Powers to plead guilty to a count for which there was no \u201cfactual basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>the plea.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, the image of V-l that focused on her bare chest was not within the definition of \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d prohibited by . 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a), and conduct relating to it cannot serve as a factual basis for a conviction thereunder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree that Powers\u2019s count of conviction related to that image, but only that image, must therefore be vacated. The principal issue on appeal is thus the appropriate remedy where only part of a conviction is subsequently overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Our opinion in <em>United States v. Rigas, </em>583 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2009), aimed to settle that very question. <em>Rigas </em>sought to clarify <em>United States v. Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d 1217 (2d Cir. 2002), which had held that the \u201cdefault rule\u201d to remedy a so-called \u201cconviction error\u201d\u2014as distinct from a so-called \u201csentencing error\u201d\u2014is <em>de novo </em>resentencing. <em>See Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d at 1228 &amp; n.6. After considering <em>Quintieri </em>and its progeny, <em>Rigas </em>explained that <em>Quintieri </em>had \u201ccreated a rule, not a guideline,\u201d and to the extent it or prior cases were ambiguous, <em>Rigas </em>\u201cresolve[d] any ambiguity\u201d in favor of <em>de novo </em>resentencing following conviction errors. <em>Rigas, </em>583 F.3d at 117-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">Subsequent characterizations of the rule in non-precedential summary orders and in passing <em>dicta </em>in published opinions have remained somewhat ambiguous, however. One panel read <em>Rigas, </em>albeit only in a summary order, as having established an essentially uniform rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Other panels, likewise in summary orders or in <em>dicta, </em>have continued to use, at least as a matter of linguistics, the \u201cdefault rule\u201d formulation of <em>Quintieri </em>when mentioning <em>Rigas,</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Notably, however, applications of the rule, be-it characterized as \u201cdefault\u201d or not, are almost entirely consistent. No. case cited in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>footnote six permitted a district judge, following partial vacatur of a conviction, simply to enter an amended judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">Indeed, it appears that only one post-<em>Rigas </em>case has allowed a district judge to do so. <em>See United States v. Moreno-Montenegro, </em>553 Fed.Appx. 29, 31-32 (2d Cir. 2014). That summary order reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">With respect to the appropriate remedy, Moreno-Montenegro requests a remand for <em>de novo </em>resentencing, contending that vacating one of his convictions \u201c \u2018effectively undoes the entire knot of calculation\u2019 underlying the original sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Barresi, </em>361 F.3d 666, 672 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting <em>United States v. Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d 1217, 1228 (2d Cir. 2002)). We disagree. The two offenses here were considered together throughout the proceedings below, and the district court ultimately imposed identical concurrent sentences for both counts. Moreover, as explained below, we find no other error in the defendant\u2019s sentencing. <em>In accordance with our ;practice in such circumstances, </em>we accordingly will remand with instructions for the district court to vacate the conviction on one of the two counts and to enter an amended judgment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Miller, </em>116 F.3d 641, 685 (2d Cir. 1997).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 32 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">The Government relies heavily upon <em>Moreno-Montenegro </em>here\u2014and, it appears, elsewhere<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\u2014in arguing that resen-tencing is unnecessary. That reliance is misplaced. The \u201cpractice\u201d identified in <em>Moreno-Montenegro </em>is appropriate only when the defendant has already received, as his or her sentence on an upheld count of conviction, a mandatory minimum sentence. Those were the circumstances in <em>Miller, </em>to which <em>Moreno-Montenegro </em>attributes \u201cour practice,\u201d and in the other case upon which the Government here relies, <em>Burrell v. United States, </em>467 F.3d 160 (2d Cir. 2006).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Such circumstances\u2014in which a district court\u2019s amending its judgment of conviction is, by force of law, \u201cstrictly ministerial\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\u2014constitute the only viable exception to the rule set forth in <em>Rigas. </em>And as a non-precedential summary order, <em>Moreno-Montenegro </em>is without force to suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">Here, Powers was not given a mandatory minimum sentence for any of the twelve non-deficient counts of conviction. Accordingly, <em>Rigas </em>controls and <em>de novo </em>resen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>tencing is required.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In light of that, we do not reach Powers\u2019s challenge to the substantive reasonableness of his current sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">For the reasons stated above, we REMAND the cause to the District Court with instruction to vacate the erroneous count of conviction and for <em>de novo </em>resen-tencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\">.
