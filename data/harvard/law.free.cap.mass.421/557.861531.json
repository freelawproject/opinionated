They urge us to overrule <em>Filios </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue, </em>415 Mass. 806 (1993), cert, denied, 114 S. Ct. 1538 (1994). We allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The taxpayers are Massachusetts residents who paid State income taxes on Federal military pension income from 1986 to 1992. Their abatement claim is grounded in 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 (1994), which provides: \u201cThe United States consents to the taxation of pay or compensation for personal service as an officer or employee of the United States ... or political subdivision thereof . . . by a duly constituted taxing authority .. . if the taxation does not discriminate against the officer or employee because of the source of the pay or compensation.\u201d Where State law imposes a heavier tax burden \u201cbecause of the source of the pay or compensation,\u201d \u00a7 111 is violated unless \u201cthe inconsistent tax treatment is directly related to, and justified by, \u2018significant differences between the two classes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>503 U.S. 594, 598 (1992), quoting <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>489 U.S. 803, 816 (1989). The taxpayers here argue that 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 is violated by G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 <em>(a) </em>(2) (E) (1994 ed.), and by St. 1973, c. 876. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">General Laws c. 62, \u00a7 2 <em>(a) </em>(2) (E), exempts \u201c[ijncome from any contributory annuity, pension, endowment or retirement fund of the United States government or the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof ... to which the employee has contributed.\u201d Under the statute, benefits received by employees who contributed to the pension system during their State or Federal employment are exempt from State taxation, and employees (whether State or Federal) who did not contribute a portion of their salary to the retirement system must pay State taxes on their benefits. Most employees of the Commonwealth pay a percentage of their salaries into the retirement system during their working years. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (1994 ed.). The taxpayers, on the other hand, are beneficiaries of a \u201cnoncontributory\u201d system funded entirely by their former employer, the Federal government. The Commissioner of Revenue asserts that the tax<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>payers\u2019 pension benefits are therefore taxable under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 <em>(a) </em>(2) (E). The taxpayers claim that the statute violates 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. We agree with the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Massachusetts tax law distinguishes between contributory and noncontributory retirement plans, not between State and Federal retirees. \u201cThe determining factor for the Massachusetts exemption is whether the retirement fund is a \u2018contributory fund to which the employee has contributed.\u2019 \u201d Technical Information Release (TIR) 89-6 (May 10, 1989), 2 Official MassTax Guide at 369 (West 1995). \u201cAny Federal retirement income is exempt from Massachusetts tax if the system is contributory and the employee actually contributed,\u201d <em>id.,</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and, on the other hand, \u201c[a] non-contributory government pension, received by a retired employee of [a political subdivision of the Commonwealth] ... is includible in the Massachusetts gross income of the employee ... in the taxable year in which the pension is paid.\u201d Letter Ruling 81-51 (June 11, 1981), <em>supra </em>at 576. In sum, the statutory provisions treat retirement benefits paid by the Commonwealth and the Federal government in precisely the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The taxpayers argue that a retired employee of the Commonwealth receives \u201cannuity\u201d payments from the employee\u2019s own contributions and \u201cpension\u201d payments from the Commonwealth\u2019s contributions, so that the State employee does not contribute to the \u201cpension fund.\u201d The taxpayers conclude that to tax their pension benefits is discriminatory because the State retiree is receiving a State tax-free \u201cpension.\u201d If the taxpayers were correct we would be required to interpret G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 <em>(a) </em>(2) (E), so as to yield different results depending not on the substantive distinction whether employees contribute, but rather on the technical distinction of how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the Commonwealth accounts for contributions. We conclude that the taxpayers are not correct, and that their focus on the State\u2019s accounting system is misplaced. The dispositive inquiry under G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 (a) (2) (E), is whether the employee contributed to the retirement system, not what account his contributions are placed in, or from what account distributions are made. The State worker is required to make regular, State-taxed, contributions to the retirement system in order to get a State tax-free pension on retirement. The taxpayers here made no such contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Further, the result advocated by the taxpayers would require the Commonwealth either to discriminate against contributing employees in favor of noncontributing employees by taxing both contributions when made and benefits when received or, alternatively, to make the State retirement system noncontributory so as not to favor noncontributing employees. We do not think \u201cthe modern constitutional doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity\u201d codified in 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 requires such a result. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Michigan Dep\u2019t of the Trea</em>sury, 489 U.S. 803, 813 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">We also do not agree with the taxpayers that the distinction made by the Commonwealth between contributing and noncontributing employees is \u201conly a cloak for discrimination against federally funded benefits.\u201d <em>Barker, supra </em>at 604-605. Disparate treatment is justified by the fact that, in the Commonwealth\u2019s contributory system, the preretirement employee pays into the pension fund a percentage of after-tax wages, while in a noncontributory system the preretirement employee sacrifices nothing and receives full salary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>Furthermore, we do not agree with the taxpayers that the contribution of a Massachusetts State employee is illusory. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 22 (1) <em>(b), </em>requires a contribution of five per cent from employees who began service prior to 1975, seven per cent from employees who began service between 1975 and 1984, and eight per cent from employees who began service after 1984. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 22 (1) (bV.2), requires an additional two per cent of the salary in excess of $30,000 from employees who began service after 1978. Although G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 3 (B) <em>(a) </em>(4), allows a taxpayer to deduct up to $2,000 from gross income for retirement system contributions, the taxpayers are mistaken in asserting that this provision \u201ceffectively shields employees earning less than $40,000 from ever paying any tax on their \u2018contributions.\u2019 \u201d On the contrary, as the commissioner points out, a State employee hired after 1984 and earning between $25,000 and $30,000 (and therefore subject only to the eight per cent rate) would be subject to tax despite the $2,000 deduction. For State employees earning over $30,000 (and who are therefore subject to the additional two per cent contribution required by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 [1] [Z\u00bbVi]), the tax is even more significant.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">The taxpayers also argue that 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 is violated by St. 1973, c. 876. Chapter 876 is a \u201cgrandfather\u201d provision which exempts from taxation \u201cincome from a noncontributory annuity or pension allowance received on account of service in a police or fire department of a town by a person . . . who was in the employ of such . . . department at the time of the establishment of the contributory retirement system\u201d in 1936 and 1937.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We do not think this provision discriminatory in the meaning of 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111. Chapter 876 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>favors a class of retirees not \u201cbecause . . . the source of the pay or compensation\u201d is the Commonwealth rather than the Federal government, but on the basis of occupation (police and firefighters) and date of first employment (before 1938). Furthermore, St. 1973, c. 876, protects a small and dwindling class; we do not think it can be credibly argued that it constitutes \u201cdiscrimination against federally funded benefits.\u201d <em>Barker, supra </em>at 604-605. Accord <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Mierke, </em>191 W.Va. 120, 124, cert, denied sub nom. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Paige, </em>115 S. Ct. 207 (1994) (distinguishing statutes which discriminate <em>against </em>Federal retirees from statute <em>favoring </em>a narrow class of State retirees). See also <em>Alarid </em>v. <em>Secretary of the N.M. Dep\u2019t of Taxation &amp; Revenue, </em>118 N.M. 23, 29 (Ct. App. 1994), cert, denied, 115 S. Ct. 733 (1995) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Neither G. L. c. 62, \u00a7 2 <em>(a) </em>(2) (E), nor St. 1973, c. 876, discriminates on the basis of source of benefits, either facially or in effect. Therefore, neither statute violates 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The taxpayers\u2019 argument amounts to a request that Federal employees be treated better than State and local employees. We do not think that 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 111 requires such a result. The ruling of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Accord TIR 78-1 (Jan. 9, 1978) 2 Official MassTax Guide at 309 (West 1995) (\u201cIncome received from an employee benefit plan is generally taxable ....

L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (10), for Federal income tax purposes, not to exempt the employee from taxation, but to defer Federal taxation until benefits are received.
