R. Crim. P. 30, 378 Mass. 900 (1979). Therefore, we affirm the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>We summarize the facts. The defendant was a used automobile salesman and manager at Carney Buick Corporation (Carney Buick) in Hanover. Sometime in 1985 he left his position at Carney Buick and started his own used automobile wholesale business, East/West Auto Trade (East/West). He would purchase used automobiles from Carney Buick and resell them.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s case focused on an alleged scheme created and carried out by the defendant and Patrick Moriarty, Carney Buick\u2019s comptroller, to steal funds from Carney Buick. Under this scheme, the defendant would give Moriarty a check payable to Carney Buick for each car that he purchased from Carney Buick. However, these checks typically were not deposited into Carney Buick\u2019s account. The Commonwealth presented evidence that, in this manner, the defendant \u201cpurchased\u201d from Carney Buick 240 automobiles worth more than $717,000. Although the defendant had issued checks to Carney for that amount, some $694,357 was not deposited into Carney Buick\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The defendant testified in his own behalf. He stated that Moriarty had initiated an arrangement whereby, when the defendant purchased an automobile from Carney Buick, Moriarty would hold the defendant\u2019s check for several days, until the defendant resold the vehicle. At that time, the defendant would deliver to Carney Buick, from the proceeds of the resale, the cash equivalent of the check he had previously issued to Carney Buick for the automobile. Moriarty then would return the defendant\u2019s check. The defendant testified that Moriarty told him that this arrangement was at the behest of the dealership\u2019s owner, James Carney, who needed cash. The defendant also testified that he agreed to the arrangement as a \u201ccourtesy\u201d to the dealership.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Moriarty also was charged with larceny. Initially, his case was joined with the defendant\u2019s case. The defendant successfully moved to sever his case from Moriarty\u2019s because some of Moriarty\u2019s testimony, as well as some of the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>against Moriarty, might tend to inculpate the defendant. Moriarty\u2019s testimony at his own trial, which occurred prior to the defendant\u2019s trial, tended to support the defendant\u2019s contention that he had been an unwitting participant in Moriarty\u2019s scheme. Moriarty testified that he had devised the scheme in order to generate large amounts of cash for James Carney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also testified that the defendant received a fee, ranging from $50 to $200, for each of the transactions in which he issued a check to Carney Buick and subsequently exchanged the check for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">On April 14, 1992, after a jury-waived trial, a judge found the defendant guilty on one indictment charging larceny over $100. The defendant subsequently filed a motion for new trial alleging that trial counsel\u2019s failure to call certain witnesses, in particular Moriarty, to corroborate his testimony amounted to constitutionally inadequate assistance of counsel. The defendant submitted five affidavits in support of his motion for a new trial, one each from: Moriarty; the defendant\u2019s brother; a former employee of the defendant at East/ West; the former general sales manager at Carney Buick; and a businessman who had done business with both the defendant and Moriarty. The latter four affidavits attested generally to the defendant\u2019s good reputation. Those of the defendant\u2019s brother, the former East/West employee, and the former sales manager indicated that the defendant did not attempt to conceal his practice of swapping cash for the return of checks previously issued by him to Carney Buick. Moriarty\u2019s affidavit followed his testimony at his own trial and tended in some respects to support the defendant\u2019s assertion that he had been duped by Moriarty. Moriarty stated in his affidavit that he had assured the defendant that the scheme \u201cwas on the up and up,\u201d that James Carney knew about and consented to it, that the cash generated by the scheme inured to Carney, and that the defendant should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>speak directly to Carney if he had any questions about the scheme. In addition to these affidavits, the transcript of Moriarty\u2019s trial was before the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">The judge denied the defendant\u2019s request for an evidentiary hearing, heard the motion for a new trial based upon the affidavits and arguments of counsel, and denied the motion. The defendant now asserts that the judge abused his discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing before denying the motion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A defendant may obtain a new trial under Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (b), \u201cif it appears that justice may not have been done.\u201d Appellate courts generally defer to the sound discretion of the trial judge on whether a motion for a new trial requires an evidentiary hearing or whether it can be decided on the basis of the facts alleged in the affidavits. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 660 (1992). <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>406 Mass. 103, 110 (1989). In exercising this discretion, the judge must determine whether the motion or affidavits have raised a \u201csubstantial issue\u201d that would require an evidentiary hearing. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257 (1981). See Mass. R. Crim. P. 30 (c) (3). We have reviewed the record before us and conclude that no evidentiary hearing was required on the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial because his motion and the affidavits accompanying it did not present a \u201csubstantial issue\u201d to the court. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>385 Mass. 190, 194 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra </em>at 257-258. Thus, we hold that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u201cIn determining whether a \u2018substantial issue\u2019 meriting an evidentiary hearing under rule 30 has been raised, we look not only at the seriousness of the issue asserted, but also to the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s showing on the issue raised.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, supra. </em>Although we recognize that the issue of ineffectiveness of counsel is of constitutional importance, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, supra </em>at 661, the defendant made no showing that he was denied the effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>assistance of counsel under the appropriate standards. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rodwell, </em>394 Mass. 694, 701 (1985). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974) (to prove ineffective assistance of counsel, defendant must show that \u201cserious incompetency, inefficiency or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer . . . likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence\u201d).* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5For example, the defend\u00e1nt has failed to show that counsel\u2019s decision not to call Moriarty as a witness was \u201cmanifestly unreasonable.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>374 Mass. 722, 728 (1978). The record indicates that counsel did evaluate Moriarty\u2019s potential testimony and made a tactical decision that Moriarty\u2019s testimony would not benefit the defendant.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, nothing in the four other proffered affidavits provided any significant information about the defendant\u2019s intent to steal funds from Carney Buick, which was the disputed issue at trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Furthermore, the defendant has not shown that his proposed witnesses would have testified in an evidentiary hearing to anything more than what was contained in the affidavits accompanying the motion, and thus has failed to demonstrate that such a hearing would have provided the judge with additional information relevant to the motion. The judge was entitled to look \u201cnot only to the seriousness of the claims presented but also to the adequacy of the defendant\u2019s factual showing on those claims.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 378, 381 (1992). For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>although the defendant focuses upon Moriarty\u2019s testimony at his trial, and asserts that the judge should have held an evidentiary hearing so that Moriarty could testify along those same lines, the transcript from Moriarty\u2019s trial was before the judge and the defendant did not indicate that Moriarty\u2019s proffered testimony would add anything to the information contained in that transcript or in his affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Finally, the judge, who had been the factfinder at the defendant\u2019s trial, was entitled to use his knowledge and evaluation of the evidence at trial not only in reaching a decision on the motion, but in determining whether to decide that motion without an evidentiary hearing. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carver, supra. </em>See also <em>Fogarty </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, supra </em>at 111. The judge\u2019s conclusion that the defendant\u2019s motion and affidavits did not raise a substantial issue, as well as the judge\u2019s favorable evaluation of trial counsel\u2019s performance, are entitled to substantial deference. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McMaster, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 735 n.6 (1986).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We conclude that the judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-15\">The Appeals Court, by memorandum of decision under its Rule 1:28, had remanded the case for the purpose of conducting an evidentiary hearing on the motion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DeVincent, </em>37 Mass.

At the sentencing hearing, the judge told trial counsel that \u201cYou came as close to making a silk purse out of a saw\u2019s ear in this case as anybody I\u2019ve ever come across. I\u2019m not being critical of your advocacy.\u201d In a marginal notation on the motion for a new trial, the judge concluded that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation of this defendant was excellent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
