Rule 3:07, Canon 4, DR 4-101 (B) (3), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981), concerning the use of a client\u2019s secrets for the advantage of another, and S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 5, DR 5-105, as appearing in 382 Mass. 781 (1981), concerning multiple employment in which a lawyer would be likely to represent differing interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the two attorneys declined to accept the proposed private reprimands, the board filed an information in the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. A single justice reserved decision and reported the matter to the full court to consider whether the two attorneys had violated disciplinary rules as the board ruled and, if so, what discipline, if any, should be imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">We set forth the significant facts to which the attorneys and bar counsel have stipulated. In December, 1991, the two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>attorneys obtained a District Court judgment of almost $17,000 against Diane Cosenzi (Cosenzi) on behalf of Lorac Leasing Corp. (Lorac). On May 10, 1991, prior to the commencement of that action, Cosenzi had fraudulently conveyed real estate she owned in Longmeadow to her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Approximately two months before judgment was entered against Cosenzi, the two attorneys had undertaken to represent Howard and Christine Hausman (Hausmans) in the purchase of property in Longmeadow from a Vera Sadallah. The firm\u2019s \u201cconflict check\u201d showed no problem. The attorneys did not know, nor did they have any reason to know, that Sadallah was in fact Cosenzi\u2019s mother, the transferee of the property that the Hausmans sought to acquire. In November, the attorneys undertook a title examination, and a review of the abstract on December 18 disclosed that the property that the Hausmans had agreed to purchase had been owned by Cosenzi and fraudulently conveyed by her to her mother for one dollar. On December 20, counsel for Sadallah and Cosenzi advised the attorneys that Sadallah would transfer the property to Cosenzi prior to the closing, which was scheduled for December 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The attorneys and other lawyers in their firm discussed the appropriate course of action to take in view of their simultaneous representation, through no fault of their own, of a judgment creditor of the seller of real estate, Lorac, and the prospective purchasers of that real estate, the Hausmans. The attorneys did not withdraw from either representation, or from their intended role at the closing as the settlement agent for the lender and the Hausmans. They did not inform the Hausmans that they represented Lorac. They did not seek advice from outside counsel or from bar counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">On December 20, 1991, the attorneys moved ex parte on behalf of Lorac in the District Court for an $18,000 trustee process attachment of expected proceeds from the sale of Cosenzi\u2019s property. The process was to be served on the attorneys\u2019 firm, which expected, pending the recording of the deed and other documents, to hold the proceeds of the anticipated sale of the Longmeadow property. A judge allowed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>motion. The attorneys did not obtain a real estate attachment on the Longmeadow property. The attorneys were, therefore, taking the risk that their firm would be able to hold the settlement proceeds for a sufficient time after the deed to the Hausmans was recorded, and before the proceeds were distributed to the seller, to enable a deputy sheriff effectively to serve the trustee summons on the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">The closing took place in the morning of December 27 at the attorneys\u2019 firm, which acted as settlement agent. An associate in the firm handled the closing on behalf of the firm and informed the seller\u2019s lawyer that the firm would record the necessary papers and that the seller\u2019s net proceeds would be available at about noon. The deed and other papers were recorded before 11:40 a.m., when a deputy sheriff served the trustee summons on the firm\u2019s treasurer. A few minutes later, one of the attorneys advised the office of seller\u2019s counsel that the settlement proceeds would be $18,000 less than the amount set forth in the settlement statement. Lorac\u2019s judgment was subsequently satisfied out of the funds retained by the attorneys\u2019 firm. The matter came to bar counsel\u2019s attention when a District Court judge referred the matter to him, after he denied a motion of the seller Cosenzi to dismiss the trustee process.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">A hearing committee of the board concluded that the attorneys\u2019 failure, as escrow holder, to disclose the impending service of trustee process was prejudicial to the administration of justice in violation of S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 1, DR 1-102, as appearing in 382 Mass. 769 (1981). The hearing committee agreed with bar counsel that the Hausmans and Lorac had potentially differing interests, but concluded that it would have been a disservice to both clients to require either to seek new counsel a week before the closing. The hearing committee also recognized that the attorneys\u2019 conduct involved the improper disclosure of client secrets.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The hearing committee recommended that no discipline be imposed. No client was harmed. No client complained. The attorneys obtained no undue financial benefit. The committee concluded that neither it nor bar counsel was able to identify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>what the two attorneys should have done in the specific circumstances. Bar counsel appealed from the hearing committee recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The board rejected the hearing committee\u2019s recommendation of no discipline and ordered that a private reprimand be administered to each attorney. In addition to identifying violations of DR 4-101 (B) (3) (use of secrets) and DR 5-105 (improper multiple representation), which we have already mentioned, the board ruled that the two attorneys violated their fiduciary duty as escrow holder and consequently violated S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 1, DR 1-102 (A) (5), as appearing in 382 Mass. 769 (1981), by engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. We shall consider each of these disciplinary rules in turn and then shall consider the level of discipline that should be imposed for those violations that we conclude did occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">1. <em>DR 4-101 (B) (3). </em>The board properly decided that the two attorneys violated DR 4-101 (B), which states that \u201ca lawyer shall not knowingly ... (3) Use a confidence or secret of his client for the advantage of himself or of a third person, unless the client consents after full disclosure.\u201d The attorneys used information that they obtained from their buyer-clients, the Hausmans, concerning the date and place of the closing, the seller\u2019s name, the purchase price, and net proceeds of the sale. They did so for the advantage of Lorac, their creditor-client, without the Hausmans\u2019s consent. The significant question is whether that information was a \u201cconfidence or secret\u201d of the Hausmans. \u201c \u2018Confidence\u2019 refers to information protected by the attorney-client privilege under applicable law.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 4-101 (A), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981). There is no claim that the information that the two attorneys used was protected by the attorney-client privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">A \u201c \u2018secret\u2019 refers to other information gained in the professional relationship that the client has requested be held inviolate or the disclosure of which would be embarrassing or would be likely to be detrimental to the client.\u201d DR 4-101 (A). The attorneys certainly used \u201cinformation gained in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>professional relationship\u201d with the Hausmans. The Hausmans did not request that the information be held inviolate, nor does it appear that the disclosure of the information would have been embarrassing to the Hausmans. Thus, the question comes down to whether disclosure of the information \u201cwould be likely to be detrimental to the client.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Recently, this court endorsed the view that public disclosure of the secrets of a client is never the business of a lawyer, except in those rare instances when disclosure is explicitly permitted under S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 4, DR 4-101 (C), as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981). <em>GTE Prods. Corp. </em>v. <em>Stewart, ante </em>22, 31 (1995). We have not, however, decided the meaning of the words \u201clikely to be detrimental to the client.\u201d Cases elsewhere do not provide significant guidance. One commentator has suggested that a test of reasonableness should be used in deciding whether revealing information would likely be detrimental to a client. C. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 6.7.2, at 297 (1986).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">The attorneys\u2019 use of the information concerning the sale and closing to advance Lorac\u2019s interests in collecting its judgment against Cosenzi was detrimental to the interests of the Hausmans. The fact that the Hausmans\u2019 purchase was put at some risk by the collection procedure devised by the multiple attorneys was a detriment to the Hausmans. It was not necessary for the board to find that it was more probable than not that the Hausmans would suffer a loss because of the use of the secrets. It was inherent in the collection plan that the Hausmans\u2019 acquisition of the property was placed at a greater risk because the seller might learn of the plan to attach a portion of the proceeds and postpone or abandon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>sale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The two attorneys\u2019 unauthorized use of information, derived from their representation of the Hausmans, to aid Lorac was contrary to the Hausmans\u2019 interests because it made their situation less secure. The risk created by use of the information was detrimental to the Hausmans\u2019 interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">2. <em>DR 5-105. </em>The board rightly concluded that the attorneys violated DR 5-105. A lawyer must decline proffered employment and discontinue multiple employment if the acceptance of the proffered employment or the representation of multiple clients \u201cwould be likely to involve him in representing differing interests,\u201d with an exception (which requires the consent of each client) that has no application here. DR 5-105 (A) &amp; (B). When the attorneys learned that Cosenzi was the true owner of the premises that their clients, the Hausmans, intended to purchase, conflicting responsibilities to Lorac and to the Hausmans presented a problem for the attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">The interests of the two clients were \u201cdiffering interests.\u201d See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, 382 Mass. 796 (1981), defining \u201c[differing interests\u201d to \u201cinclude every interest that will adversely affect either the judgment or the loyalty of a lawyer to a client, whether it be a conflicting, inconsistent, diverse, or other interest.\u201d The Hausmans wanted to purchase the property without difficulty. Lorac wanted its judgment satisfied, which might have been most securely achieved by an attachment of the seller\u2019s real estate rather than by an attachment of proceeds of any potential sale. Lorac had an interest in the disclosure and use of the information that the attorneys obtained from their representation of the Hausmans. The interests of the Hausmans in time might call for avoidance of the sale, perhaps because of an arguable title defect, a financing problem, or a change of mind. Lorac might desire to pursue the Cosenzi property aggressively and not care about whether the sale was completed. The attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>neys\u2019 enthusiasm for that aggressive action could be tempered by loyalty owed to the Hausmans. Because information about the sale was a secret of the Hausmans that, as we have held, the attorneys could not properly disclose, once the attorneys learned that the seller was Lorac\u2019s judgment debtor, the interests of the two clients, the Hausmans and Lorac, were inconsistent, and the attorneys\u2019 loyalty to each client was adversely affected by the conflicting joint representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">3. <em>DR 1-102 (A) (5). </em>The board also concluded that the attorneys\u2019 participation in the sale as escrow agents was prejudicial to the administration of justice and thus violated DR 1-102 (A) (5).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The attorneys contend that they violated no fiduciary duty as escrow agents and that, in any event, there was no prejudice to the administration of justice. We shall consider the two points in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">The board concluded that the attorneys had a fiduciary duty to disclose to the seller Cosenzi any material fact that, if known, might have caused her not to agree to the escrow. Cosenzi was not a client of the attorneys. The issue here is the extent of an escrow holder\u2019s obligation to parties to an escrow agreement beyond the obvious obligation to carry out its terms. See <em>Greater Boston Real Estate Bd. </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Real Estate Brokers &amp; Salesmen, </em>405 Mass. 360, 362 n.5 (1989); <em>Kaarela </em>v. <em>Birkhead, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 412 (1992) (escrow holder is not agent of either party but is fiduciary of each); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 14D (1958). Massachusetts cases have not discussed whether an escrow holder has any duty beyond fulfilling the terms of the escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Some authority limits an escrow holder\u2019s duties to the terms of the escrow. See, e.g., <em>Gurley </em>v. <em>Bank of Huntsville, </em>349 So. 2d 43, 45 (Ala. 1977); <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Title Ins. &amp; Trust Co., </em>264 Cal. App. 2d 160, 162-163 (1968). Other authority extends an escrow holder\u2019s duty beyond compliance with the escrow agreement. See, e.g., <em>Maganas </em>v. <em>Northroup, </em>135 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Ariz. 573, 576 (1983) (duty to disclose known fraud); <em>Collins </em>v. <em>Heitman, </em>225 Ark. 666, 673 (1955) (escrow holder may not take advantage of position to profit beyond agreed compensation); <em>Kitchen Krafters, Inc. </em>v. <em>Eastside Bank, </em>242 Mont. 155, 162 (1990) (duty to make full disclosure of all material facts relevant to escrow); <em>American State Bank </em>v. <em>Adkins, </em>458 N.W.2d 807, 811 (S.D. 1990) (escrow holder has duty to avoid any self-dealing that places personal interest in conflict with obligations to party to escrow).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We need not resolve the scope of an escrow holder\u2019s duties in all circumstances. The facts of a particular situation will be important in deciding the nature of an escrow holder\u2019s duties to the parties to the escrow. Surely, self-dealing by an escrow holder, such as an escrow holder\u2019s unauthorized collection from escrowed funds of a debt owed by a party to the escrow agreement, would be a breach of duty. We have no hesitancy in concluding that if, as was the case here, an escrow holder without disclosure sets in motion a process to deny a party to the escrow agreement a portion of the funds to be held in escrow and to transfer those funds to a client of the escrow holder, the escrow holder violates a fiduciary duty to that party to the escrow agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">It is a closer question whether DR 1-102 (A) (5) was violated by the attorneys\u2019 breach of duty as escrow holder, which caused no harm to any client and satisfied Cosenzi\u2019s obligation to the attorneys\u2019 creditor client. Certainly most situations in which an attorney\u2019s conduct has been held to be prejudicial to the administration of justice have involved judicial or adjudicative proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Matter of Finnerty, </em>418 Mass. 821, 828-829 (1994) (attorney\u2019s intentional misrepresentation of financial worth to court); <em>Matter of Tobin, </em>417 Mass. 92, 94, 96 (1994) (submission of false description of services rendered and false time records to court; misrepresentations to court and bar counsel); <em>Matter of McCarthy, </em>416 Mass. 423, 423, 426-427 (1993) (eliciting false testimony and offering false documents before rent control board); <em>Matter of Neitlich, </em>413 Mass. 416, 416, 419 (1992) (fraud on court by misrepresenting terms of client\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>pending real estate transactions); <em>Matter of Palmer, </em>413 Mass. 33, 33, 36-37 (1992) (charging excessive fee, filing probate account containing misrepresentations, and neglecting legal matter); <em>Matter of Orfanello, </em>411 Mass. 551, 552-553, 555 (1992) (making ex parte communication to judge on behalf of another lawyer concerning case pending before that judge); <em>Matter of Clooney, </em>403 Mass. 654, 657 (1988) (withholding information from court and violating court orders). Cf. <em>Roy </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 633, 635-636 (1993) (attorney violated DR 1-102 [A] [5] when he failed to disclose to executor asset of estate being probated). In cases holding that DR 1-102 (A) (5) was violated where the connection to litigation has not been apparent, the basis for the violation has not been explained, and the question has been unimportant because of substantial violations of other provisions of the Code. See <em>Matter of Saab, </em>406, Mass. 315, 319 n.4 (1989); <em>Matter of Kenney, </em>399 Mass. 431, 434 (1987). In <em>Matter of Kerlinsky, </em>406 Mass. 67, 74-75 n.6 (1989), cert, denied, 498 U.S. 1027 (1991), the court questioned whether an attorney\u2019s refusal to deliver certain property to his client violated DR 1-102 (A) (5), as the board had concluded, but passed on the issue because more serious violations had been proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We obtain some guidance concerning the definition of conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice from sources elsewhere. The Florida Supreme Court has said that \u201c[t]he term is not so broad as to include all conduct which is illegal but rather those activities [such as bribery, perjury, misrepresentations to a court] \u2018which undermine[] the legitimacy of the judicial processes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Florida Bar </em>v. <em>Pettie, </em>424 So. 2d 734, 737-738 (Fla. 1983), quoting <em>Polk </em>v. <em>State Bar of Tex., </em>374 F. Supp. 784, 788 (N.D. Tex. 1974). The New Jersey Supreme Court has said that \u201con those few occasions when the rule has served as the sole basis for discipline, it has been applied only in situations involving conduct flagrantly violative of accepted professional norms.\u201d <em>Matter of Hinds, </em>90 N.J. 604, 632 (1982). Without such limiting interpretations of DR 1-102 (A) (5), the rule presents the risk of vagueness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>and arbitrary application. See C. Wolfram, Modern Legal Ethics \u00a7 3.3.1 at 87-88 (1986); 2 G. Hazard &amp; W. Hodes, The Law of Lawyering, \u00a7 8.4:501, at 957 (2d ed. Supp. 1994), discussing Rule 8.4 (d) of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, which preserves the same language.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Because of the uncertainty of the law of the Commonwealth concerning the duties of the attorneys as escrow agents and, more particularly, because their conduct as escrow holders involved no egregious conduct and did not undermine the legitimacy of the judicial process, we decline to rule that the attorneys violated DR 1-102 (A) (5). It is true that they used the judicial system to obtain service of trustee process on their firm. There is no showing, however, of wrongdoing before the judge in obtaining the attachment. The attorneys\u2019 conduct did not prejudice the administration of justice in any large sense because a debt established in court was satisfied from funds of the debtor. On a more restrictive view, the processes of the court were used to take advantage of one client\u2019s secrets unethically to help another client. The better course, where possible, is to deal with alleged professional misconduct under specific rules, such as those that we have already discussed, rather than to invoke the general language of DR 1-102 (A) (5).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">4. <em>Level of discipline. </em>The attorneys should receive the lowest possible level of private discipline, an informal admonition. Although the line between a private reprimand and an informal admonition is not easily drawn,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> in the novel circumstances of this case we believe that the two attorneys need not be reprimanded but rather should be warned by the imposition of an informal admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">We have rejected the breach of the attorneys\u2019 fiduciary duty as escrow holder as a violation of DR 1-102 (A) (5) in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>this proceeding. There remains the use of client secrets and the representation of differing interests, each a disciplinary violation but neither virulent. It appears that Lorac was materially benefited by the actions of the two attorneys and that the Hausmans were not harmed. Indeed, as a practical matter, the risk that the attorneys would disadvantage their clients by withdrawing from each representation was arguably as great as was the risk in continuing to represent them. As the board noted, these circumstances are entitled to weight in mitigation, but they do not absolve the two attorneys from the imposition of discipline.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The two attorneys were not indifferent to the ethical dilemma. They did, however, not select the correct course to avoid violations of disciplinary rules. Absent client consent, the attorneys should have withdrawn from the representation of each client.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 2, DR 2-110 (B) (2), as appearing in 382 Mass. 774 (1981), mandating withdrawal if continued employment will result in violation of a disciplinary rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">A judgment shall be entered in the county court that the two attorneys shall receive an informal admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-9\">The firm is a professional corporation, and the two attorneys are shareholders.
