Brousseau, appeals. She claims that the trial judge improperly: (1) admitted evidence of prior bad acts; (2) failed to instruct the jury as to the credibility of witnesses testifying pursuant to a plea bargain or grant of immunity; and (3) failed to instruct the jury as to the weight of consciousness of guilt evidence. The defendant also asks that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1994 ed.), to order a new trial or enter a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt. We affirm the conviction and decline to exercise our power under \u00a7 33E in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">1. <em>Facts. </em>We set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichypor, </em>419 Mass. 209, 210 (1994). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Salemme, </em>395 Mass. 594, 595 (1985). Two weeks prior to the victim\u2019s murder, the defendant\u2019s home was destroyed by fire. The defendant moved in with her friend, Gina Hadley, and Hadley\u2019s lover, Debra Skarpos. The defendant\u2019s young twins went to stay with another friend, the victim\u2019s wife Janice Allen Desnoyers. It was' during this period that Janice told Skarpos and the defendant that she wanted her husband killed. Janice, Skarpos, and the defendant devised a plan to murder him in the parking lot of a cocktail lounge called The Rawhide. Janice was to accompany the victim to the bar and bring him out at an agreed time to his automobile, where Skarpos would be lying in wait.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">On the night of the murder, Skarpos, the defendant, and the victim\u2019s stepson Aaron Allen left Hadley\u2019s around 8 p.m. and drove to The Rawhide. Skarpos had a gun taken from Hadley\u2019s closet. The defendant gave directions as Aaron drove. When they arrived at The Rawhide, the defendant instructed Aaron to drive out of the parking lot and turn right so he would know their escape route. After so doing, Aaron drove back into the parking lot and parked. Skarpos got out and hid in the victim\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">While waiting in Aaron\u2019s automobile, the defendant and Aaron heard a gunshot, after which Skarpos appeared and stated that the gun had misfired. The defendant repaired the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>gun, and, gun in hand, Skarpos returned to the victim\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Janice and the victim left the bar and approached the victim\u2019s automobile. As the victim was preparing to open the automobile\u2019s door, Skarpos got out of the automobile and shot and killed him. Skarpos returned to the automobile in which the defendant and Aaron were waiting, and the three drove away together. While en route, Skarpos and the defendant wiped the gun clean and the defendant tossed it through the automobile\u2019s open window.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">Skarpos, pursuant to a plea bargain, pleaded guilty to murder in the second degree and testified against both the defendant and Janice, who were tried separately. Aaron and Hadley testified against the defendant under grants of immunity, and Aaron also testified against Janice. Janice was acquitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">2. <em>Evidence linking the defendant with a prior crime. </em>A .25 caliber handgun was identified by a ballistics expert as the weapon which, in his opinion, had been used to fire the fatal bullets. Raymond Silva, the defendant\u2019s son-in-law, testified that prior to the murder he had seen the same gun in the defendant\u2019s possession. Silva also testified that sometime after the murder the defendant asked him: \u201cIf someone were to file down a firing pin [of a .25 caliber handgun], would they be able to match the shells from one crime to another crime?\u201d Silva added that the defendant \u201cspecifically mentioned the \u2014 Norman Michaud shooting. . . . She said, would it match the shells to the Norman Michaud shooting if they had the shells to this shooting?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">On cross-examination the defendant testified that: (a) she was not the owner of the gun, but (b) had once used the gun, (c) her use of the gun had some relationship to Norman Michaud, and (d) she had asked Silva whether either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>gun, or bullets fired from the gun, could be traced to the Michaud shooting.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">\u201cIn Massachusetts, evidence of other criminal behavior may not be admitted to prove the propensity of the accused to commit the indicted offense . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>412 Mass. 267, 280 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 672 (1981). \u201cHowever, \u2018[r]elevant evidence is not rendered inadmissible merely because it indicates that the defendant may have committed an offense other than that for which [she] is being tried.\u2019. . . [If] the challenged evidence is admissible for a purpose other than impugning the defendant\u2019s character ... [it is] admissible, so long as its probative value is not substantially outweighed by any prejudice. This latter determination is for the judge to make and we shall not disturb it on appeal \u2018except for palpable error.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>408 Mass. 747, 750 (1990), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 462-463 (1981). Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barrett, 418 </em>Mass. 788, 793-794 (1994); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Otsuki, 411 </em>Mass. 218, 236 (1991); P.J. Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence \u00a7 4.4.6, at 155 (6th ed. 1994) (\u201cWhere evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is relevant in establishing motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake or accident, a particular way of doing an act or a particular skill, the evidence may be admitted if its probative value is not substantially outweighed by any prejudice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">The defendant argues that the admission of testimony which referenced the Michaud shooting was error because it was extremely prejudicial and had minimal probative value exclusive of propensity logic. We disagree. Evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior use of the murder weapon and her awareness that it had been used in a prior crime were relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>show the defendant\u2019s control over the weapon and her capacity to plan the murder. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s concern that the weapon could be traced to her through the Michaud shooting evidenced consciousness of guilt. Although the jury may have inferred from the testimony that the defendant had engaged in criminal behavior other than that set forth in the indictment, \u201cwe see no error, let alone palpable error, in the judge\u2019s balancing of the relative probative value and unfair prejudice of the evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fordham, </em>417 Mass. 10, 23 (1994). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daggett, </em>416 Mass. 347, 354 (1993) (in defendant\u2019s trial for murder of a Brockton prostitute, admission of evidence that defendant was arrested for soliciting prostitute ten months prior \u201c[ajlthough the question is a close one\u201d was not an abuse of discretion). We conclude that there was no error, and consequently no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">3. <em>Failure to instruct on consciousness of guilt evidence. </em>The consciousness of guilt evidence in this case included the following: (1) testimony given by Silva and the defendant tending to show that the defendant was afraid that the murder weapon could be traced to her; (2) testimony given by Hadley and the defendant that the defendant told Hadley that \u201cthe cops were on the way, get rid of the jean jacket and the ring\u201d worn by Skarpos on the night of the murder; (3) Aaron\u2019s testimony that two days after the murder the defendant wanted someone to retrieve the weapon from where the defendant tossed it from the automobile; and (4) testimony of the defendant\u2019s daughter Crystal that: (a) after the murder the defendant denied responsibility, but then asked if Crystal \u201cwas going to betray her\u201d; (b) the defendant told Crystal that \u201cthe cops . . . might come to [Crystal], and to be careful,\u201d and (c) the defendant told Crystal, \u201cIf anybody comes around, tell them you [don\u2019t] know anything about [the gun],\u201d and \u201c[t]hat [the gun] was Janice\u2019s and it wasn\u2019t [the defendant\u2019s], to tell the officers that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">It is \u201cwell-established that evidence tending to show consciousness of guilt will not be rendered inadmissible simply because it may reveal to the jury that the defendant commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>ted another offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252, 260 (1993). It is also well established that evidence of consciousness of guilt, standing alone, is insufficient to prove guilt. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Paniaqua, </em>413 Mass. 796, 803 n.7 (1992). When consciousness of guilt evidence is supported by other evidence, whether to instruct the jury regarding the evaluation of the consciousness of guilt evidence, absent a request, \u201cis left to the sound discretion of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Simmons, </em>419 Mass. 426, 436 (1995), overruling <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>416 Mass. 27, 29 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The defendant concedes that the consciousness of guilt evidence against her was supported by other evidence, and that she did not ask the judge to give a consciousness of guilt instruction. Nevertheless, the defendant argues that the judge\u2019s failure, sua sponte, to instruct the jury on consciousness of guilt created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She relies on <em>Cruz, supra </em>at 29, which was overruled in <em>Simmons, supra </em>at 436. In <em>Simmons </em>we held that \u201cit will not be error if [the judge] chooses not to instruct on the subject [of consciousness of guilt evidence] in the absence of a request.\u201d <em>Id. Simmons </em>governs this case. The judge did not err in failing, sua sponte, to instruct the jury on consciousness of guilt evidence. It necessarily follows that the judge\u2019s failure to give such an instruction did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">4. <em>Instructions on credibility. </em>Skarpos testified under an agreement permitting her to plead guilty to murder in the second degree. Aaron testified under a grant of immunity. Hadley testified pursuant to the district attorney\u2019s promise not to prosecute her. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fanelli, </em>412 Mass. 497, 501-502 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benton, </em>356 Mass. 447, 448 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In their closing arguments, both the defense counsel and the prosecutor commented on the detrimental effect which a grant of immunity or a plea bargain may have on the credibility of a witness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The prosecutor, in his closing argument, stated: \u201cSure, you\u2019re entitled to consider what deals have been made with some of the witnesses here, and what their motivation may be when they testify. You certainly have to look through that. There\u2019s no question that when the Commonwealth makes a deal with the witness, for whatever reason, it runs a risk, and you\u2019re entitled to judge their credibility on the basis of that deal. It\u2019s also true sometimes in life, you only play the cards that you\u2019re dealt.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The judge instructed the jury to \u201c[t]hink about the witness\u2019s interest in the outcome of the case. Think about whether the witness had a particular motive or bias which may have influenced or affected in some way what he or she testified about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Defense counsel did not request and the judge did not give cautionary instructions specifically mentioning the credibility of witnesses testifying under a grant of immunity or plea bargain. Nevertheless, the defendant now argues that the judge should have given an instruction sua sponte and that his failure to do so created a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">\u201cThe judge is not required to grant a particular instruction so long as the charge, as a whole, adequately covers the issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Daye, 411 Mass. 719, 739 (1992), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>396 Mass. 306, 316 (1985). In <em>Daye, </em>a witness was granted immunity, police protection, and drug rehabilitation treatment in exchange for truthful testimony. The judge instructed the jury to consider the credibility of all witnesses in light of any possible bias or favoritism for one side over the other, but did not give an instruction (requested by the defendants) that \u201cthe jury should take great care in evaluating the testimony of a witness who has been promised the inducement of non-prosecutian.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738-739. We concluded that the judge\u2019s general instructions were adequate, particularly in light of the fact that \u201cdefense counsel vigorously cross-examined [the witness] and vigorously argued to [the] jury her lack of credibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 740. Accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>415 Mass. 680, 686-687 (1993). We think that the judge\u2019s general charge regarding credibility was adequate, particularly in light of counsels\u2019 discussion of credibility in their closing arguments. Cf. <em>Daye, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The judge did not err in failing to give specific cautionary instructions regarding witnesses testifying under a grant of immunity or plea bargain. See <em>id.; Grenier, supra </em>at 687. Thus, contrary to the defendant\u2019s argument, the judge\u2019s failure to give such an instruction did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">5. <em>General Laws c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree on the basis of deliberate premeditation. The evidence warranted that conclusion. Nevertheless, G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, \u201crequires us ... to determine whether the exercise of our power is required to obtain a result \u2018more consonant with justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabedian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 316 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>380 Mass. 1, 15 n.20 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The defendant contends that two circumstances justify exercise of our \u00a7 33E power. First, the defendant describes in detail how she \u201cis a woman who has been battered by life.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She argues that \u201cher miserable life and years of substance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>abuse\u201d militate against a verdict of murder in the first degree. Second, the defendant observes that according to the Commonwealth\u2019s theory of the case, Janice, Skarpos, and the defendant planned and performed the murder, but only the defendant was convicted of murder in the first degree. Janice was acquitted, and Skarpos was permitted to plead guilty to murder in the second degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">The defendant correctly observes that \u201cin deciding whether to \u2018shade the verdict,\u2019 we are entitled to give weight to the defendant\u2019s character\u201d and background, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>393 Mass. 451, 460 (1984), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 159, cert, denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982), accord <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, </em>373 Mass. 83, 94-95 (1977), and that we have in a few cases indicated that inconsistent verdicts may be relevant to our decision. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vanderpool, </em>367 Mass. 743, 750 (1975). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Champagne, </em>399 Mass. 80, 92 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pisa, </em>372 Mass. 590, 597-598, cert, denied, 434 U.S. 869 (1977). We are not aware of a single case, however, where these were the sole or even the principal factors motivating our exercise of power under \u00a7 33E. A defendant\u2019s background and the existence of inconsistent verdicts, although sometimes noted in cases where we exercised that power, merely reinforced a decision based primarily on other grounds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We consistently have de-</p>\n<p id=\"Agc3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>dined to exerdse our \u00a7 33E power on the basis of those factors alone.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We do not think that the interests of justice here require a departure from our established practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>We have considered the entire case on the law and the evidence, see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, and we conclude that the interests of justice do not require a new trial or entry of a verdict of a lesser degree of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b667-9\">The Michaud shooting is unrelated to the murder at issue here. The defendant was acquitted of shooting Michaud at a prior trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The Michaud shooting was mentioned again in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument: \u201cWhy [did the defendant ask her son-in-law about the gun], and what does it come back to, . . . filing down the firing pin and this Norman Michaud shooting, she\u2019s obviously concerned that the gun is going to be traced from one incident to the other. Why is that?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b670-7\">Specifically, the defendant contends that the judge should have given the instructions set out in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 585 (1982): \u201c(1) that they [the jury] are not to convict a defendant on the basis of evidence of flight or concealment [or the like] alone . . . and (2) that they [the jury] may, but need not, consider such evidence as one of the factors tending to prove the guilt of the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Defense counsel discussed this issue at some length: \u201cAaron comes in and testifies under a grant of immunity. Now, the grant of immunity says, and I believe you will have it with you in the jury room, you can read it, that as long as you tell the truth, nothing you say can be used against you. If you come in and lie, then we could go ahead and prosecute you for perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">\u201cSignificantly, it\u2019s the process that was followed here. . . . Some several days after [the murder] . . . [the victim\u2019s wife] brings Aaron Allen . . . and coached [him] through a story. As Aaron is saying things she\u2019s putting words in his mouth and she\u2019s getting his story down. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">\u201cThis story is then taken up to the Supreme Court and he\u2019s granted immunity. And he comes down and he tell[s] us his story.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">\u201cI suggest to you right from the outset that Aaron Allen is highly motivated to lie. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">\u201cThink again of what we have here. Gina Hadley not being prosecuted, Aaron Allen granted immunity, he cannot be prosecuted at all for anything he said; Debra Skarpos, the person, the shooter, and you heard the report on the autopsy, it was a contact wound, the barrel was right against the forehead, she has agreed to testify in return for being allowed to plead guilty to second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">\u201cI say to you that all of these witnesses are under incredible pressure to deliver, if they don\u2019t, they lose their deal. And I say once again, do not convict [the defendant] on this type of testimony. You have heard them all . . . and you have heard [the defendant] today. I suggest to you that what you heard today from [the defendant] is what occurred.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b671-11\">We noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciampa, </em>406 Mass. 257, 265 (1989), that \u201c[a] prosecutor\u2019s position is a delicate one. The prosecutor must be free to argue that [a witness testifying pursuant to a plea agreement] is credible, but may not explicitly or implicitly vouch to the jury that he or she knows that the witness\u2019s testimony is true.\u201d The prosecutor in this case struck the balance commendably.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Our decision in <em>Ciampa, supra, </em>is not to the contrary. In that case \u201cwe held that the prejudicial admission of certain portions of a written plea agreement between the prosecution and a witness, including repeated references to the witness\u2019s obligation to tell the truth, was not cured by the judge\u2019s charge. <em>Id. </em>at 262-263. The danger ... in <em>Ciampa </em>was that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>jury would believe the witness was telling the truth because his benefiting from the agreement depended on his doing so.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>411 Mass. 719, 739-740 (1992). This case does not present the same question. Unlike the prosecutor in <em>Ciampa, </em>the prosecutor here properly refrained from highlighting the requirement of truthfulness in the plea bargain and immunity agreements. And, unlike <em>Ciampa, </em>the record does not support a claim that there was \u201ca realistic possibility\u201d that the jurors\u2019 knowledge of the agreements caused them to give greater credence to the witnesses\u2019 testimony. See <em>Daye, supra </em>at 740.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b673-13\">Born in 1951, the defendant as a child was beaten by her alcoholic mother and stepfather, and raped and sexually abused by her mother\u2019s alcoholic friends. The defendant became pregnant at age fourteen years and married at age fifteen years. By the time she was twenty years old, she had given birth to five children. She dropped out of school in the seventh grade. At times the defendant has been obese; she has made several suicide attempts, one resulting in a coma and hospitalization. In 1985 the defendant gave birth to twins, one with serious health problems. That same year, the defendant\u2019s brother committed suicide.
