Pursuant to a clause in the agreement, its validity was contingent on Chelsea\u2019s board of aldermen and the Legislature\u2019s approving a home rule petition authorizing the arrangement. Art. 89, \u00a7 1, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. The home rule petition was approved by the Legislature and signed by the Governor into law on June 13, 1989. St. 1989, c. 133 (enabling act).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">On November 23, 1988, the president of the Massachusetts Federation of Teachers, an affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO, and others, commenced an action in the Suffolk Superior Court seeking a preliminary injunction to prevent the implementation of the agreement. On November 29, 1988, a Superior Court judge denied the motion for preliminary injunction as premature. Thereafter, the school committee and the university each moved to dismiss the action pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 12 (b) (6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974). These motions were denied by the judge on February 22, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">On June 13, 1989, the day the Governor signed the enabling act into law, fifty-one Hispanic residents of Chelsea filed an action in this court, pursuant to the court\u2019s original jurisdiction. G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 2 (1994 ed.). G. L. c. 40, \u00a7 53 (1994 ed.). A single justice transferred the action to the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>perior Court, where, on April 2, 1992, it was consolidated with the earlier action. G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 4A (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Thereafter, the school committee moved to dismiss and was joined by the university. The university moved for summary judgment and was joined by the school committee. The plaintiffs filed a joint cross motion for summary judgment. On July 27, 1994, another Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss as to some of the claims and allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all claims except for the \u201cas-applied\u201d unconstitutional delegation claim of the plaintiffs in the original complaint. This claim was reserved for trial. On motion of the joint plaintiffs, the judge thereafter reported both cases to the Appeals Court pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111 (1994 ed.), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The enabling act authorizes the school committee to enter into an agreement with the university whereby the university would manage the Chelsea public school system for a period not exceeding ten years.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Section 2 of the enabling act explains the purpose of the act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute \u201cdeclared and determined\u201d that the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>school system in Chelsea \u201ccurrently offers unacceptably low levels of educational opportunity,\u201d and the university is \u201cuniquely qualified to help the school committee make significant improvements in the educational opportunities offered\u201d in the Chelsea public schools. The university had originally been working with the school committee as a consultant and had provided the school committee with a detailed report on the schools in May of 1988, which included practical suggestions on how to improve the system. The implementation of the agreement between the school committee and the university was determined by the enabling act to be in the best interests of Chelsea, its inhabitants, its school system, and its students.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The enabling act makes special provisions for the university and the school committee regarding open meetings, public records, and audits, explicitly overriding other General Laws or any special law traditionally governing public schools.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 5 of the enabling act provides that the Inspector General shall continue to audit all public funds used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>to operate the Chelsea public schools.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 6 of the enabling act requires that all final decisions of the university be made in an open meeting if the school committee would have been required to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Section 7 of the enabling act allows school employees and their union access to the university\u2019s internal memoranda if used in connection with a tenure decision or suspension, promotion, demotion, or dismissal of an employee.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>The university is obligated by the agreement to make timely reports to the school committee, and the school committee has the right to review: educational policies; the annual budget; collective bargaining agreements; and the appointment of certain employees. The school committee also retains the right to override the university on these issues with a two-thirds vote. Most significantly, the school committee retains the power, by majority vote, to terminate the agreement with the university at any time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Many issues raised in the complaint were not raised on appeal and are therefore waived.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). The primary issue before us concerns the constitutionality of the enabling act and agreement under art. 103, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> An additional issue is whether the judge erred when he reserved the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cas-applied\u201d nondelegation claim for trial. We agree with the judge that the enabling act does not violate the anti-aid amendment and that the \u201cas-applied\u201d claim was properly held for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Article 46, \u00a7 2, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution, as it was rewritten in 1974 by art. 103 of the Amendments, provides in pertinent part: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>or public agents authorized by the Commonwealth <em>99</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u201cNo grant, appropriation or use of public money or property or loan of credit shall be made or authorized by the Commonwealth ... for the purpose of founding, maintaining or aiding any . . . primary or secondary school . . . which is not publicly owned and under the exclusive control, order and supervision of public officers</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>Constitutional analysis begins with a presumption of statutory validity. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Springfield, </em>382 Mass. 665, 674 (1981). The party attacking the legislation bears the heavy burden of proving the absence of any conceivable basis on which the statute may be supported. See, e.g., <em>id. </em>at 675, citing <em>Jewel Cos. </em>v. <em>Burlington, </em>365 Mass. 274, 277-278 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">The plaintiffs contend that the enabling act and agreement run afoul of the provisions of the anti-aid amendment set out above. There is no question that the schools in Chelsea are \u201cpublicly owned,\u201d and the plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. See G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 37 (1994 ed.). It is just as clear that the members of the school committee of Chelsea are public officers. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>309 Mass. 106, 108 (1941). Thus, if under the enabling act and the agreement the university is a public agent authorized by the Commonwealth, the agreement does not offend the anti-aid amendment because the schools are publicly owned and under the control of either public officers or public agents authorized by the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">1. <em>The university as public agent. </em>The principal focus of the motion judge\u2019s decision and of the defendants\u2019 arguments in support of it is on the status of the university as a public agent. There is nothing in the concept of public agent that precludes a private university from performing as an agent of the public. If it does so in this case, then the school system is under the control, order, and supervision of public officers or public agents authorized by the Commonwealth. The anti-aid amendment\u2019s purpose is served if the required control, order, and supervision are shared jointly but exclusively by public officers and public agents. The crucial question is, therefore, whether the university is acting as the agent of a public entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">There are few opinions that deal with the meaning of the words \u201cpublic agent.\u201d There are two, however, relied on by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>the plaintiffs, that deserve discussion. In <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>103 Mass. 94 (1869), the court dealt with art. 18 of the Amendments to the Constitution of the Commonwealth in its original form, and not as approved by the voters in 1917, 1972, and 1974. The original amendment required that any school for which public funds were to be expended had to be under the order and superintendence of the municipal authorities. The court held that a school under the direction of independent trustees was not under the control of municipal authorities and that public funds could not be used to support the school. <em>Id. </em>at 102. In the <em>Jenkins </em>case, there was none of the incidents of control and supervision that the school committee has pursuant to the enabling statute and pursuant to the agreement between it and the university. For the purposes of determining the right to control, and hence agency, the absence of such incidents in the <em>Jenkins </em>case and their presence in the case now before the court are crucial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Plunkett, 21A </em>Mass. 453 (1931), in dictum, the court considered the provisions of art. 18, superseded by art. 45 of the Amendments to the Constitution in 1917, and then specifically discussed the status of trustees of a publicly-owned hospital maintained by the town of Adams pursuant to a gift accepted by the town. The trustees had \u201cexclusive control, order and superintendence\u201d of the hospital subject to the terms of the gift and general public law. The court said \u201cthese trustees constitute \u2018public officers or public agents.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465. The court considered that the trustees were administering a public trust, performing public duties for definite purposes solely for the benefit of the public. <em>Id. </em>at 462. The <em>Adams </em>opinion concluded that town funds could be expended, without violating the anti-aid amendment, for an institution not under the supervision of any town official or agent (other than the trustees themselves) whose administrators were governed by the terms of a gift and by duties imposed by law. That holding certainly provides the plaintiffs before us no assistance and suggests that, where by law, statutory or otherwise, an entity is regulated as to its perform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>anee of some public obligation, the entity can be a public official or public agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">The extensive supervisory controls that the school committee has over the university\u2019s performance of the city\u2019s educational obligations represents that kind of control, or more precisely right to control, that is an essential part of an agency relationship. Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 (1958). The university\u2019s agency is a public one because the university as an agent is fulfilling a public obligation, i.e., education of the youth of the city, <em>McDuffy </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Executive Office of Educ., </em>415 Mass. 545, 620-621 (1993), while subject to the control of a public entity as a principal, all pursuant both to its legislatively authorized contract and to the enabling act. The university is, therefore, a public agent for the purposes of the anti-aid amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">2. <em>Delegation. </em>The plaintiffs argue that the school committee has unconstitutionally delegated its powers to a private entity. What we have said in the preceding section of this opinion disposes of this argument. The university is a public agent authorized by the Commonwealth to perform under the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">3. <em>\u201cAs </em>applied\u201d <em>claims. </em>The plaintiffs claim that it was error for the judge to reserve for trial the \u201cas applied\u201d claims of the plaintiffs in the original action. In support of this argument on appeal the plaintiffs rely primarily on the affidavit of a former member of the school committee who last served in December, 1991. The affidavit contains a recitation of her experiences while serving on the committee and her opinion on the efficacy of the controls over the conduct of the university. Even if we take the allegations of this affidavit as true for summary judgment purposes, it does not establish that the control of the school committee is illusory or that it has abdicated its responsibility under the enabling act and agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 standing to claim that the university is not supplying adequate reports pursuant to the agreement is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The judge correctly reserved the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cas-applied\u201d claims for trial. The affidavits presented do not support any legal theory on which summary judgment could be based.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">We conclude that the school committee has retained control of the Chelsea public schools, directly or through the university, which is a public agent authorized by the Commonwealth. The arrangement between the school committee and the university does not offend the anti-aid amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Section 2 of the enabling act provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\">\u201cIt is hereby declared and determined: that providing the best possible education to students in the public schools of the city of Chelsea and to the inhabitants of said city is the essential public purpose of the school committee; that the school system in said city currently offers unacceptably low levels of educational opportunity, as reflected by the poor performance of students on standardized tests, by the unacceptably high dropout rate of students and by the prevalence of functional illiteracy and academically and vocationally unprepared students in said city; that it is in the best interests of said city and its inhabitants to create new and expand existing educational opportunities in the school system so as to improve the academic performance of the students and to increase the general level of education among the inhabitants of said city; that the creation and expansion of educational opportunities within said school system would be significantly improved with the assistance of and under the direction of experts; that the university employs talented faculty and administrators who are experts in matters of educational policy and management, has particular knowledge of said school system gained by conducting a comprehensive study of said school system, has proven its ability, in a detailed report to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the school committee, to identify the problems faced by said school system and to make specific and practical recommendations for capitalizing on the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of said school system so that it may solve those problems, and thus is uniquely qualified to help the school committee make significant improvements in the educational opportunities offered by said school system and in the academic performance of students within said system . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Section 3 of the enabling act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">\u201cNotwithstanding any provision of any general or special law to the contrary, including without limitation the provisions of chapter seventy-one of the General Laws, and notwithstanding any provision of the city\u2019s charter to the contrary, the school committee is hereby authorized to enter into an agreement with the university, which may be subject to amendment by the parties from time to time and which shall be subject to termination by the school committee upon reasonable notice, under which (i) the school committee shall delegate to the university some or all of its legal duties, powers and functions, on such terms and subject to such conditions, controls, standards and procedures as the school committee may determine to be appropriate to ensure that the public purposes of the agreement and this act are carried out, and (ii) the university shall act for, on behalf of and in the name and stead of the school committee, in the manner set forth in such agreement, in exercising the duties, powers and functions which are so delegated.
