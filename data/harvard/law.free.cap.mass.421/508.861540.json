L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>(1994 ed.), for failure to file annual reports for two consecutive years. The plaintiff, who is proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> began this action by filing a complaint in the Superior Court on behalf of two such corporations: NatureQuest Corporation and NatureQuest Publications, Inc. (corporations).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The plaintiff requested that the corporations be restored to their status prior to the dissolution or revocation and requested a waiver of the fees associated with their revival. Shortly after filing this complaint, the plaintiff moved for an interlocutory injunction barring the Secretary from dissolving any other existing nonprofit organization and also moved for appointment of a special investigator to expose an alleged scheme by the Secretary capable of \u201ccircumventing our existing laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">At that time, the plaintiff also sought to amend his complaint by asking the court to: (1) nullify the \u201cdissolution\u201d of his two corporations and \u201cadvise\u201d the Secretary to eliminate all references to the \u201cdissolution\u201d in the official records; (2) advise the Secretary that he cannot issue a \u201cNotice of Dissolution,\u201d and should issue a \u201cNotice for Revocation of Charters\u201d; (3) award $250,000 per corporation for each year of alleged \u201cdissolution\u201d; (4) award punitive damages; and (5) require a public apology from the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">A Superior Court judge, acting on the Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, granted summary judgment to the plaintiff on his claim that the Secretary improperly \u201cdissolved\u201d the corporations, but allowed the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to plaintiff\u2019s request for waiver of the fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Subsequently, the plaintiff filed an \u201cemergency motion for a closed hearing\u201d regarding complaints he had against an assistant clerk of the court. This motion was denied, as were several other of the plaintiff\u2019s remaining motions. The plaintiff apparently appeals from the denial of his motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>amend his claim for damages and the denial of his motion for an emergency hearing regarding the assistant clerk. The Secretary appeals from the judge\u2019s granting of summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff on his claim that the Secretary had improperly \u201cdissolved\u201d the two corporations. We transferred the case here on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The following facts are from the judge\u2019s memorandum of decision and the affidavits of the parties, part of the summary judgment record. The plaintiff is the president of two corporations, which were identified by the Secretary as having failed to file an annual report for the years 1983 and 1984. The corporations were sent notices of dissolution in May, 1986, informing them of their failure to file such annual reports, as required by G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A, for those years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The corporations had filed annual reports, but had failed to include the filing fee, so they were returned as unacceptable. At that time the corporations had requested a waiver of the filing fees; however, there is no provision in the statute for waiving the fees, so the request was properly denied. The Secretary revoked the charters of the corporations on November 17, 1986, pursuant to G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">On August 2, 1993, the plaintiff, on inquiry in person at the Secretary\u2019s office, learned that his corporations had been dissolved. He subsequently received a certificate which refers to dissolution pursuant to G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 101 (1994 ed.), the statute by which the Secretary dissolves a business corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>ration. The Secretary maintains that this certificate was issued in error; the issuing clerk incorrectly read the computer record; and that the certificate should have referred to G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss should have been allowed, although not for the reason relied on by the Secretary. In <em>Varney Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>WMF, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 79, 79 (1988), we held that, \u201cexcept for small claim matters, a corporation may not be represented in judicial proceedings by a corporate officer who is not an attorney licensed to practice law in the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Corporations, including nonprofit corporations, are artificial persons. See <em>Mills </em>v. <em>W.T. Grant Co., </em>233 Mass. 140, 145 (1919). Corporations that have been dissolved or have had their charters revoked are allowed three years to close out their affairs under G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 102 (1994 ed.), pursuant to the cross-references in G. L. c. 180, \u2019 \u00a7 10C. Thus, the plaintiff, as an officer of the corporations who is not an attorney, may not represent the interests of the corporations in a legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Even if the question were properly before us, we would hold that the Secretary did not improperly \u201cdissolve\u201d the nonprofit corporations under G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 50A (1994 ed.), but rather that the charters were appropriately \u201crevoked\u201d under G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A (4). The use of the term \u201cdissolution\u201d instead of \u201crevocation\u201d on the notification form is a distinction without a difference. The Secretary fulfilled the statutory requirements of G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A, for revocation of a corporation\u2019s charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Under G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 50A, only this court can dissolve a nonprofit corporation; however, the Secretary has the authority to dissolve business corporations and to revoke the charter of nonprofit corporations. See G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 101 (conditions for dissolution by Secretary of certain business corporations); G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A (4) (conditions for revocation of charter by Secretary of certain charitable corporations). Although the notifications were entitled \u201cNotice of Dissolution\u201d and threatened that the corporations would be <em>dissolved </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ninety days, the notices also cited the correct statute, G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A, and correctly stated that the corporate charter would be revoked. See note 2, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The use of the term \u201cdissolution\u201d to refer to the termination of a corporate existence has been used historically to refer both to the revocation of a charter under G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A, as well as the dissolution of a corporation under G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 101. See <em>Franklin Fair Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Secretary of the Commonwealth, </em>347 Mass. 110, 117 (1964). In <em>Franklin Fair Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 118, this court upheld the \u201cdissolution\u201d of a nonprofit corporation because of its failure to file its annual reports under G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">There is no practical distinction between the revocation of a nonprofit corporation\u2019s charter under G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A, and dissolution of a business corporation under G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 101. In both cases, the corporation must cease conducting business, although it may \u201cwind up\u201d its affairs pursuant to G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 102, may be put into receivership under G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 104 (1994 ed.), or may be revived under G. L. c, 156B, \u00a7 108 (1994 ed.).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">It is undisputed that there was sufficient cause to revoke the charters of the corporations since they did not file acceptable annual reports for two consecutive years. The plaintiff argues that he never received the notice of dissolution sent to him in 1986. The statute requires that notice of default be given by \u201cmail, postage prepaid, to such corporation in default.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> G. L. c. 180, \u00a7 26A (4). Furthermore, the affidavit that the notices were mailed is undisputed. The plaintiff avers only that he was unable to find anyone with personal knowledge that they were mailed and that <em>he </em>did not receive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>the notice. Neither averment contests the Secretary\u2019s affidavit. The statute does not require proof of receipt. <em>Id. </em>The Secretary complied with the statute, so the revocation is valid.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>The plaintiff\u2019s motions. </em>Since the motion to dismiss should have been allowed, it is unnecessary for us to discuss the plaintiffs appeal from the denial of his collateral motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">We therefore vacate summary judgment and remand the case to the Superior Court for entry of judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Pro se plaintiffs are bound by the same rules and requirements as one represented by counsel. <em>Mmoe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>393 Mass. 617, 620 (1985), and cases cited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The notice provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-8\">\u201cUnder the provisions of Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 180, section 26A, failure to file the annual reports for two consecutive years is sufficient cause for the revocation of the corporate charter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-9\">\u201cYou are hereby notified that the ABOVE-NAMED CORPORATION WILL BE DISSOLVED ninety days from the date of this notice, as provided by M.G.L. c. 180, s. 26A, para. 4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">\u201cIn order to avoid dissolution, the corporation must file the above delinquent annual reports together with the filing fee of $10.00 for each annual report. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b528-11\">The records for each corporation indicated a \u201cdissolution date\u201d of November 17, 1986, and a \u201cdis[solution] type\u201d of \u201cI\u201d (for involuntary). According to the Secretary, these records have since been changed now to indicate a \u201crevocation date\u201d and \u201crevocation type,\u201d respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">The nonprofit corporations invoke the normal business dissolution provision pursuant to the cross-reference in G.

Failure of such corporation to submit the required certificates within ninety days after the notice of default has been given shall be sufficient cause for the revocation of its charter by the state secretary.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The summary judgment decision relied in part on an uncontested affidavit from legal counsel for the Secretary that the notifications were mailed.
