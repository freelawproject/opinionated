L. c. 231A (1994 ed.), that it was not obligated to pay underinsured motorist benefits to the defendant, Eric Pascar. A judge in the Superior Court considered the case on cross motions for summary judgment, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (a) and (b), 365 Mass. 824 (1974), based on a statement of agreed facts and exhibits. The judge denied Hanover\u2019s motion and allowed Pascar\u2019s motion. In so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ruling, the judge rejected Hanover\u2019s position that the under-insurance coverage of its policy was not triggered because the limits of that coverage did not exceed the sum of the per person bodily injury liability limits of the policies of the two other responsible tortfeasors. Hanover appealed from the judgment which declared that Pascar could pursue his claim for underinsured motorist benefits against Hanover. We granted Hanover\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We now vacate the judgment and direct the entry of a judgment favoring Hanover.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The statement of agreed facts and exhibits indicate as follows. On October 4, 1991, Pascar was a passenger in an automobile driven by Joseph Cannon when the automobile was involved in a multi-vehicle accident. It was agreed that Cannon, and the driver of a second vehicle, Philip Miceli, were responsible, as joint tortfeasors, for Pascar\u2019s injuries. Both Cannon and Miceli carried liability insurance on their vehicles which provided bodily injury coverage in the amount of $15,000 per person and $30,000 per accident. Hanover insured Pascar\u2019s mother in a policy which provided underinsured motorist coverage of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Pascar settled his claims against Cannon and Miceli for $8,000 ($4,000 was paid by each tortfeasor\u2019s insurer).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Pas-car then made a claim against Hanover for underinsurance benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pascar maintained that, under G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>(2), as amended by St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 46, set forth below,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the provisions of Part 12 of the fifth edition standard motor vehicle liability insurance policy, also set forth below,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Hanover\u2019s underinsurance coverage was triggered because the limit of each single tortfeasor\u2019s liability coverage ($15,000 per person) was less than the limit of underinsurance coverage in Hanover\u2019s policy ($25,000). Hanover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>maintained that, under the statute and the policy language, reasonably interpreted, particularly in light of the provisions of Part 12 of the sixth edition standard motor vehicle liability policy set forth below<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (which became effective on January 1, 1993, after the accident in this case), underinsurance benefits were not available because the combined per person limits of the two tortfeasors\u2019 coverages ($30,000) exceeded Hanover\u2019s limit on underinsurance coverage ($25,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We agree with Hanover\u2019s position. The applicable statute, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), as amended by St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 46, see note 4, <em>supra, </em>does not precisely deal with the question whether a claim may be made against underinsurance coverage when the accident involves multiple joint tortfeasors with combined coverages in excess of the underinsurance limit. The pertinent language in Part 12 of the fifth edition standard motor vehicle liability insurance policy on underinsurance, see note 5, <em>supra, </em>also does not completely address the issue. We are obliged, however, to deal with any imprecision in the statutory scheme by giving G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), as amended, a reasonable construction, see <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>371 Mass. 186, 190 (1976), which promotes the remedial purposes of the legislation describing the trigger for underinsurance coverage. See <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>393 Mass. 574, 577 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The underinsurance legislation and the component statutory provision we are concerned with are remedial in nature and expressly intended to restructure the automobile liability insurance system in a way which lowers rates to the consum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>ing public while continuing to provide reduced, but effective, levels of coverage. See St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 1; <em>Massachusetts Auto Body Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>409 Mass. 770, 772 (1991). The legislation seeks to limit significantly claims on underinsurance coverage by establishing a trigger to coverage which did not previously exist. The Legislature contemplated an over-all provision reduction rate of 2% from the adoption of the trigger alone. See St. 1988, c. 273, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Thus, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2), as amended, speaks in terms of underinsurance coverage being available \u201conly to the extent that the [underinsured] motor vehicle coverage limits exceed . . . limits of bodily injury liability [coverage] . . . .\u201d This language expresses a legislative intent that underinsured motorist benefits are not available if the limits of that coverage are less than the bodily injury coverage available to the injured party from the primary liability policies which insured the joint tortfeasors in this case. This intention would be defeated by the construction suggested by Pascar.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">We also think the commissioner\u2019s clarification of the issue in the revised language in Part 12 of the sixth edition of the standard motor vehicle liability insurance policy is consistent with his power to express the scope of insurance coverage when statutory purpose is apparent, but a technical application of the statute exposes a gap or previously unconsidered point. The commissioner\u2019s action in resolving the problem supports the conclusion we have reached based on the intent expressed in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (2). See <em>Cleary </em>v. <em>Cardullo\u2019s, Inc., </em>347 Mass. 337, 344 (1964) (under ambiguous statute, details of legislative policy not spelled out in statute may appropriately be determined by agency charged with administration of statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">We note as well that cases from other jurisdictions which have considered this issue (and which also have construed an insurance policy or a statute written in the singular) have concluded that the sum of the personal injury liability limits of separate policies insuring joint tortfeasors should be considered for the purpose of deciding whether underinsured coverage will be available to an injured insured. See <em>Allstate </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number><em>Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hilbun, </em>703 F. Supp. 533, 536-538 (S.D. Miss. 1988) (applying Mississippi law); <em>Pinto </em>v. <em>Garretson, </em>237 N.J. Super. 444, 450-451 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">The judgment is vacated. A new judgment is to enter declaring that the plaintiff, Hanover Insurance Company, has no obligation to furnish \u201cunderinsured motorist benefits\u201d to the defendant, Eric Pascar.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Hanover agreed, solely for purposes of the summary judgment motions, that Pascar was a member of his mother\u2019s household and that he was eligible on this basis to make a claim for underinsurance benefits on Hanover\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Each of these insurers paid the full $30,000 per accident limit of its policy which was divided among all the claimants who were injured in the multi-vehicle accident giving rise to Pascar\u2019s claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The record is silent on the extent of the damages sustained by Pascar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\">This statute, which describes underinsured motor vehicle coverage as an aspect of uninsured motor vehicle coverage, reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-8\">\u201cFor the purpose of said coverage, if the policyholder or obligor elects to purchase the coverage described in this paragraph, the term \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d shall also include protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of insured motor vehicles, trailer or semitrailers, to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applied at the time of the accident and its bodily injury liability bond amount or policy limit is less than the policy limit for uninsured motor vehicle coverage and is insufficient to satisfy the damages of persons insured thereunder and only to the extent that the uninsured motor vehicle coverage limits exceed said limits of bodily injury liability subject to the terms of the policy . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b462-10\"> \u201cSometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is underinsured.
