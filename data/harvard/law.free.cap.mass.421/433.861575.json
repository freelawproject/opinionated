L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (/) (2) (1994 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Commonwealth charged Leduc with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor (OUI) in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1) (1994 ed.). Leduc moved to dismiss the OUI complaint, asserting that to prosecute him on that complaint would violate the prohibition against multiple punishments contained in the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and the common and statutory law of this Commonwealth. The judge denied Leduc\u2019s motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1994 ed.), Leduc correctly sought relief from a single justice of this court. See, e.g., <em>Kater </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>17, 19 (1995); <em>Cramer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>419 Mass. 106, 107 n.l (1994); <em>Koonce </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>412 Mass. 71, 72 (1992). See also S.J.C. Rule 2:21, <em>post </em>1303 (1995) (effective Nov. 15, 1995). The single justice denied relief. Leduc appeals. We affirm the judgment of the single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">I. <em>Facts. </em>On July 2, 1994, at approximately 1 a.m., Trooper K.E. Reine of the Massachusetts State police observed Leduc\u2019s vehicle weaving in marked lanes. Trooper Reine stopped the vehicle and, after detecting the odor of alcohol on Leduc\u2019s breath, asked him to perform a variety of field sobriety tests. She concluded that Leduc was under the influence of alcohol, arrested him, and transported him to the State police barracks in Andover, where Leduc took a breathalyzer test and registered blood alcohol levels of 0.14% and 0.12%. His license was seized and suspended pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (f) (2). On July 5, 1994, he was arraigned and charged with OUI. If convicted, Leduc could be punished by fine and imprisonment. See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>II. <em>Double jeopardy. Luk </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, ante </em>415 (1995), involved an administrative license suspension (ALS) for refusing to submit to the breathalyzer test required by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (/) (1) (1994 ed.). The instant case involves an ALS for taking and failing a breathalyzer test under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (/) (2). In <em>Luk </em>we discussed in detail the multiple punishment component of the double jeopardy clause as developed in <em>Department of Revenue of Mont. </em>v. <em>Kurth Ranch, </em>114 S. Ct. 1937 (1994), and <em>United States </em>v. <em>Halper, </em>490 U.S. 435 (1989). See <em>Luk, supra. </em>Leduc\u2019s double jeopardy claim fails because, as in <em>Luk, </em>the suspension of his driver\u2019s license is not punishment for double jeopardy purposes. We hold that, as in <em>Luk, </em>the \u201ccharacter of the actual sanction [ ] imposed ... by the machinery of the state\u201d is remedial. <em>Halper, supra </em>at 447. See <em>Kurth Ranch, supra </em>at 1946-1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The historical aim of licensure generally is preservation of public health, safety, and welfare by extending the public trust only to those with proven qualifications. See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 527-528 (1979). Moreover, statutes making continued licensure dependent on continued eligibility for the public trust are historically nonpunitive. See, e.g., G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 87L (1994 ed.) (barber\u2019s certificate of registration may be suspended \u201cfor failure to comply with sanitary rules or regulations ... or for having imparted any contagious or infectious disease\u201d); <em>Feldstein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Medicine, </em>387 Mass. 339, 341-342 (1982) (revocation of license to practice medicine nonpunitive); <em>Saxon Coffee Shop, Inc. </em>v. <em>Boston Licensing Bd., </em>380 Mass. 919, 928 (1980) (common victualler\u2019s license revocable for failure to operate eating establishment in manner consistent with public health and safety).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">We acknowledge that the threat of ALS acts as a deterrent. We also acknowledge that ALS constitutes an affirmative disability or restraint, and that probable cause to believe that the licensee was engaged in criminal behavior is a prerequisite to ALS. But we think it significant that these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>punitive attributes of \u00a7 24 (1) (/) (2) are found in most licensing statutes. See <em>Kurth Ranch, supra </em>at 1947, 1948. The licenses of pharmacists, opticians, land surveyors, television technicians, electricians, cosmetologists, barbers, and embalmers (among others) can be suspended for violation of the laws of the Commonwealth relating to their occupations. See G. L. c. 13, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 22, 29, 32, 39, 42, 45, 48, 61 (1994 ed.); G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 61 (1994 ed.). Suspension in those cases is similarly an affirmative disability or restraint, as well as a deterrent to and consequence of criminal behavior. But such license suspensions serve not to punish but to \u201cprotect the public health, welfare, and safety\u201d by cancelling the authority of an individual to engage in a specified activity. <em>Levy, supra </em>at 527. ALS under \u00a7 24 (1) (/) (2) is similarly nonpunitive.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Luk, supra </em>at 426-427.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Our conclusion is supported by consideration of the statute\u2019s nonpunitive purpose: prompt removal of drunk drivers from the highways. \u201cA person charged with drunken driving who turns up with a substantiated blood alcohol content of .10 percent or more must be thought of as a menace to public safety, and it makes sense to relieve him of his license for a period of time by swift administrative action.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Callen, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 920, 922 (1988) (re-script). We do not think a suspension until trial (or for a period not to exceed ninety days) is excessive in relation to this remedial purpose. See note 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Furthermore, we believe that \u00a7 24 (1) (/) (2) is not a retributive statute because it is aimed at public safety rather than \u201cpunishment for the sake of justice.\u201d J. Hospers, Punishment, Protection, and Retaliation, Justice and Punishment 21, 22 (J.B. Cederblom &amp; W.L. Blizek, eds. 1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">Drawing the line between punitive and nonpunitive civil sanctions \u201cinevitably involves an element of rough justice.\u201d <em>Halper, supra </em>at 449. The court\u2019s judgment can amount to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>no more than an approximation which protects the defendant from a civil sanction clearly disproportionate to its remedial ends. See <em>Kurth Ranch, supra </em>at 1946; <em>Halper, supra </em>at 450. The judgment of the single justice is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-14\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (/) (2) (1994 ed.), provides, in pertinent part: \u201cIf a person\u2019s blood alcohol percentage is not less than eight one-hundredths . . . [the] police officer shall . . . immediately and on behalf of the registrar [of motor vehicles] take custody of such person\u2019s driver\u2019s license ....

But whether a sanction constitutes punishment for double jeopardy purposes is not determined from the defendant\u2019s perspective. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
