Petitioner Mississippi sued respondent liquid crystal display (LCD) manufacturers in state court, alleging violations of state law and seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   restitution for LCD purchases made by itself and its citizens. Respondents sought to remove the case to federal court. The District Court held that the suit qualified as a mass action under \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i), but remanded the suit to state court on the ground that it fell within CAFA's \"general public\" exception, \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(III). The Fifth Circuit reversed, agreeing with the District Court that the suit was a mass action but finding the general public exception inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   : Because Mississippi is the only named plaintiff, this suit does not constitute a mass action under CAFA. Pp. 741 - 746.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   (a) Contrary to respondents' argument, CAFA's \"100 or more persons\" phrase does not encompass unnamed persons who are real parties in interest to claims brought by named plaintiffs. Congress knew how to draft language to that effect when it intended such a meaning, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1332(d)(5)(B), 1332(d)(1)(D). That it did not do so in the mass action provision indicates that Congress did not want the provision's numerosity requirement to be satisfied by counting unnamed individuals who possess an interest in the suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Respondents' understanding also cannot be reconciled with the fact that the \"100 or more persons\" are not unspecified individuals with no participation in the suit but are the \"plaintiffs\" subsequently referred to in the provision,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   the very parties proposing to join their claims in a single trial. This is evident in two key ways. First, CAFA uses \"persons\" and \"plaintiffs\" the same way they are used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, which refers to \"persons\" as individuals who are proposing to join as \"plaintiffs\" in a single action. Second, it is difficult to imagine how the \"claims of 100 or more\" unnamed individuals could be \"proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the ... claims\" of some completely different group of named plaintiffs \"involve common questions of law or fact.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Construing \"plaintiffs\" to include both named and unnamed real parties in interest would stretch the meaning of \"plaintiff\" beyond recognition. A \"plaintiff\" is commonly understood to be a party who brings a civil suit in a court of law, not anyone, named or unnamed, whom a suit may benefit. Moreover, respondents' definition would also have to apply to the mass action provision's subsequent reference to \"plaintiffs\" in the phrase \"jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims [exceed $75,000],\" \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i). See\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Gardner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332238\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/115/#p118\">\n    513 U.S. 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332238,6467327\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/552/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332238\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/115/#p118\">\n    130 L.Ed.2d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This would result in an administrative nightmare that Congress could not possibly have intended, see\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. Oceanic Contractors, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    458 U.S. 564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 575,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636708\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/564/#p575\">\n    73 L.Ed.2d 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , where district courts would have to identify hundreds (or in this case, hundreds of thousands) of unnamed parties whose claims are for less than $75,000 and then decide how to dispose of their claims. Pp. 741 - 744.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (b) Statutory context reinforces this Court's reading of the mass action provision. CAFA provides that once removal occurs, a case shall not be transferred to another court \"unless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request transfer.\" \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(C)(i). If \"plaintiffs\" included unnamed parties, it would be surpassingly difficult for a court to poll the enormous number of real parties in interest to decide whether an action may be transferred. Moreover, respondents' position that the action here should be removed because it is similar to a class action fails to recognize that the mass action provision functions largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA's relaxed class action jurisdictional rules cannot be evaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather than using the class device. Had Congress wanted CAFA to authorize removal of representative actions brought by States as sole plaintiffs on respondents' theory, it would have done so through the class action provision, not the mass action provision. Pp. 744 - 745.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   (c) This Court has interpreted the diversity jurisdiction statute to require courts in certain contexts to look behind the pleadings to ensure that parties are not improperly creating or destroying diversity jurisdiction, see,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wecker v. National Enameling &amp; Stamping Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8291160\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/204/176/#p185\">\n    204 U.S. 176\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185-186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8291160\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/204/176/#p185\">\n    27 S.Ct. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8291160\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/204/176/#p185\">\n    51 L.Ed. 430\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but Congress did not intend this background inquiry to apply to the mass action provision. First, it could make sense to incorporate the background inquiry into the mass action provision if the inquiry had previously been applied in a similar manner. That is not the case here, however, and so any presumption that Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it exists at all, would be comparatively weak. Second, even if the background principle had previously been applied in this manner, Congress expressly indicated that it did not want the principle to apply to the mass action provision both through the textual indicators described above and by prohibiting defendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in order to turn it into a mass action, \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II). Requiring district courts to identify unnamed persons interested in the suit would run afoul of that intent.

CAFA defines a \"mass action\" as \"any civil action ... in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(11)(B)(i). The question presented is whether a suit filed by a State as the sole plaintiff constitutes a \"mass action\" under CAFA where it includes a claim for restitution based on injuries suffered by the State's citizens. We hold that it does not. According to CAFA's plain text, a \"mass action\" must involve monetary claims brought by 100 or more persons who propose to try those claims jointly as named plaintiffs. Because the State of Mississippi is the only named plaintiff in the instant action, the case must be remanded to state court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Congress enacted CAFA in order to \"amend the procedures that apply to consideration of interstate class actions.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%204\">\n     119 Stat. 4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In doing so, Congress recognized that \"[c]lass action lawsuits are an important and valuable part of the legal system.\" CAFA \u00a7 2. It was concerned, however, that certain requirements of federal diversity jurisdiction,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , had functioned to \"kee[p] cases of national importance\" in state courts rather than federal courts. CAFA \u00a7 2.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    CAFA accordingly loosened the requirements for diversity jurisdiction for two types of cases-\"class actions\" and \"mass actions.\" The Act defines \"class action\" to mean \"any civil action filed under rule 23\n    of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or similar State statute or rule of judicial procedure.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(1)(B). And it defines \"mass action\" to mean \"any civil action ... in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact.\" \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    For class and mass actions, CAFA expanded diversity jurisdiction in two key ways. First, it replaced the ordinary requirement of complete diversity of citizenship among all plaintiffs and defendants, see\n    <em>\n     State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Tashire,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177327\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/523/#p530\">\n     386 U.S. 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 530-531,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177327\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/523/#p530\">\n     87 S.Ct. 1199\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177327\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/386/523/#p530\">\n     18 L.Ed.2d 270\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1967), with a requirement of minimal diversity. Under that requirement, a federal court may exercise jurisdiction over a class action if \"any member of a class of plaintiffs is a citizen of a State different from any defendant.\" \u00a7 1332(d)(2)(A). The same rule applies to mass actions. See \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(A) (\"[A] mass action shall be deemed ... removable under [\u00a7\u00a7 1332(d)(2) through (d)(10) ]\"). Second, whereas \u00a7 1332(a) ordinarily requires each plaintiff's claim to exceed the sum or value of $75,000, see\n    <em>\n     Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Services, Inc.,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209559\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/546/#p554\">\n     545 U.S. 546\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 554-555,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209559\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/546/#p554\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2611\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209559\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/546/#p554\">\n     162 L.Ed.2d 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005), CAFA grants federal jurisdiction over class and mass actions in which the aggregate amount in controversy exceeds $5 million. \u00a7\u00a7 1332(d)(2), (d)(6), (d)(11)(A). Class and mass actions filed in state court that satisfy CAFA's requirements may be removed to federal court,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201453\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1453\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , but federal jurisdiction in a mass action, unlike a class action, \"shall exist only over those plaintiffs\" whose claims individually satisfy the $75,000 amount in controversy requirement, \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n      1\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Respondents manufacture liquid crystal displays, or LCDs. In March 2011, the State of Mississippi sued them in state court, alleging that they had formed an international cartel to restrict competition and raise prices in the LCD market. The State claimed that these actions violated two Mississippi statutes: the Mississippi Antitrust Act, Miss.Code Ann. \u00a7 75-21-1\n    <em>\n     et seq\n    </em>\n    . (2009), and the Mississippi Consumer Protection Act, \u00a7 75-24-1\n    <em>\n     et seq.\n    </em>\n    (2009 and Cum. Supp. 2013). The State sought injunctive relief and civil penalties under both statutes, along with punitive damages, costs, and attorney's fees. It also sought restitution for its own purchases \"of LCD products and the purchases of its citizens.\" App. to Brief in Opposition 65a; \u00a7 75-24-11.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    Respondents filed a notice to remove the case from state to federal court, arguing that the case was removable under CAFA as either a \"class action\" or a \"mass action.\" The District Court ruled that the suit did not qualify as a \"class action\" because it was \"not brought pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 or a 'similar State statute or rule of judicial procedure.' \"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862937\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/876/758/#p769\">\n     876 F.Supp.2d 758\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 769 (S.D.Miss.2012).

The statute provides:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    \"[T]he term mass action means any civil action (except a [class action] ) in which monetary relief claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact, except that jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requirements under subsection (a).\" \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The parties do not dispute that this provision encompasses suits that are brought jointly by 100 or more named plaintiffs who propose to try their claims together. The question is whether the\n    provision also includes suits brought by fewer than 100 named plaintiffs on the theory that there may be 100 or more unnamed persons who are real parties in interest as beneficiaries to any of the plaintiffs' claims. Respondents argue that the provision covers such suits because \"claims of 100 or more persons\" refers to \"the\n    <em>\n     persons\n    </em>\n    to whom the claim belongs,\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    the real parties in interest\n    <em>\n     to the claims,\n    </em>\n    \" regardless of whether those persons are named or unnamed. Brief for Respondents 19 (emphasis in original). We disagree.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    To start, the statute says \"100 or more persons,\" not \"100 or more named or unnamed real parties in interest.\" Had Congress intended the latter, it easily could have drafted language to that effect. Indeed, when Congress wanted a numerosity requirement in CAFA to be satisfied by counting unnamed parties in interest in addition to named plaintiffs, it explicitly said so: CAFA provides that in order for a class action to be removable, \"the number of members of all proposed plaintiff classes\" must be 100 or greater, \u00a7 1332(d)(5)(B), and it defines \"class members\" to mean \"the persons (named or unnamed) who fall within the definition of the proposed or certified class,\" \u00a7 1332(d)(1)(D). Congress chose not to use the phrase \"named or unnamed\" in CAFA's mass action provision, a decision we understand to be intentional. See\n    <em>\n     Dean v.

Here, Congress used the terms \"persons\" and \"plaintiffs\" just as they are used in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 20, governing party joinder. Where \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i) requires that the \"claims of 100 or more persons [must be] proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact,\" Rule 20 provides that \"[p]ersons may join in one action as plaintiffs if they assert any right to relief jointly ... and any question of law or fact common to all plaintiffs will arise in the action.\" Thus, just as it is used in Rule 20, the term \"persons\" in \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i) refers to the individuals who are proposing to join as plaintiffs in a single action.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Second, respondents' interpretation of \"persons\" cannot square with the statute's requirement that the claims of the \"100 or more persons\" must be proposed for joint trial \"on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact.\" \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i). It is difficult to imagine how the claims of one set of unnamed individuals could be proposed for joint trial on the ground that the claims of some completely different group of named plaintiffs share common questions. The better understanding is that Congress meant for the \"100 or more persons\" and the proposed \"plaintiffs\" to be one and the same.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Recognizing that the statute's use of the term \"persons\" could be a reference to proposed plaintiffs, respondents assert that \"plaintiffs,\" like \"persons,\" should be construed to \"includ[e] both named and unnamed real parties in interest.\" Brief for Respondents 24. But that stretches the meaning of \"plaintiff\" beyond recognition. The term \"plaintiff\" is among the most commonly understood of legal terms of art: It means a \"party who brings a civil suit in a court of law.\" Black's Law Dictionary 1267 (9th ed. 2009); see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1729 (1961) (defining \"plaintiff\" to mean \"one who commences a personal action or lawsuit,\" or \"the complaining party in any litigation\"). It certainly does not mean \"anyone, named or unnamed, whom a suit may benefit,\" as respondents suggest.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fr5\" name=\"fr5\">\n      5\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    Moreover, Congress used the term \"plaintiffs\" twice in the mass action provision. The provision encompasses actions in which monetary \"claims of 100 or more persons are proposed to be tried jointly on the ground that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions,\" and it then provides that \"jurisdiction shall exist only over those plaintiffs whose claims in a mass action satisfy the jurisdictional amount requiremen[t]\" of $75,000. \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(i). If respondents are correct that \"plaintiffs\" means unnamed parties in interest where it is used the first time, then so too the second. After all, the \"presumption that a given term is used to mean the same thing throughout a statute\" is \"at its most vigorous when a term is repeated within a given sentence.\"\n    <em>\n     Brown v.

How is a district court to identify the unnamed parties whose claims in a given case are for less than $75,000? Would the court in this case, for instance, have to hold an evidentiary hearing to determine the identity of each of the hundreds of thousands of unnamed Mississippi citizens who purchased one of respondents' LCD products between 1996 and 2006 (the period alleged in the complaint)? Even if it could identify every such person, how would it ascertain the amount in controversy for each individual claim? Respondents suggest that \"[i]n some circumstances, defendants may be able to identify from their payment records any persons who may have claims for overpayments,\" but they stop notably short of claiming to possess such decades-old records themselves. Brief for Respondents 25.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Furthermore, what would happen with individuals whose claims were valued at less than $75,000? The District Court in this case suggested that if the suit were deemed a mass action, it would sever the claim for \"restitution for losses incurred by individuals claiming less than or equal to $75,000 each\" and remand that claim back to state court, while allowing the other claims (including the restitution claims exceeding $75,000) to proceed in federal court.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862937\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/876/758/#p769\">\n     876 F.Supp.2d, at 775\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

By contrast, interpreting \"plaintiffs\" in accordance with its usual meaning-to refer to the actual named parties who bring an action-leads to a straightforward, easy to administer rule under which a court would examine whether the plaintiffs have pleaded in good faith the requisite amount.

That provision, \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(C)(i), provides that once a mass action has been removed to federal court, it \"shall not thereafter be transferred to any other court ... unless a majority of the plaintiffs in the action request transfer.\" If respondents are correct that \"plaintiffs\" means \"unnamed parties in interest,\" it will be surpassingly difficult for a court to decide in a case like this one whether an action may be transferred. The District Court itself acknowledged this problem, noting that it would have to identify and communicate with \"hundreds of thousands if not millions of real parties in interest\" to \"pol[l] [them] about their preferred forum\" if respondents' interpretation were correct.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3862937\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/876/758/#p769\">\n     876 F.Supp.2d, at 777\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    The context in which the mass action provision was enacted lends further support to our conclusion. Congress' overriding concern in enacting CAFA was with class actions. See Preamble,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%204\">\n     119 Stat. 4\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (describing CAFA as an \"[a]ct to amend the procedures that apply to consideration of interstate class actions\"); CAFA \u00a7 2 (Congress' findings with respect to class actions). The mass action provision thus functions largely as a backstop to ensure that CAFA's relaxed jurisdictional rules for class actions cannot be evaded by a suit that names a host of plaintiffs rather than using the class device. Respondents' argument fails to recognize this key distinction. Their position is ultimately that \"[t]his action is similar to a class action,\" such that it should be removed. Brief for Respondents 27. But if Congress had wanted representative actions brought by States as sole plaintiffs to be removable under CAFA on the theory that they are in substance no different from class actions, it would have done so through the class action provision, not the one governing\n    mass actions.\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     III\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Rather than relying on the text of CAFA as the source of its real party in interest inquiry, the Court of Appeals appeared to find such an inquiry necessary on the basis of what it understood to be a background principle: that \"federal courts look to the substance of the action and not only at the labels that the parties may attach.\"\n    <em>\n     Caldwell,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763630\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/536/418/\">\n     536 F.3d, at 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

But that is not the case here. The background real party in interest inquiry identifies what party's (or parties') citizenship should be considered in determining diversity. The inquiry that respondents urge is quite different: It is an attempt to count up additional unnamed parties in order to satisfy the mass action provision's numerosity requirement. Respondents offer no reason to believe that Congress intended to extend the real party inquiry to this new circumstance, and so any presumption that Congress wanted to incorporate the inquiry, if it exists in this case at all, would be comparatively weak. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Meyer v. Holley,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191020\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/280/#p286\">\n     537 U.S. 280\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 286,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191020\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/280/#p286\">\n     123 S.Ct. 824\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9191020\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/537/280/#p286\">\n     154 L.Ed.2d 753\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2003) (\"Congress' silence, while permitting an inference that Congress intended to apply\n    <em>\n     ordinary\n    </em>\n    background tort principles, cannot show that it intended to apply an unusual modification of those rules\").\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fr8\" name=\"fr8\">\n      8\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Second, even if the background principle had previously been applied in the manner sought by respondents, Congress provided express indications that it did not want the principle to apply to the mass action provision. It specified that \"the term 'mass action' shall not include any civil action in which ... the claims are joined upon motion of a defendant.\" \u00a7 1332(d)(11)(B)(ii)(II). By prohibiting defendants from joining unnamed individuals to a lawsuit in order to turn it into a mass action, Congress demonstrated its focus on the persons who are actually proposing to join together as named plaintiffs in the suit. Requiring district courts to pierce the pleadings to identify unnamed persons interested in the suit would run afoul of that intent. Moreover, as already discussed, Congress repeatedly used the word \"plaintiffs\" to describe the 100 or more persons whose claims must be proposed for a joint trial. That word refers to actual, named parties-a concept inherently at odds with the background inquiry into unnamed real parties in interest, who by definition are never plaintiffs. Congress thus clearly displaced a background real party in interest inquiry, even assuming one might otherwise apply. Cf.\n    <em>\n     Barnhart v.
