State prosecutors then dismissed their charges to allow federal authorities to prosecute him. When Cheever filed notice that he intended to introduce expert evidence that methamphetamine intoxication negated his ability to form specific intent, the Federal District Court ordered Cheever to submit to a psychiatric evaluation. The federal case was eventually dismissed without prejudice. Meanwhile, this Court held the State's death penalty scheme constitutional, see\n  <em>\n   Kansas v. Marsh,\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500516\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/163/\">\n   548 U.S. 163\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500516\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/163/\">\n   126 S.Ct. 2516\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500516\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/163/\">\n   165 L.Ed.2d 429\n  </extracted-citation>\n  . The State then brought a second prosecution. At trial, Cheever raised a voluntary intoxication defense, offering expert testimony regarding his methamphetamine use. In rebuttal, the State sought to present testimony from the expert who had examined Cheever by the Federal District Court order. Defense counsel objected, arguing that since Cheever had not agreed to the examination, introduction of the testimony would violate the Fifth Amendment proscription against compelling an accused to testify against himself. The trial court allowed the testimony, and the jury found Cheever guilty and voted to impose a death sentence. The Kansas Supreme Court vacated the conviction and sentence, relying on\n  <em>\n   Estelle v. Smith,\n  </em>\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187407\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/454/\">\n   451 U.S. 454\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187407\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/454/\">\n   101 S.Ct. 1866\n  </extracted-citation>\n  ,\n  <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6187407\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/451/454/\">\n   68 L.Ed.2d 359\n  </extracted-citation>\n  , in which this Court held that a court-ordered psychiatric examination violated a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights when the defendant neither initiated the examination nor put his mental capacity in dispute.

Pp. 600 - 603.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   (a) In\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   the prosecution presented evidence from a court-ordered evaluation to rebut the defendant's affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance. This Court concluded that this rebuttal testimony did not offend the Fifth Amendment, holding that when a defense expert who has examined the defendant testifies that the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit an offense, the prosecution may present psychiatric evidence in rebuttal.\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   's reasoning was not limited to the circumstance that the evaluation was requested jointly by the defense and the government. Nor did the case turn on whether state law referred to extreme emotional disturbance as an affirmative defense. Pp. 600 - 601.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   (b) The admission of rebuttal testimony under the rule of\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   harmonizes with the principle that when a defendant\n   chooses to testify in a criminal case, the Fifth Amendment does not allow him to refuse to answer related questions on cross-examination. See\n   <em>\n    Fitzpatrick v. United States,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250763,3612373\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/178/304/\">\n    178 U.S. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1250763\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/alaska-fed/1/625/\">\n    20 S.Ct. 944\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3612373\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/178/304/\">\n    44 L.Ed. 1078\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the prosecution elicited testimony from its expert only after Cheever offered expert testimony about his inability to form the requisite\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   . Excluding this testimony would have undermined\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   and the core truth-seeking function of trial. Pp. 601 - 602.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (c) This Court is not persuaded by the Kansas Supreme Court's reasoning that Cheever did not waive his Fifth Amendment privilege because voluntary intoxication is not a mental disease or defect as a matter of state law. \"Mental disease or defect\" is not the salient phrase under this Court's precedents, which use the much broader phrase \"mental status,\"\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    483 U.S., at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mental-status defenses include those based on psychological expert evidence as to a defendant's\n   <em>\n    mens rea,\n   </em>\n   mental capacity to commit the crime, or ability to premeditate. To the extent that the Kansas Supreme Court declined to apply\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   because Cheever's intoxication was \"temporary,\" this Court's precedents are again not so narrowly circumscribed, as evidenced by the fact that the courts where Buchanan was tried treated his extreme emotional disturbance as a \"temporary\" condition. Pp. 601 - 602.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (d) This Court declines to address in the first instance Cheever's contention that the prosecution's use of the court-ordered psychiatric examination exceeded the rebuttal-purpose limit established by\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   see\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    483 U.S., at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We hold that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the morning of January 19, 2005, Scott Cheever shot and killed Matthew Samuels, a sheriff of Greenwood County, Kansas, and shot at other local law enforcement officers. In the hours before the shooting, Cheever and his friends had cooked and smoked methamphetamine at a home near Hilltop, Kansas. Samuels and multiple deputies drove there to arrest Cheever on an unrelated outstanding warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When one of Cheever's friends warned him that officers were en route, Cheever rushed outside and tried to drive away, but his car had a flat tire. He returned inside and hid with a friend in an upstairs bedroom, holding a loaded .44 caliber revolver. Cheever then heard footsteps on the stairs leading up to the room, and he stepped out and shot Samuels, who was climbing the stairs. After briefly returning to the bedroom, Cheever walked back to the staircase and shot Samuels again. He also shot at a deputy and a detective, as well as members of a local SWAT (special weapons and tactics) team that had since arrived. Only Samuels was hit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The State charged Cheever with capital murder. But shortly thereafter, in an unrelated case, the Kansas Supreme Court found the State's death penalty scheme unconstitutional.\n   <em>\n    State v. Marsh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371962\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/278/520/\">\n    278 Kan. 520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8371962\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/278/520/\">\n    102 P.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). Rather than continuing to prosecute Cheever without any chance of a death sentence, state prosecutors dismissed their charges and allowed federal authorities to prosecute Cheever under the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the federal case, Cheever filed notice that he \"intend[ed] to introduce expert evidence relating to his intoxication by methamphetamine at the time of the events on January 19, 2005, which negated his ability to form specific intent,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   malice aforethought, premeditation and deliberation.\" App. to Pet. for Cert. 69-70. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 12.2(b), the District Court ordered Cheever to submit to a psychiatric evaluation by Michael Welner, a forensic psychiatrist, to assess how methamphetamine use had affected him when he shot Samuels. Welner interviewed Cheever for roughly five and a half hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The federal case proceeded to trial. Seven days into jury selection, however, defense counsel became unable to continue; the court suspended the proceedings and later dismissed the case without prejudice. Meanwhile, this Court had reversed the Kansas Supreme Court and held that the Kansas death penalty statute was constitutional.\n   <em>\n    Kansas v. Marsh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500516\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/163/\">\n    548 U.S. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 167,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500516\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/163/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500516\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/163/\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). A second federal prosecution never commenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Kansas then brought a second state prosecution. At the state trial, Cheever presented a voluntary-intoxication defense, arguing that his methamphetamine use had rendered him incapable of premeditation. In support of this argument, Cheever offered testimony from Roswell Lee Evans, a specialist in psychiatric pharmacy and dean of the Auburn University School of Pharmacy. Evans opined that Cheever's long-term methamphetamine use had damaged his brain.\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fr1\" name=\"fr1\">\n     1\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   Evans also testified that on the morning of the shooting, Cheever was acutely intoxicated. According to Evans, Cheever's actions were \"very much influenced by\" his use of methamphetamine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After the defense rested, the State sought to present rebuttal testimony from Welner, the expert who had examined Cheever by order of the federal court. Defense counsel objected, arguing that because Welner's opinions were based in part on an examination to which Cheever had not voluntarily agreed, his testimony would violate the Fifth Amendment proscription against compelling an accused to testify against himself. The State countered that the testimony was necessary to rebut Cheever's voluntary-intoxication defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court agreed with the State. The court was persuaded, in part, by the fact that the defense expert had himself relied on Welner's examination report: \"I think that fact alone probably allows the State to call [Welner] to give his own point of view.\" App. 92. The court allowed Welner's testimony for the purpose of showing that Cheever shot Samuels \"because of his antisocial personality, not because his brain was impaired by methamphetamine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The jury found Cheever guilty of murder and attempted murder. At the penalty phase, it unanimously voted to impose a sentence of death, and the trial court accepted that verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal to the Kansas Supreme Court, Cheever argued that the State had violated his Fifth Amendment rights when it introduced, through Welner's testimony, statements that he had made during the federal court-ordered mental examination. The court agreed, relying primarily on\n   <em>\n    Estelle v.

The rule of\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   which we reaffirm today, is that where a defense expert who has examined the defendant testifies that the defendant lacked the requisite mental state to commit an offense, the prosecution may present psychiatric evidence in rebuttal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Any other rule would undermine the adversarial process, allowing a defendant to provide the jury, through an expert operating as proxy, with a one-sided and potentially inaccurate view of his mental state at the time of the alleged crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The admission of this rebuttal testimony harmonizes with the principle that when a defendant chooses to testify in a criminal case, the Fifth Amendment does not allow him to refuse to answer related questions on cross-examination.

Although Kansas law defines \"mental disease or defect\" narrowly, to exclude voluntary intoxication, that phrase is actually not the salient one under our precedents. In\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   we permitted rebuttal testimony where the defendant presented evidence of \"the 'mental status' defense of extreme emotional disturbance.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    483 U.S., at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And \"mental status\" is a broader term than \"mental disease or defect,\" at least to the extent that Kansas law excludes voluntary intoxication from that definition. Mental-status defenses include those based on psychological expert evidence as to a defendant's\n   <em>\n    mens rea,\n   </em>\n   mental capacity to commit the crime, or ability to premeditate. Defendants need not assert a \"mental disease or defect\" in order to assert a defense based on \"mental status.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To the extent that the Kansas Supreme Court declined to apply\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   because Cheever's intoxication was \"temporary,\" our precedents are again not so narrowly circumscribed. Like voluntary intoxication, extreme emotional disturbance is a \"temporary\" condition, at least according to the Kentucky state courts where Buchanan was tried. See\n   <em>\n    McClellan v. Commonwealth,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9979611\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/715/464/#p468\">\n    715 S.W.2d 464\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468-469 (Ky.1986) (defining extreme emotional disturbance as \"a temporary state of mind so enraged, inflamed, or disturbed as to overcome one's judgment, and to cause one to act uncontrollably from [an] impelling force of [an] extreme emotional disturbance rather than from evil or malicious purposes\"). We nonetheless held in\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   that the defense of extreme emotional disturbance, when supported by expert testimony, may be rebutted with expert testimony. The same is true here. Cheever's psychiatric evidence concerned his mental status because he used it to argue that he lacked the requisite mental capacity to premeditate. The Fifth Amendment therefore did not bar the State from using Welner's examination to rebut Cheever's voluntary-intoxication defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Cheever further contends that the Fifth Amendment imposes limits on the State's ability to introduce rebuttal evidence regarding a defendant's mental status. According to Cheever, Welner's testimony exceeded these limits by describing the shooting from Cheever's perspective;\n   <sup>\n    <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n     3\n    </a>\n   </sup>\n   by insinuating that he had a personality disorder; and by discussing his alleged infatuation with criminals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We have held that testimony based on a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation is admissible only for a \"limited rebuttal purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    483 U.S., at 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Buchanan,\n   </em>\n   for example, although the prosecution had used a psychiatric report to rebut the defendant's evidence of extreme emotional disturbance, we noted that the trial court had redacted the report so as to avoid exposing the jury to \"the very different issue\" of the defendant's competency to stand trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    ., at 423, n. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"28132\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/483/402/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
