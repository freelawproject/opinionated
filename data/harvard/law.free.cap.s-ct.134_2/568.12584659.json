The subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all disputes between the parties would be litigated in Virginia. When a dispute arose, however, J-Crew filed suit in the Western District of Texas. Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss, arguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue \"wrong\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and \"improper\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3).

The District Court denied both motions. It concluded that \u00a7 1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum; that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under \u00a7 1404(a); and that the court would consider both public- and private-interest factors, only one of which was the forum-selection clause. After weighing those factors, the court held that Atlantic Marine had not carried its burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   The Fifth Circuit denied Atlantic Marine's petition for a writ of mandamus directing the District Court to dismiss the case under \u00a7 1406(a) or to transfer it to the Eastern District of Virginia under \u00a7 1404(a). The court agreed with the District Court that \u00a7 1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum; that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(3) would be the correct mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that pointed to a nonfederal forum; and that the District Court had not abused its discretion in refusing to transfer the case after conducting the balance-of-interests analysis required by \u00a7 1404(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    Held\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   1.

Section 1404(a), however, governs transfer only within the federal court system. When a forum-selection clause points to a state or foreign forum, the clause may be enforced through the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens.\n   </em>\n   Section 1404(a) is a codification of that doctrine for the subset of cases in which the transferee forum is another federal court.\n   <em>\n    Sinochem Int'l Co. v.

First, the plaintiff's choice of forum merits no weight, and the plaintiff, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, has the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted. Second, the court should not consider the parties' private interests aside from those embodied in the forum-selection clause; it may consider only public interests. Because public-interest factors will rarely defeat a transfer motion, the practical result is that forum-selection clauses should control except in unusual cases. Third, when a party bound by a forum-selection clause flouts its contractual obligation and files suit in a different forum, a \u00a7 1404(a) transfer of venue will not carry with it the original venue's choice-of-law rules. See\n   <em>\n    Van Dusen,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n     supra,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n    at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n    84 S.Ct. 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pp. 581 - 584.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (b) Here, the District Court's application of \u00a7 1404(a) did not comport with these principles. The court improperly placed the burden on Atlantic Marine to prove that transfer to the parties' contractually preselected forum was appropriate instead of requiring J-Crew, the party acting\n   in violation of the forum-selection clause, to show that public-interest factors overwhelmingly disfavored a transfer. It also erred in giving weight to the parties' private interests outside those expressed in the forum-selection clause. And its holding that public interests favored keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to those in Virginia rested in part on the District Court's mistaken belief that the Virginia federal court would have been required to apply Texas' choice-of-law rules instead of Virginia's.

We reject petitioner's argument that such a clause may be enforced by a motion to dismiss under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201406\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1406\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) or Rule 12(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Instead, a forum-selection clause may be enforced by a motion to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V), which provides that \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\" When a defendant files such a motion, we conclude, a district court should transfer the case unless extraordinary circumstances unrelated to the convenience of the parties clearly disfavor a transfer. In the present case, both the District Court and the Court of Appeals misunderstood the standards to be applied in adjudicating a \u00a7 1404(a) motion in a case involving a forum-selection clause, and we therefore reverse the decision below.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    <strong>\n     I\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Petitioner Atlantic Marine Construction Co., a Virginia corporation with its principal place of business in Virginia, entered into a contract with the United States Army Corps of Engineers to construct a child-development center at Fort Hood in the Western District of Texas. Atlantic Marine then entered into a subcontract with respondent J-Crew Management, Inc., a Texas corporation, for work on the project. This subcontract included a forum-selection clause, which stated that all disputes between the parties \" 'shall be litigated in the Circuit Court for the City of Norfolk, Virginia, or the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division.' \"\n    <em>\n     In re Atlantic Marine Constr.

Atlantic Marine moved to dismiss the suit, arguing that the forum-selection clause rendered venue in the Western District of Texas \"wrong\" under \u00a7 1406(a) and \"improper\" under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(3). In the alternative, Atlantic Marine moved to transfer the case to the Eastern District of Virginia under \u00a7 1404(a). J-Crew opposed these motions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    The District Court denied both motions. It first concluded that \u00a7 1404(a) is the exclusive mechanism for enforcing a forum-selection clause that points to another federal forum. The District Court then held that Atlantic Marine bore the burden of establishing that a transfer would be appropriate under \u00a7 1404(a) and that the court would \"consider a nonexhaustive and nonexclusive list of public and private interest factors,\" of which the \"forum-selection clause [was] only one such factor.\"\n    <em>\n     United States ex rel.

We disagree. Section 1406(a) and Rule 12(b)(3) allow dismissal only when venue is \"wrong\" or \"improper.\" Whether venue is \"wrong\" or \"improper\" depends exclusively on whether the court in which the case was brought satisfies the requirements of federal venue laws, and those provisions say nothing about a forum-selection clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     A\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    Section 1406(a) provides that \"[t]he district court of a district in which is filed a case laying venue in the wrong division or district shall dismiss, or if it be in the interest of justice, transfer such case to any district or division in which it could have been brought.\" Rule 12(b)(3) states that a party may move to dismiss a case for \"improper venue.\" These provisions therefore authorize dismissal only when venue is \"wrong\" or \"improper\" in the forum in which it was brought.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    This question-whether venue is \"wrong\" or \"improper\"-is generally governed by\n    <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201391\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2006 ed., Supp. V).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fr2\" name=\"fr2\">\n      2\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    That provision states that \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by\n    <em>\n     law\n    </em>\n    ... this section\n    <em>\n     shall\n    </em>\n    govern the venue of\n    <em>\n     all civil actions\n    </em>\n    brought in district courts of the United States.\" \u00a7 1391(a)(1) (emphasis added). It further provides that \"[a] civil action may be brought in-(1) a judicial district in which any defendant resides, if all defendants are residents of the State in which the district is located; (2) a judicial district in which a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a substantial part of property that is the subject of the action is situated; or (3) if there is no district in which an action may otherwise be brought as provided in this section, any judicial district in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to such action.\" \u00a7 1391(b).\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fr3\" name=\"fr3\">\n      3\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    When venue is challenged, the court must determine whether the case falls within one of the three categories set out in \u00a7 1391(b). If it does, venue is proper; if it does not, venue is improper, and the case must be dismissed or transferred under \u00a7 1406(a). Whether the parties entered into a contract containing a forum-selection clause has no bearing on whether a case falls into one of the categories of cases listed in \u00a7 1391(b). As a result, a case filed in a district that falls within \u00a7 1391 may not be dismissed under \u00a7 1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Petitioner's contrary view improperly conflates the special statutory term \"venue\" and the word \"forum.\" It is certainly true that, in some contexts, the word \"venue\" is used synonymously with the term \"forum,\" but \u00a7 1391 makes clear that venue in \"all civil actions\" must be determined in accordance with the criteria outlined in that section. That language cannot reasonably be read to allow judicial consideration of other, extrastatutory limitations on the forum in which a case may be brought.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    The structure of the federal venue provisions confirms that they alone define whether venue exists in a given forum. In particular, the venue statutes reflect Congress' intent that venue should always lie in\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    federal court whenever federal courts have personal jurisdiction over the defendant. The first two paragraphs of \u00a7 1391(b) define the preferred judicial districts for venue in a typical case, but the third paragraph provides a fallback option: If no other venue is proper, then venue will lie in \"\n    <em>\n     any judicial district\n    </em>\n    in which any defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction\" (emphasis added). The statute thereby ensures that so long as a federal court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant, venue will always lie somewhere. As we have previously noted, \"Congress does not in general intend to create venue gaps, which take away with one hand what Congress has given by way of jurisdictional grant with the other.\"\n    <em>\n     Smith v. United States,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225788\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/197/#p203\">\n     507 U.S. 197\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 203,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225788\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/197/#p203\">\n     113 S.Ct. 1178\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6225788\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/197/#p203\">\n     122 L.Ed.2d 548\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Yet petitioner's approach would mean that in some number of cases-those in which the forum-selection clause points to a state or foreign court-venue would not lie in any federal district. That would not comport with the statute's design, which contemplates that venue will always exist in some federal court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The conclusion that venue is proper so long as the requirements of \u00a7 1391(b) are met, irrespective of any forum-selection clause, also follows from our prior decisions construing the federal venue statutes.

Under the construction of the venue laws we adopted in\n    <em>\n     Van Dusen,\n    </em>\n    a \"wrong\" district is therefore a district other than \"those districts in which Congress has provided\n    <em>\n     by its venue statutes\n    </em>\n    that the action 'may be brought.' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n      Id.,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n     at 618\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n     84 S.Ct. 805\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added).

The defendant had initially moved to transfer the case or, in the alternative, to dismiss for improper venue under \u00a7 1406(a), but by the time the case reached this Court, the defendant had abandoned its \u00a7 1406(a) argument and sought only transfer under \u00a7 1404(a).

A contrary view would all but drain\n    <em>\n     Stewart\n    </em>\n    of any significance. If a forum-selection clause rendered venue in all other federal courts \"wrong,\" a defendant could always obtain automatic dismissal or transfer under \u00a7 1406(a) and would not have any reason to resort to \u00a7 1404(a).\n    <em>\n     Stewart\n    </em>\n    's holding would be limited to the presumably rare case in which the defendant inexplicably fails to file a motion under \u00a7 1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <strong>\n     B\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Although a forum-selection clause does not render venue in a court \"wrong\" or \"improper\" within the meaning of \u00a7 1406(a) or Rule 12(b)(3), the clause may be enforced through a motion to transfer under \u00a7 1404(a). That provision states that \"[f]or the convenience of parties and witnesses, in the interest of justice, a district court may transfer any civil action to any other district or division where it might have been brought or to any district or division to which all parties have consented.\" Unlike \u00a7 1406(a), \u00a7 1404(a) does not condition transfer on the initial forum's being \"wrong.\" And it permits transfer to any district where venue is also proper (\n    <em>\n     i.e.,\n    </em>\n    \"where [the case] might have been brought\") or to any other district to which the parties have agreed by contract or stipulation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Section 1404(a) therefore provides a mechanism for enforcement of forum-selection clauses that point to a particular federal district.

As Atlantic Marine persuasively argues, however, that conclusion cannot be reconciled with our construction of the term \"improper venue\" in \u00a7 1406 to refer only to a forum that does not satisfy federal venue laws.

Rather, as the party defying the forum-selection clause, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that transfer to the forum for which the parties bargained is unwarranted. Because plaintiffs are ordinarily allowed to select whatever forum they consider most advantageous (consistent with jurisdictional and venue limitations), we have termed their selection the \"plaintiff's venue privilege.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    <em>\n     Van Dusen,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n     376 U.S., at 635\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n     84 S.Ct. 805\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fr7\" name=\"fr7\">\n      7\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    But when a plaintiff agrees by contract to bring suit only in a specified forum-presumably in exchange for other binding promises by the defendant-the plaintiff has effectively exercised its \"venue privilege\" before a dispute arises. Only that initial choice deserves deference, and the plaintiff must bear the burden of showing why the court should not transfer the case to the forum to which the parties agreed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Second, a court evaluating a defendant's \u00a7 1404(a) motion to transfer based on a forum-selection clause should not consider arguments about the parties' private interests. When parties agree to a forum-selection clause, they waive the right to challenge the preselected forum as inconvenient or less convenient for themselves or their witnesses, or for their pursuit of the litigation. A court accordingly must deem the private-interest factors to weigh entirely in favor of the preselected forum.

It nevertheless promised to resolve its disputes in Virginia, and the District Court should not have given any weight to J-Crew's current claims of inconvenience.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    The District Court also held that the public-interest factors weighed in favor of keeping the case in Texas because Texas contract law is more familiar to federal judges in Texas than to their federal colleagues in Virginia. That ruling, however, rested in part on the District Court's belief that the federal court sitting in Virginia would have been required to apply Texas' choice-of-law rules, which in this case pointed to Texas contract law. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%208499879\">\n     2012 WL 8499879\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *8 (citing\n    <em>\n     Van Dusen,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n      supra,\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n     at 639\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379239\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/612/\">\n     84 S.Ct. 805\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). But for the reasons we have explained, the transferee court would apply Virginia choice-of-law rules. It is true that even these Virginia rules may point to the contract law of Texas, as the State in which the contract was formed. But at minimum, the fact that the Virginia court will not be required to apply Texas choice-of-law rules reduces whatever weight the District Court might have given to the public-interest factor that looks to the familiarity of the transferee court with the applicable law. And, in any event, federal judges routinely apply the law of a State other than the State in which they sit. We are not aware of any exceptionally arcane features of Texas contract law that are likely to defy comprehension by a federal judge sitting in Virginia.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    * * *\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.
