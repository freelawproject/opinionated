Under his will he bequeathed the residue of his estate in trust to pay the net income to his niece Vesta B. Birchard until she should have attained the age of thirty years, providing that should she die before attaining that age the trust estate should be transferred and conveyed \u201cto her children then living, if any, and their respective heirs, and to the issue of any deceased child by right of representation. . . .\u201d Further provisions in the event that Vesta left no child or issue of a deceased child need not be recited since Vesta died before attaining the age of thirty years leaving one child, \u201cEdward Bidderbusch, Jr.,\u201d to whom the residuary estate of the husband of the testatrix, to the extent that it was ascertained upon the death of Vesta, was paid over. Edward Bidderbusch, Jr. died intestate on November 11, 1932, a resident of the State of Oregon. He was survived by his widow, Mary E. Johnson, and two minor children, Bobert and Edward, all of whom are respondents. Under the laws of the State of Oregon the widow of Edward became entitled to one half of his estate and the children to the other half in equal shares. They are strangers to the blood of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Among other respondents are Kate M. (Simonds) Johnson, a niece of the testatrix (daughter of her brother William) and Edward B. Simonds and Marie Simonds Staples, grandnephew and grandniece, respectively, of the testatrix (children of the son of her brother John) and Fred A. Tower, executor of the will of \u201cHattie\u201d (Harriet) S. B. Denison, deceased, the last survivor of the daughters of Columbia A. Bishop, the sister of the deceased. Harriet died without issue on August 21, 1941, and the trusts thereupon termi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>nated, since the other daughters of Columbia had predeceased Harriet without issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\">The issue presented in the circumstances is whether the testatrix died intestate as to the ultimate disposition of the $2,000 trust fund in question established under the fourth clause of the will and the residuary trust established by the fifth clause of the will, and, if so, whether the heirs of the testatrix are to be determined as of the date of her death, or as of the date of the death of the last survivor of the daughters of her sister Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The judge entered a decree directing that the trust funds in question be distributed \u201cto such representative of the estate of . . . Edward Ridderbusch, Junior, as may be authorized to receive said funds in this Commonwealth.\u201d The respondent niece, grandnephew and grandniece, and the executor of the will of Harriet S. B. Denison appealed from this decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">The appellants argue with relation to the trust of the residue created by the fifth clause of the will that it is manifest, from a reading of the will as a whole, that the testatrix intended to benefit her own next of kin rather than strangers to her blood claiming through her husband, and that her heirs were to be determined as of the date of the death of the last survivor of the daughters of Columbia, and that a gift to them by implication is to be read into the will. In behalf of the executor of the will of \u201cHattie\u201d (Harriet) it is argued, with relation to the trust created by the fourth clause of the will, that, the trust having been fully executed, \u201cthe legal title followed the equitable title,\u201d and the fund, therefore, became part of the assets of the estate of \u201cHarriet,\u201d and is payable to the representative of her estate. We do not sustain these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">It is plain that the testatrix made no disposition of the residuary trust fund involved upon the contingency that has occurred. We discover nothing in the will read as a whole, in the light of the circumstances attendant upon and known to the testatrix at the time of its execution (see <em>Ware </em>v. <em>Minot, </em>202 Mass. 512), from which to conclude that, in the exact situation that has arisen, the testatrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>intended that the trust estate should be paid over to her heirs at law determined as of the date of the death of the last survivor of the daughters of her sister Columbia. On the contrary, the only provisions of the will as to the disposition of the trust estate as of that time are precise and clear, to the effect that it should then be divided among the living children of said daughters, share and share alike. We cannot speculate as to what the testatrix might have done had the situation that has occurred been in her mind when making the will. <em>Worcester Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>210 Mass. 115, 122. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>230 Mass. 478, 480. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>256 Mass. 273, 278. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Harding, </em>267 Mass. 203, 206. A reading of the will as a whole indicates that the testatrix did not anticipate that the present situation would in fact come to pass. Her sister Columbia had five daughters when the testatrix executed the will. Two of them had married. It is reasonable to suppose that the testatrix did not in those circumstances envisage that her sister Columbia\u2019s line would become extinct in a single generation. Doubtless the testatrix thought that she was fully disposing of her entire estate, but the inescapable fact is that, as events have transpired, she did not succeed in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-3\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Sanger </em>v. <em>Bourke, </em>209 Mass. 481, largely relied on by the appellants. In the <em>Sanger </em>case, a sum of money was left in trust to pay the income to the testator\u2019s named children, during their lives, providing that, should any child die without issue, his share of the income should be divided among the survivors, but that if any child died leaving issue the capital, of which such child had enjoyed the income, should be paid to his issue. The last survivor of the testator\u2019s children died without issue. As distinguished from the present case, however, there were then hving issue of other deceased children, and, although not formally expressed in the will, it was held that there was manifest by implication an intention on the part of the testator to benefit an entire class consisting of the issue of his deceased children by leaving to them ultimately the estate placed in trust for his children. See also <em>Metcalf </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>v. <em>First Parish in Framingham, </em>128 Mass. 370; <em>Hood </em>v. <em>Boardman, </em>148 Mass. 330; <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Coffin, </em>152 Mass. 95; <em>Fitts </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>307 Mass. 449. In the present case each of the daughters of Columbia died without issue, and there is no one to answer that description, and the will is silent in that event.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\">We do not concur in the contention of the appellants that the heirs at law of the testatrix to be determined as of the date of the death of Harriet are entitled to distribution of the trust funds in question. Such cases as <em>Fargo </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>150 Mass. 225, <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Bullard, </em>151 Mass. 324, <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>196 Mass. 35, <em>Carr </em>v. <em>New England Anti-Vivisection Society, </em>234 Mass. 217, and <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>278 Mass. 244, relied upon by the appellants, concern wills where the testator made an ultimate gift in express terms to his heirs at law or next of kin, and where the circumstances disclosed were such that the court was satisfied from reading the wills and ascertaining the testamentary scheme, that the testator intended that his heirs at law should be determined as though he had died at the time fixed for final distribution. These cases rest upon their special facts, and, indeed, in all of them the rule is recognized that a person\u2019s heirs at law are to be ascertained as of the date of his death unless a contrary intent is plainly shown by his will. See <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Congregational Home Missionary Society, </em>276 Mass. 580, 582, 585; <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>City Bank Farmers Trust Co., ante, </em>528, 530. In the instant case it seems plain that the event of intestacy, which has occurred, was unconsidered by the testatrix. The will discloses no intention on the part of the testatrix in that event with respect to the time as of which her heirs should be ascertained, and it is settled that, where a residuary gift lapses as in the circumstances of the present case, it passes to those who were the heirs of the testatrix under the statute of distribution in force at her death. <em>Dresel </em>v. <em>King, </em>198 Mass. 546, 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">This general rule applies even though the husband of the testatrix was given a life interest in the trust fund of the residue, in the absence, as here, of anything in the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>to evidence clearly an intention to exclude him from any further interest in the estate of the testatrix. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>Bowly, </em>8 Met. 424, 431, 432. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Goss, </em>132 Mass. 274. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Buffum, </em>186 Mass. 242. <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>248 Mass. 285. <em>Loring </em>v. <em>Dexter, </em>256 Mass. 273. <em>Boynton </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>266 Mass. 454. <em>Gilman </em>v. <em>Congregational Home Missionary Society, </em>276 Mass. 580. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>313 Mass. 717, 720. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>City Bank Farmers Trust Co., ante, </em>528, 531-532, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-3\">The $2,000 trust fund in question created by the fourth clause of the will having lapsed fell into the residue of the estate, <em>Casey </em>v. <em>Genter, </em>276 Mass. 165, 170, and cases cited, and passes as intestate property, <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Punchard, </em>217 Mass. 237, 239, strictly speaking, to the representative of the estate of the husband of the testatrix. \u25a0 Since, however, the testatrix\u2019s husband died over forty-five years ago, we see no good reason why the trust funds should not be paid over as directed by the decree entered in the court below to a representative, authorized to receive them in this Commonwealth, of the estate of his grandnephew, the only child of the husband\u2019s niece Vesta, taking through the gift of the residue contained in the will of the husband of the testatrix. The decree entered in the Probate Court is affirmed. Costs and expenses of this appeal may be allowed to the respondents or their counsel in the discretion of that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
