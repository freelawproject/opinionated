The plaintiff\u2019s intestate and the defendant had been friends for a number of years. On May 2, 1937, the defendant gave the plaintiff\u2019s intestate an order for letterheads and envelopes with the heading \u201cSouth Shore Farms, Inc.\u201d On June 5 the defendant went to the place of business of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate and ordered one hundred menus to be delivered to the South Shore Farms, on the cover page of which was printed \u201cSouth Shore Farms, Inc.\u201d Again, on July 5, the defendant ordered one hundred menus but requested the plaintiff\u2019s intestate to omit \u201cInc.\u201d from the cover page. The plaintiff\u2019s intestate carried the account and addressed the bills in the name \u201cSouth Shore Farm.\u201d On cross-examination the defendant testified that he did not tell the plaintiff\u2019s intestate that \u201cSouth Shore Farms, Inc.,\u201d was a corporation; that \u201che knew I was getting the place ready. I never told him it was a corporation.\u201d The wife of the intestate testified that she talked with the defendant over the telephone and asked him if he would pay the bill; that he said he had nothing to do with the South Shore Farms any more; that she said, \u201cyou contracted the bill,\u201d and he said he had nothing more to do with it; that he did not say whether he would pay it or not; and that he did not say it was the obligation of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The only point argued is the refusal of the judge to rule as requested by the defendant that \u201cthe plaintiff [[meaning the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who died since the trial], having knowledge of the existence of the corporation at the time he extended credit to it and having rendered his bills to the corporation, must look to the corporation for payment and is not entitled to recover from the defendant.\u201d In denying this request the judge stated that he found \u201cneither fact on which this request is based.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">We do not discover error in the refusal of this request, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>The judge was not obliged to find that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate extended credit to the corporation, even if he knew of its existence, and he did not render his bills in the correct name of the corporation. The form of the bills was not conclusive. <em>Barr-Wight Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Butkovitz, </em>267 Mass. 372. On all the evidence, including the form of the account and of the bills, it was a question of fact to whom the plaintiff\u2019s intestate extended credit. The evidence that the defendant ordered all of the goods in person without telling the intestate that \u201cit was a corporation,\u201d the testimony of the defendant as to the knowledge of the intestate that the defendant \u201cwas getting the place ready,\u201d and the evidence of the defendant\u2019s equivocal reply when asked by the wife of the intestate to pay the bill and of his failure then to assert that it was an obligation of the corporation, all taken together, constituted some evidence that the defendant was personally indebted for the goods. <em>Chelmsford Foundry Co. </em>v. <em>Shepard, </em>206 Mass. 102, 109-112. <em>New London Ship &amp; Engine Co. </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>254 Mass. 76. <em>Barr-Wight Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Butkovitz, </em>267 Mass. 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
