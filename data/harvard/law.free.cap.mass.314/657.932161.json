The original declaration was for money had and received to the amount of $875.19. The defendant answered general denial, payment and statute of limitations. The judge denied four requests for rulings made by the defendant, and made a finding for the plaintiff in the amount of $1,443.22. After this finding was made the plaintiff moved to amend the declaration so as to be a declaration for money had and received to the amount of $1,443.22 according to an account annexed, and the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>was allowed. The denial of the four requests for rulings and the allowance of the motion to amend the declaration were reported to the Appellate Division. The report was dismissed and the defendant appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">There was evidence at the trial that the plaintiff was the owner of certain parcels of real estate in Lowell, that the plaintiff made an arrangement with the defendant to collect the rents thereon, and that the defendant collected such rents from October 29, 1932, to May 10, 1941. The controversy involved in the present case relates to the amount, if any, due from the defendant to the plaintiff by reason of such collection of rents and matters connected therewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">There was evidence that the defendant on May 10, 1941, turned over to the plaintiff two bank books with deposits aggregating $525.56. As to this payment there appears to be no controversy. Both the evidence for the plaintiff and the evidence for the defendant assume that this payment was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">The evidence \u201cfor\u201d the plaintiff showed that the \u201ctotal net rents received by the defendant\u201d amounted to $8,624, and there was evidence that \u201cthe plaintiff advanced to the defendant the sum of $310 for taxes,\u201d making an aggregate amount of $8,934. There was also \u201cevidence from the plaintiff showing that the defendant paid out a total of $7,490.78, which amount includes the $525.56, for interest, principal, taxes, water and repairs, leaving a total net due the plaintiff of $1,443.22.\u201d The judge found for the plaintiff in this amount of $1,443.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">The evidence \u201cfor\u201d the defendant showed that she collected \u201ca total net of rents\u201d of $8,166.25. The evidence \u201cfor\u201d the defendant with respect to the amounts expended by her appears to be somewhat inconsistent. In one place in the report it is stated with respect to the \u201ctotal net of rents collected,\u201d amounting to $8,166.25, that the defendant \u201cexpended all on the buildings for repairs, taxes, interest, mortgages, etc., excepting the $525.56 which she turned over to the plaintiff on May 10, 1941, leaving a balance of $30 which she claimed she owed the plaintiff and which she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>offered to the plaintiff but which he refused to accept and so she left it with her attorney.\u201d In another place in the report it is stated that there was \"evidence for the defendant that she paid for interest, principal, etc., $7,494.29, which amount also includes the $525.56, leaving a net amount due plaintiff of $671.96, which amount defendant claimed she expended for repairs for which she had no receipts, having sent them to the plaintiff, which the plaintiff denied ever receiving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The defendant expressly waives her requests for rulings numbered 1 and 4 respectively. She contends, however, that the denial of her requests for rulings numbered 2 and 3 respectively was error. The judge in denying the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings stated: \"Defendant\u2019s requests are denied because on her own admission there was a balance due the plaintiff.\u201d The defendant\u2019s request numbered 2 was a request for a ruling that the \u201cevidence is sufficient to warrant a finding for the defendant.\u201d This requested ruling was a correct statement of the law on the evidence unless there was evidence binding on the defendant that she owed something to the plaintiff. In one place in the report it is stated that the defendant \"claimed\u201d that she \u201cowed the plaintiff\u201d \"a balance of $30.\u201d We interpret this statement to mean that the defendant so testified. She was bound by this testimony unless there was other evidence more favorable to her. There is no such evidence, except as it is shown by the statement in the report with respect to an amount of $671.96 shown by evidence for the defendant to be the \"net amount due plaintiff,\u201d after deducting certain described payments, that this \"amount defendant claimed she expended for repairs.\u201d We interpret this statement to mean that the defendant testified that she expended this amount for repairs. But even if the latter testimony warranted a finding, contrary to the defendant\u2019s testimony that she \"owed the plaintiff\u201d \"a balance of $30,\u201d the judge, as appears from his statement of his reason for denying the defendant\u2019s requests for rulings, accepted as true the testimony of the defendant that she owed a \"balance\u201d to the plaintiff, and so found, although he did not accept as true her testimony as to the amount of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>balance. In substance, the judge made a special finding to this effect warranted by the evidence even if not required by it. The use by the judge of the word \u201cadmission\u201d in his statement of his reason for denying the defendant\u2019s requests does not preclude the conclusion here reached. The use of this word does not import that the judge ruled that as matter of law the testimony of the defendant that she \u201cowed the plaintiff\u201d \u201ca balance of $30\u201d was conclusive against her. This special finding of the judge rendered immaterial the ruling requested by the defendant\u2019s request numbered 2, and consequently it was not error to deny this request. See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hanover, ante, </em>167, 173-177, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The defendant\u2019s request numbered 3 involved, with other matters, a request for a ruling that the \u201cevidence is sufficient to warrant a finding . . . that the defendant paid over to the plaintiff whatever balances were on hand, if any.\u201d For the reason already stated with respect to the defendant\u2019s request numbered 2, it was not error to deny this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">There was no error in allowing the amendment to the declaration. The allowance of this amendment was well within the established principle permitting amendments to pleadings after a case has been fully and fairly tried \u201cfor the purpose of making the pleadings conform to the proof and avoiding a new trial when the issues raised by the amendments have been fully tried.\u201d <em>Drury </em>v. <em>Hartigan, </em>312 Mass. 527, 529. The allowance of the amendment implied a finding \u2014 which we cannot say ivas unwarranted \u2014 that the case was fully and fairly tried. <em>Bucholz </em>v. <em>Green Bros. Co. </em>290 Mass. 350, 354-355.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">\n<em>Order dismissing report affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
