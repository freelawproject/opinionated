Ed.) c. 152, \u00a7 9B, as inserted by St. 1935, c. 424, and amended by St. 1938, c. 462, provides in part that where, \u201cat the time of filing a claim for compensation, an employee is claiming to be disabled as a result of an injury by industrial disease\u201d one or more members of the board may appoint three impartial physicians as industrial disease referees, who shall examine the employee, may consider and study all pertinent medical and hospital records and other information submitted to them by said member or members, may inspect the place of employment and make such further investigation as they deem necessary, and \u201cshall make to the department a complete report, which shall include the results of their study, together with their diagnosis and their opinion as to the extent and cause of disability, if any.\u201d It is further provided that the report \u201cshall be binding on the parties.\u201d On November 28, 1941, the employee filed the claim for compensation in writing required by \u00a7 49, wherein he stated the date of his injury as \u201con or about December 1940,\u201d the cause of his injury as \u201ccontact with material used in employee\u2019s work,\u201d and the nature of his injury as \u201cinjury to nerves.\u201d The impartial referees reported a diagnosis of \u201cPsycho-neurosis,\u201d not due to \u201ccontact with material used in employee\u2019s work\u201d and further reported in their original and in their second supplemental reports that although the employee was totally incapacitated at the times of those reports, \u201cthe in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>capacity is not due to the condition claimed to be due to work.\u201d The board admitted the reports of the referees as evidence, rejected evidence offered by the employee tending to contradict \"the conclusions\u201d of the referees'on the ground that under the statute the reports of the referees were \"binding,\u201d and dismissed the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">There was error. Under the statute the board is authorized to appoint industrial referees only where \u201cat the time of filing a claim ... an employee is claiming to be disabled as a result of an injury by industrial disease.\u201d In our opinion a claim of \"injury to nerves\u201d caused by \"contact with materia] used in employee\u2019s work\u201d cannot, without more, be construed as a claim of injury by industrial disease. A claim in these words is more naturally construed as pointing toward some specific nerve injury by trauma or as the direct result of physical contact rather than as pointing toward that kind of impairment of bodily health which is properly described as disease. See <em>Hogan </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>164 Mass. 448, 449; <em>Hurle\u2019s Case, </em>217 Mass. 223; <em>Madden\u2019s Case, </em>222 Mass. 487; <em>Maggelet\u2019s Case, </em>228 Mass. 57, 61, 62; <em>Pimental\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 598, 601, 602; <em>Smith\u2019s Case, </em>307 Mass. 516, and cases cited. But even if a claim of some form of disease of the nerves resulting from personal injury as distinguished from personal injury without disease might sometimes fairly be comprehended within these words, their meaning is not restricted to such a claim, and there is nothing in them to show that such a claim was intended in this instance. There is nothing in the record outside of the written statement of claim to indicate that at the time of the filing of the statement the employee was \"claiming to be disabled as a result of an injury by industrial disease\u201d rather than as the result of an injury without industrial disease, if we assume, without deciding, that the nature of the employee\u2019s claim \u201cat the time of filing\u201d can ever be determined by evidence outside of the formal written statement of claim required by the act to be filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">Since there is nothing in the record to show that \u201cat the time of filing . . . [the] claim for compensation,\u201d the employee was \"claiming to be disabled as a result of an injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>by industrial disease,\u201d this does not appear to be a case in which the board had any authority under \u00a7 9B to appoint industrial referees. The reports of the purported referees were therefore null and without effect and should have been excluded altogether, and the employee should have been permitted to proceed with the proof of his claim by any pertinent and competent evidence. See <em>Latorre\u2019s Case, </em>302 Mass. 24, 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Other questions as to the construction and effect of \u00a7 9B need not now be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The decree is reversed, and the case is to be recommitted to the Industrial Accident Board for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
