Each of these appeals was dismissed rightly since it was not taken seasonably. See <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Assessors of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number><em>Boston, </em>311 Mass. 415. Each application for abatement was made to the assessors on November 6, 1939. The taxpayer in each case appealed to the Appellate Tax Board on June 5, 1940. The assessors failed to act upon these applications for abatement. Under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 64, as appearing in St. 1938, c. 478, \u00a7 1, when the assessors fail to act upon an application for abatement \u201cprior to the expiration of four months from the date of filing of such application it shall then be deemed to be refused.\u201d This period of four months expired at the close of the day March 6, 1940. The term \u201cmonth\u201d means calendar month. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 4, \u00a7 7, Nineteenth. The day \u201cfrom\u201d which the period is computed \u2014 November 6, 1939 \u2014- is excluded. <em>Bemis </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>118 Mass. 502, 505-506. <em>Sweeney </em>v. <em>Morey &amp; Co. Inc. </em>279 Mass. 495, 502-503. March 6, 1940, however, is included, but March 7, 1940, is not. See <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Nute, </em>2 Cush. 333, 334. <em>Nickerson </em>v. <em>President &amp; Fellows of Harvard College, </em>298 Mass. 484-485. <em>Bogash </em>v. <em>Studios, Inc. </em>303 Mass. 207, 208. <em>Boston Five Cents Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Assessors of Boston, </em>313 Mass. 762, 763-764. If March 7, 1940, were to be included, as the taxpayer contends, the period would be more than four months. It would include the seventh day of each of five months and the intervening days. At the close of the day March 6, 1940, each application was \u201cdeemed to be refused.\u201d The taxpayer had the right to appeal \u201cwithin ninety days after the time when the application\u201d was \u201cdeemed to be refused.\u201d G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 59, \u00a7 65, as appearing in St. 1939, c. 31, \u00a7 7. It could have appealed on March 7, 1940, which was \u201cafter the time when the application\u201d was \u201cdeemed to be refused\u201d and \u201cwithin\u201d the ninety days\u2019 period. This is in accordance with the principle that the ninety days\u2019 period excludes the day \u201cafter\u201d which this period is to be reckoned, that is, March 6, 1940. <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Willson, </em>1 Pick. 485, 495. <em>Bemis </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>118 Mass. 502, 509. <em>Corey </em>v. <em>National Ben Franklin Fire Ins. Co. </em>284 Mass. 283, 286. Ninety days \u201cafter\u201d March 6, 1940, included twenty-five days in March, thirty days in April, thirty-one days in May and four days in June, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>the ninety days\u2019 period expired at the close of the day June 4, 1940. The last day of the ninety days\u2019 period is to be included in the computation. <em>Corey </em>v. <em>National Ben Franklin Fire Ins. Co. </em>284 Mass. 283, 286. If June 5, 1940, were to be included in the time for appeal, the taxpayer would have had more than ninety days in which to appeal, contrary to the clear meaning of the statute. There is nothing-in the nature or purpose of the statute to take it out of the ordinary principles governing computation of time. The appeals taken on June 5, 1940, were not taken within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\">\n<em>Appeals to Appellate Tax Board dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
