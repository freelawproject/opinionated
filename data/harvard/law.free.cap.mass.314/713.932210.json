L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 239, \u00a7 5 (relating to the giving of bond by a defendant appealing from a judgment of a District Court upon summary process for the possession of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>land), by which action the plaintiff seeks to recover the rent due at the time of the surrender of possession of the tenement by the defendant, costs and other damages. Said \u00a7 5 provides that the bond thereby required shall be \u201cconditioned to enter the action\u201d and \u201cto pay to the plaintiff, if final judgment is in his favor, all rent accrued at the date of the bond, all intervening rent, and all damage and loss which he may sustain by the withholding of possession of the land or tenements demanded and by any injury done thereto during such withholding, with all costs, until the delivery of possession thereof to him.\u201d The bond, copy of which' is attached to the declaration, is so conditioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\">The case was heard by a judge sitting without a jury upon a so called \u201cagreed statement of facts.\u201d Therein it \u201cis agreed by the parties that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the sum of $150 which represents the amount of rent due the plaintiff as of the date of surrender of the premises by the defendant,\u201d and further agreed, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover costs of suit as appear of record in the prior action of summary process. It is also agreed that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel would testify as therein set forth with respect to the extent of his services in the case, that he and other qualified attorneys \u201cwould testify that his services are fairly worth $150\u201d <em>(sic), </em>and that plaintiff\u2019s counsel paid the sum of $10.35 for a transcript of the evidence. And it is agreed \u201cthat the sum so paid is a fair charge and may be recovered by the plaintiff if the same constitutes 'costs.'\u201d It is further agreed in the \"agreed statement of facts\u201d that the \u201cissue before the court is: Whether counsel fees of $150 can be recovered by the plaintiff in the action on the bond as an element of damage.\u201d The judge filed a document entitled \u201cfinding and order\u201d in which he stated \u201cI find and rule counsel fees is not an element of damage in the instant action,\u201d recited that in open court the defendant, through counsel, \u201cstated his willingness to have included also the sum of $10.35 covering expense of transcript of evidence,\u201d found for the plaintiff in the sum of $160.35 and costs, and directed the clerk of courts to pay this amount to the plaintiff from the sum of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>$300 deposited in court by the defendant, together with costs in the sum of $25.65, making a total of $186, and to pay to the defendant the sum of $114. The plaintiff appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-3\">The ordinary method of securing review by this court of actions at law tried in the Superior Court is by exceptions. There are, however, certain special classes of cases in which appeals lie. G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96. A party can avail himself of the right of review by appeal instead of resorting to the ordinary method of review by exceptions only when his case falls within one or more of these limited classes. Said \u00a7 96 authorizes an appeal from (1) an \"order . . . sustaining or overruling a demurrer\u201d such as is therein described, (2) \"an order for judgment upon a case stated,\u201d or (3) \"any order decisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record.\u201d The appeal in the present case obviously is not an appeal of the first class. Nor is it an appeal of the second class. The so called \"agreed statement of facts\u201d did not constitute a \u201ccase stated.\u201d It is not an agreement \u201cupon all the material ultimate facts on which the rights of the parties are to be determined by the law,\u201d except so far as such rights may depend upon inferences permissible under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 126, originally enacted as St. 1913, c. 716, \u00a7 5, which constitutes a \u201ccase stated.\u201d <em>Frati </em>v. <em>Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430, 431. <em>Petros </em>v. <em>Superintendent of Buildings of Lynn, </em>306 Mass. 368, 369. See <em>United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co. </em>v. <em>English Construction Co. </em>303 Mass. 105, 108-109. The \"agreed statement of facts\u201d does not purport to be an agreement \"upon all the material ultimate facts.\u201d It is an agreement as to some such facts, but as to other matters there is merely an \"agreement of the parties as to the evidenc\u00e9 which shall be considered by the court or jury.\u201d <em>Frati </em>v. <em>Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430, 431. No appeal, therefore, lies from the order in the present case unless such order was \"decisive of the case founded upon matter of law apparent on the record\u201d so as to bring the appeal within the third class of appeals described in G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 231, \u00a7 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>There was an order \u201cdecisive of the case.\u201d Whether the finding for the plaintiff \u201cin the sum of $160.35 and costs\u201d or the order of the court directing the clerk \u201cto pay, from the $300.00 deposited in court by the defendant, to the plaintiff, Pequod Realty Corporation, the sum of $160.35, and costs in the sum of $25.65, making a total of $186.00,\u201d and to pay to the defendant the remainder of $114 constituted the order \u201cdecisive of the case\u201d need not be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">If the order appealed from was founded solely upon the \u201cagreed statement of facts,\u201d the appeal lies. Such an \u201cagreed statement of facts,\u201d though, in part, only an agreement as to evidence to be considered by the court, is treated as a part of the record. But the only \u201cmatter of law apparent on the record\u201d that can be considered on an appeal in a case of this kind is the question whether the order is warranted by the evidence. <em>Ingalls </em>v. <em>Hobbs, </em>156 Mass. 348, 349. <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Sweet, </em>221 Mass. 587, 598. <em>Frati </em>v. <em>Jannini, </em>226 Mass. 430, 432.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">A comparison of the order with the \u201cagreed statement of facts\u201d suggests some doubt whether the case was heard solely upon the \u201cagreed statement of facts,\u201d that is, whether the order was based solely upon matters apparent on the record. It is not wholly clear whether the \u201ccosts\u201d referred to in the order are the costs in the earlier action or the costs in the present action. In neither event does the \u201cagreed statement of facts\u201d show the amount of such costs or evidence with respect thereto. But the plaintiff, the appealing party, makes no contention that the order is erroneous with respect to \u201ccosts,\u201d and without further discussion we assume in its favor that the appeal lies.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">We assume that the finding for the plaintiff in the sum of $160.35 includes $150 rent and $10.35 stenographer\u2019s charges for a transcript of the evidence. And the judge found for the plaintiff in the matter of \u201ccosts\u201d and ordered the amount of the finding and \u201ccosts\u201d in the sum of $25.65 paid to the plaintiff. The sole contention of the plaintiff is that it is entitled to recover in addition to these amounts counsel fees of $150 for services in the earlier action. The judge found against this contention. We cannot say that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>he was not warranted in so doing whatever may be the scope of the bond sued on. There is no agreement as to the extent or value of services of counsel in the earlier action. The agreement is only as to the evidence relating to this question of fact. None of this evidence was-of such a nature that the judge was required to believe it.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-3\">Even if a bond given under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 239, \u00a7 5, is broad enough to entitle an obligee, in a proper case, to recover counsel fees from the obligor \u2014 as we do not decide \u2014 the facts and evidence agreed upon in the present case did not as matter of law require the judge to find in the present case that the plaintiff was entitled to recover counsel fees in the amount of $150 or in any other amount. The order of the judge interpreted as ordering that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover counsel fees does not appear to have been founded upon the matter of law that the bond sued on was not broad enough to cover counsel fees. \u2022 This order may have been founded upon the matter of law that the evidence warranted a finding as matter of fact that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover counsel fees from the defendant \u2014 that is, that the evidence did not require a finding that the plaintiff was so entitled. And, as already pointed out, the evidence did not require such a finding. Error as matter of law in the order appealed from is not shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">The defendant\u2019s requests for rulings and the indorsement thereon to the effect that the judge did not act upon these requests, though included in the printed record, are not a part of the record on appeal. And statements of rulings of law or of findings of fact, though they are incorporated in the same document as the order appealed from and this document is included in the printed record, are not a part of the record on appeal. <em>Watts </em>v. <em>Watts, </em>312 Mass. 442, 449-451, and cases cited. See also <em>Check </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>280 Mass. 170, 174. Compare, as to the practice on appeals from decisions of the Land Court, <em>Sheehan Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Dudley, </em>299 Mass. 48, 49; <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>301 Mass. 125, 127-128.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">But even if, contrary to established practice on appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>from orders of the Superior Court, the document in the present case entitled \u201cfinding and order\u201d were to be treated as a part of the record, the plaintiff, appellant, would not be aided thereby. The only statement therein in the nature of a finding or ruling, apart from the ultimate finding or order, is \u201cI find and rule counsel fees is not an element of damage in the instant action.\u201d With respect to such a statement it was said in <em>Flesher </em>v. <em>Handler, </em>303 Mass. 482, 483, that the \u201ccommon formula \u2018find and rule/ though not well chosen, has been interpreted so as to require us to support the decision if warranted upon the evidence.\u201d Such a statement is to be interpreted as meaning that the judge ruled that the evidence warranted a finding that \u201ccounsel fees is not an element of damage in the instant action\u201d and then made that finding. <em>Sylvester </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>280 Mass. 508, 509-510. In so ruling and finding, for the reason already pointed out, there was no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-3\">This case, like many other cases in our reports, furnishes an illustration of the hazard of seeking review in an action at law by the method of appeal upon a limited record instead of by the ordinary method of exceptions in accordance with which matter not otherwise a part of the record may be incorporated therein by a bill of exceptions \u2014 as may also be done by a report of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">\n<em>Order of Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
