It was referred to an auditor whose findings of fact were to be final. The facts appear in his report and supplemental report. Judgment was ordered for the plaintiff on the reports, and the defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-10\">On January 25, 1939, the defendants entered into a written contract with the plaintiff whereby the latter was to build for the defendants a house and garage in Marblehead for $7,600, according to certain plans and specifications. No time for payment was fixed. Work was started in May, 1939. On June 14, 1939, the defendants obtained a construction mortgage from a bank. The bank was to make payments as follows: $2,280 when the house was boarded in and the chimney was built and flashed; $1,520 when the house was finished outside and plastered; $1,520 when the standing finish was on; $1,520 when the house was completed and ready for occupancy; and the remainder, amounting to $760, forty-on\u00e9 days thereafter. The first payment of $2,280 was turned over to the plaintiff as soon as it was received on June 14, 1939. \u201cOn this same day Gorham [who appeared to represent LeBel] explained to the McCoys the mechanics of a construction mortgage and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>he told them that they must turn the future payments as they received them from the bank over to LeBel and the McCoys agreed to do it.\u201d Later the second payment of $1,520 was received and paid over to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">When the third payment of $1,520 was received, the defendants refused to pay it over to the plaintiff. They \u201cdid not refuse to turn the check over because of any complaint with any particular portion of LeBel\u2019s work.\u201d The auditor found \u201cthat the failure by the McCoys to turn the third bank payment over to LeBel was unreasonable and that it was. a breach of their oral contract with LeBel to do so. The refusal of the McCoys to turn the third payment over to LeBel caused LeBel to have to cease work on the house on Saturday, September 2, 1939.\u201d On September 7, 1939, the defendants notified the plaintiff in writing that unless he commenced work again on or before September 18, 1939, they would hire another contractor to complete the work and hold the plaintiff liable. The plaintiff did no more work, but began this action on September 11, 1939. The auditor found that the defendants owed the plaintiff $1,440 with interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">The plans called for a steel I-beam as one of the main supports. That would have cost more than the six by eight wooden beam which the plaintiff actually used. The auditor finds: \u201cLeBel did purposely fail to furnish the steel I-beam which was called for in the plans referred to in the written contract of January 25, 1939.\u201d He did not discuss the matter with the defendants, and the auditor doubts whether they knew the fact until after this litigation was started. They never waived their right to a steel beam, which would carry more weight than the wooden beam. But the auditor found that the wooden beam was sufficient, and that its use was good construction in such a house. He found \u201cthat the work done by LeBel was good and workmanlike.\u201d But he added: \u201cI make this finding with the. one qualification bearing upon the use of the wooden beam instead of the steel beam. I find that what he did in using the wooden beam was good and workmanlike but as I have set forth hereinbefore I do find that he purposely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>refrained from using the steel beam as called for in the blue print plans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">The auditor found that \u201cthe oral agreement [to turn over to the plaintiff the payments as received from the bank] did not arise from the refusal of either party to fulfil so much of the written contract as remained executory . . . [but] arose from the indefiniteness of the written agreement as to how the $7,600 was to be paid.\u201d The auditor found: \u201cThe manner in which the $7,600 was to be paid was amplified after the written contract between the parties. But, the written contract was never waived or rescinded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The written contract was not indefinite as to the time of payment. Under it the plaintiff was not entitled to any payment until the completion of his work. <em>Stark </em>v. <em>Parker, 2 </em>Pick. 267. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>12 Met. 286, 290. <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Arancio, </em>277 Mass. 310. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Boston Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. </em>310 Mass. 593, 595.

Here the plaintiff furnished no consideration for the oral promise of the defendants to turn over to the plaintiff the bank payments when received. Hence the defendants were not in default when they refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The plaintiff intentionally failed to perform his contract in the important matter of the steel I-beam.
