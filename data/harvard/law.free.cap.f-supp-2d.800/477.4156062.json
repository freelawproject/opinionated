KAPLAN, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">This putative class action concerns the issuance, distribution and sale of numerous offerings of mortgage pass-through certificates (the \u201cCertificates\u201d) issued between September 2005 and July 2007. The Court assumes familiarity with its prior opinions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The matter is before the Court on two motions to intervene pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-10\">\n<em>I. The Securities at Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">The Certificates are a form of mortgage-backed security. In a mortgage securitization, mortgage loans are acquired, pooled together, and then sold to a trust which in turn issues certificates to purchasers who become the beneficiaries of the trust and who then receive distributions from the trustee from the cash flow generated by the pool of mortgages and in accordance with the specification of the rights of the respective classes of certificate holders set out in the trust instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-18\">In this case, the Certificates were registered with the SEC under two shelf registration statements with base prospectuses filed by an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in August 2005 (amended in September 2005) and August 2006, pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act. For each offering, Lehman filed also a pricing supplement to the relevant base prospectus which amended or updated the original shelf registration statement to which it pertained and provided additional information about the particular pools of mortgages underlying the Certificates offered pursuant to that prospectus supplement, including the types of loans and the descriptions of underwriting guidelines for those loans that were provided by the originators. The shelf registration statements and the prospectus supplements are referred to here as the \u201cOffering Documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-19\">II. <em>The Action and Motions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-20\">Plaintiffs are purchasers of certain Certificates who allege that the Offering Documents contained a number of misrepresentations and omissions in violation of federal securities laws. They brought two actions in June and July 2008 in the New York Supreme Court, New York County. Defendants removed them to this Court, where they were consolidated. The complaint asserts claims under the Securities Act in connection with 94 offerings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As it alleges that plaintiffs purchased Certificates in only nine of those offerings, the Court dismissed the claims arising out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the other 85 offerings for lack of standing in <em>Lehman MBS II.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">These motions aim to cure that standing deficiency as to eight of those 85 offerings. Movant Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Mississippi (\u201cPERSM\u201d) alleges that it purchased securities pursuant to three offerings in connection with which the original plaintiffs lack standing to sue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Movant Iowa Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cIPERS\u201d) alleges that it purchased securities pursuant to five such offerings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They seek to intervene as representatives of a class, members of which purchased Certificates in those offerings. The Individual Defendants<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> contend, <em>inter alia, </em>that the statutes of limitations and repose for the claims that movants<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> seek to assert against them have expired and that the motions therefore should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Movants seek to assert claims against the Individual Defendants under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 13 of that act sets forth two timeliness requirements for such claims a one-year statute of limitations and a three-year statute of repose. That is, claims must be asserted (1) \u201cwithin one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence,\u201d and (2) \u201c[i]n no event ... more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Individual Defendants contend that movants\u2019 claims against them are untimely under both requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-16\"><em>I. The Claims That Movants Seek to </em>As<em>sert Against the Individual Defendants</em></p>\n<p id=\"b520-17\">It is undisputed that the <em>latest </em>offerings upon which PERSM and IPERS seek to sue occurred on November 28, 2006, and June 28, 2007, respectively<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>three years before each movant filed its motion to intervene.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The claims that movants seek to assert against the Individual Defendants therefore appear to be untimely. Movants argue, however, that the three-year statutes of repose have been tolled and that these claims therefore are timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\n<em>A. The Statutes of Repose Have Not Been Tolled</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Movants base their argument on <em>American Pipe &amp; Construction Co. v. </em>Utah,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> where the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class who would have been parties had the suit been permitted to continue as a class action.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> There, the respondents moved to intervene in a civil antitrust action in which they had been putative class members after the named plaintiff \u2014 the State of Utah \u2014 failed to win class certification for lack of numerosity. The Court held that the statute of limitations for the respondents\u2019 claims had been tolled for the period between the filing of Utah\u2019s complaint and the denial of class certification. The motion to intervene therefore was timely. \u201cA contrary rule allowing participation only by those potential members of the class who had earlier filed motions to intervene in the suit would deprive Rule 23 class actions of the efficiency and economy of litigation which is a principal purpose of the procedure. Potential class members would be induced to file protective motions to intervene or to join in the event that a class was later found unsuitable.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court stated that this rule was \u201cin no way inconsistent with the functional operation of a statute of limitations\u201d \u2014 protection from the assertion of stale claims \u2014 as it tolls only claims of which defendants are put on notice in a timely fashion by virtue of the putative class complaint.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-14\">The Individual Defendants counter, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>American Pipe </em>dealt only with statutes of limitations and argue that statutes of repose, including the three-year period established by Section 13 of the Securities Act, are not tolled by the pendency of putative class actions. Judge Castel, in a particularly persuasive decision, recently adopted this view.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed below, this Court agrees.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Statutes of limitations are fundamentally different from statutes of repose. The former:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-4\">\u201c\u2018bear on the availability of remedies and, as such, are subject to equitable defenses ..., the various forms of tolling, and the potential application of the discovery rule. In contrast, statutes of repose affect the availability of the underlying right: That right is no longer available on the expiration of the specified period of time. In theory, at least, the legislative bar to subsequent action is absolute, subject to legislatively created exceptions ... set forth in the statute of repose.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The question therefore is whether tolling under <em>American Pipe </em>reflects a judicially created amelioration of a statute of limitations or a legislatively sanctioned means of extending a statute of repose.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">In the first analysis, it must be noted that <em>American Pipe </em>was a case about a statute of limitations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Section 13\u2019s three-year requirement, by contrast, is a statute of repose.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Moreover, the Supreme Court and Second Circuit have cited <em>American Pipe </em>as an example of equitable tolling.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>Lampf Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis &amp; Petigrow v. Gilbertson, </em>the Supreme Court held that equitable tolling does not apply to statutes of repose.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> On the face of it, then, <em>American Pipe </em>has no bearing- here.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-12\">That said, most courts that have addressed this issue have concluded that <em>American Pipe </em>does apply to toll statutes of repose.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> They have reasoned that <em>American </em>Pipe\u2014despite its characterization by the Supreme Court as equitable tolling\u2014in fact is a form of legal tolling, i.e., a toll provided for by statute that properly could be applied here. This, the theory goes, is because the rule arises from, or is a logical corollary to, Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, which governs class actions. But while the Supreme Court had Rule 23\u2019s goals in mind when it decided <em>American Pipe, </em>the rule makes no mention whatsoever of the tolling principle announced in that case. Furthermore, even if Rule 23 did include or imply such a tolling rule, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure may \u201cnot abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-13\">The claims sued upon here are created and defined by the words of Sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>11 and 15 of the Securities Act. Section 13 of that act states quite clearly that \u201c[i]n no event\u201d shall such claims be asserted \u201cmore than three years after\u201d the pertinent offerings. That language is absolute. If Congress had intended that the three-year statute of repose apply differently to securities class actions \u2014 which are not uncommon occurrences \u2014 it certainly could have provided so. It still may. In the absence of further legislation, this Court must apply the statute as written.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">This ruling is in tension with the policies animating the <em>American Pipe </em>decision. That decision, however, spoke only of tolling statutes of limitations \u2014 something courts may do in appropriate circumstances. When it comes to statutes of repose, however, the relevant policies are those of Congress rather than any that courts might think preferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\n<em>B. Absent Tolling, These Claims are Untimely</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">IPERS contends that its claims would be timely even if <em>American Pipe </em>tolling does not apply. Its claims, it argues, \u201c \u2018relate back\u2019 to the filling of the Initial Complaint on July 23, 2008.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c) enumerates certain circumstances in which amendments to pleadings are treated, for statute of limitations purposes, as if made on the date the original pleading was filed. As noted earlier, though, the Rules Enabling Act prohibits federal rules from enlarging substantive rights. In consequence, as a number of courts have stated, the Rule 15(c) relation back doctrine does not apply to statutes of repose.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Furthermore, this Court has serious doubts as to whether the doctrine ever applies to cases such as this one. If it did, the <em>American Pipe </em>rule would be superfluous. In other words, \u201c[i]f in <em>American Pipe </em>the Court had believed that relation back controlled, it would not have gone into its long discussion of Rule 23.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">\n<em>II. The Claims That Movants Seek to Assert Against the Other Defendants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A6U\">Only the Individual Defendants have opposed these motions to intervene. As discussed above, all of the claims that movants seek to assert against them \u2014 Section 11 and 15 claims<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u2014 are barred by the three-year statute of repose requiring that such claims be asserted within three years of the pertinent offerings. The motions to intervene therefore must be denied with respect to all claims that movants seek to assert against the Individual Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">The Court\u2019s discussion respecting statutes of repose resolves also the timeliness of most of the claims that movants seek to assert against other defendants. Naturally, the Section 11 claims that movants seek to assert against other defendants are un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>timely for the same reasons that those claims are untimely as against the Individual Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Certain Section 12(a)(2) claims that movants seek to assert<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> are time-barred as well. Section 12(a)(2) claims are governed by a slightly different statute of repose they must be brought within three years of the date of <em>sale.</em><footnotemark><em>31</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Both movants seek to assert Section 12(a)(2) claims in connection with sales allegedly completed more than three years before they moved to intervene.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In light of the Court\u2019s conclusion that statutes of repose are not tolled by <em>American Pipe, </em>these claims are untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">However, movants seek to assert also certain Section 12(a)(2) claims that are not barred by the three-year statute of repose. PERSM purchased FFMLT 2006-FFB Certificates on and after September 14, 2007<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> \u2014 less than three years before it moved to intervene. IPERS purchased SASC 2007-BC1 Certificates on October 26, 2007, and SARM 2006-4 Certificates on July 10, 2008<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> \u2014 less than three years before it moved to intervene. None of the defendants against whom movants seek to assert these claims has opposed the motions to intervene. Intervention to assert these claims is permissive under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Movants\u2019 motions to intervene [09 MD 2017, docket items 241, 323; 08 Civ. 6762, docket items 115, 138] are granted with respect to (1) PERSM\u2019s Section 12(a)(2) claims relating to its purchase of FFMLT 2006-FFB Certificates and (2) IPERS\u2019s Section 12(a)(2) claims relating to its purchase of SASC 2007-BC1 and SARM 2006-4 Certificates.
