T., 1900, by Nathaniel B. Light, from order of C. P. Lebanon Co., June T., 1897, No. 304, setting aside sheriff\u2019s sale to him in case of Jacob L. Light, Assignee, et al. v. D. W.

J., as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-6\">It is not denied that the property in question was sold for a grossly inadequate price. Its value is estimated by a number of witnesses to be from $2,500 to $8,000. It was sold by the sheriff for $960. It is only necessary in connection with inadequacy of price to consider the absence of notice in the advertisement of a well of water on the prernises and of a dwelling portion or apartment, in the basement of the church for the janitor and his family, tb come to the conclusion that this sale must be set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-7\">It is unusual to have a portion of a church building set apart and used as a residence, and as this is the fact in the present case, notice should have been given of the same, as also of the well, the necessity for which is apparent when the janitor has his residence in the church.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-8\">Sale set aside.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b340-9\"><em>jError assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-10\"><em>J.

Vanderlin, 165 Pa. 252; Cake v. Cake, 156 Pa. 47; Young\u2019s App., 2 Penrose &amp; Watts, 382; Ritter v.

Getz, 161 Pa. 648; Germer v. Ensign, 155 Pa. 466; Stroup v. Raymond, 183 Pa. 279; Media Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Kelly, 185 Pa. 133; McGonigle v. Johnson, 8 Pa. C. C.

Raymond, 183 Pa. 279. Wbat other circumstances are sufficient for this purpose is largely in the discretion of the court below, and whether or not we should in its place have reached the same conclusion in the present case, we have not been convinced that there was error which calls for reversal. As said in Ritter v. Getz, supra, \u201c we do not review the action of the lower courts in setting aside sheriff\u2019s sales except in extreme eases, and this is not one of them. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AU8\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
