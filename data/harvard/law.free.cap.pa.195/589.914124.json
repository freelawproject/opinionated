J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The auditor, from \u00a1.competent and sufficient evidence, substantially finds the facts to be as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-4\">On February 24, 1896, John A. Canan was indebted to the People\u2019s Building and Loan Association in an amount liquidating at $3,249.54. Mr. Canan was negotiating a loan from the Washington Loan and Building Association, to repay, inter alia, said debt due to the People\u2019s Building and Loan Association. On that day John A. Doyle, Esq., solicitor for the Washington, gave to Mr. Canan a check, payable to the People\u2019s Building and Loan Association, for $1,254.71, marked \u201cIn full claims vs. J. A. Canan.\u201d Mr. Canan handed this check to Professor Keith, secretary of the People\u2019s who gave him a receipt, not in full, but on account, and credited same on account. The treasurer of the People\u2019s duly banked said check. No one connected with the Washington paid anymore attention to the matter in order to definitely ascertain what had become of the check. Mr. Doyle, however, assuming from statements of Mr. Canan that the People\u2019s had been paid in full, consummated the loan by the Washington, paying out the entire amount of said loan, and taking a mortgage therefor. Mr. Doyle seems to have been careless in ascertaining, or even attempting to ascertain, whether the mortgage to the People\u2019s was satisfied. He only ascertained the fact that said mortgage was unsatisfied shortly before the sheriff\u2019s sale in 1897. At said sheriff\u2019s sale the property did not bring a sufficient amount to pay both the said mortgage of the People\u2019s and said mortgage of the Washington. If the mortgage of the People\u2019s at the time of said sale, was a valid, subsisting lien, the Washington will get nothing, the People\u2019s not even being paid in full.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-5\">Under the facts in the case the auditor decided that the mortgage of the People\u2019s was such valid, subsisting lien; ha so deciding, I think the auditor was correct.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b614-6\">If we assume that the check for $1,254.71, marked \u201cin full claims vs. J. A. Canan,\u201d partakes of the nature of a receipt, certainly it was a receipt of the most informal kiaad, and was, as the auditor states, susceptible of explanation; it would not come in the same category as solemn receipts in deeds, or receipts given as in full of all accounts, after a settlement betweeaa the parties, and the doctrine of Rhoads\u2019s Estate, 189 Pa. 460, as to the degree of proof aaecessary to overcoane its force would aaot, I thiaik, be applicable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>But, assuming the check to be a receipt in full, would not the legal rule apply that \u201c payment of part of a debt due without a release under seal, although received in full satisfaction, will not discharge the debt? \u201d Hartman v. Danner, 74 Pa. 36. Unquestionably said legal rule is a technical one and has been greatly relaxed; but such relaxation has been to compel the party creditor to carry out his agreement not to give the party debtor an unfair advantage. Most of the cases cited by counsel for ex-ceptants were instances where the creditor had agreed to accept something in full satisfaction ; after receipt of same he sought to shelter himself behind the said technical legal rule cited from Hartman v. Danner, supra; the court, in order to avoid said rule, applied the doctrine of accord and satisfaction. But, as a general rule, this doctrine of accord and satisfaction rests for its foundation on a mutual agreement between the respective parties, between the debtor and creditor, or between the creditor and the third party making the payment. That this is so is shown by most of the authorities cited by said counsel. \u201c It must be proved not only that the thing was delivered, but that it was received in satisfactionParsons on Contracts (6th ed.), *685. There must be an \u201caggregatio mentium:\u201d Fuller v. Kemp, 20 Law. Ann. Rep. 801. And that there must be such mutual agreement, even when the note or check, of a third party constitutes the consideration is shown by the syllabus in Lauer v. Yetzer, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 461. It is there said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-5\">\u201c Where a creditor accepts the note of a third person in payment of his debt, a novation takes place, but the mere acceptance of such note, however, does not constitute a novation without some evidence that it was taken in satisfaction of the debt. The burden of proof is upon the party asserting the novation.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-6\">But there was no \u201c aggregatio mentium \u201d in the present instance. The auditor specifically so finds in his eighth finding of facts; the auditor there finds \u201c that the People\u2019s Building and Loan Association never entered into any agreement with John A. Canan, or with any one representing him, to take $1,254.71 in full satisfaction of its claim against him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b615-7\">As has already been stated in most cases cited, there was an agreement between the parties, an aggregatio mentium. In some of the cases cited, however, there is an absence of such ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>press agreement; said latter eases rest on the doctrine of estoppel. \u201c One who accepts a payment tendered to him in full satisfaction of his claim is estopped from claiming thereafter a balance on such claim: \u201d Economy Coal, etc., Co. v. Bracewell, 78 111. App. 335.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-5\">But \u201c it rests upon the party setting up an estoppel to show the grounds on which it restsWood v. Bullard, 151 Mass. 331; such \u201cparty\u201d should \u201cshow,\u201d as one of \u201cthe grounds\u201d of an estoppel, knowledge on part of the creditor to be estopped, for without knowledge there can be no estoppel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-6\">In 11 Am..&amp; Eng. Ency. of Law (new ed.), p. 433, it is said: \u201cIt may be stated as a general rule, that the representation or concealment relied on to sustain an estoppel must have been made with full knowledge of the facts by the party to be estopped, unless his ignorance was the result of gross negligence. ...\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-7\">In all the cases accessible to me, cited by counsel, analogous in anywise to the present, there was such full knowledge that the check was tendered as full payment. In the following stated cases a letter, or letters, had passed between the parties explicitly calling attention to the fact that the check, or draft, was in full, and, in some of said letters, it was stated that, if the check was not so accepted, it should be returned: Washington N. Gas Co. v. Johnson, 123 Pa. 593; Christman v. Martin, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 572; Rumsey v. Barber, 78 Ill. App. 88; Fuller v. Kemp, 20 Law. Ann. Rep. 801. In other of the cases cited by counsel the creditor gave a receipt in full, thus conclusively showing that he knew the intent with which the payment was made; said latter cases are Golden v. Bartlett Illuminating Co., 114 Mich\u00a1 625, and Goddard v. O\u2019Brien, L. R. 9 Q. B. Div. 37. In Keck v. Hotel Owners Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 89 Iowa, 200, the assured knew the conditions when she indorsed the draft.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b616-8\">But, it seems to me, that there is a marked distinction between the cases cited and the present one. In all of the said cited cases there was full knowledge; in the present instance there is no proof that any officer of the People\u2019s Building and Loan Association knowingly received a less, in payment of, a greater sum. Professor Keith, the secretary, swears that if he had noticed the words, \u201c in full, \u201d on the check he would not have accepted it. After the secretary inadvertently had accepted it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>no estoppel could be based on the act of the treasurer in indorsing it, because the treasurer had no personal knowledge as to whether it was the exact amount due from Canan or not. The auditor finds that \u201cthere is no evidence to the effect that the officers, through whose hands the check passed, even noticed the words, \u2018 In fuil claims v. J. A. Canan.\u201d\u2019 In view of this finding, and the legal principle, heretofore alluded to, that the burden is on the Washington Loan and Building Association to establish every element of estoppel, I think the claim of estoppel is unavailing in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-5\">If it be urged, however, that Secretary Keith was negligent in failing to notice the words on the check \u201c in full,\u201d etc., the rejfiy, it seems to me, is that Solicitor Doyle, of the Washington, was more negligent in allowing John A. Canan, the borrower, to transact business which it was the duty of Mr. Doyle personally to attend to. The auditor finds in effect that the loss, to the Washington, resulted by reason of Mr. Doyle\u2019s too implicit confidence in Mr. Canan. But by giving the check to Mr. Ca-nan, and relying on his representations that everything was right, instead of personally going to the officials of the People\u2019s, Mr. Doyle put it in the power of Mr. Canan to do the wrong. Hence, on the principle then when one of two innocent parties must suffer for the wrongful act of a third party, he must suffer who put it in the power of such third party to do the wrong. Mr. Doyle\u2019s association, the Washington, must suffer, rather than the People\u2019s.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-6\">\u201c It is not in evidence that Mr. Doyle had any communication whatever with the People\u2019s Building and Loan Association or any of its officers relative to the business of repaying the Canan loan. It appears that he relied upon Mr. Canan attending to it.\u201d (I quote from the auditor\u2019s report.) If, then, Mr. Doyle believed as the auditor finds he did, that the sum of $1,254.71, the amount of the check, would repay the People\u2019s in full, such belief must have been engendered by statements made by Mr. Canan, because if any liquidation was presented to him the \u201c auditor is of the opinion that the weight of testimony shows that if a liquidation was furnished it was for the full amount,\u201d $8,249.54.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b617-7\">If such liquidation was furnished its very form suggested the prudent business course for Mr. Doyle to pursue, namely, to go to the treasurer of the People\u2019s, pay $3,249.54, or ascertain why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>a smaller amount would be in full, and get an order to satisfy the prior mortgage. If Mr. Doyle chose not to follow such prudent business course, a course which it seems to me would be dictated by the instincts of any man of ordinary care, independent of any suggestions contained in a liquidation form, but chose rather to entrust the transaction of the affair to Mr. Canan, the borrower, and to rely on the statements of such borrower, rather than to take the trouble to communicate with officers of the People\u2019s then I think the loss occasioned by such carelessness should fall on the Washington, rather than on the People\u2019s, because the negligence of Mr. Doyle, solicitor of the Washington, was greater, and was more efficient in causing the loss, than was that of Professor Keith, secretary of the People\u2019s, in failing to notice that the check was marked \u201c in full.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-4\">Now, March 19, 1900, the exceptions are overruled and the report of the auditor is confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b618-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>among others was in overruling exceptions to auditor\u2019s report.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-6\"><em>Thomas E.
