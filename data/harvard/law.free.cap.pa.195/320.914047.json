At the time of the accident there was recess at the school which the plaintiff attended, and plaintiff with other children was playing in the road near the schoolhouse, on which defendant operated its railway. The evidence showed that the car was run at a high rate of speed. The evidence as to whether a gong was rung was conflicting. Harry Gaughan, the motorman in charge of the car, testified that when he was about fifty or sixty yards away from where the accident occurred he saw children in the road on both sides of the track and only a few feet from it. He stated that he did not have time to stop the car before it struck the boy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-5\">A witness for the plaintiff was asked this question :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-6\">\u201c Q.

He knew the schoolhouse was there and seeing the children in the road was notice to him that it was recess, or at least that the school was\" not in session. These circumstances put on him the duty of at once getting his par under special control. Whether he did all that was reasonably proper for that purpose was necessarily a question for the jury. The cases of this kind where it is for the - court to direct the verdict are confined to those in which the uncontested evidence leads to the conclusion that the child ran in front of the car so quickly and under such circumstances that the driver or motorman had no reasonable ground to apprehend such action and no time after it to avoid the collision. In such cases the direction by the court is based on the entire absence of any sufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The only other question raised by the assignments of error is not important. The offer of the conversation with the motorman or conductor as part of the res gestee was not as precise in respect to proximity of time and place as it might reasonably \u2022have been made, and might have been rejected on that ground, but the whole conversation testified to amounted to no more than a question by the motorman whether the witness had heard the bell ring, and the reply that he had not. This was wholly unimportant in affecting the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
