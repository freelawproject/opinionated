This not having been done, I direct you to render a verdict for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I desire before answering that point to call your attention to the fact that while the point recites as an undisputed fact that Mrs. Scattergood gave instructions to her own lawyer from which the will and codicil in dispute were drawn, that is not a fact proved in this case. I mean by that, undisputed. Where there is a conflict of testimony, it is for you to find the fact. There is in this case some testimony which would warrant you in finding that that is stated too broadly; that is to say, Mrs. Scattergood has testified here\u2014 and there is no evidence to contradict her on that point\u2014that she never saw Mr. Peterson, or never had any legal business with him prior to the time she went to him to draw Miss Cum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>mins\u2019s will; that she got his name from a friend of hers who knew him, and that she reported that to Miss Cummins before she went to Mr. Peterson; and she has likewise said that Miss Cummins dictated her will, or had jotted down her instructions to be put into legal shape as a will, to Mr. Walker, and that Mrs. Scattergood went as Miss Cummins\u2019s messenger with the notes jotted down by Mr. Walker to Mr. Peterson\u2019s office. I say that merely because the point makes me say to you that if you find that Mrs. Scattergood gave instructions to her own lawyer, to call your attention to the fact that there is a dispute in the testimony upon that point. With this exception, gentlemen, the law that is laid down there is the law that is to govern this case. The balance of the point, \u201c this not having been done, I direct you to render a verdict for the defendant,\u201d I decline. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">2. The testimony is uncontroverted that the will and codicil in dispute were drawn by the attorney at law of Mrs. Scatter-good at her request; that he was not the attorney at law of Miss Cummins and had not seen her; that when she signed them they were not read to her; and that she was then in her eighty-eighth year and bodily feeble, and solely under the care of Mrs. Scattergood; that between December 20,1896, and January 28, 1897, she divested herself of all her personal property at the instance of Mrs. Scattergood, amounting to $4,900, in her favor, who took possession of it at once. That Mrs. Scattergood was a beneficiary under the alleged will and the sole beneficiary under the codicil, all of which induces the belief that Mrs. Scattergood might have exercised undue influence over Miss Cummins, and the question is not only whether the latter knew what she was doing in signing the alleged will and codicil, but if she did know, how was her knowledge and intention induced? And the burden is upon Mrs. Scattergood to show by evidence that it was not induced by her influence; and that Miss Cummins had a complete understanding of the disposition in these two papers ; and that this disposing intention was not brought about through the undue influence of Mrs. Scattergood over Miss Cummins; and since Mrs. Scattergood has not done this, I direct ,you to render a verdict against her and in favor of the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I .decline that point. I have, however, already stated the law, which shows that in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>parts that point is a correct statement of <em>law; </em>but where a point is not wholly correct or does not state the facts accurately, the judge ought not to affirm it, I therefore decline it.

Justice Fell,</author>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">The first and second assignments have not been pressed, and as regards the third and fourth we are asked to consider not merely technical errors, but whether under all the testimony the case should have been withdrawn from the jury by peremptory instruction to find for the defendant. The issue was devisavit vel non. It was conceded that the testatrix was of sound and disposing mind, and was possessed of testamentary capacity. The contest was confined to the question of the use of undue influence in procuring the execution of the will or codicil.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">At a former trial of the same issue it appeared that the plaintiff, who takes one half of the estate under the will and is the sole beneficiary under the codicil, stood in a relation of trust and confidence to the testatrix, who was a woman eighty-eight years of age; that she had assumed the control of the house and servants of the testatrix, and had expressed her intention to have her property after her death; that she had procured her own attorney to draft the will, and that he had acted entirely upon her suggestions; that at the time of the execution of the will it was not read to the testatrix, and that she in no way indicated that she knew that it was a will, and that the subscribing witnesses did not know that it was a will. In view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>of this and other testimony presented at the trial it was held, in reversing the judgment, that the presumption of the exercise of undue influence had not been rebutted, and that a verdict against the plaintiff should have been directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">At the second trial a different state of facts was presented by the testimony. That as to the age and infirmities of the testatrix, and as to the confidential relations existing between her and the plaintiff, was the same; but there was no proof of declarations of the plaintiff indicating a purpose on her part to secure the estate, and there was testimony that before signing the codicil the testatrix read it, and that it was not signed in the presence of the plaintiff, and that no representations were made or inducements presented by any one. At the former trial it seems to have been assumed that Mr. Peterson, who wrote the will, was the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The testimony at the second trial relating to his employment was that the testatrix told the plaintiff she was going to make her will; that the plaintiff procured paper, and being at the time unable to write, called on a boarder in the house to write for her. At her direction he wrote down what the testatrix had told her. Neither she nor the testatrix had ever had occasion to consult an attorney. On inquiry of a friend Mr. Peterson was recommended to the plaintiff, and after communicating this to the testatrix she called on Mr. Peterson by her direction and gave him the memorandum mentioned, from which he wrote the will. He afterward prepared the codicil on information received from the plaintiff and sent it to the testatrix by a notary, in whose presence it was executed. This testimony would indicate, that in securing the services of an attorney the plaintiff was acting for the testatrix and not for herself. Whatever doubt as to its correctness was raised by the cross-examination it was for the jury; the court could not have said that the will was drawn by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The contestant was a beneficiary under a former will; the plaintiff was the first cousin of the testatrix, and her only surviving relative, and in the case of intestacy would have taken her whole estate. As against her the same presumption does not arise as in the case of one who is a stranger to the blood: Caldwell v. Anderson, 104 Pa. 199. We think the case was necessarily for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
