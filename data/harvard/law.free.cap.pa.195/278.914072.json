On August 1, 1894, the company executed a mortgage in which the mortgaged premises were described as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-12\">\u201cAll the real estate of the Carbon County Improvement Company, Limited, situated in the borough of Weissport, Carbon County, Pennsylvania, with the improvements, consisting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>of: \u2018several brick, stone and frame messuages or tenements, consisting of store and storehouses, dwelling houses, planing mill, stock and drying house, lumber sheds, steam engine and boiler house, ice manufacturing building, stable and wagon shed, and other buildings and improvements thereon erected, together with the steam engine, boilers, water wheels, dynamos, and other electrical machines and plant, ice manufacturing machines, plant, apparatus, and all other machinery and fixtures, therein respectively contained or appertaining or belonging thereto!</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-5\">\u201c With the railroad thereon constructed, situate, lying and being in the borough of Weissport, in Carbon county, in the state of Pennsylvania, bounded and described according to the 'recent plan thereof made by Franz Maekl, civil engineer and surveyor of the said county, in the month of October, 1893, as follows, to wit: (here follows description of the premises by metes and bounds).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-6\">\u201c Together with all and singular the buildings, improvements, machinery, fixtures, steam engines, boilers, dynamos, electric plant, machines for making ice, railroads, sidings, turbines, waters, water rights, water courses, roads, streets, alleys, passages, rights, liberties, privileges, hereditaments and appurtenances whatsoever, unto the said hereby granted premises belonging or in any wise appertaining, and the reversions and remainders, rents, issues, and profits thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b303-7\">On October 24, 1896, the Carbon County Improvement Company, Limited, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and subsequently the assignee sold the property of the company for the sum of 86,000, subject to the lien of the mortgage.

To sever the pole line would be to destroy the plant. The pole line was necessary to carry the electric light current to consumers in Lehighton. It was attached physically and continuously to the plant in Weissport, and while the plant was in operation the electricity created by the machinery was passing to and fro, going from and returning to the dynamos, and thus constituting one machine or plant. Evidently it was the full intent of the parties who erected the plant in Weissport to make the pole line in dispute a part of the machine plant attached to the real estate.\u201d The controversy turned upon the question-whether the part of the plant which was contained within the territory of the borough of Lehighton was real or personal estate, whether it was so connected with the plant in Weissport as to be a necessary part of it and therefore bound by the lien of the mortgage. The above findings, which in our opinion could not have been otherwise under the evidence, dispose of the question. We are clearly of opinion that the court below was entirely correct in its findings of fact and conclusions of law The principles upon which the question was ruled are thoroughly well established and very familiar to the professional mind. It is beyond doubt that they have direct application to the clear facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellants.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
