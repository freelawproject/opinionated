The certificate thus issued was delivered by the customer to a firm of brokers as collateral for his liability to them. The brokers then had the stock transferred to their own name. Subsequently upon the customer becoming insolvent, the bank which held his notes asked the brokers if they held any notes of the customer secured by collateral which exceeded in value the amount of the notes. On receiving an affirmative reply the bank purchased from the brokers the notes of the customer with the certificate of stock as the accompanying collateral.

Baker, Jr., presented to the Philadelphia National Bank, the plaintiff, a power of attorney to transfer to himself seventy shares of stock standing in the name of his grandfather, Charles H. Baker. The power of attorney purported to be signed by the executors of Charles JHJ. Baker, but it was really a forgery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>made by John R. Baker, Jr. The bank made the transfer and delivered the certificate to John R. Baker, Jr., who on the same day delivered it to the defendants as collateral for his liability to them. On November 17, 1890, the defendants presented the certificate to the plaintiff and received a new certificate of stock in their own name. Shortly afterwards, it becoming known that John R. Baker, Jr., was insolvent, the plaintiff, having several notes of Baker which were not fully secured, asked the defendants if they held any notes of Baker secured by collateral in which the value of the collateral exceeded the amount of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">Upon receiving an affirmative reply, the plaintiff purchased from the defendant the notes of Baker with the certificate of the seventy shares of stock, the accompanying collateral.

The certificate of stock issued by the bank to John R. Baker, Jr., November 14, 1890, was delivered by him to the defendants on the same day, and on account of his liability to them. On November 17, they presented to the bank the aforesaid certificate of stock, then standing in the name of John R. Baker, Jr., for transfer to them under a power of attorney from him. In compliance with their request the bank issued a certificate to them, and on November 28, they sold and delivered it to the bank, with four demand notes of Baker, together with a transfer of the col-laterals pledged as security for the same. The sales and transfers obviously originated in the application of the bank to the defendants for information as to the nature and amount of Baker\u2019s indebtedness to them. The accuracy of the information received is not denied, and the purchase by the bank was in aid of its claims against Baker. The certificate issued to Baker, and by him deposited with the defendants as collateral to the loan, was genuine, and so was the certificate issued to them at their request. They had no knowledge of the forgery of Baker previous to their sale to the bank, and their transactions with Baker and the bank were irreproachable. The error of the bank was in issuing to the forger a genuine certificate of stock, but with the consequences of it the defendants are not chargeable. The certificate of stock they sold to the bank was theirs, lawfully and in good faith acquired in the transaction of a legitimate business. In the refusal of the court to take off the compulsory nonsuit entered on the motion of the defendants we discover no error. As we cannot find in the testimony, oral or documentary, any warrant for the bank\u2019s contention we dismiss the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
