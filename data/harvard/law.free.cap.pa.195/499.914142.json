Pennsylvania Railroad Company.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"At_\">Before Green, C.

Before Bailey, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-5\">At the trial it appeared that plaintiff was a postal clerk in the employ of the United States post office department, and that on February 22,1897, the train on which he was traveling in the performance of his duties left the main track on account of a switch which had been negligently left open by a brakeman, and ran into a siding and collided with a loaded car. The plaintiff was permanently injured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-6\">Plaintiff presented among others the following points:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-7\">1. The plaintiff was a postal clerk, and if the jury believe he was not employed in railroad work, or work which railroad employees were required to do, he was a passenger, and does not come under the head of quasi employees, and does not come under the act of 1868. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-8\">2. It was the duty of the defendant to provide proper appliances, suitable machinery, and implements for the use of their employees, and if the jury believe the signal at the switch was in ordinary use by the defendant company, and that its use where the accident occurred, would have prevented the accident, and that the defendant was negligent in not providing a suitable signal at the switch at the point where the accident occurred, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, if they believe he has been injured. <em>Answer: </em>Refused. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-9\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-10\">[The absence of signals was presumably well known to all employed upon it, and especially to those in charge of this train as they passed over the road daily for a long time before the accident, and it does not appear that a complaint was ever made to the company of the absence of signals or a suggestion that they ought to be placed at the switches. The plaintiff himself passed over the road almost daily for more than a year, and must have noticed the absence of signals. He made no request that the switches be supplied with them. We are therefore obliged to instruct you that the plaintiff cannot recover and that your verdict must be for the defendant.] [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b524-11\">Verdict and judgment for defendant.

The contention that there ought to have been a signal at the switch and therefore the defendant was guilty of negligence, is not tenable, as there was no evidence that the absence of a signal caused the' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>accident or in any way contributed to it and there was an abundance of proof that the switch was a standard lever switch * in general use along the whole line of this branch road. The charge of the court below was a correct presentation of the case, and the binding instruction to the jury to find for the defendant was in conformity with the evidence and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
