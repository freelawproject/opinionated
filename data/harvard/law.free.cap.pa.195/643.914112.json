Zaun and Mathias Hartleb, road commissioners.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"AS2\">Before Gbeen, C.

J., which was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-10\">The above bill was brought to restrain defendants from removing or interfering with certain poles of plaintiff situate' in the Buffalo road east of Erie city, etc. The case was heard upon bill, answer and testimony, from which the facts are found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-11\">1. That plaintiff is a telegraph and telephone company duly incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, and lawfully doing business therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-12\">2. That tbe Buffalo road is a public highway, leading easterly from Erie city through the township of Millcreek to and past a public road known as the Fagan road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-13\">3. That the road commissioners of said township have charge and control of said highway, and that on August 1, 1890, the plaintiff asked and obtained from said road commissioners a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>permit to erect a line of poles in said highway known as the Buffalo road, and that plaintiff during the same month erected said line of poles in said highway from the city of Erie to the said Fagan road. That the permit does not state the place in said highway where said poles were to be constructed, but they were, in fact, erected along the south side of said highway at a distance of about five feet from the property line where they have since remained, which location appears to have been given by one of the then road commissioners, and it was at that time satisfactory to the road commissioners of said township.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-5\">4. That by act of assembly approved Aprill4,1863, P. L. 405, the road commissioners of Millcr\u00e9ek township are authorized to lay out sidewalks along the public roads in said township. Pursuant to which said road commissioners appear to have laid out a sidewalk along the south side of said Buffalo road, from Erie city easterly to and beyond said Fagan road, of the width of five feet, which said space so allotted as a sidewalk is now used by pedestrians passing along said road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-6\">5. That said Buffalo road is of the width of fifty feet, and is the main thoroughfare leading eastwardly from Erie city, and is largely used by the public in all the ordinary ways of a modern suburban highway. The travel thereon has been greatly increased since 1890, and since said date many residences have been built on both sides of said highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-7\">6. That the mode of working upon and improving public highways has greatly changed since 1890, and at present such work is done largely by road machines. And a majority of plaintiff\u2019s said poles now stand as originally intended, about five feet from the property line, but some of said poles stand distances from the property line varying from three and one half feet to six and one half feet. And all of said poles interfere more or less with the present method of working said highway, and also are an injury to said highway in some places by standing in and obstructing the free flow of water in the gutter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-8\">7. That said poles as so located are a serious inconvenience and damage to said township in working said road, and a slight inconvenience to the public traveling thereon; and that if set along the property line on the south side of said highway they would not interfere at all with the working of said road, ana. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>would be away from the gutter and would not interfere with public travel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-5\">8. That said road commissioners have recently granted a street railway company the right to build and operate a line of electric railway in said highway, which, if built, would greatly facilitate public travel on said highway, and which would be obstructed by said poles as now located.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-6\">9. That the road commissioners of said township, as they believe, for the best interests of the public have ordered above plaintiff to move its poles from the present location to the property line on the south side of said highway. And plaintiff has been duly notified to that effect.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-7\">10. That plaintiff has some fifty-five poles affected by said order and it will probably cost several hundred dollars to make the change, especially as some longer poles will be needed to carry the wires over shade trees along the line. Yet plaintiff paid nothing for its present location in the street, and the place offered is a reasonable substitute thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-8\">LEGAL CONCLUSIONS.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-9\">1. That plaintiff has the right to maintain a line of poles in the Buffalo road between the city of Erie and the Fagan road, subject to the right of the road commissioners of Millcreek township to control the place in said road where said poles shall be located.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-10\">2. That a telegraph or telephone company by erecting its line of poles in a certain place in the highway, with the express or implied assent of the road authorities, does not thereby acquire a vested right to perpetually maintain said line of poles in that particular location. And in after years if changed conditions render it necessary for the public good that such line of poles be moved to a different part of the highway, the road authorities have the right to compel such removal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-11\">8. That the road commissioners of Millcreek township are justified under the facts of this case in requiring the plaintiff to remove its said line of poles from their present location to the south line of said Buffalo road. And that such removal should be at the plaintiff\u2019s expense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b669-12\">4. That the bill in above case should be dismissed at the costs of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>DISCUSSION.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-4\">It is not necessary here to decide upon the relative rights of plaintiff and an electric street railway which came later upon the street, as the situation of the street is such as to justify the road commissioners in requiring said line of poles to be removed to the property line without reference to any franchise given to the railway company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-5\">The action of the road commissioners is not arbitrary in this case. They are here simply carrying out a general order for the placing of all poles in highways in said township on the property line.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-6\">It appears very clear to me that the road authorities- do not lose control of any part of the highway by permitting the erection of a pole line therein. For if a pole line once located could always be maintained on such location, no matter what changes might occur in the use of such highway, great damage would be done to the public.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-7\">A telegraph or telephone line in a highway serves no purpose of public travel and must be so located and so maintained as not to materially interfere with ordinary public travel on such highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-8\">There is no very great hardship to plaintiff in this case. Its line has stood there for nearly ten years, and now when changed conditions and increased travel make it desirable for the public good that the pole line should be changed, I see no reason why the defendants should not order such removal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-9\">The court entered a decree dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b670-10\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b670-11\"><em>J.

Such power rests largely in their discretion, and if the said change be required in good faith, and the same be not clearly unjust, corrupt or oppressive, it is final, and the courts will not interfere with their action, for they, rather than the courts, are the judges of the necessity and expediency thereof: Act of April 13, 1843, P.
