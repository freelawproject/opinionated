On the happening of one or the other of three contingencies he directed that the real estate given to his wife should be sold, and the proceeds distributed in a manner specified. These contingencies were (1) the marriage or death of the widow before testator\u2019s daughter became of full age; (2) the death of the daughter without issue before attaining the age of twenty-one years; and (3) the death of the daughter leaving issue before attaining the age of twenty-one years. The daughter became of age, and subsequently the widow remarried. <em>Held, </em>that as none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>the three contingencies had happened, and as no provision had been made for the contingency which actually did happen, viz: the remarriage of the widow after the majority of the daughter, there was an intestacy as to the real estate devised to the wife during her life or widowhood.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b320-5\">Argued March 6, 1900.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AWV\">Appeal, No. 304, Jan.

Filbert, remarried on April 12, 1898. The children of testator\u2019s soh filed a petition for partition of the real estate devised to the widow, claiming that as to that there was an intestacy upon the remarriage of the widow after Mrs. Geiser had attained her majority. Partition was decreed in accordance with the prayer of the petition, and the inquisition was confirmed absolutely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b321-7\"><em>Error </em>assigned, among others, was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b321-8\"><em>W U.

But it is only a presumption, and is easily rebutted when the fact of intestacy is plainly apparent on the face of the will. This rule of construction is only applicable when the question of intestacy is doubtful: \u2019Busby v. Busby, 1 Dall. 226; Cassell v. Cooke, 8 S. &amp; R. 268.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b322-8\">It was perfectly apparent from the whole will that the period fixed for distribution was when the widow either died or married, and the court was clearly justified in supplying the words \u201c or died: \u201d McKeehan v.

There was no devise over of this real estate of any kind after the determination of the estate of the widow. There were other provisions as to what should be done with it in the event of several designated contingencies, none of which ever happened. As to those contingencies therefore it was as if they had never been written in the will. The first of these contingencies was the marriage or death of the testator\u2019s wife before his daughter Adelaide became of full age. The second was the death of the daughter without issue before attaining the age of twenty-one years, and the third was the death of the daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>leaving issue before attaining the age of twenty-one. It so happens tbat not one of these several contingencies has occurred. The widow married again in 1898 and thereupon her estate terminated absolutely. The widow is still living and so is the daughter who is married and is of full age. The provisions of the will, therefore, which were adapted to the occurrence of any one of these several contingencies, became entirely inapplicable, and the disposition of the property in question must be sought in the other directions of the will, but of these there are none, absolutely none. No provision whatever has been made for the event which has actually arisen. There is no testacy as to this real estate in the state of facts which now exists, and to make a testacy where the testator has seen fit to make none, is simply an undertaking by the courts to do something which they have no right to do. We agree entirely with the views so well expressed by the learned judge of the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
