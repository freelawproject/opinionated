He went into the basement by the direction of a floorwalker, and after he had made his purchase was struck by a roll of oilcloth which one of defendants\u2019 employees had been carrying. Plaintiff described the accident as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b399-13\">\u201c A. I was standing in the passageway, and the saleslady was in front of me. She made out a check, and while I stood I was knocked down with a terrible blow, and I went down on the floor, and I just raised my head, and I didn\u2019t know what it could be, and I saw a man on me and an oilcloth. I said, \u2018 Don\u2019t kill me.\u2019 \u2018Oh, Lord I? he said. \u2018I nearly got killed myself. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>And it is not my fault,\u2019 he says. \u2018 You see that roll of matting, it was in my way, and I stumbled over that.\u2019 Q. Where was that roll of matting ? A. It was in the passageway from me, maybe three or four yards. And he went up, and I laid myself across the washtubs to take a little breath. And the man who fell on me\u2014he started to pick up that roll of matting again to put it on his shoulder, and started one or .two steps, and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t work any more to-day. I am hurt awful.\u2019 Q. Did you see the roll of matting over which you say the man tripped that was carrying the oilcloth? A. Yes, sir; the man pointed it out to me. He said, \u2018It ain\u2019t my fault. You see this roll of matting was in my way, and that is the fault I struck you and knocked you down. It ain\u2019t my fault,\u2019 he said.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-5\">The court entered a compulsory nonsuit which it subsequently refused to take off.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in refusing to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b400-7\"><em>R.
