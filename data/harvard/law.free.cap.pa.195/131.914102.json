Subsequently another ordinance was passed granting to the defendant the right to lay tracks on the streets, and a motion was made to vacate the previous order of tlio court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-10\">Gunster, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-11\">The preliminary injunction in this case was continued on the ground that the ordinance under which the defendants proposed to construct their road, was tainted; that it had been procured by improper influences. The defendants now allege that since that time another ordinance has been passed by the borough authorities which is not open to such a charge, and they ask that the injunction he modified so as to enable them to construct their road in accordance with this last ordinance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>It appears that at a regular meeting of the borough council of the borough of Old Forge, held on August 14, 1899, an ordinance entitled \u201cAn ordinance authorizing the construction and operation of a street railway in the borough of Old Forge by the Pittston and Scranton Street Railway Company,\u201d was introduced and passed first and second reading, and at the regular meeting of the council held on August 21, 1899, the ordinance was passed on third reading, four of the five members present voting \u201c yea \u201d and one voting \u201c nay \u201d thereon. The ordinance was then presented to the burgess, who returned the same without his approval to the council at its next regular meeting, which was held on August 28, 1899, all the members being present. The message of the burgess was read. After various preliminary motions it was regularly moved and seconded that the ordinance be enacted into a law and passed, notwithstanding the veto of the burgess ; and on this question, the roll being called, five members voted \u201c yea \u201d and two members voted \u201c nay,\u201d and the names of the members voting' having been duly recorded, the president of the council declared the ordinance to have been properly and legally passed, and the same to be advertised and published according to law, which was done. In accordance with the terms of the ordinance, the defendant company filed with the borough clerk a written acceptance of the pro: visions of the ordinance, and gave to the borough an indemnifying bond in the sum of $10,000, approved by the borough solicitor, to secure the borough against any claims of property owners by reason of change of grade in front of their property, and to secure the borough for any expense for litigation arising from the construction of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-5\">It is contended on part of the plaintiffs that the ordinance now in question was procured by the same means that the first one was produced by, and that it is no better. Aside from the evidence which was adduced at the hearing of the rule to continue the preliminary injunction, there is no evidence of any improper influence being brought to bear in favor of any ordinance authorizing the company to construct and operate the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b156-6\">On the contrary, as soon as the giving of passes by the company, and the acceptance thereof by members of the borough council had been declared illegal and improper, the councilmen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>who had passes immediately surrendered them to the company, and as far as I can judge, the ordinance of August 28, 1899, was introduced and passed because a majority of the borough council honestly thought it should be done for the benefit of the community.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-5\">The fact that they were paid their witness fees and expenses at the former hearing by the agent of the company, does not appear to have anything to do with this ordinance. That was all done in connection with the first ordinance, and was done before that ordinance was declared illegal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-6\">I have examined the testimony carefully, and while the councilmen who voted for the present ordinance are the same councilmen who voted for the first one, I cannot find that their votes in the present case were cast from improper motives, or procured by improper means.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-7\">And now, September 26, 1899, it is ordered that the injunction heretofore granted and continued be, and the same is, hereby so modified that the same shall not in any manner restrain or interfere with the construction and operation by the defendant company of a street railway in the borough of Old Forge under and in pursuance of the ordinance of August 28, 1899, above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b157-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b157-9\"><em>H.
