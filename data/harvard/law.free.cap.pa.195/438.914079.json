On October 10, an inquisition was filed finding that Wolf was then, and had been for twenty years, a lunatic without lucid intervals.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">On November 21, Mary Brink had brought a civil action against Wolf, per quod servitium amisit, for the seduction of her minor daughter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-8\">On January 4, 1899, Mary Brink filed a traverse to the inquisition. Subsequently, the court in an opinion by Woodward, P. J., made absolute a rule to strike off the traverse.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-9\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-10\"><em>Edmund G-. </em>Butler, with him <em>James S. Biery, </em>for appellant.\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUc-\">A mere relative or a person with a present or prospective interest in an alleged lunatic\u2019s property is a person aggrieved : In re Heft, 8 Pa. Dist. Repr. 99: Com. v. Schneider, 59 Pa. 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-11\">The sole purpose of the inquisition proceedings is to hinder, delay, obstruct, interfere with and prevent Mrs. Brink in enforcing her rights of action against Solomon Wolf. She is a creditor, has a right of action, has a prospective interest in his property, which arose long preceding the lunacy proceedings. If these proceedings are sustained and are pleadable in Mrs. Brink\u2019s suit, then they are prima facie evidence of lunacy at the time that the cause of her action arose.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b463-12\"><em>Greorge H. Troutman </em>and <em>John T. </em>Lenahan, for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AY1\">were not heard, but cited in their printed brief: Act of June 13, 1836, P.

L. 122, Purd. D. 1272,. pi. 16, includes only persons related to the lunatic by blood or marriage, and persons having an interest in his estate. The' very point was ruled by the prerogative court of New Jersey in Rorback v. Van Blarcom, 5 C. E. Green (N. J.), 461, under a provision of the constitution of that state which contains similar language to our own law of 1874. This conclusion is strongly fortified by the consideration- that the proceedings in lunacy are not conclusive upon strangers, and the fact of lunacy is no defense in an action for the recovery of compensatory damages for a tort in which wrongful or malicious intent is not an essential element: Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Showalter, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 452. The exhaustive opinion of Rice, P. J., in that case contains a full review of the whole subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Decree affirmed and appeal dismissed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
