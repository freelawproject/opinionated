J.</author>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for one count of unlawful possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence discovered during a search of his car following a traffic stop. Defendant argues that the police officer extended defendant\u2019s initial, lawful detention of defendant for a traffic offense without reasonable suspicion to do that and, therefore, the evidence obtained during the search must be suppressed. The state concedes that the police unlawfully extended the traffic stop; however, it asserts that we should affirm the trial court under the \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine, <em>see Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (setting out conditions under which a reviewing court may, as a matter of discretion, affirm the ruling of a lower court on an alternative basis), because defendant was advised of his right to refuse consent and testified that he understood that right. In the state\u2019s view, \u201c[t]hat mitigating circumstance was sufficient to attenuate defendant\u2019s consent from the unlawful stop,\u201d rendering the evidence nonetheless admissible.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant responds that we cannot affirm on that alternative basis because, among other reasons, the record could have developed differently had the attenuation issue been raised in the trial court. We agree with defendant; accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion for legal error and are bound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical facts that are supported by evidence in the record. <em>State v. Bailey, </em>356 Or 486, 489, 338 P3d 702 (2014). With one exception noted below, the pertinent facts in this case are undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Oregon State Police Trooper Macy stopped defendant for speeding at 7:45 a.m. on a September morning. As he approached the driver\u2019s side of defendant\u2019s car, he noticed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>that defendant was wearing a long-sleeved jacket or sweater that was zipped up to his chin, which seemed unusual to Macy because it was a hot morning. Macy thought it could have been \u201cto cover up any sort of scars, marks, tattoos, anything like that on his arms.\u201d He also noticed that defendant was \u201cvery nervous.\u201d Macy asked defendant for his driver license, registration, and insurance, and, when defendant handed them to the officer, Macy testified that defendant was shaking visibly and displayed \u201cfacial twitches,\u201d which Macy recognized as a sign of stimulant use. Macy asked defendant why he was so nervous; defendant responded that \u201c[h]e doesn\u2019t like the presence of police officers.\u201d Macy also asked defendant if he had any weapons or marijuana in the car; defendant said \u201cno\u201d to both questions. Macy then asked if he had any methamphetamine in the car, and defendant looked away and said, \u201cnot that he knew of.\u201d Because of defendant\u2019s change in demeanor when asked about methamphetamine, Macy thought there might be methamphetamine in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Macy then went back to his patrol car and contacted dispatch. Because of defendant\u2019s degree of nervousness and answer to the question about methamphetamine, Macy, in addition to his normal request for checks and warrants, also asked the dispatcher to check whether defendant had any drug-related offenses in his criminal history. The dispatcher informed Macy that defendant had a prior drug conviction. Macy returned to defendant\u2019s car, told him that he thought defendant was in possession of methamphetamine, and asked defendant for consent to search the car. He gave defendant a consent form that stated, among other things, \u201cYou have the right to refuse to consent to a search.\u201d Macy asked defendant to read the form and whether he understood the form. According to Macy, defendant said that he did and agreed to the search, but he asked Macy to \u201churry up\u201d because he needed to get to work and was late. Defendant\u2019s account differs. He testified that he had initially refused consent because he was late for work but had changed his mind when Macy told him that he would then have to wait more than two hours for a drug dog to show up.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>also testified that he had read the form and understood that he had the right to refuse to consent to the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Macy asked defendant to get out of the car, patted defendant for weapons, and asked defendant to speak to his \u201ccover officer.\u201d Macy then searched the car and found a glasses case behind the driver\u2019s seat; inside the case, Macy found a spoon with methamphetamine residue, a cotton ball, and \u201cother drug paraphernalia.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Defendant was arrested and charged with unlawful possession of methamphetamine. Before trial, he filed a motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the search; at the hearing on his motion, defendant argued that the officer had obtained the evidence by unlawfully extending defendant\u2019s detention for a traffic stop without reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Specifically, defendant contended that Macy had unlawfully extended the search when he asked defendant why he was so nervous and whether he possessed any weapons, marijuana, or methamphetamine before Macy returned to his patrol car to run defendant\u2019s license and, further, when Macy returned to defendant\u2019s car and, instead of issuing a citation, told defendant that he believed that defendant possessed methamphetamine and requested consent to search the car. <em>See State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 623, 227 P3d 695 (2010) (police may not unreasonably extend the duration of an otherwise lawful traffic stop to investigate matters unrelated to the reason for the stop without reasonable suspicion about those matters).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The state\u2019s chief argument in response was that Macy did not need reasonable suspicion because defendant\u2019s consent \u201cwas obtained during the course of a traffic stop, not after the traffic stop should\u2019ve ended\u201d; its \u201cfallback\u201d position was that Macy had reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity, thus justifying any extension of the stop. The state did <em>not </em>argue, as it does now, that, even if the stop was unlawfully extended, defendant\u2019s consent was sufficient to attenuate the unlawful police conduct, permitting admission of the evidence. <em>See State v. Unger, </em>356 Or 59, 76, 333 P3d 1009 (2014) (state bears burden of proving that defendant\u2019s consent to search following unlawful stop was not product of police exploitation of unlawful conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">The trial court agreed with the state\u2019s first argument. The extent of the court\u2019s findings and conclusions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201cThis is a case in which the officer stopped the Defendant for speeding. Upon stopping him, he noticed the Defendant was, his jacket or \u2014 he, the officer testified it was a sweater, a zip up sweater. The Defendant said it was his work windbreaker. It was zipped up to the neck. And the officer felt that the Defendant was unduly nervous. He asked for and subsequently received the Defendant\u2019s documents. And when handing them to the officer, the Defendant was shaking visibly and that there was a twitch in his face.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cThe officer in receiving the documents asked four questions about why are you so nervous. To which the Defendant responded he didn\u2019t like being stopped by police officers and that they made him nervous. He asked if he had any weapons in the vehicle, the officer. And the Defendant said no. He asked if there was any marijuana in the vehicle, and the Defendant said no. And he asked if there was any methamphetamine in the vehicle and the Defendant said not to my knowledge. I believe that\u2019s what he said. \u2018Not that I know of.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cThe officer then went back to his car, called in dispatch and asked for his normal wants and warrants and history, and asked also for a criminal history check. That came back. There is no evidence that extended the request for information from dispatch. And the officer asked for consent to search, which consent was granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>\u201cThere is no evidence other than those brief questions that this was [sic] in any way extended the stop. And I specifically asked that the State specifically ask those questions of the officer, and he was cross-examined about that. And there\u2019s no evidence before the Court that there was an extension.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">\u201cThe case law as cited allows an officer to question as long as there is not an unreasonable extension of the traffic stop. I do not find from the evidence that there was such an unreasonable extension, and I therefore am going to deny your motion to suppress.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">Defendant subsequently entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his suppression motion. ORS 135.335(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">On appeal, defendant reiterates the argument that he made below \u2014 that Macy violated Article I, section 9, by extending the lawful traffic stop of defendant without reasonable suspicion of further criminal activity. The state concedes that the traffic stop was unlawfully extended. We agree with and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or at 623 (\u201cPolice authority to detain a motorist dissipates when the investigation reasonably related to that traffic infraction, the identification of persons, and the issuance of a citation (if any) is completed or reasonably should be completed. Other or further conduct by the police, beyond that reasonably related to the traffic violation, must be <em>justified </em>on some basis other than the traffic violation.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)); <em>State v. Dennis, </em>250 Or App 732, 737, 282 P3d 955 (2012) (state has burden of proving that investigation of unrelated criminal matter during traffic stop occurred during unavoidable lull in investigation of the traffic stop); <em>State v. Hendon, </em>222 Or App 97, 106, 194 P3d 149 (2008) (where there was no evidence that the request for consent to search occurred during an \u201cunavoidable lull\u201d in the investigation, \u201cthe state has not established that [the officer] did not detain defendant beyond the time reasonably necessary to investigate the initial lawful basis for the stop and we must conclude that [the officer] unlawfully prolonged the duration of the stop when he asked defendant to consent to a search without reasonable suspicion of other criminal activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>However, as noted, the state argues that we can affirm the trial court on the alternative basis that, because defendant\u2019s consent was sufficiently attenuated from the unlawful police conduct, the evidence is nonetheless admissible. Specifically, in the state\u2019s view, because defendant was advised of his right to refuse to consent to a search and he testified that he understood that right, his consent was not the product of police exploitation of the unlawful extension of the stop and, consequently, the evidence is admissible. <em>See State v. Lorenzo, </em>356 Or 134, 144, 335 P3d 821 (2014) (observing that \u201cadvising individuals that they need not consent to a request to search * * * would make it easier for reviewing courts to determine that, notwithstanding any prior illegality, the individual knew that he or she had a constitutional right to refuse consent \u2014 and that, if the individual gave consent, it was voluntary and not the product of exploitation\u201d). In other words, according to the state, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s suppression motion was \u201cright for the wrong reason.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">The problem with the state\u2019s position is that it did not make that argument below and, hence, the trial court did not consider it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u201c[W]hen a defendant has established that an illegal stop or an illegal search occurred and challenges the validity of his or her subsequent consent to a search, the state bears the burden of demonstrating that (1) the consent was voluntary; <em>and </em>(2) the voluntary consent was not the product of police exploitation of the illegal stop or search.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-6\"><em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 74-75 (emphasis added). Applying those principles here, even assuming that defendant voluntarily consented to the search following the unlawful extension of the stop, for the evidence to be admissible, the state had to prove that the police did not exploit that illegality to obtain defendant\u2019s consent. <em>Id. </em>at 74 (\u201cExploitation analysis recognizes that police conduct that constitutes an illegal stop or an illegal search may fall short of coercing a defendant to consent to a subsequent request to search, but nevertheless may require suppression because the police took advantage of information gained from their illegal conduct or some other aspect of that conduct to obtain consent \u2014 an advantage that they would not have had had the police stayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>within the bounds of the law.\u201d (Citing <em>State v. Hall, </em>339 Or <em>1, </em>27-28, 115 P3d 908 (2005).)).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Determining whether the police exploited their unlawful conduct to obtain consent \u201cinvolve [s] a \u2018fact-specific inquiry into the totality of the circumstances to determine the nature of the causal connection.\u2019\u201d <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 79-80 (quoting <em>Hall, </em>339 at 35). In addition to the temporal proximity between the unlawful police conduct and the voluntary consent, and the existence of mitigating or intervening circumstances, <em>Hall, </em>339 at 35, 35 n 21, relevant considerations also include \u201cthe nature, extent, and severity of police misconduct \u2014 and relatedly, the purpose and flagrancy of that misconduct,\u201d <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 83.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">For us to affirm a trial court\u2019s ruling on a basis other than that on which the court relied, (1) \u201cthe facts of record [must] be sufficient to support the alternative basis for affirmance\u201d; (2) \u201cthe trial court\u2019s ruling [must] be consistent with the view of the evidence under the alternative basis for affirmance\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe record [must] materially be the same one that would have been developed had the prevailing party raised the alternative basis for affirmance below.\u201d <em>Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc., </em>331 Or at 659-60.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cIn other words, even if the record contains evidence sufficient to support an alternative basis for affirmance, if the losing party might have created a <em>different </em>record below had the prevailing party raised that issue, and that record could affect the disposition of the issue, then we will not consider the alternative basis for affirmance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 660 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">Here, the trial court never considered the evidence on which the state\u2019s alternative argument is premised; that is, the trial court did not engage in the fact-specific inquiry necessary to determine whether the state had carried its burden of proving that \u201cthe consent was independent of, or only tenuously related to, the unlawful police conduct,\u201d including \u201can assessment of the actual police misconduct.\u201d <em>Unger, </em>356 Or at 86. Moreover, the record may very well have developed differently had the state raised the lack-of-exploitation argument below. For example, as noted, there is a factual dispute in the record about whether Macy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>threatened defendant with calling a drug dog when Macy asked defendant for consent to search, a dispute that the trial court was not required to \u2014 and did not \u2014 resolve, but which is highly relevant to the exploitation analysis. <em>See Unger, </em>356 Or at 83 (\u201cnature, extent, and severity of police misconduct\u201d are relevant considerations in determining whether the state exploited its illegal conduct in obtaining defendant\u2019s consent). Had the state raised the exploitation issue with the trial court, defendant would undoubtedly have sought to adduce additional facts about those circumstances \u2014 including challenging Macy\u2019s hearsay testimony regarding whether Macy had called the K-9 handler that day. Defendant may also have sought to introduce evidence about the actions of the \u201ccover officer\u201d who was, apparently, present at the scene. Finally, defendant likely would have attempted to adduce evidence relevant to the purpose and flagrancy of Macy\u2019s conduct in extending the traffic stop. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cpurpose and flagrancy\u201d of police misconduct relevant factors in exploitation analysis). However, because the state did not argue that, even if the stop was unlawfully extended, the police did not exploit that unlawful conduct in obtaining defendant\u2019s consent to search, there was no reason for defendant to do that. In short, we disagree with the state that the record here is \u201cfully developed\u201d with respect to the totality of the circumstances surrounding defendant\u2019s consent to search. For those reasons, we decline to affirm the trial court on the alternative basis presented by the state. <em>Cf. State v. Heater, </em>271 Or App 538, 351 P3d 776 (2015) (declining to consider lack of exploitation as alternative basis for affirmance where state made argument for first time on remand from Supreme Court following issuance of <em>Unger, Lorenzo, </em>and <em>State v. Musser, </em>356 Or 148, 335 P3d 814 (2014)).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">In sum, the trial court erred in concluding that the officer did not unlawfully extend the traffic stop in violation of Article I, section 9. Moreover, the record is insufficient for us to affirm the court\u2019s decision under the alternative basis advanced by the state. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b213-7\"> In a memorandum of additional authorities, the state points to a trio of cases involving attenuation that the Oregon Supreme Court decided after this case was briefed and argued, namely, <em>State v. Unger, </em>356 Or 59, 333 P3d 1009 (2014), <em>State v. Lorenzo, </em>356 Or 134, 335 P3d 821 (2014), and <em>State v. Musser, </em>356 Or 148, 335 P3d 814 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-5\"> After defendant testified, the prosecutor recalled Macy, who testified that he did not remember \u2014 and there is nothing in his police report indicating \u2014 that he had threatened to call the K-9 unit. Macy also stated that he had just called the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>K-9 handler; according to Macy, the handler told Macy that he had not received a call from Macy on that day. The trial court did not address the factual discrepancy between Macy\u2019s and defendant\u2019s testimony because, as discussed below, it concluded that Macy had not unlawfully extended the traffic stop, and defendant had not raised the issue of coercion in his suppression motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b215-8\"> Defendant apparently prepared a memorandum supporting his motion to suppress to which he referred during the hearing; however, as the trial court noted, the memorandum is not in the trial court file.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b215-9\"> Although defendant cited, in his written motion to suppress, various provisions of the Oregon Constitution, the federal constitution, and Oregon statutes as authority for his motion, defendant\u2019s argument at the hearing, premised largely on <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>219 Or App 366, 182 P3d 209 (2008), <em>aff'd sub nom State v. Rodgers/Kirkeby, </em>347 Or 610, 227 P3d 695 (2010), focused solely on the principles underlying Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. That provision states, in part, that \u201c[n]o law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
