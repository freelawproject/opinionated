We conclude that, under these circumstances, it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The material facts are these: In 1992, defendant was convicted of two counts of aggravated murder, three counts of murder, two counts of rape in the first degree, and one count of sexual abuse in the first degree. Defendant was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 2004, defendant filed a motion under ORS 138.692 seeking DNA testing. The parties discovered that, in 1999, the Medford Police Department destroyed all of the evidence gathered during the investigation leading to defendant\u2019s conviction. However, one of the nongovernmental laboratories that had conducted DNA testing before defendant\u2019s trial had retained extracts from the evidence samples and determined that the samples remained suitable for testing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>That the samples were in the possession of a nongovernmental entity is important because ORS 138.692(2)(b) requires either that the circuit court make a chain of custody finding or that the state stipulate to the requested DNA testing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, defendant and the state stipulated to the testing of the private laboratory\u2019s samples, but the stipulation included the following provision that ultimately appeared in the circuit court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for DNA testing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">\u201cIf the DNA testing ordered under [ORS 138.690 to 138.692] fails to produce exculpatory evidence, defendant shall forever be barred from collaterally attacking his convictions in this case, including any appeal, post-conviction or habeas corpus proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">DNA testing was conducted and apparently did not produce any exculpatory evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The circuit court entered its order on July 16, 2004; defendant timely filed notice of appeal from that order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In a single assignment of error, defendant argues that the circuit court erred by conditioning the order granting DNA testing on defendant\u2019s waiver of collateral remedies. The state moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that ORS 138.697(1) does not allow the defendant to appeal from the circuit court\u2019s order on a request for DNA testing unless the order \u201cden[ies] or limit [s]\u201d DNA testing; in the state\u2019s view, the circuit court\u2019s order in this case did neither. Defendant opposed the motion on the ground that the order effected a \u201climit\u201d on DNA testing; therefore, it was within the scope of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>ORS 138.697(1). The Appellate Commissioner granted the state\u2019s motion and issued an order dismissing the appeal on the ground that a future motion for DNA testing under ORS 138.692 would not be a collateral attack on defendant\u2019s conviction; therefore, the circuit court\u2019s order did not \u201climit\u201d DNA testing and was not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">ORS 138.697 controls when a final order or judgment relating to DNA testing may be appealed. The statute provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-5\">\u201c(1) A person described in ORS 138.690 may appeal to the Court of Appeals from a circuit court\u2019s final order or judgment <em>denying or limiting DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) testing under ORS 138.692, </em>denying appointment of counsel under ORS 138.694 or denying a petition for a new trial under ORS 138.696.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">\u201c(2) The state may appeal to the Court of Appeals from a circuit court\u2019s final order or judgment granting a motion for DNA testing under ORS 138.692 or granting a motion for a new trial under ORS 138.696.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Defendant argues that the word \u201climiting,\u201d as used in ORS 138.697(1), confers appellate jurisdiction over an order that in any way restricts or constrains opportunities to challenge the validity of his conviction. Based on that interpretation, defendant argues that the circuit court in this case limited DNA testing by requiring him to surrender opportunities to collaterally challenge his conviction, including post-conviction relief, habeas corpus, as well as future requests for DNA testing under ORS 138.692.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">The state argues that the circuit court\u2019s order granted the DNA testing requested by defendant and is therefore not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-10\">Our disposition of this appeal turns on the resolution of two issues. First, does the circuit court\u2019s order, by its terms, preclude or limit defendant\u2019s request for DNA testing under ORS 138.692? Second, does barring defendant from seeking post-conviction relief or habeas corpus effect a denial of, or limitation on, DNA testing within the meaning of ORS 138.697(1)?</p>\n<p id=\"b798-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The disputed order does not, by its terms, bar defendant from making a future request for DNA testing under ORS 138.692. The operative language of the circuit court\u2019s order bars defendant from \u201ccollaterally attacking\u201d his conviction, and specifically mentions only appeal, post-conviction relief, and habeas corpus. It does not mention a future request for DNA testing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, and decisively, a motion for DNA testing under ORS 138.692 is not itself a challenge to the defendant\u2019s conviction; rather, the motion for DNA testing merely sets the stage for a <em>potential </em>challenge to the judgment of conviction. If the circuit court grants the motion for DNA testing and testing produces exculpatory evidence, the defendant\u2019s remedy is to move for a new trial, which, if granted, would result in the judgment of conviction being set aside. ORS 138.696(2) (if DNA testing produces exculpatory evidence, defendant may move for new trial under ORCP 64 F based on newly discovered evidence). The motion for new trial would be a challenge to the defendant\u2019s conviction, but, because the motion is filed in the same action that gave rise to the judgment of conviction and sentence, the motion is a direct, not a collateral, attack on the validity of the conviction. In short, contrary to defendant\u2019s characterization of the circuit court\u2019s order, it simply does not in any way \u201climit\u201d his ability to file a future motion for DNA testing under ORS 138.692.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">We proceed, then, to the second issue: even if the order does not explicitly deny or limit DNA testing, does its preclusion of future collateral relief effect such a denial or limitation of DNA testing as to render it appealable under ORS 138.697(1)?</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We conclude that it does not, because of the combination of two circumstances. First, as noted, defendant did, in fact, receive the DNA testing he requested, <em>see </em>272 Or App at 776, and nothing in the order purports to limit or preclude any future entitlement to testing under ORS 138.692. Second, in the procedural posture of this case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>on this record, any purported \u201climitation\u201d as a result of the condition relating to potential future collateral proceedings is so speculative as to be noncognizable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">Accordingly, the circuit court order is not appeal-able under ORS 138.697(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Reconsideration allowed; prior order adhered to.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\"> The post-judgment DNA testing statutory scheme consists of six statutes; in play here are ORS 138.690 (identifying who may file a motion for DNA testing and where the motion is filed\u2014in the circuit court in which the judgment of conviction was entered), ORS 138.692 (prescribing the procedures governing the filing and adjudication of motions for DNA testing), and ORS 138.697 (addressing appeals from circuit court decisions in DNA testing proceedings).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b795-8\"> Defendant unsuccessfully appealed the judgment of conviction and sentence. <em>State v. Harris, </em>152 Or App 567, 953 P2d 433 (1998). Thereafter, defendant sought post-conviction relief. Defendant dismissed his post-conviction relief petition without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b795-9\"> Defendant\u2019s original trial and conviction was one of the early cases in Oregon to use DNA testing. Four different laboratories conducted DNA testing of samples in defendant\u2019s case, the Oregon State Police crime lab, the FBI crime lab, and two private laboratories.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\"><em> </em>ORS 138.692(2) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-8\">\u201cThe court shall order the DNA testing requested in a motion under subsection (1) of this section if the court finds that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">\u00ab\u00ab** *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-10\">\u201c(b) Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, the evidence to be tested is in the possession of a city, county, state or the court and has been subject to a chain of custody sufficient to establish that the evidence has not been altered in any material respect.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b796-11\"> The result of the DNA testing is not reflected in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b796-12\"> Senate Bill (SB) 42 (2013) authorized this court to decide appeals from dispositions of requests for DNA testing under ORS 138.690. SB 42 allowed defendants who had previously sought DNA testing to file an appeal within 90 days of the effective date of SB 42. Appellant timely filed this appeal on the ninetieth day following the effective date of SB 42.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b798-7\"> Indeed, part 3 of the circuit court\u2019s order contemplates the possibility of future DNA testing. The authorization to conduct DNA testing was subject to this provision: \u201cThat the DNA evidence at [the private laboratory] shall not be consumed by the re-testing at this time so that subsequent retesting may occur if deemed necessary by either party and allowed by this court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b799-6\"> We imply no view as to the enforceability of that condition, which may be properly considered in the event that defendant pursues future collateral proceedings and the state seeks dismissal of such proceedings based on the condition in the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
