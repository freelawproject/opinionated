J.</author>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Petitioner seeks review of a Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision order that deferred petitioner\u2019s parole release date from December 2009 to December 2011. He assigns error to the board\u2019s decision to defer his release date, which was based on its finding that petitioner had a \u201cpresent severe emotional disturbance\u201d (PSED). Petitioner contends that the board could make that finding only if the psychological report evaluating petitioner formally diagnosed petitioner as having a PSED. Consequently, he argues that, because the psychological report explicitly stated that he did not have a PSED, the board could not defer his release date. We disagree and, for the reasons explained below, affirm the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Petitioner committed murder during a drug transaction in March 1989. He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after a 20-year minimum term of incarceration and assigned a release date of December 26, 2009. Petitioner was sentenced under the \u201cmatrix\u201d system, which required the board to assign petitioner an initial parole release date within a specified time of being admitted to an Oregon correctional institution. <em>See </em>ORS 144.120(1) (1989), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 1991, ch 126, \u00a7 6. Under ORS 144.125(3) (1989), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 1993, ch 334, \u00a7 1, the board was allowed to modify that release date \u201cif a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis of [PSED]\u201d was made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At the time that defendant committed his crime, the board had adopted OAR 255-60-006 (1988), which provided that the board could defer an inmate\u2019s release date by up to 24 months if the inmate had a PSED. As part of that process, the board could order that a psychologist examine the inmate and document the psychologist\u2019s findings regarding the inmate. <em>See </em>OAR 255-60-006 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>In anticipation of petitioner\u2019s 2009 parole-consideration hearing, the board ordered that a psychologist examine petitioner. The psychologist\u2019s report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\">\u201c[Petitioner] does not suffer from a severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the community. Diagnosis would be Antisocial Personality, and, by history, Alcohol and Polysubstance Dependence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-5\">\u201c* * * [Petitioner\u2019s] record is clearly one of a very habitual criminal, some of his criminal history seemingly quite professional in the sense of being [a] planned-out, daily lifestyle, somewhat analogous to that by which most of us go to our jobs. Given the depth of that history, there would be concern that he would return to illegal activity, most likely [of] a larcenist or drug [-] trafficking nature, and any potential for violence would probably be ancillary to that lifestyle. Such danger would be considered significant, although not nearly as acute as that for an inmate with a more habitually aggressive arrest record, or a record of volatility within the institution. He has kept control of himself during this incarceration, and one would expect the same to continue, albeit to potentially [be] jeopardized, should he return to other criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">On the basis of that report, the board determined that \u201cthe psychological evaluation does constitute a finding that the offender has a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community\u201d and deferred for 24 months petitioner\u2019s release on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">Petitioner sought administrative review of the board\u2019s decision, arguing, among other things, that the board had erred \u201cwhen [it] fail[ed] to follow the recommendation of [the psychologist] for \u2018Release\u2019 when he clearly states that the petitioner \u2018does not suffer from a severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the community.\u2019\u201d The board denied petitioner\u2019s request for review on the grounds that petitioner\u2019s arguments \u201care not supported by the factual record, *** are without merit, or some combination of these factors.\u201d Petitioner, having exhausted his administrative remedies, now seeks judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>Petitioner renews his argument that \u201cthe board could defer an inmate\u2019s release only if the inmate\u2019s psychological * * * report contained a formal [PSED] diagnosis.\u201d To make that argument, petitioner relies on OAR 255-60-006 (1988), which provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-4\">\u201c(1) At any time prior to a prisoner\u2019s scheduled parole release date, the Board may conduct a parole release hearing to review the prisoner\u2019s parole plan, psychiatric/psychological reports, if any * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-5\">\u00abM: * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-6\">\u201c(7) The Board may order a psychiatric/psychological report anytime prior to the release. If the record indicates that a psychiatric or psychological condition of severe emotional disturbance, such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, is present, the Board may consider deferring parole release until a specified future date.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b206-7\">\u201c(8) If the evaluation does not make a finding of severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community, the Board shall affirm the parole release date and set parole conditions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Petitioner argues that we held in <em>Peek v. Thompson, </em>160 Or App 260, 980 P2d 178, <em>rev dismissed, </em>329 Or 553 (1999), that that regulation laid out a two-step process. First, he posits, the report must contain a \u201cformal finding\u201d of PSED, OAR 255-60-006(8) (1988), and, only then, can the board consider deferring petitioner\u2019s release date under OAR 255-60-006(7) (1988). Consequently, petitioner argues, the board did not have the authority to defer his release date because the psychological report concluded that he did not have a PSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">The board offers a different reading of OAR 255-60-006 (1988) and <em>Peek. </em>The board contends that we held in <em>Peek </em>that, before determining whether it will defer an inmate\u2019s release date under OAR 255-60-006 (1988), <em>the board </em>must determine whether \u201cthe psychologist\u2019s report supports the board\u2019s finding of PSED.\u201d Therefore, the board\u2019s argument continues, when reviewing the board\u2019s determination that a petitioner had a PSED, the reviewing court\u2019s task is to determine whether there was substantial evidence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>support the board\u2019s conclusion, not whether the psychologist made a formal finding of PSED. In support of that reading of OAR 255-60-006 (1988) and <em>Peek, </em>the board notes that we stated in <em>Gordon v. Board of Parole, </em>246 Or App 600, 610, 267 P3d 188 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 341 (2012), that PSED is a legal rather than a medical term. If that is the case, it argues, then it logically follows that the board, rather than a psychologist, is in the best position to determine whether the psychologist\u2019s report supports a finding of PSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Given the parties\u2019 disagreement about how OAR 255-60-006 (1988) works, we begin with an overview of our case law interpreting that rule and other relevant statutes. Ironically, our discussion of that rule begins with <em>Weidner v. Armenakis, </em>154 Or App 12, 959 P2d 623, <em>vac'd and rem'd, </em>327 Or 317 (1998), <em>withdrawn by order </em>July 17, <em>1998, reasoning reaffirmed and readopted in Merrill v. Johnson, </em>155 Or App 295, 964 P2d 284, <em>rev den, </em>328 Or 40 (1998),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a case in which neither party mentioned OAR 255-60-006 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In <em>Weidner, </em>the petitioner appealed the board\u2019s decision to defer his release date, which was based on a determination that he had a PSED. The petitioner argued, among other things, that the board had erred because the psychologist\u2019s report did not diagnose him as having a PSED and, consequently, the board could not defer his release date under ORS 144.125(3) (1993). <em>Weidner, </em>154 Or App at 19. The petitioner failed to make any argument under OAR 255-60-006 (1988). We rejected the petitioner\u2019s argument and held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201cthe determination as to whether a prisoner suffers from a [PSED] such as to constitute a danger to the health and safety of the community is a judgment that the legislature intended the Board to make. Although a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis is a prerequisite to the Board\u2019s consideration of whether the statutory criteria have been met, that diagnosis alone does not dictate the result. ORS 144.125(3) (1991) allows the Board to consider both a psychiatric or psychological diagnosis and other pertinent evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>record in exercising its judgment as to whether the prisoner\u2019s release should be deferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><em>Id. </em>at 19-20. That passage states that, although the psychological report must contain a diagnosis of some emotional disorder, it is the board that determines whether an inmate has a PSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">We were presented with a similar series of questions in <em>Peek, </em>another case in which the petitioner appealed the board\u2019s decision to defer his release date on the ground that he had a PSED. In that case, the psychologist had diagnosed the petitioner with \u201cMixed Personality Disorder with Antisocial and Narcissistic Features\u201d and concluded that the petitioner was still a danger to the community. <em>Peek, </em>160 Or App at 267. Nothing in <em>Peek </em>suggests that the psychologist\u2019s report contained a formal finding that the petitioner had a PSED. The board proceeded to defer the petitioner\u2019s release date, finding that \u2014 based on all the information before it and not just the psychologist\u2019s report\u2014 petitioner had a PSED. On appeal, the petitioner made the same argument as had the petitioner in <em>Weidner, </em>with one important difference: Instead of relying on ORS 144.125(3) (1993), the petitioner in <em>Peek </em>relied on OAR 255-60-006(8) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">In <em>Peek, </em>we began by addressing whether the board was required to determine whether the psychologist had diagnosed the petitioner with PSED and what information it could consider in coming to that conclusion. 160 Or App at 264-66. After noting that the dissent in <em>Weidner </em>had argued that the board was required to look only to the psychological report to determine whether it had the authority to extend the release date, we concluded that OAR 255-60-006(8) had adopted precisely that <em>approach </em>\u2014 viz., that the regulation limited the documents that the board could consider when deciding whether an inmate has a PSED. <em>Id. </em>at 266 n 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Next, we addressed \u201cwhether the psychologist\u2019s report would permit the board\u201d to conclude that the petitioner had a PSED. <em>Id. </em>at 266. We reiterated that PSED is a legal rather than a medical standard that \u201cnecessarily requires some translation from one system to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 268. We clarified that the board could conclude that the petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>had a PSED if he had an \u201c\u2018emotional disorder [that] was (a) present, (b) severe, and (c) one that made the prisoner a \u201cdanger to the health and safety of the community.\u2019\u201d\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Weidner, </em>154 Or App at 18). Furthermore, we noted that a \u201c\u2018diagnosis\u2019 of a mental disorder, standing alone, will not always provide the necessary information\u201d to conclude that an inmate has a PSED. <em>Id. </em>After concluding that it was unclear whether the petitioner\u2019s disorder was severe and caused the petitioner to be dangerous, we remanded the case back to the board to make precisely those determinations. <em>Id. </em>at 269 (\u201cThe evaluation could permit the Board to find that the diagnosis satisfies those conditions, but that conclusion is by no means compelled. It is, thus, something that the trial court on remand should permit the Board to consider.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\"><em>Peek </em>stands for the proposition that, for the board to defer a petitioner\u2019s release date, the psychologist\u2019s report must diagnose the petitioner with a mental disorder. Once the psychologist has made the diagnosis, the board must, considering the psychologist\u2019s report in its totality, resolve whether the petitioner\u2019s emotional disorder is a PSED. Our decision in <em>Peek </em>to give the board an opportunity to determine whether the petitioner\u2019s personality disorder was a PSED makes little sense unless it is for the board to make that determination. That understanding is also consistent with our post <em>-Peek </em>case law. For example, in <em>Davis v. Lampert, </em>174 Or App 383, 388, 25 P3d 408 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 260 (2002), the petitioner challenged a board order deferring his release date on the ground that \u201cthe evaluator was required to issue findings in the language of the Board\u2019s rule and of ORS 144.125(3), which refer to a \u2018present severe emotion disturbance\u2019 that constitutes a \u2018danger to the health or safety of the community.\u2019\u201d We rejected that argument and concluded that it \u201chas been discredited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we reject petitioner\u2019s argument that, for the board to defer his release date, the psychologist\u2019s report had to contain a formal finding that he had a PSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">However, we acknowledge that petitioner\u2019s proposed reading of <em>Peek </em>is not entirely unpersuasive. For example, in support of his argument that the psychological evaluation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>must contain a formal finding that he had a PSED, petitioner underscores the importance of the following passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">\u201cSo long as [OAR 255-60-006 (1988)] was in effect, it required the Board to treat the statute as requiring a formal finding in the psychiatric or psychological evaluation as a prerequisite to the Board\u2019s authority to extend a prisoner\u2019s parole release date.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-5\"><em>Peek, </em>160 Or App at 265. The problem with petitioner\u2019s reliance on that statement is that the \u201cformal finding\u201d that we required in <em>Peek </em>was not a diagnosis of a PSED but of some emotional disorder. As we have stated in subsequent opinions applying Peek\u2019s analytical framework, the psychologist\u2019s report need not contain a formal diagnosis of a PSED. <em>See Gordon, </em>246 Or App at 610 (\u201cIt is not necessary that the psychological report contain the phrase \u2018severe emotional disturbance.\u2019\u201d); <em>see also Davis, </em>174 Or App at 388 (stating that no \u201cprecise words\u201d are required because the report \u201cmust satisfy the legal standard engrafted into the statute and rule but need not use its particular words\u201d). Rather, for the board to find that a person has a PSED, the psychological report must contain the diagnosis of an emotional disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">As we have previously stated, \u201cthere are four elements composing the board\u2019s determination of a [PSED]: (1) an emotional disorder that is (2) present, (3) severe, and (4) one that made petitioner \u2018a danger to the health and safety of the community.\u2019\u201d <em>Gordon, </em>246 Or App at 612 (internal quotation marks omitted). We examine the psychological evaluation as a whole to determine whether substantial evidence supports the board\u2019s order finding that petitioner has a PSED. <em>Id. </em>at 611. \u201cSubstantial evidence exists to support a finding of fact when the record, viewed as a whole, would permit a reasonable person to make that finding.\u201d ORS 183.482(8)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Here, there is substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s finding that petitioner had (1) an emotional disorder that is (2) present, (3) severe, and (4) one that made him a danger to the health and safety of the community in this case. The report formally diagnosed petitioner as having an antisocial personality disorder, which would allow a reasonable person to make the finding that petitioner had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>present emotional disorder. Further, the report characterized petitioner\u2019s criminal history as that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\">\u201cof a very habitual criminal, [with] some of his criminal history seemingly quite professional in the sense of being [a] planned-out, daily lifestyle, somewhat analogous to that by which most of us go to our jobs. Given the depth of that history, there would be concern that he would return to illegal activity, most likely [of] a larcenist or drug [-] trafficking nature, and any potential for violence would probably be ancillary to that lifestyle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Finally, the report concluded that there was a \u201csignificant\u201d danger that petitioner would commit future violent acts if he reverted to criminal activity after his release from prison.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">It is true that the psychologist concluded that petitioner did not have a PSED but, given the standard of review, that did not preclude the board from arriving at a different conclusion, as long as a reasonable person could have arrived at the board\u2019s conclusion. Here, the report would allow a reasonable person to conclude that there was a significant risk that petitioner would revert to a criminal lifestyle on his release and, in turn, that there was a significant risk that he would commit violent acts if he did that. Hence, the report constitutes substantial evidence that supports the board\u2019s conclusion that petitioner had a PSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">In sum, we conclude that the board could defer petitioner\u2019s release date even if the psychological report did not contain a formal diagnosis of a PSED and that there was substantial evidence in the report to sustain the board\u2019s finding that petitioner had a PSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-6\"> To determine an inmate\u2019s release date, the board applies the substantive law that existed at the time that the inmate committed the crime. <em>See Williams v. Board of Parole, </em>112 Or App 108, 828 P2d 465, <em>rev dismissed, </em>313 Or 300 (1992) (holding that applying current substantive law would violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clauses of the Oregon and federal constitutions if doing so leads to an increased term of incarceration).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\"> Although we withdrew our opinion in <em>Weidner </em>after we learned that the case had become moot, for convenience, we will refer to it in this opinion, although technically <em>Merrill </em>is the precedential case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b211-9\"> The report noted that the danger was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">\u201cnot nearly as acute as that for an inmate with a more habitually aggressive arrest record, or a record of volatility within the institution. He has kept control of himself during his incarceration, and one would expect the same to continue, ableit to potentially [be] jeopardized, should he return to other criminal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-11\">In other words, although the danger that petitioner would commit future violent acts was lessened by aspects of his behavioral history, the report nonetheless characterized the danger to be a significant danger.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
