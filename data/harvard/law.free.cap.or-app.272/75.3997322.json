Mother has suffered from depression throughout her life and has been treated for it with medication and counseling. Mother separated from father shortly before M\u2019s birth in February 2013. As a result, mother parented M by herself from the time that M was born to the time that M was removed from mother\u2019s home in July 2014. Mother had legal custody of M. M was mother\u2019s first and only child, and the transition to motherhood was difficult for mother. A few days before M was born, mother expressed concern to her own mother (grandmother) and to father that she might harm her baby. Mother did not intend to harm her child, but made that statement because she was scared about the process of giving birth, and wanted attention from grandmother and father. Grandmother and father contacted the Department of Human Services (DHS), and mother was hospitalized and evaluated. As a result of that process, mother was provided with six weeks of counseling, in which she participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In November 2013, when M was approximately nine months old, mother left M in the car while mother went into a store. Mother left M alone for approximately 20 minutes. DHS was contacted as a result of the incident but did not take any action.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Mother relied on grandmother and grandmother\u2019s husband to help her with M. They would watch M for mother and, at times, when M would cry, they would talk to M on the telephone to soothe her. At the time DHS removed M from mother\u2019s care, M was physically healthy in all respects and her height and weight were at the top of the charts for her age. M was clean and appeared to be well-cared for; mother\u2019s house was clean and stocked with appropriate food and toys for M.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">DHS removed M from mother\u2019s care after receiving a call from grandmother. In the month or so leading up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>to M\u2019s removal,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> mother left voicemail messages for grandmother, and sent text messages as well, often when mother was not able to reach grandmother for assistance with M. On May 24, 2014, mother text messaged grandmother:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">\u201cYes u\u2019re right. My dog has leprosy &amp; I am a serial killer (or violent schizophrenic) we\u2019re dangerous to both u &amp; my daughter <em>&amp; </em>I might just sacrifice her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">She continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\"><em>\u201c2 </em>the devil. R u happy now \u2014 u figured us out! I &amp; my dog r the devil\u2019s children &amp; my daughter has no chance w/ur god. Ho hum. I\u2019ll pray to YOU from now on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">She also text messaged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cok? U or Ilein-u both seem to be holier than thou. (Rolling my eyes...) I\u2019ll take my chances w/ur heartless god! Goodnight/day 2 u hypocritical plus fana.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">On June 1, 2014, mother text messaged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">\u201cIf u don\u2019t have the energy either I\u2019d understand. There\u2019s only 1 othr person who\u2019s willing 2 take her full-time. I don\u2019t have enuf time 2 recuperate &amp; she\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-12\">She also text messaged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-13\">\u201cThen u wont have 2 expend ur energy or have 2 worry about her. U\u2019ll feel better when her father takes here. Then if u or my father want 2 see her, u can contact him <em>&amp; </em>see how that works out. I nevr wanted 2 b a parent-NEVER!\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">On July 12, 2014, mother text messaged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-15\">\u201cShe cries every single day for hours. We tried calling u so maybe u can comfort her but both your cell phones disconnected me. She cried so much her chest is soaked in tears. \u201cToo bad nobody cares\u201d I told her. She\u2019s all on her own. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the P.D./DHS comes 2 pick her up, I\u2019d willingly give them her clothes &amp; diapers &amp; never care 2 see her again. Much like I dont want 2 see her when u have her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">During the same period of time, mother also had a text message exchange with father; the exchange indicates that mother and father were having difficulties negotiating the terms of their separation and had some hostility toward each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">It is not clear from the record exactly when mother left the voicemail messages, although the trial court could have inferred that they were left on different days. Some of the messages are just short clips of M crying. In one of the voicemail messages, mother stated:<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-6\">\u201cThis message is for anybody who cares. [M]\u2019s hungry and thirsty I\u2019m sure. She\u2019s crying. It\u2019s 3:00, 3:30, she hasn\u2019t had anything to eat or drink today. [Unintelligible]. I\u2019m taking the day off. So I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s gonna eat or drink or be changed or whatnot. She\u2019s running around here kind of crying. So I don\u2019t know if anybody there cares. But she\u2019s, you know where to find her.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">In another voicemail, mother states that M had not eaten since the previous day. In another, M is heard crying while mother states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">\u201cNobody\u2019s cares, nobody answers, there\u2019s nobody there for you little girl. Nobody. Nobody. Not your poppa, not your momma, not your grandpa, grandma, nobody, not DHS, not the police department. You\u2019re just gonna have to sit there and cry it out. Your doctor said it\u2019s okay for you to cry it out. [Unintelligible]. It doesn\u2019t help with anything [unintelligible] before you stop [unintelligible] yeah, yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Ultimately, grandmother contacted DHS after mother refused to let grandmother into her house when grandmother, after having been out of town, went to see mother. That worried grandmother and she was concerned because, while she was out of town, she had not responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>to phone calls or text messages from mother, or checked her voicemail. When grandmother finally checked her messages, she discovered that mother had left her voicemails while she was gone. After grandmother contacted DHS, two caseworkers came to grandmother\u2019s home. Grandmother played the voicemails for them and showed them the text messages. The three then went to mother\u2019s home, and mother let them in when they knocked. Mother and M were watching a children\u2019s show on mother\u2019s laptop at the time. The DHS workers talked to mother and removed M. M initially was placed with grandmother and then was placed with her father. Mother was allowed visitation throughout on varying terms. DHS filed a dependency petition the day after removing M from mother. The petition alleged the following bases for juvenile court jurisdiction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-4\">\u201c(a) [Mother\u2019s] mental health problems interfere with her ability to safely parent the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-5\">\u201c(b) [Mother] fails to provide adequate food for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-6\">\u201c(c) [Mother] subjects the child to mental, verbal and emotional abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">\u201c(d) [Father\u2019s] mental health problems interfere with his ability to safely parent the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">After M was removed, mother continued in counseling with the therapist that she had been seeing since January 2014. Around the time of M\u2019s removal, mother\u2019s therapist had been in the process of adjusting her antidepressants, and mother continued with that process. Mother also participated in a Dialectical Behavior Treatment group almost every week, to help her with her \u201cemotional regulation.\u201d In September 2014, mother\u2019s therapist notified DHS that she thought mother was in a position to focus on parenting M.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">A month later, a psychologist, Dr. Truhn, conducted a complete psychological evaluation of mother at the request of mother\u2019s attorney. He diagnosed her with \u201cmajor depressive disorder that was moderate, with anxious distress, moderate to severe, and borderline dependent, narcissistic and histrionic personality features.\u201d Truhn conducted a battery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>of tests on mother which indicated, among other things, that mother had \u201csolid\u201d intellectual abilities and that mother did not share the profile of known physical child abusers. Truhn concluded that mother\u2019s \u201cpersonality issues\u201d could be an \u201cissue\u201d with mother\u2019s ability to safely parent \u201cif untreated and in the long term if there were ongoing verbal abuse or angry outbursts or unstable relationships essentially putting her needs above the needs of the child.\u201d Specifically, Truhn thought that if mother engaged in the type of conduct that led to M\u2019s removal \u201cconsistently and as the child would mature, that it could affect the child in a long-term situation\u201d in a negative way. Truhn did not believe that mother\u2019s mental health issues impaired her ability to safely parent at the current time, but thought that they \u201ccould\u201d do so in the future if mother did not continue with treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The hearing on the jurisdictional petition was held in November 2014, four months after DHS removed M from mother. It had originally been scheduled for September 2014, but was set over \u2014 over mother\u2019s objection \u2014 because DHS wanted father to take steps to obtain legal custody of M, so that DHS could dismiss the dependency case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The hearing was rescheduled for October but was set over again \u2014 again, at DHS\u2019s request and over mother\u2019s objection. DHS stated at the October hearing that it had planned on dismissing the case and letting the case just \u201cturn[] into a custody case\u201d between mother and father, but, upon receiving Truhn\u2019s psychological evaluation from mother\u2019s attorney the day before the hearing, DHS changed its mind about dismissing the case because it wanted time to review the evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">At the November hearing, DHS amended the petition to eliminate the allegation that father\u2019s mental health issues interfered with his ability to safely parent M. It added the following allegation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">\u201c[Father] does not have legal custody of the child and cannot protect the child from Mother removing the child from his home, which is a safety threat.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>In support of its contention that M\u2019s circumstances endangered her, DHS relied primarily on the circumstances existing up until July 2014 to demonstrate that M\u2019s circumstances \u2014 in particular, mother \u2014 posed a risk to M. DHS contended that (1) mother\u2019s suggestion before M\u2019s birth that she might hurt her unborn child, (2) mother\u2019s act of leaving M in the car at the store, and (3) mother\u2019s texts and voicemails to grandmother and to father demonstrated that mother posed an ongoing risk to M. DHS did not introduce any evidence indicating that mother had engaged in conduct after July 2014 that gave rise to any concerns for M\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">At the end of the hearing, the juvenile court concluded that jurisdiction was warranted. Although the court found that mother had no intent to hurt her child, the court concluded that mother had hurt M by \u201csubjecting] her to horrible, intense emotions, and le[aving] her \u2014 she wasn\u2019t screaming just because she wanted to annoy you, that was really unhappy wailing, really unhappy, scared, who knows what all emotions she was feeling, but I suspect she was feeling probably pretty scared, pretty abandoned [.]\u201d The court also concluded that mother\u2019s mental health issues caused her to seek help with M in inappropriate, \u201cunhealthy\u201d ways, and to say inappropriate things. The court further concluded that the fact that mother vocalized inappropriate thoughts put her \u201cone step closer to actually doing the inappropriate thing.\u201d The court explained that it believed that mother needed to learn to not say \u201chateful, ugly, hurtful things you can\u2019t take * * * back,\u201d particularly around M, because \u201cwhat you do and what you say impacts other people, especially your child, who, whether you say it to her in a way she understands, if you\u2019re doing it around her, she feels it, she feels it.\u201d The court ultimately concluded that, in the light of the risks mother posed to M, father\u2019s lack of a custody order put M at risk because that would mean, if the dependency case was dismissed, that M would be returned to mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">On appeal, mother contends that the trial court erred when it concluded that M\u2019s conditions and circumstances endangered her at the time of the hearing, so as to warrant jurisdiction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>For a court to take jurisdiction of a child under ORS 419B.100(1)(c), the child\u2019s \u201ccondition or circumstances\u201d <em>at the time of the jurisdictional hearing </em>must be such as to endanger the welfare of the child or another person. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. S. P., </em>249 Or App 76, 84, 90-91, 275 P3d 979 (2012). A child\u2019s condition or circumstances \u201cendanger\u201d the child within the meaning of the statute if they \u201ccreate a current threat of serious loss or injury to the child,\u201d and the threat is one that is \u201creasonably likel[y]\u201d to be realized absent juvenile court intervention. <em>Id. </em>at 84 (internal quotations omitted); <em>Dept. of Human Services v. W. A. C., </em>263 Or App 382, 402-03, 328 P3d 769 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Here, that standard was not met. At the outset, we note that the juvenile court found affirmatively that mother did not have the motivation or intent to harm M. Beyond that, the historical facts in the record do not permit the conclusion that M faced a current threat of serious loss or injury from mother at the time of the jurisdictional hearing. We acknowledge that mother\u2019s text messages and voice-mails, combined with mother\u2019s mental health history, gave DHS reason to be concerned for M\u2019s welfare at the time that grandmother contacted DHS in July 2014. The messages clearly demonstrate that mother was struggling in late spring and early summer 2014 with the significant challenge of parenting a toddler on her own. However, the messages, together with the other historical facts about mother and her parenting of M, do not permit the conclusion that mother posed \u201ca current threat of serious loss or injury\u201d to M that was reasonably likely to be realized without juvenile court intervention at the time of the jurisdictional hearing four months later.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>It is possible that the text messages and voice-mails might have permitted the conclusion in <em>July 2014 </em>that mother\u2019s mental health issues and her \u201cemotional abuse\u201d of M jeopardized M\u2019s welfare at that point in time, but that is not the question presented in this case. Again, to establish jurisdiction, DHS was required to demonstrate that M\u2019s circumstances in <em>November 2014 </em>endangered her welfare. <em>S. P., </em>249 Or App at 90-91. Although there are certainly cases in which the child\u2019s circumstances four months earlier will permit the conclusion that the child\u2019s welfare is presently endangered, the evidence here is insufficient to support a conclusion that the danger to M \u2014 if any \u2014 that existed in July continued to be present in November, even when the record is viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s ruling. First, we note that the record contains no evidence that would permit the conclusion that M was, in fact, harmed by mother\u2019s conduct in any nonspeculative way. Notwithstanding mother\u2019s concerning voicemail and text messages, M\u2019s medical records show that M was healthy and meeting developmental milestones at the time that she was removed from mother\u2019s care. The DHS caseworkers who removed M from mother\u2019s care testified that M\u2019s living conditions were clean and appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Second, this is not a case in which evidence of mother\u2019s past mental health issues alone are sufficient to support an inference of her present condition. The evidence is uncontroverted that mother continuously has made efforts to eliminate any risk of harm to M posed by mother\u2019s mental health issues. When mother became concerned before M\u2019s birth that she might harm M, she communicated those concerns to grandmother and to father, and they were able to obtain help for mother. Further, at least since M\u2019s birth, mother continuously has made efforts to address her mental health issues. It is undisputed that, after M was removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>from her care, mother continued to participate in counseling and seek help for her mental health conditions. As of November 2014, mother was continuing to participate in counseling and therapy, and her medication for her depression appeared to be working. Although, as DHS points out, mother\u2019s participation in counseling did not stop her from engaging in the conduct that the agency found objectionable in July, the only mental health professionals to testify confirmed that, as of the date of the hearing, mother\u2019s mental health issues were being managed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">Third, and relatedly, the historical facts do not allow for the conclusion that the management of mother\u2019s mental health issues in November 2014 was so inadequate that mother\u2019s mental health conditions posed a serious threat to M or that mother was likely to continue to make the type of statements to M that the juvenile court deemed emotionally abusive. Mother\u2019s therapist confirmed that mother was participating in therapy and doing well, and that mother\u2019s long-term therapy plan was to work on addressing the topics that Truhn identified in his evaluation of mother. As noted, Truhn testified that as long as mother continued to work to address her various mental health issues, mother did not present a risk of serious harm to M. Truhn\u2019s only concern was that that mother\u2019s mental health condition might put M at risk of harm \u2014 in the form of verbal <em>abuse </em>\u2014 in <em>the future, </em>if mother did not continue with counseling. DHS introduced no evidence controverting those opinions, opting instead to rely primarily on mother\u2019s voicemail messages and text messages to demonstrate that mother posed a risk to M at the time of the November hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Under those circumstances, the trial court erred in concluding that mother\u2019s mental health issues or her prior conduct in July 2014 posed a <em>current </em>threat of serious loss or injury to M at the time of the jurisdictional hearing in November 2014. Consequently, father\u2019s lack of a custody order at that time also did not endanger M; father\u2019s lack of custody endangered M only if mother, as the custodial parent, posed a risk to M.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-8\"> ORS 419B.100(1)(c) provides that \u201cthe juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction in any case involving a person who is under 18 years of age and * * * [w]hose condition or circumstances are such as to endanger the welfare of the person or of others.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-9\"> The court also took jurisdiction as to M\u2019s father. Mother and father were separated at the time of the hearing, and mother had legal custody of M. The court took jurisdiction as to father on the ground that father\u2019s lack of a custody order endangered M, because father could not protect M from mother. The court indicated that it was finding jurisdiction as to father so as to provide father with \u201cthe assistance of the agency to protect the child from\u201d the environment of mother\u2019s home \u201cwhile the parents are getting their help.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b99-16\"> The precise timing of the voicemails and text messages is not clear from the record or critical to the trial court\u2019s findings and conclusions. Mother testified that she thought that they covered the period of time from May 2014 until shortly before M\u2019s removal. Grandmother\u2019s testimony suggests that the messages, for the most part, arrived shortly before she contacted DHS.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b99-17\"> The text messages were introduced into evidence through photographs of them on cell phones. The photographs do not always capture the entirety of mother\u2019s text messages. In quoting the text messages, we have omitted portions of sentences when the entire sentence is not captured in the photograph of the text message.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> The voicemails were entered into evidence as an exhibit on a CD. That exhibit was played in court, and the transcript reflects the content of the voice-mails. There are some discrepancies between the transcript of the dependency hearing and the CD exhibit as to the content of the voicemails. We have drawn the content of the voicemails from the audio CD that was entered into evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\"> The court took testimony from one witness in September; mother\u2019s father had traveled to Oregon from Puerto Rico for the hearing, but had to return home. The court permitted him to testify about his observations of his daughter\u2019s parenting of M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\"> We note that the text and voicemail messages, while concerning, provide little information about M\u2019s conditions and circumstances while in mother\u2019s care. The text messages were sent sporadically across a span of time from May to July 2014. Each appears to represent one side of a conversation that mother was having with grandmother; without the other side of the conversation, it is not possible to infer much about mother\u2019s parenting \u2014 and the risks she poses to M- \u2014 from those messages. The voicemails also demonstrate little about M\u2019s circumstances. They provide only a narrow window into mother\u2019s parenting of M as a whole, in that they capture on audio brief moments of mother\u2019s parenting, and they do not show that mother routinely neglected M while she was crying or that mother routinely said inappropriate things to M. If anything, they suggest that mother reached out to her parents for assistance in soothing M when she was unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>do so herself, evidencing a concern for M\u2019s well-being. Although mother\u2019s statements to M in the last voicemail message to the effect that \u201cnobody\u201d was there for M \u2014 the conduct on which we understand the juvenile court primarily to have based its determination that mother engaged in \u201cemotional abuse\u201d of M \u2014 could appropriately be characterized as abusive in terms of content, the recording of the voicemail reflects that mother uttered the statements in what could be described as a calm tone, and there is no evidence that M understood what mother was saying to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
