In his opening brief, defendant argues that, under OEC 404(3)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>352 Or 172, 282 P3d 857, <em>modified on recons, </em>352 Or 622, 292 P3d 522 (2012), the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his nine prior identity theft convictions to prove that he had an intent \u201cto deceive or to defraud\u201d in this case, because he did not concede that he \u201cpossesse[d] *** the personal identification[s] of [others],\u201d ORS 165.800(1), and the court did not otherwise instruct the jury that it first had to find that defendant possessed the identifications before it considered the identity theft convictions as evidence of intent. After oral argument, the Supreme Court, in <em>State v. Williams, </em>357 Or 1, 15, 346 P3d 455 (2015), concluded that OEC 404(4) \u201csupersede[s] OEC 404(3) in criminal cases, except * * * as otherwise provided by the state or federal constitutions.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court further concluded that, under OEC 404(4), evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted so long as (1) it is relevant under OEC 401, and (2) as required by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, \u201ca trial court determines whether the risk of unfair prejudice posed by the evidence outweighs its probative value under OEC 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 24.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In a supplemental brief, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>defendant maintains that, under the framework announced in <em>Williams, </em>the challenged evidence was inadmissible without a <em>Leistiko </em>jury instruction. As we explain below, we conclude that defendant\u2019s argument under <em>Leistiko </em>\u2014 a decision announced after his trial \u2014 was unpreserved and, given the \u201csignificant change in the law\u201d announced in <em>Williams, </em>357 Or at 20, defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court was required to give the <em>Leistiko </em>instruction to properly admit evidence of his identity theft convictions is not cognizable as plain error. We further conclude that the trial court erred in modifying defendant\u2019s sentence outside his presence, because the court denied defendant \u201cearned time\u201d on each felony sentence in the written judgment, even though the court had originally announced that he was eligible for earned time after the first 144 months of his sentence. We therefore remand for resentencing and otherwise affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">We set out the pertinent facts, which were undisputed at trial, except as noted. Just after 7:00 a.m. on March 7, 2012, the owner of a truck, Woolley, reported to police that the truck had been stolen from his driveway in Eugene. Woolley had discovered that the truck was gone after one of his employees called and said that he had seen someone other than Woolley driving the truck in a convenience store parking lot. At trial, the employee identified defendant as the driver of the stolen truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">An officer soon spotted the truck in a restaurant parking lot. After the officer pulled into the parking lot, defendant drove over a curb and sped away. (The officer testified that defendant drove away after the officer activated his lights and siren, but defendant testified that he never saw lights or a siren and thought he was being chased by someone who he recently had fought in a bar.) The officer observed defendant stop, drop off a female passenger, who was never identified, and speed away again.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>As defendant continued to flee, he reached speeds of over 70 miles per hour. At one point, he passed a \u201cdo not enter\u201d sign and drove onto the Beltline Highway against traffic. Defendant passed several other drivers and at least one person walking along the road. Eventually, he ended up on a narrow, dead-end street, with the same officer in pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">After he reached the dead-end street, defendant drove the truck into two parked minivans, and one of the minivans hit a nearby house. Defendant abandoned the truck, proceeded on foot, and lost the jacket he was wearing as he ran. (The officer testified that he told defendant that he was under arrest, yelled for him to stop, and grabbed at the jacket, which slipped off as defendant ran; defendant denied that any of that occurred.) Woolley\u2019s loaded handgun was found in the jacket pocket. Defendant was apprehended a short time later, just a few blocks away, by other officers who had been setting up a perimeter.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">It was later discovered that the property found in the truck matched property missing from two cars near where the truck had been stolen: A GPS unit, other property, and a wallet containing the personal identifications of a husband and wife were missing from one car; a car charger, mailbox key, change, and garage door opener were missing from another. A nearby garage \u2014 the one that matched the opener \u2014 was found open, and a $100 Wal-Mart gift card, car charger, and sunglasses were missing from a car parked in the garage. In the same neighborhood, a truck and trailer parked on the street near Woolley\u2019s house had been sideswiped; paint found on the damaged truck and trailer matched the color of Woolley\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">At 4:35 a.m. on March 7, defendant used a $100 gift card at a Wal-Mart. To make his purchase, defendant provided his birthdate and signature. Surveillance video recorded defendant making the purchase and climbing into the sunroof of the truck in the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Defendant was charged with a number of crimes, including two counts of identity theft<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> related to the personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>identifications of the husband and wife that were found in the truck, and, at trial, the state moved <em>in limine </em>to admit evidence that defendant had been convicted of nine counts of identity theft as part of four separate criminal episodes. The state argued that that evidence was relevant to show that defendant acted with the intent to defraud in this case. Defendant objected, arguing that admission of defendant\u2019s prior identity theft convictions \u201cwould inject the worst kind of character evidence\u201d into the case, and that, under \u201cthe balancing required by <em>[State v. Johns, </em>301 Or 535, 725 P2d 312 (1986)],\u201d that evidence \u201cwould blacken [defendant\u2019s] character.\u201d Defendant asked the court to \u201chear the circumstances rather than making a ruling now,\u201d and the court agreed to defer a ruling until after opening statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The court revisited the admissibility of evidence of defendant\u2019s identity theft convictions during the state\u2019s case-in-chief. The state argued that that evidence met the five criteria set out in <em>Johns </em>and was therefore admissible to show defendant\u2019s intent to deceive or defraud. Defendant responded that the prior crimes were not sufficiently similar to the charged crimes under the criteria set out in <em>Johns </em>and asserted that, if the court found that they were sufficiently similar, the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The court granted the state\u2019s motion to admit the evidence, concluding that \u201call the elements under <em>Johns </em>have been met.\u201d Further, \u201cwith regard to the balancing test,\u201d the court explained that it did \u201cnot believe that there [was] any unfair prejudice involved in this,\u201d noting that the state \u201cbears the burden of proof on all the elements and one of the elements is intent\u201d and that the evidence of other acts \u201cgoes to intent.\u201d The state and defendant later stipulated to his prior convictions. The jury heard testimony from four witnesses for the state who described the prior identity thefts, as well as the parties\u2019 stipulation to the resulting convictions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>Defendant testified that, on the night before the car was stolen, he drank beer with a man and woman he met, the man had asked defendant if he would drive the man\u2019s truck to take \u201chis old lady\u201d to a friend\u2019s house, and defendant agreed to drive the truck. He testified that he was unaware that it was stolen and did not have any connection to any of the personal property or identifications found in the truck. Although defendant admitted that he possessed a gift card, he stated that the gift card was given to him (in exchange for methamphetamine) by the same man who loaned him the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The court also gave two limiting instructions related to the jury\u2019s assessment of the identity theft convictions and defendant\u2019s several other convictions (which were admitted for impeachment purposes when defendant testified):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">\u201cIf you find the defendant has been previously convicted of a crime, you may consider this conviction only for its bearing, if any, on the believability of the defendant\u2019s testimony. Specifically, you may not use this evidence for the purpose of drawing the inference [that] because the defendant was convicted of a previous crime, the defendant may be guilty of the crime charged in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-6\">\u201cHowever, the evidence that the defendant has been convicted of identity thefts may also be used to determine whether the defendant possessed personal identification of another with the intent to deceive or defraud.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Defendant did not object to those instructions. Ultimately, the jury found defendant guilty of all 26 counts it considered.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>On appeal, in his opening brief, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting evidence of his prior convictions for identity theft to prove that he had the intent to deceive or defraud. He asserts that \u201cother acts\u201d evidence \u201cis not admissible under OEC 404(3) to prove intent unless defendant committed the act\u201d and invokes <em>Leistiko, </em>a case, like this one, where the state sought to introduce evidence of prior acts as relevant to the defendant\u2019s intent under the doctrine of chances theory of <em>relevance </em>\u2014 i.e., evidence of the defendant\u2019s other acts showed that, because the defendant had performed those acts with a particular intent many times in the past, that makes it more likely that he had that same intent when he performed the charged act. In <em>Leistiko, </em>the Supreme Court reasoned that \u201cother acts\u201d evidence is not admissible to prove a defendant\u2019s intent under the doctrine of chances unless \u201c\u2018the act itself is assumed to be done\u2014 either because (as usually) it is conceded, or because the jury is instructed not to consider the evidence from this point of view until they find the act to have been done and are proceeding to determine the intent.\u2019\u201d 352 Or at 184 (quoting John Henry Wigmore, 2 <em>Evidence </em>302, 245 (Chadbourne rev 1979)) (emphasis omitted). Defendant claims that the trial court erred when it admitted evidence of his identity theft convictions without instructing the jury that it could not consider that evidence as to intent to deceive or defraud until it first found that defendant had, in fact, possessed the identifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">Before addressing those claims further, we must first address preservation. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (explaining that, to preserve an argument for appellate review, \u201ca party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted\u201d). At trial, defendant argued, at length, that the prior identity theft crimes were not sufficiently similar to meet the requirements of <em>Johns </em>and that the evidence was unduly prejudicial. Defendant did not present an argument forecasting the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Leistiko, </em>which was issued after his trial. Because the argument defendant advances on appeal is categorically different from the one he advanced in the trial court, which was grounded in controlling cases at the time, we conclude that he did not preserve his appellate argument.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We may, however, review defendant\u2019s unpreserved assignment of error as one \u201capparent on the record\u201d if (1) the error is one of law; (2) it is apparent, that is, it is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute\u201d; and (3) the error appears on the record such that \u201c[w]e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990); <em>see State v. Jury, </em>185 Or App 132, 137, 57 P3d 970 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 504 (2003) (explaining that \u201cplain error\u201d is determined by reference to the law existing at the time the appeal is decided). If those requirements are met, we must determine whether it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>as explained in <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991). We have applied that plain-error framework where, as here, the defendant was convicted in a <em>pre-Leistiko </em>trial and claimed on appeal that the trial court erred in admitting prior acts evidence \u201cwithout the requisite qualifying instruction\u201d later announced in <em>Leistiko. See, e.g., State v. Jones, </em>258 Or App 1, 8-9, 308 P3d 347 (2013) (concluding that trial court plainly erred and exercising discretion to correct the error).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Since <em>Leistiko, </em>however, the law surrounding \u201cother acts\u201d evidence has shifted yet again. After the parties filed their briefs in this case, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Williams, </em>where the question was whether evidence that the defendant was found in possession of two pairs of children\u2019s underwear was admissible in a prosecution for first-degree sexual abuse for conduct involving a child. 357 Or at 3-4. In answering that question, the Supreme Court considered the state\u2019s contention that \u201cOEC 404(4) supersedes OEC 404(3) and makes relevant \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence admissible for <em>all </em>purposes,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>even to show a defendant\u2019s character and propensity to act accordingly. <em>Id. </em>at 5 (emphasis in original). After reviewing the text, context, and legislative history of OEC 404(4), the court concluded that \u201cOEC 404(4) *** supersede[s] OEC 404(3) in criminal cases, except * * * as otherwise provided by the state or federal constitutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The court then considered what limits the federal constitution, specifically the Due Process Clause, might place on the admission of other acts evidence. Drawing from historical practice and the fundamental principles embodied in the Due Process Clause, the court concluded that, \u201cin a prosecution for child sexual abuse, *** subjecting proffered \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence to OEC 403 balancing is a due process requirement.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 18. The court explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>the Due Process Clause \u201cat least requires that, on request, trial courts determine whether the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. The court held that \u201cOEC 404(4) makes \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence admissible if it is relevant under OEC 401 and admissible under OEC 403.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Applying that framework, the court concluded that evidence that the defendant possessed the underwear was logically relevant under OEC 401 because the evidence permitted the inference that the defendant was an adult who had a sexual interest in children, which, in turn, was probative of whether the defendant had a sexual purpose in engaging in the charged conduct. <em>Williams, </em>357 Or at 21-23. Finally, because the trial court had admitted the evidence after conducting the balancing under OEC 403, and because the defendant did not contend that the trial court\u2019s OEC 403 analysis was erroneous, the court ruled that the \u201cother acts\u201d evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Both parties address the application of <em>Williams </em>in supplemental briefs. Defendant recognizes that, in criminal cases, \u201cOEC 404(4) makes \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence admissible if it is relevant under OEC 401 and admissible under OEC 403,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>357 Or at 20, but he asserts that his <em>Leistiko </em>\u201carguments, and the law on which they are based, are not altered by the <em>Williams </em>decision.\u201d First, defendant emphasizes that, under OEC 404(4), evidence is admissible only if the court finds \u201cthat the evidence [is] \u2018logically relevant.\u2019\u201d He argues that, \u201c[although <em>Leistiko </em>was primarily focused on OEC 404(3), and <em>Williams </em>held that OEC 404(4) abrogated OEC 404(3), <em>both </em>rules require that the proponent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>evidence first establish its relevance.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) And, in defendant\u2019s view, \u201c[ujntil the jury first determined that defendant <em>knew </em>the items were in the vehicle, evidence bearing only on secondary questions regarding what defendant intended to do with the items were <em>not yet </em>relevant.\u201d (First emphasis in original; second emphasis added.) Second, defendant argues that, under <em>Williams, </em>evidence must be excluded when its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. 357 Or at 18-20. Defendant contends that, because the state failed to establish that defendant\u2019s prior identity theft crimes were relevant to intent under the doctrine of chances, that evidence \u201clack[edj probative value <em>and </em>[was] unfairly prejudicial.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">The state responds that \u201cdefendant incorrectly characterizes the <em>Leistiko </em>rule as one strictly of relevancy, rather than of admissibility.\u201d The state agrees with defendant to the extent he argues that <em>Williams </em>\u201cdoes not alter the definition of relevant evidence in OEC 401,\u201d but the state contends that <em>Leistiko </em>was not \u201ca case determining the <em>relevancy </em>of proffered prior misconduct evidence.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Leistiko </em>was concerned with OEC 404(3), the state suggests, and OEC 404(3) \u201cdoes not bear on the relevancy determination of specific evidence,\u201d it \u201csimply identifies a type of evidence that \u2014 although relevant \u2014 is inadmissible based on a specific application of OEC 403.\u201d The state further argues that, because \u201cevidence of defendant\u2019s prior conviction of identity theft was highly relevant and specific to the question of whether he had the intent to deceive or defraud with the charged victims\u2019 stolen pieces of identification,\u201d the trial court\u2019s admission of the prior identity theft crimes \u201ceasily passes muster under traditional OEC 403 balancing and thus necessarily satisfies due process.\u201d On that issue, the state notes that the trial court provided a limiting jury instruction that restricted the jury\u2019s use of defendant\u2019s prior identity theft convictions, even if that instruction was \u201cnot an exact recitation of the limiting jury instruction the Court suggested in <em>Leistiko\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>In addressing defendant\u2019s claim of plain error, we must consider whether the \u201clegal point\u201d underlying that claim is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute\u201d under the law as it now exists. <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355; <em>see Jury, </em>185 Or App at 137. We emphasize that the error defendant claimed under <em>Leistiko </em>remains the same after <em>Williams: </em>The trial court erred by admitting defendant\u2019s prior identity theft convictions without instructing the jury that it must first find that defendant possessed the identifications of others before considering whether he had the intent to deceive or defraud.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the two \u201clegal points\u201d defendant advances in support of his claim of error are subject to reasonable dispute, we conclude that the asserted error is not obvious and therefore not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">First, there is at least a reasonable dispute as to defendant\u2019s claim that, without a <em>Leistiko </em>jury instruction, the evidence here was \u201cnot yet relevant\u201d to intent under the doctrine of chances.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In <em>Leistiko, </em>the court explained that the trial court erred in admitting uncharged misconduct evidence to prove intent under the doctrine of chances where the defendant did not concede doing the charged act and the court \u201cneither admitted the uncharged misconduct evidence as conditionally relevant nor instructed the jurors to consider that evidence on the issue of intent only if they first found that the defendant had [committed the charged act].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>352 Or at 186. But in announcing that rule, the court started from the proposition that OEC 404(3) made propensity evidence categorically inadmissible. <em>See Leistiko, </em>352 Or at 180 n 6 (so stating and noting that the state did not argue that \u201cpropensity evidence is relevant and thus admissible under OEC 404(4)\u201d). And the court later explained that, without the defendant\u2019s concession as to the charged act or a <em>Leistiko </em>jury instruction, there was \u201ca risk that the jury would use the [other acts] evidence for an impermissible propensity <em>purpose </em>\u2014 i.e., to decide that, because [the] defendant had committed the [other] acts, his character was such that he again would act in the same manner and commit the charged acts.\u201d <em>State v. Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 582, 293 P3d 1002 (2012). Given the starting point of the court\u2019s decision in <em>Leistiko </em>(the ban on propensity evidence under OEC 404(3)) and the court\u2019s explanation of why that instruction was necessary (to avoid propensity-based reasoning), it is not obvious here that, without the jury instruction described in <em>Leistiko, </em>the evidence offered for intent on a doctrine of chances theory was \u201cnot yet relevant,\u201d as defendant asserts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Second, we do not agree with defendant that the trial court committed <em>obvious </em>error in admitting the identity theft evidence because, without a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction, the probative value of that evidence was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice. Defendant\u2019s argument rests on the categorical proposition that, when a defendant does not concede the charged act and the trial court does not give a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction, evidence offered on a doctrine of chances theory necessarily \u201clacks probative value <em>and </em>is unfairly prejudicial.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) As noted above, it is not obvious that the failure to give a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction means that \u201cother acts\u201d evidence has no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>probative value to intent on a doctrine of chances theory. And, although the court in <em>Leistiko </em>and later cases noted that a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction guards against the risk that a jury might use \u201cother acts\u201d evidence for propensity purposes to conclude that a defendant committed the charged act, it is not obvious that, in all cases where that instruction is not given, the risk of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value of that evidence \u2014 regardless of any other jury instructions given and regardless of the other evidence presented that the defendant committed the charged act. Because defendant does not advance any other argument about why the trial court improperly concluded that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by a risk of unfair prejudice, we do not consider that issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">In sum, we cannot endorse defendant\u2019s unqualified claim \u2014 that \u201cevidence that fails the <em>Leistiko </em>analysis and is not relevant for any other purpose must <em>also </em>be excluded under <em>Williams\u201d </em>(emphasis in original) \u2014 as an obvious point of law that is beyond reasonable dispute. In light of <em>Williams, </em>we do not agree with defendant that the trial court plainly erred when it admitted the challenged evidence without issuing a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction. <em>See also State v. Brown, </em>272 Or App 424, 355 P3d 216 (2015) (failure to give <em>Leistiko </em>instruction is not plain error under OEC 404(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">We turn to two assignments of error related to defendant\u2019s sentence. In both, defendant argues that, when the trial court imposed a sentence in the judgment that differed from the sentence announced in open court, the court violated his constitutional and statutory right \u201cto be present when a court effects a sentence modification.\u201d <em>See State v. Riley, </em>195 Or App 377, 384, 97 P3d 1269 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (explaining that a defendant\u2019s right to be present is implicated when the modification involves disputed facts or the court\u2019s exercise of discretion, not when it occurs wholly by operation of law).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Defendant first argues that the trial court erred when it modified his sentence on Count 13, for criminal mischief, without pronouncing the new sentence in open court in defendant\u2019s presence. On Count 13, the trial court stated that the 60-month sentence for the criminal mischief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>conviction \u201cwill be concurrent to Count 2.\u201d The trial court later entered a judgment that imposed Count 13 \u201cconsecutively to the sentence imposed in Count 19, Count 1, 2 and Count 5.\u201d The state concedes the error, but it is now moot because the trial court, on February 26, 2014, entered an amended judgment reflecting that defendant\u2019s sentence on Count 13 is to be served concurrently with defendant\u2019s other sentences. <em>See, e.g., State v. Retasket, </em>211 Or App 432, 156 P3d 71 (2007) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s challenge to an erroneous term of sentence was moot because the trial court entered an amended judgment to correct error).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Defendant next argues that the trial court erred when it modified his sentence to deny him \u201cearned time\u201d on each of his felony sentences. At sentencing, the court stated that defendant would \u201cnot be eligible for good time for the first 144 months of his sentence\u201d and found substantial and compelling reasons for that denial under ORS 137.750(1).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the judgment is at least ambiguous on whether he is entitled to earned time after 144 months. In the judgment, every felony count states that \u201cdefendant may not be considered by the executing or releasing authority for any form of temporary leave from custody, reduction in sentence, work release, alternative incarceration program or program of conditional or supervised release authorized by law for which the defendant is otherwise eligible,\u201d but a paragraph at the end of the judgment states that \u201c[defendant is not eligible for earned good time credit for the first 144 months of this sentence. Defendant is eligible for earned good time credit for the remaining 198 months of this sentence.\u201d (Boldface in original.) In defendant\u2019s view, the judgment is internally inconsistent because it both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>grants eligibility for earned good time after 144 months and denies it in its entirety (by making impossible a \u201creduction in sentence,\u201d which unambiguously includes earned time). Defendant argues that the judgment represents a \u201cmodification\u201d of the sentence that was announced in open court, and thus he was entitled to be present. He requests that we vacate his sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The state responds that defendant\u2019s argument should be reviewed for plain error because defendant failed to preserve it, and contends that the error is not plain because the Department of Corrections could interpret the judgment in one of two ways: \u201c(1) that defendant is not eligible for <em>any </em>sentence-reducing credits; or (2) that defendant is not eligible for any sentence-reducing credits, except for earned good time once defendant has served 144 months of his sentence.\u201d According to the state, the only way to determine how the Department of Corrections has interpreted defendant\u2019s sentence is to go outside the record, so the error is not apparent on the record and therefore not plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">We conclude that, because the asserted error first became apparent when the judgment was issued, defendant was not required to raise an objection at that time, when defendant was not present, to preserve the error. <em>See State v. Jacobs, </em>200 Or App 665, 671, 117 P3d 290 (2005) (assignment of error was preserved where the defendant argued that the trial court erred by imposing a longer sentence by written order and judgment than that proposed orally at an earlier time, even though the defendant did not object at time of judgment). And, we conclude that the judgment reflects a sentence that effectively modifies the sentence that was announced in open court. At best, the judgment is ambiguous in that regard; as the state notes, it might be read to deny defendant earned good time after 144 months, so that the judgment modifies defendant\u2019s sentence. Because that modification is discretionary rather than a change required by operation of law, defendant had a right to be present for that modification. Accordingly, we vacate defendant\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-5\"> OEC 404(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.
