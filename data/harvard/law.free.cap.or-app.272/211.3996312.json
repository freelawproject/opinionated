Combest, </em>271 Or App 38, 350 P3d 222 (2015); <em>State v. Pugh, </em>255 Or App 357, 297 P3d 27, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 748 (2013).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>A detailed description of the facts is unnecessary. Briefly, defendant was charged with 20 counts of first-degree encouraging child sexual abuse; each count alleged that, during a specified time period, defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly duplicate a visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child while knowing that creation of the visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involved child abuse.\u201d Those charges derived from 13 files containing child pornography that defendant had made available on the Gnutella peer-to-peer file-sharing network and that the police, using computer software, including programs called Peer Spectre and Shareaza LE, were able to locate and download from defendant\u2019s computer. Using that information, the police obtained a search warrant authorizing the search of defendant\u2019s home and his computers, and, in executing the warrant, the police obtained additional incriminating information. Defendant moved to suppress the evidence, arguing that the manner in which the police had discovered it was a warrantless search in violation of Article I, section 9. The trial court denied the motion. At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts, arguing that downloading child pornography files from the peer-to-peer network did not constitute \u201cduplicat [ing] \u201d those files within the meaning of ORS 163.684 (2009). The court denied that motion as well, and, following a bench trial, defendant was convicted of all counts. He appeals, challenging the court\u2019s denial of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">Our recent decision in <em>Combest, </em>decided after this case was briefed and argued, controls the outcome of defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in denying his suppression motion. Defendant argues that the officers engaged in a search violating Article I, section 9, when they</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">\u201cutilized proprietary law enforcement computer software that is not available to the general public to engage in a sweeping exploration of online activity, enter that activity into a database that permits them to zero in on a specific computer user in a specific place at a specific time, and investigate the content of an individual computer user\u2019s shared files.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>That was also the issue in <em>Combest. </em>There, we considered whether \u201cthe officers\u2019 use of Shareaza LE to seek out and download files from defendant on a peer-to-peer network\u2014 and to obtain the IP address, GUID [Globally Unique Identifier], and hash value associated with those files\u2014 invaded defendant\u2019s protected privacy interest and was thus \u2018sufficiently intrusive to be classified as a search\u2019\u201d under Article I, section 9. <em>Combest, </em>271 Or App at 48 (quoting <em>State v. Wacker, </em>317 Or 419, 425, 856 P2d 1029 (1993)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">We concluded in <em>Combest </em>that the police conduct did not constitute a search under Article I, section 9, reasoning that the information that the police were able to obtain using the software was \u201cthe same information that was available to any other user of the network\u201d and \u201c[t]he police obtained that information by zeroing in on shared files that contained child pornography, not by engaging in all-encompassing surveillance of defendant\u2019s online activity.\u201d 271 Or App at 56. We also rejected the defendant\u2019s theory that, because Shareaza LE \u201cmade police practice more efficient,\u201d its warrantless use constituted a search. <em>Id. </em>at 55. That reasoning is equally compelling here. In short, we can perceive no meaningful legal distinction between the police activity here and that at issue in <em>Combest. </em>Consequently, as in <em>Combest, </em>we conclude that the police did not conduct a search under Article I, section 9, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">As mentioned, defendant also contends that the trial court erred in denying his MJOA because evidence that he downloaded files containing child pornography is not sufficient to establish that he \u201cduplicated\u201d them for purposes of ORS 163.684 (2009). Defendant essentially acknowledges that we decided this question contrary to his position in <em>Pugh </em>but argues that our construction of the statute was incorrect. We decline to revisit that issue. <em>See Pugh, </em>255 Or App at 364 (holding that defendant knowingly \u201cduplicated\u201d child pornography when he downloaded such images from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the Internet, and noting that there is \u201cno difference between creating a personal copy of child pornography through downloading from a peer-to-peer network and downloading from other independent sources on the Internet [because, in] both situations, the original image remains with the original owner, and a copy is saved onto the downloading party\u2019s computer\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-5\"> ORS 163.864 (2009), in effect when defendant committed his offenses, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-7\">\u201c(a)(A) <em>Knowingly </em>develops, <em>duplicates, </em>publishes, prints, disseminates, exchanges, displays, finances, attempts to finance or sells any photograph, motion picture, videotape or other visual recording of sexually explicit conduct involving a child or possesses such matter with the intent to develop, duplicate, publish, print, disseminate, exchange, display or sell it[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-8\">\u201c* * :|i * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b232-9\">\u201c(2) Encouraging child sexual abuse in the first degree is a Class B felony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\"> Article I, section 9, provides, in part, \u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\"> Defendant initially raised an additional assignment of error, namely, that the court erred in denying defendant\u2019s MJOA on the ground that the state had failed to prove venue. Defendant has since withdrawn that assignment of error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b234-6\"> Although some of the specific software programs used by the police in this case to access, locate, and download files from defendant\u2019s computer may have been different from those used by the police in <em>Combest, </em>they operate the same way.
