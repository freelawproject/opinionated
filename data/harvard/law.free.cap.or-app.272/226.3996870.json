Prior to his post-conviction hearing, the trial court issued trial management orders stating that petitioner\u2019s case would be scheduled for 15 minutes and that \u201c [n] o live testimony will be permitted without prior court order.\u201d The court clarified that, \u201c[i]n order to present live witnesses, a party must first file a motion to do so along with a supporting affidavit as to why live testimony is necessary.\u201d The court denied petitioner\u2019s motion requesting additional time and to call two witnesses. Later, the court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration on the basis that petitioner had failed to establish that he could not present those witnesses\u2019 proposed testimony through deposition or affidavit. In other words, the court determined that the substance of the witnesses\u2019 testimony was such that it was not necessary for them to testify at the hearing because the same information could be relayed through an affidavit or deposition. As a result of that ruling, petitioner was not allowed to call those witnesses at his hearing. Instead, he submitted those witnesses\u2019 testimony through declarations. The trial court ultimately denied petitioner\u2019s petition in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">In a single assignment of error, petitioner \u201cassigns error to the trial court\u2019s orders limiting the amount of time he would have to present his case, imposing preconditions on calling live witnesses, and transforming his post-conviction hearing into a summary judgment hearing.\u201d He argues that \u201cthe Oregon State Bar\u2019s Principles and Standards for Post-Conviction Relief Practitioners, statutes, rules of court, and constitutional provisions required the court to allow him a full and fair hearing on his claims, which includes allowing adequate time and to call live witnesses without having to meet the show-cause requirement the court imposed.\u201d He further argues that \u201cthe litigation restrictions the post-conviction court imposed effectively transformed petitioner\u2019s post-conviction hearing into a summary judgment proceeding,\u201d and that that \u201cunauthorized * * * transformation established that[,] given the state of the record, the court improperly relied on documentary evidence to grant \u2018summary judgment\u2019 for defendant.\u201d We reject without discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>petitioner\u2019s argument that the court transformed his hearing into a summary judgment proceeding. We limit our consideration to whether the court erred by limiting petitioner\u2019s time for his hearing and imposing a show-cause precondition on his ability to call live witnesses. For the reasons stated below, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, any error in imposing those limitations was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">I. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s regulation of the proceedings before it and its control over the presentation of evidence for abuse of discretion. <em>See Biegler v. Kirby, </em>281 Or 423, 427, 574 P2d 1127 (1978) (\u201cThe conduct of trial is within the discretion of the trial court and an appellate court will not interfere absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d). As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s authority to exercise reasonable discretion to ensure that the trial is orderly and expeditious does not evaporate when the parties assert their constitutional rights during trial.\u201d <em>State v. Rogers, </em>330 Or 282, 301, 4 P3d 1261 (2000) (citing <em>State v. Langley, </em>314 Or 247, 257-60, 839 P2d 692 (1992), <em>adh'd to on recons, </em>318 Or 28, 861 P2d 1012 (1993) (rulings that implicated defendant\u2019s rights to counsel and to fair trial reviewed for abuse of discretion), and <em>State v. Engeman, </em>245 Or 209, 211, 420 P2d 389 (1966) (ruling that implicated defendant\u2019s right to fair trial reviewed for abuse of discretion)). \u201cRather, a trial court is obliged to accommodate the exercise of all pertinent constitutional and statutory rights by all parties within the context of an orderly and expeditious trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we review whether the trial court abused its discretion when it limited the time for the hearing and required petitioner to establish prior to trial the necessity of calling his witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">II. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Petitioner was convicted of unlawful possession of cocaine, driving under the influence of intoxicants, and reckless driving, arising out of an incident in which he drove his car into a ditch. After petitioner had driven his car into the ditch, the police arrived. The car was partially in the ditch and partially in the roadway. As a result, the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>determined that the car needed to be towed. Before towing the car, police conducted an inventory search and discovered drugs. The police gave petitioner <em>Miranda </em>warnings in English, and petitioner proceeded to make incriminating statements. At his criminal trial, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel unsuccessfully moved to suppress evidence seized during the inventory search and petitioner\u2019s incriminating post-<em>Miranda </em>statements. We summarily affirmed petitioner\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"APn\">Petitioner thereafter initiated this post-conviction action, claiming, among other things, that his trial counsel had provided him with constitutionally inadequate representation. As relevant here, petitioner argued that his trial counsel had been constitutionally inadequate because, in seeking to suppress that evidence, (1) he had failed to argue that the inventory search of petitioner\u2019s car was invalid on the basis that the car was not a hazard and, therefore, did not need to be towed, and (2) he had failed to have petitioner \u2014 whose primary language is Spanish \u2014 tested for English proficiency to demonstrate that petitioner could not understand the <em>Miranda </em>warnings that the police gave him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">After petitioner had filed his petition, before trial, the court sent the parties a letter addressing some case management issues. The letter stated, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cWe are making an effort to resolve all post conviction relief and habeas corpus cases within one year from the original filing. If a trial date is set, the trial will be scheduled for 15 minutes. No live testimony will be permitted without prior court order. Petitioner (if in custody) will appear by telephone absent a court order to the contrary. ***\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s counsel sent the court a letter stating that he intended to call \u201cas many as three live witnesses\u201d\u2014 petitioner, Matt Roloff, and Professor Mariana Valenzuela\u2014 and that he estimated that he would need 90 minutes to present the case. In response, the court sent the parties a follow-up letter describing the procedure that they would have to follow to obtain live testimony at the hearing. That letter provided, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">\u201cIn order to present live witnesses, a party must first file a motion to do so along with a supporting affidavit as to why live testimony is necessary. I strongly encourage you to present evidence by way of affidavits and depositions. It is very unlikely that I will allow live testimony in the absence of attempts to present the evidence by other means and a showing that those other means have proven unsuccessful.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Petitioner thereafter filed a motion seeking, among other things, an order allowing petitioner to call Roloff and Valenzuela as live witnesses and 90 minutes for the hearing. The motion clarified that petitioner no longer needed to testify at the hearing. In the supporting declaration filed with the motion, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that, in their opinion, they needed Roloff and Valenzuela to testify at the hearing because their live testimony would \u201cgreatly assist [ ] \u201d the court, as finder of fact, in understanding certain factual aspects of petitioner\u2019s claims because aspects of that evidence \u201cwill not be as readily understandable without a live witness,\u201d and that it is \u201crelated much more easily through live testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Roloff was petitioner\u2019s employer at the time of the incident. Petitioner had called Roloff for assistance after crashing into the ditch; Roloff arrived at the scene after the police, but observed the position of the car before it was towed. In his petition, petitioner argued that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to argue that the evidence obtained by the police should be suppressed because it was obtained through an invalid inventory search. Petitioner contended that his trial counsel should have argued that petitioner\u2019s car was not a hazard and did not need to be towed, therefore, no inventory search needed to be performed. In the supporting declaration filed with the motion for live testimony, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that, \u201c[i]n order to prove that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>search was unlawful, petitioner must prove that the car he was driving on the night of his arrest was not stopped in a position that required it to be towed [,]\u201d and that Roloff \u201ccan testify about the location of the vehicle and the availability of another driver to take control of the vehicle,\u201d which are facts relevant to that issue. Petitioner\u2019s counsel also stated that, in his opinion, \u201cthe location of the vehicle at the scene will not be as readily understandable without a live witness being called.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">Valenzuela is a language expert who tested petitioner\u2019s English language skills. Petitioner claimed that his trial counsel was ineffective because he had failed to have petitioner tested for English proficiency and that, had he done so, he could have obtained suppression of petitioner\u2019s incriminating statements. In the declaration supporting the motion for live testimony, petitioner\u2019s counsel stated that Valenzuela tested petitioner\u2019s language skills and that her testimony \u201cwill reveal that petitioner\u2019s poor language skills impeded his ability to understand his right to remain silent,\u201d and that the \u201climitations on the petitioner\u2019s ability to understand English are related much more easily through live testimony than through a summation of his testing results on paper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">The court denied petitioner\u2019s motion to call live witnesses without elaboration. The order noted that the court was granting petitioner\u2019s motion for a continuance, but that the court was denying his request to call live witnesses. The order did not state a ruling on petitioner\u2019s request for additional time, though petitioner took the denial of his request to call live witnesses as an implicit denial of his request for additional time.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Petitioner subsequently filed a motion for reconsideration of that order, explaining in legal terms why he believed that the court must allow him additional time to present his case and to call live witnesses. Specifically, petitioner argued that the court\u2019s order \u201cwould deny [him] post-conviction counsel in accordance with the Oregon State Bar\u2019s Principles and Standards for Post-Conviction Relief Practitioners.\u201d Under those standards, he explained, \u201cto protect the petitioner\u2019s right to a full and fair hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>claims asserted in the petition,\u201d post-conviction attorneys are supposed to present oral testimony at the hearing and object to any time limitations on the presentation of evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Quoting Standard 6.6.4.) Thus, in his view, the court\u2019s order would deprive him of his right to a full and fair hearing on the claims asserted in his petition. He also argued that the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Stevens v. Czerniak, </em>336 Or 392, 84 P3d 140 (2004), confirmed that claim. Additionally, petitioner argued, again relying on Stevens, 336 Or at 398, that the court\u2019s denial of his request for his witnesses would deprive him of a \u201cfull and fair opportunity to present [his] evidence,\u201d in violation of his due process rights. Finally, he argued that \u201cnothing authorizes the Court to bar petitioner from calling live witnesses and denying him adequate time to present his case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Defendant filed a response to petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration, arguing that ORS 138.620(2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that a post-conviction court \u201cmay receive proof by affidavits, depositions, oral testimony or other competent evidence,\u201d and that the \u201cmanner in which evidence is presented is left to the court\u2019s discretion [.]\u201d Defendant argued that the bar principles and standards cited by petitioner mirror ORS 138.620(2) and, similarly to that statute, those principles \u201cdo[] not suggest that oral testimony is the sole or preferred method to afford a fair hearing; rather, [oral testimony] is listed equally with the other means of testimony suggested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>by this Court,\u201d and that petitioner had \u201cnot indicated why he is unable to produce evidence by way of affidavit or deposition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Petitioner filed a reply to defendant\u2019s response conceding that he could \u201c\u2018produce evidence by way of affidavit or deposition,\u201d\u2019 but that \u201cis beside the point,\u201d because \u201che cannot have a \u2018full and fair opportunity to present [his] evidence,\u2019 [Stevens, 336 Or at 398], and comply with Standard 6.6.4.b-c of the Oregon State Bar\u2019s Standards for Post-Conviction Relief Practitioners, unless he is allowed additional time and live-witness testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The trial court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration in a written decision. In that decision, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-6\">\u201cPetitioner cites <em>Stevens v. Czerniak, </em>336 Or 392 [, 84 P3d 140] (2004). My prior decisions are consistent with the procedure approved of in that case in that I have not precluded either party from calling live witnesses. However, I have required a party desiring to call live witnesses to make a showing as to why it is necessary to do so in order to have a fair trial. [Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s] declaration does not make that showing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201cThe declaration addresses two sources and types of evidence: Matt Roloff regarding vehicle location and availability of another driver and Mariana Valenzuela regarding petitioner\u2019s limited ability to understand English and the impact thereof on petitioner\u2019s ability to understand his right to remain silent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">The court explained that Roloffs proposed testimony \u201cappears to be straightforward\u201d and involves factual issues that could be resolved through an affidavit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court said, however, that, \u201c[c]ertainly, if [petitioner\u2019s counsel] attempts to present Mr. Roloffs evidence by affidavit or deposition but is unable to do so and then explains to the court how and why the effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>has been unsuccessful, I will reconsider [petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s] request to present Mr. Roloff as a live witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">The court then addressed the subject of Valenzuela\u2019s proposed testimony, acknowledging that her \u201ccontributions may be more subtle and nuanced than Mr. Roloff s,\u201d explaining that, sometimes live testimony regarding an expert\u2019s report \u201chas helped me understand what such a witness has to say when the report of such a witness has left me uncertain,\u201d but that, \u201cin the vast majority of cases, nothing in the testimony of the witness adds to the witness\u2019s report.\u201d Accordingly, the court explained, petitioner\u2019s counsel would have to \u201cproduce some basis for believing that [Valenzuela\u2019s] live testimony will provide insight beyond what her report (or deposition) would provide.\u201d The court\u2019s written order denying petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration stated that the motion was denied \u201cwith leave to renew based on additional facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Petitioner did not renew his motion to call live witnesses. He did, however, renew his objection to the court\u2019s procedure in his trial memorandum. Petitioner again argued that <em>Stevens </em>\u201cmakes clear\u201d that the Post-Conviction Hearing Act requires that petitioner be allowed a full and fair hearing on his claims. Further, because a full and fair hearing requires that petitioner \u201cbe allowed adequate time and the ability to call live witnesses,\u201d the \u201cprocedure the Court has imposed is not authorized by and in fact is antithetical to statutory and constitutional requirements.\u201d He also raised new arguments that the trial court\u2019s procedure modified the Post-Conviction Hearing Act in violation of the separation of powers doctrine in Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution, as well as his rights under the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution, and the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">At the post-conviction hearing, petitioner offered into evidence, <em>inter alia, </em>photographs of the ditch (not taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>on the night of the incident), and declarations from Roloff and Valenzuela, as well as a declaration and affidavit from petitioner. For its part, the state offered into evidence a number of exhibits, including an affidavit by petitioner\u2019s trial counsel<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and photographs of the car in the ditch from the night of the incident. Petitioner did not object to the admission of trial counsel\u2019s affidavit. Nor did he tell the court that he needed to testify at the hearing in light of that affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">After admitting that evidence, the court heard the parties\u2019 arguments. Petitioner brought the court\u2019s attention to the fact that he had again raised the issue of live testimony in his trial memorandum. Petitioner told the court that, given the nature of the testimony being offered, \u201cit will be much more easily explained with live testimony to the Court [,] \u201d and that, \u201calthough we tried our best with the declarations and pictures that we\u2019ve submitted as part of the exhibits, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s as good as live testimony would have been.\u201d The court explained that petitioner had not renewed his motion for live testimony after the court had denied reconsideration, and that \u201c[t]oday\u2019s too late[.]\u201d At the end of the hearing, the court took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Later, the court issued a letter opinion denying all of petitioner\u2019s claims for post-conviction relief. The court\u2019s opinion addressed the Roloff and Valenzuela evidence in its assessment of petitioner\u2019s claims regarding the inventory search and the post <em>-Miranda </em>statements. With respect to petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel relating to the inventory search, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>\u201c [P] etitioner argues that there was no reason to tow the vehicle and therefore no reason to conduct an inventory search before towing. However, the car was clearly sticking out into the roadway. (Ex 116) It was a hazard. Petitioner argues that Mr. Roloff and his son could have towed the car. However, the Roloffs never made their presence known to the police. Mr. Roloff admitted this at trial. (Ex 117, Trial Tr at 308) Accordingly, even if the Roloffs could have towed the vehicle, the deputies did not know this. The decision to tow the vehicle was reasonable and necessary due to the hazard the car represented (even Mr. Roloff admitted that the area was hazardous \u2014 Ex 12) and the inventory search before the tow was conducted according to properly enacted county ordinances. Accordingly, evidence of the cocaine found in the car was properly admitted evidence. [Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel] was in no way inadequate in failing to have evidence of the search suppressed.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">(Footnote omitted.) The court then addressed petitioner\u2019s claim that his trial counsel had failed to secure suppression of his post <em>-Miranda </em>statements. The court concluded that, even if petitioner\u2019s trial counsel had been at fault for not offering evidence of petitioner\u2019s inadequate understanding of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that failure did not tend to affect the result at trial because evidence of guilt, even in the absence of his incriminating statements, was overwhelming. The court also noted that it believed that Valenzuela\u2019s assessment of petitioner\u2019s ability to understand <em>Miranda </em>rights was correct, but that, in any case, his statements were voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The court also addressed the issue of live witness testimony in a section of its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201cLastly, I shall address petitioner\u2019s renewed claim that he should have been allowed to present live testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">\u201cPetitioner claims that he was denied the opportunity to do so. In fact, my order of June 28, 2011 denied the motion to reconsider the request for live testimony \u2018with leave to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>renew based on additional evidence.\u2019 My opinion letter of that date also notes that [petitioner\u2019s attorney] \u2018will have to show more than he has to justify\u2019 presenting live testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">\u201cPetitioner sought to present the live testimony of only two witnesses, Mr. Roloff and Ms. Valenzuela.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\">\u201cAccording to [petitioner\u2019s attorney\u2019s] declaration, the purpose of Mr. Roloffs testimony was to show the location of the vehicle and that another person was available to take control of the vehicle. The former point appears to have been abandoned. Mr. Roloffs declaration does not dispute that the vehicle was a hazard. Indeed, the evidence shows that the vehicle was clearly protruding onto the lane of travel. Whether another person was available to take control of the vehicle is insignificant because this fact was never communicated to the deputies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">\u201cMs. Valenzuela\u2019s declaration is undated. Certainly, [petitioner\u2019s attorney] made no effort to convince the court that he found the declaration to be inadequate. There is no evidence that he attempted to take her testimony by deposition. Also, I have found Ms. Valenzuela to be credible, even without her live testimony. The declaration of Mr. Roloff (Ex 12) is also undated. There is no evidence that he was deposed. There was no argument after [the court denied petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration with leave to renew] that either declaration was inadequate or that depositions were inadequate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">\u201cPetitioner did not seek to testify as a live witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">\u201cAccordingly, it is clear that the court did not deny petitioner the right to present live testimony. The court specifically gave petitioner the opportunity to renew his request if he could show that other methods of presenting his case were somehow inadequate. Petitioner failed to even attempt to do so.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">The court thereafter entered a judgment reflecting its rulings. Petitioner appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">As noted above, petitioner \u201cassigns error to the trial court\u2019s orders limiting the amount of time he would have to present his case, imposing preconditions on calling live witnesses, and transforming his post-conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>hearing into a summary judgment hearing.\u201d He argues that \u201cthe Oregon State Bar\u2019s Principles and Standards for Post-Conviction Relief Practitioners, statutes, rules of court, and constitutional provisions required the court to allow him a full and fair hearing on his claims, which includes allowing adequate time and to call live witnesses without having to meet the show-cause requirement the court imposed.\u201d Specifically, he contends that there was no statute or rule authorizing the court to require a party to prove the worthiness of its live witnesses pretrial. He also contends that the court\u2019s orders deprived him of his right to a full and fair hearing on his claims, as required by the Bar Principles and Standards, as well as the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He further argues that the orders modified the Post-Conviction Hearing Act in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers in Article III, section 1, of the Oregon Constitution, and violated his rights under the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article I, section 20, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u201cIt is well established that a trial court generally possesses broad discretion to control the proceedings before it.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>330 Or at 300 (citing, as examples of that authority, ORS 1.010 (every court has power to regulate proceedings before it and to control, in furtherance of justice, conduct of persons connected with judicial proceedings) and OEC 611(1) (court shall exercise reasonable control over presentation of evidence)). And, as noted above, \u201c[a] trial court\u2019s authority to exercise reasonable discretion to ensure that the trial is orderly and expeditious does not evaporate when the parties assert their constitutional rights during trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The issue presented, then, is whether, under the circumstances, the court\u2019s procedural restrictions violated petitioner\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights and, therefore, constitute an abuse of discretion. We note that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>petitioner assigns error to the portion of the court\u2019s procedure limiting the time for his hearing, he appears to acknowledge that that limitation is tied to the limitation on live testimony. In other words, petitioner appears to acknowledge that the court would have allowed additional time had it granted his motion to call his witnesses. Thus, the issue in this case reduces to whether the court\u2019s requirement that petitioner establish pretrial that it was necessary to call his proposed witnesses violated his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that the court could not impose such a requirement, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, petitioner was not prejudiced by that error. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Petitioner did not address in his brief whether the court\u2019s asserted error in this case was harmless. However, at oral argument, when asked what prejudice petitioner suffered by the asserted error in this case, petitioner contended that trial court\u2019s error was akin to \u201cstructural error\u201d because there was no way of telling how Roloffs and Valenzuela\u2019s live testimony would have affected the trial court\u2019s decision. Petitioner thus suggested that no finding of prejudice is required to reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in this case because the court\u2019s error was \u201cstructural.\u201d As we explain below, petitioner\u2019s contention is incorrect for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">First, Oregon law does not recognize the concept of \u201cstructural error.\u201d <em>Ryan v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 278, 295, 108 P3d 1127, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 874 (2005). Rather, under Oregon law, \u201c[w]e may not reverse a judgment if the error was harmless.\u201d <em>Tracy v. Nooth, </em>252 Or App 163, 170, 285 P3d 745 (2012), <em>adh'd to on recons, </em>255 Or App 435, 299 P3d 565, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 868 (2013) (citing Or Const, Art VII (Amended), \u00a7 3). \u201cAn error is harmless if there is \u2018little likelihood that the particular error affected the verdict.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State v. Davis, </em>336 Or 19, 32, 77 P3d 1111 (2003)). Thus, in a post-conviction case, \u201cwe may not reverse the post-conviction court\u2019s error [under Oregon law] if it was unlikely to have affected the outcome of petitioner\u2019s post-conviction case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, in this case, we must review any errors that the trial court committed under Oregon law for harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Second, to the extent petitioner argues that the asserted federal due process violation in this case was a \u201cstructural error,\u201d thus obviating any need for a showing of harm, we disagree. \u201cA \u2018structural\u2019 error * * * is a \u2018defect affecting the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply an error in the trial process itself.\u2019\u201d <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 US 461, 468, 117 S Ct 1544, 137 L Ed 2d 718 (1997) (quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>499 US 279, 310, 111 S Ct 1246, 113 L Ed 2d 302 (1991)); <em>see also Fulminante, </em>499 US at 307-10 (explaining that structural errors are \u201cstructural defects in the constitution of the trial mechanism, which defy analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards,\u201d in contrast to \u201ctrial errors,\u201d which are errors that occur during the presentation of the case to the factfinder and which \u201cmay therefore be quantitatively assessed in the context of other evidence presented\u201d to determine if the error was harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">As an initial matter, post-conviction actions in Oregon are civil proceedings, except as specified by statute. <em>Elkins v. Thompson, </em>174 Or App 307, 314, 25 P3d 376, <em>rev den, </em>332 Or 558 (2001). The United States Supreme Court has \u201cnever held that an error in the <em>civil </em>context is structural.\u201d <em>Al Haramain Islamic Fdn. v. U.S. Dept. of Treasury, </em>686 F3d 965, 988 (9th Cir 2012) (emphasis in original). And, as explained in <em>Johnson, </em>even in the criminal context, the Court has found structural errors only in a very limited class of cases:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-5\">\u201cSee <em>Gideon v. Wainwright, </em>372 US 335 [, 83 S Ct 792, 9 L Ed 2d 799] (1963) (a total deprivation of the right to counsel); <em>Tumey v. Ohio, </em>273 US 510[, 47 S Ct 437, 71 L Ed 749] (1927) (lack of an impartial trial judge); <em>Vasquez v. Hillery, </em>474 US 254[, 106 S Ct 617, 88 L Ed 2d 598] (1986) (unlawful exclusion of grand jurors of defendant's race); <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 US 168[, 104 S Ct 944, 79 L Ed 2d 122] (1984) (the right to self-representation at trial); <em>Waller v. Georgia, </em>467 US 39[, 104 S Ct 2210, 81 L Ed 2d 31] (1984) (the right to a public trial); <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana, </em>508 US 275[, 113 S Ct 2078, 124 L Ed 2d 182] (1993) (erroneous reasonable-doubt instruction to jury).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-7\"><em>Johnson, </em>520 US at 468-69. <em>Cf. Hedgpeth v. Pulido, </em>555 US 57, 129 S Ct 530, 172 L Ed 2d 388 (2008) (instructing jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>on multiple theories of guilt, one of which is invalid, is not a structural error requiring reversal without regard to prejudice); <em>Neder v. United States, </em>527 US 1, 119 S Ct 1827, 144 L Ed 2d 35 (1999) (omission of an element of offense was not structural error).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Assuming, without deciding, that the concept of structural error applies in state post-conviction cases, we conclude that the assumed error in this case was not structural because it did not affect the entire conduct of the hearing; rather, it was a trial error affecting the presentation of evidence from two witnesses. Therefore, we review the assumed error under both state and federal law for harmlessness<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, any error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">The assumed error in this case prevented petitioner from calling Roloff and Valenzuela to testify at trial. However, petitioner was able to present their testimony by declaration. Furthermore, the trial court credited their written testimony, but determined that that testimony did not affect its determination of the merits of petitioner\u2019s claims. Petitioner did not argue below, nor does he argue on appeal, that Roloffs and Valenzuela\u2019s testimony raised credibility issues that could be resolved only through the observation of those witnesses\u2019 live testimony. Rather, as the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>indicated, their testimony related to factual issues that were generally straightforward. Petitioner has not provided us with any argument as to what additional testimony Roloff and Valenzuela would have given had they been allowed to testify at the hearing, or how that testimony would have changed the trial court\u2019s decision. Because petitioner was not harmed by the court\u2019s alleged error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-8\"> Petitioner also claimed that his trial counsel was constitutionally inadequate because he had (1) stipulated to the admission of a criminalist\u2019s report without obtaining petitioner\u2019s consent; (2) failed to advise petitioner of the possibility of negotiating a plea agreement that would avoid immigration consequences; (3) permitted petitioner to be tried in shackles without requiring the state to prove that shackles were necessary; and (4) failed to object to a jury instruction authorizing a nonunanimous guilty verdict. Petitioner does not renew those contentions on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b249-9\"> It is not clear from the record whether the procedure announced in the letter was specific to that courtroom, or was a policy of Washington County Circuit Court. At the time, however, Washington County did not have a supplemental local rule reflecting that policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b252-5\"> For example, petitioner cited Standard 6.6.4 b-c in support of his argument. Those standards provide, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-6\">\u201cb. Counsel should seek to present all evidence on behalf of the petitioner in the manner most likely to protect the petitioner\u2019s right to a full and fair hearing on the claims asserted in the petition, including oral testimony by witnesses present in a courtroom, depositions, affidavits, or other competent evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cc. Counsel should object to time limitations or other constraints on the presentation of evidence, on behalf of the petitioner, that might interfere with a full and fair hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Oregon State Bar Principles and Standards for Post-Conviction Relief Practitioners, http://www.osbar.org/_docs/resources/ConvictionReliefProceedings/CSPCRP3. pdf (last accessed June 30, 2015).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b252-9\"> As relevant here, ORS 138.620(2) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201cIf the petition states a ground for relief, the court shall decide the issues raised and may receive proof by affidavits, depositions, oral testimony or other competent evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b253-9\"> For example, the court explained, with respect to Roloffs proposed testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">\u201cThe car was in the ditch and/or protruding onto the highway a certain distance at a certain angle or it was not. There was another driver available or there was not. If there are photographs of the scene, Mr. Roloff can refer to them as easily in an affidavit or a deposition as he can from a witness stand. The photographs may be entered into evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> Petitioner also argued that, in denying his request for live testimony, the court was effectively transforming his post-conviction trial into a summary-judgment-type proceeding, which required the court to accept the credibility of his affiants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\"> Petitioner argues that he did not know that his trial counsel would be giving evidence until the day of the hearing and that his trial counsel\u2019s affidavit created credibility issues with petitioner\u2019s affidavit. Petitioner contends on appeal that, given those credibility issues, the trial court could not \u201cdetermine who was credible\u201d using the \u201csummary judgment proceeding\u201d that the court \u201cimproperly forced upon petitioner,\u201d and, therefore, could not \u201creject any of petitioner\u2019s claims that involved \u2018swearing contests.\u2019\u201d In support of that argument, petitioner relies on cases involving motions for summary judgment. As noted above, we reject petitioner\u2019s argument that the court transformed his hearing into a summary judgment proceeding. As a result, we reject his argument that the court could not have decided certain of his claims absent his live testimony. We also note that petitioner never clearly presented the trial court with a request to testify at the hearing after he told the court that he no longer needed to testify. Therefore, to the extent petitioner argues on appeal that the court erred in preventing him from testifying, we conclude that that argument is not preserved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b256-8\"> The court went on to say that, in any case, it was \u201cnot persuaded that admission of the evidence concerning the cocaine in the car had a tendency to affect the result of the trial,\u201d because \u201ccocaine was also found in a baggie that a deputy observed fall out of the petitioner\u2019s pocket, when petitioner was not in the car.\u201d Thus, the court noted \u201cthe pocket baggie was sufficient for a conviction even if the baggie in the car had never been discovered.\u201d Petitioner does not challenge that conclusion on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b258-6\"> Petitioner does not renew his argument under the Equal Protection Clause of the federal constitution. Petitioner also raises, for the first time on appeal, an argument that the trial court\u2019s orders limiting the time of the hearing and his ability to call live witnesses violated UTCR 1.040 and UTCR 1.050, as well as ORS 3.220(1). Because those arguments are not preserved, we do not reach them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\"> In direct appeals of criminal cases, the United States Supreme Court has held that \u201cbefore a federal constitutional error can be held harmless, the [reviewing] court must be able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 US 18, 24, 87 S Ct 824, 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). Later, the Court held that a less stringent harmlessness standard applies in determining whether habeas relief must be granted for a constitutional error that occurred during the petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 US 619, 113 S Ct 1710, 123 L Ed 2d 353 (1993). That harmlessness standard is whether the federal constitutional error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 637 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under <em>Brecht, </em>then, it seems clear that we are not to apply the beyond a reasonable doubt harmlessness standard in a case like this, which does not involve a direct review of a criminal trial. However, it is not as clear whether the standard in <em>Brecht </em>is appropriate, or whether a lesser standard would apply given that, unlike in <em>Brecht, </em>in this case we are dealing with a constitutional error that allegedly occurred in the post-conviction proceeding itself, <em>not </em>in the underlying criminal trial. We conclude that, even assuming the standard in <em>Brecht </em>applies in this context, the error in this case did not have a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence\u201d in determining the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits of the petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
