Claimant argues that the board erred in analyzing his right wrist condition as an occupational disease, both in failing to give adequate weight to the sudden onset of symptoms and because the finding of gradual onset is not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">We state the facts consistently with the board\u2019s unchallenged factual findings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant worked for employer Willamette Valley Rehabilitation Center (employer) from December 1994 to October 2010. His work duties included stacking wood, operating a nail gun, cutting wood with a saw, and wrapping bundles of sticks (the sticks job). For the sticks job, claimant held an elastic band in his left hand while he held and rotated a bundle of sticks with his right hand so that the sticks became wrapped inside the band. Throughout 2008, claimant experienced bilateral wrist pain during occasions when employer assigned him to the sticks job, but claimant primarily worked for employer as a sawyer, a job that involved repetitively cutting boards on a table saw.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">On April 5, 2010, claimant was assigned to the sticks job. Claimant developed pain that day in his right wrist and later testified that he felt as though the work was \u201ctearing\u201d his \u201ccartilage.\u201d Claimant worked again at the sticks job on April 6 and experienced more pain. On April 7, 2010, claimant continued performing the sticks job. At the end of that shift, his right wrist was very painful, and he advised employer of his right wrist pain. Claimant submitted a form to employer on April 10, 2010, stating that he had injured his right wrist while doing the sticks job on April 5, 2010. Claimant later filed an \u201c827\u201d workers\u2019 compensation claim form for \u201cwrist pain bilaterally\u201d caused by wrapping \u201csticks with nylon banding tight\u201d on April 5, 2010, \u201cafter lunch.\u201d Claimant took some time off of work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>and, when he returned, he was assigned to a different job. On May 26, 2010, employer denied claimant\u2019s right wrist pain claim, which is the subject of the pending dispute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Claimant\u2019s last day of work for employer was October 27, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">Although claimant initially saw doctors who diagnosed the wrist pain as either related to a cyst in claimant\u2019s wrist or as tendonitis, his right wrist symptoms continued, and an MRI arthrogram performed in September 2010 showed that the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) in his right wrist was possibly abnormal. On November 3, 2010, Dr. Dodds performed arthroscopic surgery, during which he discovered a \u201cfairly large central tear of the [TFC] with the head of the ulna exposed in the defect\u201d and repaired the tear. Claimant\u2019s right wrist symptoms significantly improved after the surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Dr. Button, a hand and upper-extremity expert retained by employer, examined claimant and reviewed his medical records. Button took x-rays that revealed a \u201cpreexisting abnormality likely related to a childhood wrist fracture with shortening of the radius, resulting in a secondary prominence of the ulna, termed ulnar positive variance, causing an ulnar impaction syndrome.\u201d In Button\u2019s opinion, the bone-length variance, combined with activities of daily living, \u201cimpacted, compressed, and squeezed\u201d the cartilage, leading to thinning and, ultimately, tearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Although there was a significant dispute regarding Button\u2019s assumption that the ulnar variance resulted from an undiagnosed childhood wrist fracture, Dodds agreed that claimant has a positive ulnar variance and that the variance \u201cmay be regarded as representing a predisposition for thinning of the [TFC] produced by both repetitive work activities as well as a lifetime of normal usage.\u201d Ultimately, Dodds opined that he was \u201cunable to say with certainty when or where the wrist cartilage tear treated by surgery occurred,\u201d but that claimant\u2019s work activities in April 2010 \u201crepresent the major contributing cause of the need for surgery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Following a hearing held in July 2012, the administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that claimant\u2019s right wrist claim should be analyzed as an injury, rather than an occupational disease, because \u201cclaimant\u2019s symptomatic right TFC tear requiring surgery, as distinct from his prior asymptomatic right TFC condition, probably developed during the discrete period of performing the sticks [job] from April 5, 2010 to April 7, 2010.\u201d He credited Dodds\u2019s opinion as establishing that claimant\u2019s work activities were at least the material contributing cause of that condition and set aside employer\u2019s denial of the right wrist claim. On review, the board adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact but reinstated the denial. The board determined that the claim should be analyzed as one for an occupational disease because the pertinent condition was \u201cclaimant\u2019s right TFC tear [which] is not traceable to an identified work event or discrete period.\u201d The board found that claimant failed to prove that his work activities were the major contributing cause of the tear \u2014 as required to prove a compensable occupational disease, ORS 656.802(2)(a) \u2014 and upheld employer\u2019s denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">On judicial review, claimant challenges various aspects of the board\u2019s determination that claimant\u2019s TFC tear should be analyzed as an occupational disease. Claimant argues both that the board was required to assign greater relevance to the sudden onset of symptoms in evaluating when the TFC tear occurred, and that the board\u2019s finding of a gradual onset is not supported by substantial evidence or substantial reason. We review the board\u2019s legal conclusions for legal error and its determinations on factual issues for substantial evidence, which includes substantial reason. ORS 183.482(8); <em>Cummings v. SAIF, </em>197 Or App 312, 318, 105 P3d 875 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Whether a claim is most appropriately analyzed as one for an occupational disease or an injury turns on whether the \u201ccondition\u201d is traceable to a discrete period or developed gradually over time. <em>Smirnoff v. SAIF, </em>188 Or App 438, 443, 72 P3d 118 (2003). As an initial matter, we emphasize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>that claimant does not urge us to adopt the AL J\u2019s focus on the \u201csymptomatic right TFC tear requiring surgery\u201d as the pertinent \u201ccondition.\u201d The ALJ emphasized that a condition must require medical services or result in disability or death to be compensable. ORS 656.005(7)(a); ORS 656.802(l)(a). But the ALJ\u2019s focus on symptoms as the condition is inconsistent with our decision in <em>Smirnoff, </em>in which we held that the claimant, who suffered from an asymptomatic meniscal tear that became symptomatic during a discrete work episode, presented a claim for an occupational disease because the meniscal tear occurred gradually. 188 Or App at 449. <em>Smirnoff </em>emphasizes that the onset of the symptoms is \u201cone consideration in determining the nature of the onset of the condition,\u201d but that the condition is not just the symptoms. <em>Id. </em>at 444.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Claimant, nevertheless, emphasizes our statement in <em>Smirnoff </em>that \u201cthe degree of the relevance of the onset of symptoms to determine the nature of the onset of the condition will vary depending on the circumstances, in particular the nature of the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446. Claimant argues that Dodds was uncertain about whether the onset of the tear was sudden or gradual and that Dodds\u2019s uncertainty makes this a case in which \u201cthe relevancy of the onset of symptoms would be great.\u201d However, the board did not share claimant\u2019s interpretation of the medical evidence. The board supported its finding that claimant\u2019s TFC tear developed gradually by pointing to Dodds\u2019s statement that thinning of the TFC could have been caused by work activities \u201cas well as a lifetime of normal usage,\u201d and Button\u2019s opinion that claimant\u2019s ulnar variance caused compression, squeezing, and a gradual wearing away of the TFC with \u201cactivities of daily living.\u201d The board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence and, consequently, substantial reason, because the board explained how its findings of fact related to its legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>conclusions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the board did not err in analyzing claimant\u2019s condition as an occupational disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-8\"> The board adopted the administrative law judge\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b509-7\"> Employer also issued a denial of claimant\u2019s left wrist condition, but claimant did not challenge that denial at hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b511-5\"> We note that a diagnosed condition would not have been required for claimant to litigate the claim he filed for \u201cright wrist pain.\u201d <em>See Boeing Aircraft Co. v. Roy, </em>112 Or App 10, 14, 827 P2d 915 (1992) (claimant could prove pain symptoms were a compensable injury without proving a specific medical diagnosis to explain the symptoms). However, our cases require that, once the source of the pain was diagnosed, claimant needed to prove that the diagnosed condition was compensable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b512-5\"> Claimant\u2019s argument that the board\u2019s opinion lacked substantial reason depends on claimant\u2019s characterization of the facts. Because the board made alternate factual determinations that were supported by substantial evidence, claimant\u2019s substantial reason argument is inapposite.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
