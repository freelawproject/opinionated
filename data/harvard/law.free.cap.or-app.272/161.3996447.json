Defendant requests that we review his sentences as plain error under ORAP 5.45(1), and exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Defendant pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree attempted assault. ORS 161.405(2)(c) (\u201cAn attempt is a * * * Class C felony if the offense attempted is a Class B felony.\u201d); ORS 163.175(2) (\u201cAssault in the second degree is a Class B felony.\u201d). The court imposed a sentence of 36 months\u2019 imprisonment and 36 months of PPS on Count 1 and an identical sentence on Count 2, and ordered defendant to serve the sentences concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The statutory maximum indeterminate sentence for a Class C felony is 60 months. ORS 161.605(3). OAR 213-005-0002(4) provides, in part, that \u201c[t]he term of [PPS], when added to the prison term, shall not exceed the statutory maximum indeterminate sentence for the crime of conviction.\u201d The state concedes that the PPS term of 36 months for each count exceeds the limitation imposed by OAR 213-005-0002(4). Nevertheless, the state urges us not to exercise our discretion to correct the error, asserting that, if defendant had raised an objection in a timely manner, the court \u201ceasily could have \u2014 and certainly would have \u2014 imposed the very same overall sentence.\u201d The state reasons that the court would have reduced the PPS term on the conviction for Count 1 to 24 months, and then reduced the concurrent prison term on Count 2 to 24 months, which would have allowed it to impose the 3 6-month term of PPS on that conviction. The state argues, therefore, that the \u201cnet result would have been precisely the same: defendant would serve 36 months in prison and then, upon his release, would serve 36 months on [PPS].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We have previously declined to exercise our discretion to review a sentencing error when \u201cwe conclude [d] that the \u2018gravity of the error\u2019 was insignificant, as the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>would have imposed the same sentence in any event.\u201d <em>State v. Jenniches, </em>187 Or App 658, 663, 69 P3d 771, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 578 (2003). In <em>Jenniches, </em>the record reflected that, on remand, \u201cthe sentencing court <em>would </em>impose the same total term of imprisonment\u201d that it had originally imposed. <em>Id. </em>at 664 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Although the state is correct that the sentencing court could have reached the same \u201cnet result,\u201d we are not convinced that the record indicates that it is <em>certain </em>that the court would do so. <em>See State v. Marshall, </em>219 Or App 511, 518, 183 P3d 241 (2008) (remanding for resentencing when it was possible the court would impose the same incarceration term, but not certain that the court would do so); <em>see also State v. Saechao, </em>256 Or App 369, 373, 300 P3d 287 (2013). Accordingly, we accept the state\u2019s concession and, for the reasons stated in <em>State v. Ramos, </em>254 Or App 748, 749, 295 P3d 176 (2013), we exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
