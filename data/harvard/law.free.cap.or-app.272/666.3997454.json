J.</author>\n<p id=\"b688-3\">This proceeding involves a petition and cross-petition for review of a final order of the Land Use Board of Appeals (LUBA) that remanded the declaratory ruling of the Deschutes County Board of Commissioners (the county) that a conceptual master plan (CMP) for a destination resort had been \u201cinitiated\u201d within the county code\u2019s time limitations. In the petition, petitioner contends that LUBA erred by deferring to the county\u2019s \u201cimplausible\u201d interpretation of a code provision that addressed whether a CMP had been \u201cinitiated.\u201d Alternatively, petitioner complains that the county\u2019s finding that the applicant was not at fault for failing to comply with conditions of approval in the CMP was not supported by substantial evidence. In the cross-petition, respondent Loyal Land, LLC (Loyal Land) maintains that LUBA failed to give the county\u2019s interpretation of another portion of the county code proper deference. We reverse and remand on the petition, and affirm on the cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">The proposed destination resort has an extensive history of litigation. For purposes of this opinion, we provide only the details necessary to understand and analyze the issues here. The Thornburgh Resort is a proposed destination resort on about 2,000 acres in Deschutes County. Under the Deschutes County Code (DCC), the approval of a destination resort requires three steps. First, the county must approve a CMP. DCC 18.113.040(A). Second, the county must approve a final master plan (FMP). DCC 18.113.040(B). And third, each element or development phase of the resort must receive additional approval through a required site-plan review or subdivision process. DCC 18.113.040(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Loyal Land\u2019s predecessor,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thornburgh Resort Company, LLC, obtained an approved CMP from the county in May 2006. Petitioner appealed the county\u2019s decision approving the CMP to LUBA, and LUBA remanded that decision. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>54 Or LUBA 205 (2007) <em>(Gould I). </em>Petitioner then sought our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>of LUBA\u2019s decision, asking us to grant a more extensive remand than the one granted by LUBA. On review, we agreed with petitioner that LUBA had erred in part, and remanded the case. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>216 Or App 150, 171 P3d 1017 (2007) <em>(Gould II). </em>On April 15, 2008, the county approved the version of the CMP that is at issue in this proceeding, and included 42 conditions of approval, some of which would require an approved FMP before they could be completed. Petitioner appealed that decision to LUBA, and LUBA affirmed. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>57 Or LUBA 403 (2008) <em>(Gould III). </em>Petitioner again sought our review of LUBA\u2019s decision, and in <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>227 Or App 601, 206 P3d 1106, <em>rev den, </em>347 Or 258 (2009) <em>(Gould IV), </em>we affirmed. Meanwhile, on October 8, 2008, the county approved Thornburgh\u2019s FMP. Petitioner appealed the approved FMP to LUBA, and LUBA remanded the county\u2019s FMP decision. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>59 Or LUBA 435 (2009) <em>(Gould V). </em>We affirmed LUBA\u2019s remand of the FMP. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>233 Or App 623, 227 P3d 758 (2010) <em>(Gould VI). </em>And, on August 17, 2010, LUBA remanded the FMP to the county.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Under the DCC, a CMP approval, as a land use permit, \u201cis void two years after the date the discretionary decision becomes final if the use approved in the permit is not initiated within that time period.\u201d DCC 22.36.010(B)(1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">\u201c[a] development action undertaken under a land use approval * * * has been \u2018initiated\u2019 if it is determined that: *** Where construction is not required by the approval, the conditions of a permit or approval have been substantially exercised and any failure to fully comply with the conditions is not the fault of the applicant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The two-year limit on Loyal Land\u2019s CMP was set to expire on November 11, 2011. Ten days before the expiration date, Loyal Land asked the county, pursuant to the county code, for a declaratory ruling that the CMP had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>\u201cinitiated\u201d under DCC 22.36.020(A)(3). A hearings officer ruled that the CMP had been initiated, and the county commission declined to exercise discretionary review of that decision. Petitioner appealed the hearings officer\u2019s decision to LUBA, challenging the officer\u2019s interpretation of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3). LUBA concluded that the hearings officer had incorrectly interpreted the code provision, and remanded the matter to the county.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>67 Or LUBA 1 (LUBA No 2012-042, Jan 8, 2013) <em>(Gould VII).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">The issues before us in this proceeding flow from LUBA\u2019s decision in <em>Gould VII. </em>Accordingly, we pause to examine that decision. DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) requires two findings to determine if a development action authorized by a permit has been initiated: (1) whether the conditions of approval have been substantially exercised (the \u201csubstantially exercised prong\u201d), and (2) whether, for any conditions that have not been fully complied with, the failure to comply with the conditions is \u201cnot the fault of the applicant\u201d (the \u201cfault of the applicant prong\u201d). <em>Gould VII, </em>67 Or LUBA at 19. In <em>Gould VII, </em>LUBA was tasked with reviewing the hearings officer\u2019s conclusion that, in evaluating the substantially exercised prong, the county had to consider only those conditions that could be satisfied without FMP, land division, or site plan approvals. That is, the hearings officer had concluded that, out of the 42 conditions of approval in the CMP, for purposes of determining if Loyal Land had substantially exercised the conditions of approval, the officer only had to consider the 15 conditions that she found <em>\u201crelevant\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>those conditions that did not require the applicant to acquire additional permits and approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>On appeal, LUBA disagreed, concluding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">\u201cthe hearings officer must be able to find both that the [42] conditions of approval, viewed as a whole, have been substantially exercised <em>and </em>that for any of the [42] conditions of approval where there has been a failure to fully exercise the condition, the applicant is not at fault.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\"><em>Gould VII, </em>67 Or LUBA at 19 (emphasis in original). Accordingly, LUBA remanded to the county to \u201cconsider whether all of the [42] conditions of approval have been 'substantially exercised,\u2019 including those that required that the applicant seek additional permits and approvals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>LUBA clarified that the applicant need not show that <em>\u201ceach </em>of the [42] conditions must <em>separately </em>be \u2018substantially exercised\u2019\u201d but that the 42 conditions of approval, \u201cviewed as a whole, have been substantially exercised.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed LUBA\u2019s <em>Gould VII </em>decision without opinion. <em>Gould v. Deschutes County, </em>256 Or App 520, 301 P3d 978 (2013) <em>(Gould VIII).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">On remand from <em>Gould VII, </em>the hearings officer determined that Loyal Land had not initiated the CMP before it had expired. In particular, the hearings officer concluded that Loyal Land had not \u201csubstantially exercised\u201d the 42 conditions of approval and that Loyal Land was at fault for not fully complying with many of the conditions. The county commission took discretionary review of the hearings officer\u2019s decision and rejected it, concluding instead that the CMP had been timely initiated. The county concluded that, although 19 of the 42 conditions were \u201cfully exercised\u201d and one additional condition was \u201csubstantially exercised,\u201d the remaining 22 conditions \u201crequired the occurrence of a contingency that did not occur by November 18, 2011.\u201d The county explained that Loyal Land had substantially exercised \u201c100% of the conditions of approval that were relevant and necessary to initiation of the CMP.\u201d Because Loyal Land had substantially exercised 100 percent of the conditions that were \u201crelevant and necessary to initiation of the CMP,\u201d the county decided that Loyal Land\u2019s actions \u201cconstitute substantial exercise of the conditions of approval of the CMP as a whole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>As to the fault of the applicant prong, the county concluded that Loyal Land\u2019s failure to comply with 23 conditions was \u201cnot the fault of the applicant.\u201d For each condition that Loyal Land had not fully complied with, the county noted that full compliance with the applicable condition \u201ccannot occur until there is a final, approved FMP for the project, and that contingency has not occurred.\u201d The county further concluded that, as to the 23 conditions, Loyal Land\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201cfailure to fully comply with the condition prior to November 18, 2011 (including the failure to cause any contingency to full compliance to occur) is not the fault of the applicant because of the three-step process for approving destination resorts * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">The county explained that \u201c[t]he two-year expiration of land use approvals under DCC 22.36.010 [(B)(1)] must be applied to a destination resort CMP in a manner consistent with the three-step approval process for destination resorts created under DCC Chapter 18.113.\u201d The county claimed that, in creating the three-step process, it \u201cnever intended that the general two-year expiration of land use permits under DCC 22.36.010 [(B)(1)] would require full compliance with all conditions of a CMP within two years of approval of the CMP[,]\u201d and that, \u201c[t]o find otherwise would effectively dismantle the three-step approval process of DCC Chapter 18.113 and make meaningful review and oversight of destination resorts impossible.\u201d The county further concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">\u201cthe applicant is not at fault for failing to achieve something (full compliance with all CMP conditions within two years) that: (a) was never intended by the Board; (b) would require the applicant to violate the approved phasing plan in the CMP; and (c) would be practically impossible to achieve for a complex project such as the Thornburgh Resort under the three-step approval process created by DCC Chapter 18.113.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Petitioner appealed the county\u2019s decision to LUBA, raising four assignments of error. Her first three assignments addressed the substantially exercised prong and her fourth assignment addressed the fault of the applicant prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>In <em>Gould v. Deschutes </em>County, ___ Or LUBA ___ (LUBA No 2014-080, Jan 30, 2015) <em>(Gould IX), </em>the decision that we now review, LUBA concluded that, as to the substantially exercised prong, the county had impermissibly revisited \u201cinterpretative issues\u201d that had been resolved by LUBA in <em>Gould VII. </em>That is, LUBA, in reviewing the hearings officer\u2019s decision in <em>Gould VII, </em>had interpreted DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) to require the hearings officer, when applying the substantially exercised prong, to consider <em>all </em>conditions of approval, not just those that could be satisfied without FMP, land division, or site plan approvals. LUBA agreed with petitioner that the \u201claw of the case\u201d principle set out in <em>Beck v. City of Tillamook, </em>313 Or 148, 831 P2d 678 (1992), precluded the county commission from \u201crevisiting\u201d those interpretative issues on remand. LUBA further agreed that the county, in rejecting the hearings officer\u2019s decision on remand, had adopted an interpretation of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) that was inconsistent with LUBA\u2019s interpretation of that provision in <em>Gould VII. </em>In particular, LUBA concluded that the county had avoided considering all 42 conditions as a whole; instead, the county had done what LUBA had explicitly rejected as impermissible in <em>Gould </em>VII\u2014dismissing as unimportant conditions that required additional approvals. On that basis, LUBA remanded the county\u2019s decision. <em>Gould </em>IX, ___ Or LUBA at ___ (slip op at 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">LUBA, however, rejected petitioner\u2019s fourth assignment of error aimed at the county\u2019s decision on the fault of the applicant prong. Petitioner had argued to the county that Loyal Land was at fault for its failure to fully comply with 23 of the conditions of approval, because it (1) delayed initiating proceedings after the FMP decision was remanded to the county in August 2010, (2) failed to seek extensions of the CMP as allowed by the DCC, and (3) failed to present substantial evidence to establish that it was not at fault for failing to fully comply with the conditions of approval. Loyal Land had presented argument and evidence to the county in support of its position that, to the extent that it had not complied with certain conditions, the \u201cfault\u201d lay with circumstances out of Loyal Land\u2019s control, such as delays by federal agencies, the \u201cGreat Recession,\u201d financing issues, and the complexity of the three-step process. As noted, the county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>had concluded that Loyal Land was not \u201cat fault\u201d for failing to comply with the 23 conditions that required additional approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-3\">In <em>Gould IX, </em>LUBA\u2019s scope of review of the county\u2019s interpretation of the fault of the applicant prong was prescribed by ORS 197.829(1). Under that statute, LUBA must affirm a local government\u2019s interpretation of its comprehensive plan and land use regulations if the local government\u2019s interpretation \u201cplausibly accounts for the text and context\u201d of the provisions. <em>Siporen v. City of Medford, </em>349 Or 247, 262, 243 P3d 776 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">LUBA concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">\u201cIf the [county] wants to make the complexity and length of the process that is required for destination resorts in general, and this one in particular, an important consideration in finding that it is not the \u2018fault of the applicant\u2019 under DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) that the applicant has not fully complied with 23 of the 42 conditions of approval, there is nothing in our decision in <em>Gould VII </em>that is inconsistent with that interpretation and application of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3). While it is perhaps unusual for a county to lay the blame for an applicant\u2019s inability to comply with CMP conditions of approval on the complexity of the county\u2019s own regulatory scheme, the county\u2019s interpretation and application of the \u2018fault of the applicant\u2019 prong of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) is not inconsistent with the text of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3), read in context, and it is not implausible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\"><em>Gould </em>IX, ___ Or LUBA at ___ (slip op at 25-26). Accordingly, LUBA affirmed the county\u2019s interpretation of the fault of the applicant prong, and rejected petitioner\u2019s fourth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">PETITION</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">On review, petitioner argues that LUBA\u2019s final order was \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 197.850(9)(a) (\u201cThe court shall reverse or remand the order only if it finds: The order to be unlawful in substance ***.\u201d). In her first assignment of error, petitioner urges us to reverse LUBA\u2019s conclusion that the county\u2019s interpretation of the fault of the applicant prong was plausible. In her second assignment, petitioner contends that LUBA erred by affirming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>the county\u2019s decision because the county\u2019s conclusion that Loyal Land was not at fault was not supported by \u201cadequate findings\u201d or substantial evidence. In particular, petitioner maintains that there is a dearth of evidence in the record and findings by the county as to whether Loyal Land was \u201cat fault\u201d for not using \u201ctime available to it\u201d and \u201cfailing to obtain the five years of extensions available to it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">We begin with petitioner\u2019s first assignment. LUBA\u2019s affirmance of the county\u2019s interpretation of the fault of the applicant prong is unlawful in substance if the county\u2019s interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">\u201c(a) Is inconsistent with the express language of the comprehensive plan or land use regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">\u201c(b) Is inconsistent with the purpose for the comprehensive plan or land use regulation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-7\">\u201c(c) Is inconsistent with the underlying policy that provides the basis for the comprehensive plan provision or land use regulation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-8\">\u201c(d) Is contrary to a state statute, land use goal or rule that the comprehensive plan provision or land use regulation implements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-9\">ORS 197.829(1). Whether the county\u2019s interpretation of its code is inconsistent with the code, or the purposes or policies underlying the code, \u201cdepends on whether the interpretation is plausible, given the interpretative principles that ordinarily apply to the construction of ordinances under the rules of <em>PGE </em>[v. <em>Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610-12, 859 P2d 1143 (1993),] as modified by <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009).\u201d <em>Setniker v. Polk County, </em>244 Or App 618, 633-34, 160 P3d 800, <em>rev den, </em>351 Or 216 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original). Merely because a stronger or more logical interpretation exists does not make a local government\u2019s interpretation implausible. <em>Siegert v. Crook County, </em>246 Or App 500, 509, 266 P3d 170 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-10\">Petitioner contends that the county effectively added text to the fault of the applicant prong which exempted destination resorts from that prong. Again, DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) provides, in part, that a development action has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>\u201cinitiated\u201d if \u201cthe conditions of a permit or approval have been substantially exercised and <em>any failure to comply with the conditions is not the fault of the applicant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Petitioner argues that by interpreting that provision in the way that the county <em>did\u2014i.e., </em>that Loyal Land\u2019s failure to fully comply with 23 of the CMP conditions of approval was not its fault because of the contingent nature of those conditions and the complexity of the process for approving destination resorts\u2014the county has created an <em>ad hoc </em>exemption for destination resorts. Petitioner explains that, if the county intended to exempt destination resorts from the fault of the applicant prong, the county must do so by amending the text of the code. In other words, the county can specify particular kinds of land use applications as exempt from a code standard, but only through text in the code\u2014not by an <em>ad hoc </em>interpretation. Petitioner urges that the only plausible interpretation of the DCC, as written, requires the county to evaluate whether the particular destination resort applicant bears responsibility for failure to comply with contingent conditions\u2014including the applicant\u2019s efforts to cause the contingency underlying the condition to come to fruition.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">Petitioner also contends that the county\u2019s interpretation does not plausibly account for the text and context of the DCC because it was based, in part, on the faulty premise that an applicant has only two years to initiate the project. Petitioner points to DCC provisions that allow for up to five years of extensions for CMPs, so that theoretically, applicants have up to seven years to \u201cinitiate\u201d destination resort CMPs. Petitioner argues that the county\u2019s interpretation has \u201cinterpreted out of its Code these provisions which allow the planning director to approve an additional five years to initiate a use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Loyal Land defends the county\u2019s interpretation, explaining that it must be affirmed because the county looked at the \u201cwhole code\u201d and harmonized the text of arguably conflicting provisions to adopt an interpretation consistent with the purposes and policies underlying the DCC. Specifically, Loyal Land contends that the county harmonized the \u201cgeneral\u201d requirements of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) with the code provisions in DCC chapter 18.113 that define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the requirements for a destination resort CMP. Loyal Land maintains that the county did not exempt destination resorts from the fault of the applicant prong but, instead, concluded that application of that code provision depends on the requirements of the specific permit under review. In this case, Loyal Land maintains that the county viewed DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) in context with DCC chapter 18.113, and concluded that DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) can be interpreted to allow for \u201cflexibility\u201d when assessing fault of an applicant whose CMP conditions of approval include contingencies that are unlikely to occur within the two-year limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">As for petitioner\u2019s argument about the availability of extensions, Loyal Land maintains that, because extensions are discretionary and nothing in the code requires an applicant to exhaust extensions before seeking a declaration of initiation, the mere availability of extensions \u201cis not a basis to overturn LUBA\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Because it is essential to our analysis, we begin with the substance of the county\u2019s interpretation. As noted, with respect to each of the 23 conditions that Loyal Land had not fully complied with, the county concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-6\">\u201cfull compliance with [the condition] cannot occur until there is a final, approved FMP for the project, and that contingency has not yet occurred. The [county] further finds that the failure to fully comply with this condition is not the applicant\u2019s fault for that reason and for the reasons explained below under the heading \u2018Cumulative Findings\u2014 Failure to Fully Comply is Not the Fault of the Applicant.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Under that heading, the county explained that \u201cthe failure to fully comply with the condition prior to November 18,2011 (including the failure to cause any contingency to full compliance to occur) is not the fault of the applicant <em>because </em>of the three-step process for approving destination resorts in Deschutes County as further elaborated below.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The county went on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\u201cThe two-year expiration of land use approvals under DCC 22.36.010 [(B)(1)] must be applied to a destination resort CMP in a manner consistent with the three-step approval process for destination resorts created under DCC Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>18.113. The three-step process was consciously created by the Board to provide a mechanism for meaningful review and oversight of very complex development projects, and in doing so the Board never intended that the general two-year expiration of land use permits under DCC 22.36.010 [(B)(1)] would require full compliance with all conditions of a CMP within two years of approval of the CMP (tolled only for appeals of the CMP). To find otherwise would effectively dismantle the three-step approval process of DCC Chapter 18.113 and make meaningful review and oversight of destination resorts impossible. It would also negate the express power of the Board under DCC 18.113.050 [(B)(8)] to approve multiyear phasing plans for destination resorts that exceed two years, such as the phasing plan approved for the Thornburgh Resort. Accordingly, the applicant is not at fault for failing to achieve something (full compliance with all CMP conditions within two years) that: (a) was never intended by the Board; (b) would require the applicant to violate the approved phasing plan in the CMP; and (c) would be practically impossible to achieve for a complex project such as the Thornburgh Resort under the three-step approval process created by DCC Chapter 18.113.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">To begin with, we disagree with the broad premise advanced by petitioner that the county, by interpreting the fault of the applicant prong in the way that it did, entirely exempted applicants for destination resorts from that code provision. The county determined that Loyal Land was not at fault for failing to fully comply with <em>the conditions of approval that could not he fully complied with until there was a final approved FMP. </em>That is, to the extent that the county considered the complexity of the three-step approval process as a reason that Loyal Land failed to fully comply with 23 conditions, the county applied that view only to those conditions that were \u201ccontingent\u201d on FMP approval. Accordingly, even if, as petitioner asserts, the county absolved Loyal Land of fault because of the complexity of the three-step process, it did not do so for failure to comply with <em>any </em>condition of approval; rather it has done so as to only the \u201ccontingent\u201d conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Nevertheless, we agree that LUBA erred in concluding that the county\u2019s interpretation of the fault of the applicant prong was plausible. LUBA, in rejecting petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>fault of the applicant prong argument, noted that it was plausible for the county \u201cto make the complexity and length of the process that is required for destination resorts in general, and this one in particular, an important consideration\u201d in finding that it is not the \u201cfault of the applicant\u201d for failure to fully comply with the 23 contingent conditions. We agree that the county plausibly could interpret the code so that the complexity and length of the three-step process are important considerations in determining whether an applicant is at fault for failure to comply with a condition\u2014particularly a contingent condition that requires approval of a subsequent phase in a multi-phase process. However, we understand the county to have made the complexity of the three-step process the <em>only </em>consideration in determining whether the applicant was at fault for failing to comply with those contingent conditions, and we conclude that that is an implausible interpretation of the DCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">That conclusion is premised on the explicit text of the board\u2019s decision (i.e., failure to fully comply with the conditions \u201cis not the fault of the applicant because of the three-step process for approving destination resorts in Deschutes County\u201d) and the complete lack of findings in the county\u2019s decision as to the specific facts of this case. That is, the county\u2019s findings lack factual support as to why, in this particular instance, the complexity of the process or the specific nature of the contingent conditions precluded Loyal Land from complying with any of the contingent conditions within the required time frame. Accordingly, we are left to conclude, in the absence of such findings, that the county interpreted the code so that, for destination resort CMPs in which compliance with some conditions is contingent on FMP approval, the complexity of the three-step process is the <em>only </em>consideration in determining whether the applicant was at fault for failing to comply with those contingent conditions. We conclude that, although the complexity of the three-step process is one acceptable consideration in determining the fault of the applicant in such cases, it cannot plausibly be the only consideration. That is so because such an interpretation effectively rewrites the explicit text of the code so that a development action has been \u201cinitiated\u201d if the conditions of the permit or approval have been substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>exercised and any failure to fully comply with the conditions <em>that are not contingent on FMP approval </em>is not the fault of the applicant. That interpretation is inconsistent with the explicit text of the DCC, which requires the county to examine the applicant\u2019s fault as to <em>all </em>conditions of approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The code explicitly requires the county, when evaluating whether a development action has been \u201cinitiated,\u201d to consider the fault of the applicant for failure to comply with <em>the </em>conditions\u2014not just those conditions that are not contingent. Therefore, the only plausible reading of that provision is that the fault of the applicant must be considered as to all conditions of approval\u2014even the contingent conditions. However, the county\u2019s interpretation\u2014that because the three-step process is so complex, any condition contingent on FMP approval necessarily is not the fault of the applicant\u2014 creates a blanket exemption from fault for any destination resort applicant that fails to comply with CMP conditions contingent on approval of a FMP. In doing so, the county has interpreted the code provision, which explicitly requires evaluation of the fault of the applicant as to all conditions, so that an applicant cannot be at fault for failure to comply with conditions that are contingent on FMP approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">As noted, in a given case, the complexity of the process, the specific nature of the conditions of approval (such as conditions that would require violation of the CMP\u2019s approved phasing), and other circumstances outside of the applicant\u2019s control may indeed support a determination that the applicant was not at fault for failure to comply with conditions contingent on FMP approval. Nevertheless, it is implausible for the county to interpret the code so that an applicant is excused from fault for failure to comply with such contingent conditions solely because, in the abstract, the process is too complex. That conclusion impermissibly treats as irrelevant an applicant\u2019s responsibility for the failure of the contingency to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">In this case, in response to petitioner\u2019s second assignment of error, Loyal Land points to evidence and argument in the record which it asserts demonstrates that it was not at fault for the failure of the FMP approval to occur. And Loyal Land argues that that evidence supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>the county\u2019s finding that it was not at fault. However, we cannot locate anything in the county\u2019s decision which we can fairly characterize as findings on the specific evidence in the record. The county does not mention any evidence that is specific to Loyal Land\u2019s circumstances or the CMP; instead, as noted, the county appears to have based its conclusion on the fault of the applicant prong on its interpretation that the complexity of the three-step process is the sole consideration. It may be that, based on the parties\u2019 arguments and the evidence, the county could have found that Loyal Land was not at fault for its failure to secure FMP approval and comply with the contingent conditions in the CMP, but we see no indication that that is what the county did in the decision before us. The county, however, will have a chance to evaluate the evidence on that issue on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">We also briefly address petitioner\u2019s argument that, because the DCC provides an applicant for a destination resort an opportunity to seek extensions of CMPs for up to five years, the county\u2019s interpretation of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) is implausible.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Although an applicant\u2019s failure to seek extensions that are available to it could plausibly be considered in the analysis under the fault of the applicant, we do not conclude, as petitioner seems to argue, that the only plausible interpretation of the DCC is that failure to take advantage of the available extensions means that the applicant is at fault for failure to comply with conditions contingent on FMP approval. Put another way, although the failure of an applicant to seek extensions could be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s fault, we do not understand the county\u2019s interpretation to prohibit such a consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that LUBA\u2019s order affirming the county\u2019s interpretation of the fault of the applicant prong is unlawful in substance, and we reverse and remand on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>CROSS-PETITION</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Loyal Land\u2019s cross-petition challenges LUBA\u2019s determination that, on remand from <em>Gould VII, </em>the county erroneously \u201creconsidered\u201d interpretative issues involving the substantially exercised prong that were decided by LUBA in <em>Gould VII </em>and, in doing so, reached conclusions that were inconsistent with LUBA\u2019s interpretation. LUBA determined that \u201cinterpretative issues\u201d that it resolved in <em>Gould VII </em>could not be reconsidered by the county in \u201cthis new phase of the same case.\u201d Loyal Land contends that the county\u2019s treatment of the substantially exercised prong on remand was consistent with LUBA\u2019s interpretation in <em>Gould VII </em>and, alternatively, even if it was inconsistent, the county could interpret its code for the first time on remand even though LUBA had already done so. Loyal Land\u2019s cross-petition raises an issue of first impression that we left open in <em>Canfield v. Yamhill County, </em>142 Or App 12, 20 n 4, 920 P2d 558 (1996): \u201cwhether a local government, on remand, may interpret its legislation differently from the way LUBA or we interpreted it * * * in remanding the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">A quick recap of the relevant procedural history is helpful to our discussion of this issue. As noted, when Loyal Land asked the county for a declaratory ruling that the CMP had been initiated, a hearings officer so ruled. The county declined to exercise discretionary review of that ruling, and petitioner appealed the hearings officer\u2019s ruling to LUBA, challenging the officer\u2019s interpretation of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3). Accordingly, in <em>Gould VII, </em>LUBA determined that the hearings officer had incorrectly interpreted the substantially exercised prong of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3), and remanded to the county. As we noted in discussing the petition, a governing body\u2019s interpretation of local land use laws is entitled to deference from LUBA. <em>See </em>ORS 197.829. However, a hearings officer\u2019s decision is not entitled to any deference. <em>Gage v. City of Portland, </em>319 Or 308, 317, 877 P2d 1187 (1994). Accordingly, in <em>Gould VII, </em>LUBA reviewed the hearings officer\u2019s interpretation of the substantially exercised prong by applying the traditional methods of interpretation, and did not grant any deference to the hearings officer\u2019s interpretation. As noted, LUBA disagreed with the hearings officer\u2019s interpretation, posited its own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>interpretation of the substantially exercised prong, and remanded to the county.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">On remand, the hearings officer decided that, under LUBA\u2019s interpretation of the substantially exercised prong in <em>Gould VII, </em>Loyal Land had failed to substantially exercise the conditions as a whole. The county took discretionary review of that decision and, in proceedings before the county, Loyal Land urged the county to give its own interpretation of the substantially exercised prong even though LUBA had interpreted that provision in <em>Gould VII. </em>The county did so, concluding that \u201cinterpretation of the DCC is ultimately the responsibility of the [county], and since the [county] has not previously interpreted DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) it is empowered and may do so now.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">Accordingly, the first question is whether the county\u2019s interpretation of the substantially exercised prong was inconsistent with LUBA\u2019s interpretation of that code provision in <em>Gould VII. </em>We conclude that it was. We agree with LUBA that the county\u2019s interpretation of the substantially exercised prong essentially avoided consideration of conditions that required FMP approval by treating them as \u201cirrelevant.\u201d That approach was inconsistent with LUBA\u2019s decision in <em>Gould VII, </em>which directed that on remand the county should consider \u201cwhether all of the [42] conditions of approval have been \u2018substantially exercised,\u2019 including those that required that the applicant seek additional permits and approvals.\u201d 67 Or LUBA at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The second question is whether the inconsistency of the county\u2019s interpretation matters. Loyal Land contends that the county is authorized to independently interpret the substantially exercised prong on remand even though LUBA already did so in <em>Gould VII. </em>Loyal Land argues that the county\u2019s interpretation of the substantially exercised prong, even under circumstances where LUBA has already interpreted that code provision, is entitled on appeal to deference under ORS 197.829(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">In rejecting that argument, LUBA concluded that the law of the case principle reflected in <em>Beck, </em>counsels that interpretative issues decided by LUBA in <em>Gould VII </em>could not be revisited and resolved differently by the county on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>remand. LUBA explained that \u201claw of the case\u201d facilitates judicial efficiency, and that if the county were allowed to revisit on remand interpretative issues decided by LUBA in an earlier phase of the case, judicial efficiency would be sacrificed. LUBA noted that, had the county adopted the hearings officer\u2019s first decision, on appeal in <em>Gould VII, </em>LUBA would have been bound to review that decision under the deferential standard of review set forth in ORS 197.829(1) and <em>Siporen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">In response to LUBA\u2019s decision, Loyal Land essentially asserts that the deference principle reflected in ORS 197.829(1), as explained in <em>Siporen, </em>trumps the law of the case doctrine. Loyal Land maintains that, under <em>Siporen, </em>the county \u201cis the final arbiter of what its own code means,\u201d that <em>Beck </em>is inapplicable to the facts here, and that, because the county never had a chance to interpret DCC 22.36.020(A)(3) before remand in <em>Gould VII, </em>the issue was not previously resolved in this proceeding. In addition, Loyal Land claims that ORS 197.829(1) prescribes the only bases on which LUBA can reverse a local land use decision, and that a county\u2019s interpretation of its code that is inconsistent with LUBA\u2019s own interpretation is not among those bases. Finally, Loyal Land asserts that judicial efficiency is not served by \u201cforcing a local government to hear every appeal from a hearings officer to avoid losing the opportunity to interpret its own code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In <em>Beck, </em>the Supreme Court concluded, based on statute, that issues that LUBA decided in earlier proceedings, and upon which judicial review was not sought, are not subject to review in a judicial review of a subsequent LUBA order. 313 Or at 153. \u201cThus, when LUBA remands a case for further proceedings, the parties are limited to \u2018new, unresolved issues\u2019 relating to those remand instructions and cannot raise any \u2018issues that LUBA affirmed or reversed on their merits.\u2019\u201d <em>Devin Oil Co. v. Morrow County, </em>252 Or App 101, 112-13, 286 P3d 925 (2012) (quoting <em>Beck, </em>313 Or at 153). After <em>Beck, </em>we explained that \u201c[t]he overriding principle of <em>Beck </em>is that issues in land use cases must be brought to finality at the earliest available opportunity.\u201d <em>McKay Creek Valley v. Washington County (A79679), </em>122 Or App 59, 64, 857 P2d 167 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>Obviously, <em>Beck </em>is distinct from this case. Nevertheless, the \u201coverriding principle\u201d of <em>Beck </em>is instructive to our analysis and, as we explain below, leads us to conclude that the law of the case doctrine should be applied in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The law of the case doctrine</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-5\">\u201cis a general principle of law * * * that when a ruling or decision has been once made in a particular case by an appellate court, while it may be overruled in other cases, it is binding and conclusive both upon the inferior court in any further steps or proceedings in the same litigation and upon the appellate court itself in any subsequent appeal or other proceeding for review.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-6\"><em>Boise Cascade Corp. v. Board of Forestry, </em>216 Or App 338, 351, 174 P3d 587 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 390 (2008).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The doctrine is \u201cessentially one of judicial economy and judicial discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Metz, </em>162 Or App 448, 454, 986 P2d 714 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>330 Or 331 (2000). And it applies to the portions of a prior appellate decision that were necessary \u201cto the disposition of the appeal\u201d and \u201cshould be invoked to preclude parties from revisiting issues that already have been fully considered by an appellate court in the same proceeding.\u201d <em>Hayes Oyster Co. v. Dulcich, </em>199 Or App 43, 53-54, 110 P3d 615, <em>rev den, </em>339 Or 544 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">This case has all the aspects that would normally lead to application of the law of the case doctrine. There is no dispute that the hearings officer interpreted the substantially exercised prong of DCC 22.36.020(A)(3), and that the appeal of that decision in <em>Gould VII </em>put that issue to LUBA for decision. Because the county had declined to review the hearings officer\u2019s decision, LUBA was not required to give the hearings officer\u2019s interpretation of the code provision any deference. <em>Gage, </em>319 Or at 317 (\u201c[T]he reasons for requiring deference to a local government\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>of its own ordinance do not apply when the interpretation is that of a hearings officer.\u201d). Accordingly, LUBA interpreted the code provision and remanded to the county for consideration of whether all 42 conditions of approval had been substantially exercised, including those that required the applicant to seek additional permits and approvals. Therefore, unless the law of the case doctrine does not apply, LUBA\u2014 the appellate body in the appeal from the hearings officer\u2019s decision\u2014made a ruling on the proper interpretation of the substantially exercised prong, and that ruling binds both the county\u2014the inferior body\u2014in any further proceedings in the same litigation and LUBA in any subsequent appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The only question, then, is whether ORS 197.829, which prescribes LUBA\u2019s review of a local government\u2019s interpretation of its land use regulations, precludes application of the doctrine in this case. We conclude that it does not. In reaching that conclusion, we are mindful that the law of the case doctrine is intended to promote judicial economy and that, in this case, application of the doctrine furthers the overriding principle of <em>Beck </em>that issues in land use cases must be brought to finality at the earliest possible opportunity. We recognize that, at least in theory, application of the law of the case doctrine in this case could defeat the principle that ORS 197.829 is based <em>on\u2014i.e., </em>\u201cwhen a governing body is responsible for enacting an ordinance, it may be assumed to have a better understanding than LUBA or the courts of its intended meaning.\u201d <em>Siporen, </em>349 Or at 258. However, we find it persuasive that the county had the opportunity to secure deference for its interpretation if it had, in the first instance, exercised its discretionary review of the hearings officer\u2019s interpretation of the substantially exercised prong and adopted or altered that interpretation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>the statutory scheme is set up so that the local government always has \u201cthe first bite at the apple\u201d if a hearings officer\u2019s decision involves the interpretation of a local government\u2019s land use regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In the end, we conclude that the purposes and practical realities of the law of the case doctrine counsel us to apply it in this case despite ORS 197.829. Accordingly, we affirm LUBA on the cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Reversed and remanded on petition; affirmed on cross-petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\"> Thornburgh Resort Company, LLC, initially submitted the CMP, but filed for bankruptcy in March 2011.
