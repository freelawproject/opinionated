J.</author>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">Defendant, who was convicted of first-degree burglary and possession of methamphetamine and sentenced to 36 months in prison, challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of $980 in court-appointed attorney fees. He argues that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay those attorney fees without making any determination\u2014and where the record is silent\u2014as to whether he \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay those costs of his defense. <em>See </em>ORS 151.505(3) (\u201cThe court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs.\u201d); ORS 161.665(4) (\u201cThe court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d). Defendant acknowledges that he did not preserve his claim of error but urges us to review and correct the error as an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1); <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (describing requirements for plain-error review under ORAP 5.45(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">In response, the state argues that the trial court \u201cdid not err, let alone plainly err, by imposing fees, because the record demonstrates that defendant had been employed two years prior to his arrest.\u201d According to the state, defendant \u201cis therefore employable and may be able to pay the relatively small amount of $980 at some point in the future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The state\u2019s argument notwithstanding, this case cannot be meaningfully distinguished from others in which we have concluded that the trial court plainly erred by imposing attorney fees in the absence of any evidence that a defendant \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay them. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>264 Or App 346, 349, 332 P3d 338 (2014) (explaining that, \u201calthough $400 may not be a substantial amount to pay for some defendants, it is for this defendant\u201d; \u201cwhile there is some speculative evidence that defendant might find work in the future, the actual evidence is to the contrary\u201d). The actual evidence in this case\u2014that defendant was \u201cworking on houses, cleaning them\u201d for a specific person \u201ca couple of years ago\u201d\u2014does not give rise to any reasonable inference about defendant\u2019s financial resources or employability at the time of sentencing or in the future. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number><em>See State v. Mejia-Espinoza, </em>267 Or App 682, 684, 341 P3d 180 (2014), <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 164 (2015) (\u201cAlthough the record contains some evidence that defendant worked in the past, as a field worker and as a firefighter, there is no evidence as to (1) defendant\u2019s historic earnings from such work and (2) whether, given the nature of defendant\u2019s criminal convictions and the length of his incarceration, such employment (including, especially, as a firefighter) will be plausibly available to defendant following his release.\u201d). Thus, we conclude, as we did in <em>Ramirez-Hernandez </em>and <em>Mejia-Espinoza, </em>that the trial court plainly erred in imposing attorney fees on a record that does not include any evidence that defendant \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay them.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The remaining question is whether we should exercise our discretion to correct the error. <em>See Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991) (setting out a nonexclusive list of factors for a court to consider when deciding whether to exercise discretion to correct plain error). The state contends that the imposition of fees, even if plainly erroneous, does not merit reversal for reasons of judicial economy\u2014including that, \u201cto the extent any error significantly harmed defendant, relief is available from the trial court.\u201d That is, the state contends that, \u201cif defendant is, in fact, unable to pay the $980, defendant may \u2018petition the court for remission of the payment of costs or any unpaid portion of the costs\u2019 pursuant to ORS 151.505 (4),\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>In several published decisions, we have expressly identified and rejected that same argument. <em>See, e.g., State v. Williams, </em>271 Or App 693, 694, 352 P3d 742 (2015) (exercising discretion to correct plain error in imposing attorney fees, over the state\u2019s objection that \u201cdefendant could seek relief from paying the fees if it imposes a \u2018manifest hardship,\u2019 ORS 161.665(5)\u201d); <em>Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>264 Or App at 349 (exercising discretion to correct plain error in imposing attorney fees, over \u201cthe state\u2019s suggestion that the error is not grave because defendant could petition the court to reduce or eliminate the fees if they ultimately create a substantial hardship\u201d); <em>State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 717, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (exercising discretion to correct the same plain error, notwithstanding \u201cthe state\u2019s suggestion that the error is not grave because defendant could petition the court to reduce or eliminate the $8,000 obligation if it ultimately imposed a substantial hardship on him\u201d). Moreover, the same consideration\u2014the defendant\u2019s ability to petition the trial court for relief from fees that impose a manifest hardship\u2014has been present (whether identified by the state or not) in every case like this in which the court has erroneously imposed attorney fees, and we have never found it to persuasively militate against the exercise of our discretion to correct the error before us. The state does not explain why this case is any different, let alone argue that our previous cases were wrongly decided. Accordingly, we exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error, for reasons similar to those expressed in <em>State v. Fleet, </em>270 Or App 246, 247, 347 P3d 345 (2015) (reversing as plain error the imposition of $980 in court-appointed attorney fees based on the amount of fees, the five-year prison term, and the lack of evidence in the record suggesting that defendant would be able to pay the fees).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-5\"> ORS 151.505(4) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cA person who has been required to pay costs under this section and who is not in contumacious default in the payment of the costs may at any time petition the court for remission of the payment of costs or any unpaid portion of the costs.
