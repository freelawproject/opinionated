Defendant was charged in a single, multiple-count indictment in 2011, after allegations came to light that he had repeatedly sodomized and sexually abused his daughter, W, for years when she was a minor. Those allegations were the basis for Counts 1 through 6. While investigating those allegations, police learned that a second relative, C, had previously accused defendant of sexually abusing her on one occasion in 1999, when she was a minor. That allegation was the basis for Count 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Defendant raises seven assignments of error. In three of those, he argues that the trial court should have granted his pretrial motions to, one, sever the charges related to each victim and, two, exclude the entirety of a tape-recorded phone conversation between W and defendant or, alternatively, specific statements made in that recording. In the remaining four assignments of error, defendant challenges various rulings by the court during trial regarding the prosecutor\u2019s attempts to elicit or exploit evidence that defendant was a methamphetamine addict at the time of the conduct charged in the indictment. In two of those assignments, defendant contends that the trial court erroneously denied his motion for a mistrial. For the reasons explained below, we agree with defendant that the trial court should have granted a mistrial, and we reverse and remand for a new trial. We also address defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s denial of his motion to sever, because that ruling will likely affect any retrial on remand. However, we do not reach defendant\u2019s other assignments of error to the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings before and during trial, because the evidentiary issues may be litigated differently on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">I. MOTION TO SEVER</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We begin by relating the allegations of W and of C, which are relevant to defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to sever the count alleging that defendant sexually abused C. W, the adult daughter of defendant, testified at trial that, beginning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>when she was five years old, defendant repeatedly and regularly sexually abused and sodomized her. When W was 10 years old, her parents separated, and defendant moved out of the house, although he continued to visit the home frequently and to sexually abuse W. The abuse ceased one night, when W was around 12 years old, after she told defendant to stop. W then avoided contact with defendant, speaking to him only once or twice over the next few years and then having no contact with him for the following six to seven years. During that time, W never told anybody about the abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In 2010, several of W\u2019s family members began encouraging her to reconnect with defendant. W agreed to attend defendant\u2019s birthday party and later saw defendant at another family function that year. Then, in 2011, when W was 22 years old, she revealed to her mother that defendant had sexually abused her when she was a child.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Upon learning of the alleged abuse, W\u2019s mother called the Marion County Sheriffs Office, which began investigating W\u2019s allegations. The investigation included a \u201cpretext\u201d phone call from W to defendant, which a deputy sheriff recorded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the call, W confronted defendant, asking him why he had touched her and whether he remembered doing so. She referred to \u201ceverything that happened, from the time I can remember until I was about 12.\u201d She also used the word \u201cmolested\u201d in place of \u201ctouched\u201d once during the call. For his part, defendant repeatedly admitted to past drug use and being a bad father generally, but many of his answers were nonresponsive to the questions, and defendant at various points remained silent in response to W\u2019s questions. During the 42-minute call, defendant neither denied nor explicitly admitted that he had sexually abused W.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The day after the pretext call, a sheriffs detective, Wilkinson, contacted and interviewed defendant. When confronted with W\u2019s allegations, defendant denied ever having sexually abused her.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>Approximately two weeks later, the police contacted and interviewed C. C is the daughter of W\u2019s maternal grandmother but is close in age to W. In the course of investigating W\u2019s allegations, the police had learned that C had accused defendant in 1999 of sexually abusing her one night that year. After defendant separated from W\u2019s mother, and while the alleged sexual abuse of W was still ongoing, defendant stayed for a period of time with C and her mother when C was about nine years old. According to C\u2019s account of the incident, C\u2019s mother sent C to bed early, and defendant accompanied C up to her bedroom. C asked defendant to stay with her until she fell asleep. C woke up the next morning in her bed next to defendant. Defendant then began touching her buttocks and vagina. After a few seconds, C kneed defendant and told him to stop. C then ran downstairs and told her mother, who immediately kicked defendant out of the house. Neither C nor her mother reported the incident to police. After that, C never saw defendant again, save for one night, briefly, several years after the alleged abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Defendant also denied sexually abusing C. According to defendant\u2019s testimony at trial, on the morning that C accused him of sexually abusing her, she had actually rolled over onto his arm, and he awoke with his arm pinned underneath her torso. He pulled his arm away and went back to sleep, only to be \u201cawakened a little bit later when [C\u2019s mother] is telling me to get the hell out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">As noted above, defendant was ultimately charged with five counts of sodomy in the first degree, ORS 163.045, and one count of sexual abuse in the first degree, ORS 163.427, based on W\u2019s allegations, as well as an additional count of sexual abuse in the first degree based on C\u2019s allegations. Just before trial, defendant filed a motion to sever the lone count stemming from C\u2019s allegations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>defendant\u2019s seventh assignment of error, he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever. Because the issue affects any retrial of defendant, we address the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Defendant argued to the trial court that severance was warranted under ORS 132.560(3), which provides that, \u201c [i] f it appears, upon motion, that the state or defendant is substantially prejudiced by a joinder of offenses * * *, the court may order an election or separate trials of counts,\u201d because he would be substantially prejudiced by joinder. Defendant first argued that he would be prejudiced because evidence regarding the separate victims would not be admissible in separate trials under OEC 404(3)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and OEC 403.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, defendant asserted, because the two victims were close in age at the time of the charged offenses and because of the prejudicial nature of child sexual abuse evidence, a jury hearing allegations from two victims would be highly likely to conclude that defendant had a propensity to commit sex crimes against minor females. Defendant also argued that the evidence regarding the victims was not \u201csufficiently simple and distinct to mitigate\u201d the potential dangers that would result from erroneous joinder. <em>State v. Norkeveck, </em>214 Or App 553, 560, 168 P3d 265 (2007), <em>rev den, </em>344 Or 558 (2008). Defendant argued, lastly, that a joint trial would severely curtail his \u201cfifth amendment privilege\u201d by forcing him to choose between testifying with regard to both victims or neither of them. Defendant stated that he wished to preserve his right to testify regarding C\u2019s allegations while preserving his right to remain silent regarding W\u2019s allegations. In defendant\u2019s view, an instruction directing the jury to ignore his silence as to one victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>while he addressed the allegations of the other would put him in \u201cthe awkward position\u201d of effectively having to comment on his own silence.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The state responded that the evidence as to both of the victims was sufficiently interrelated so as to require each victim\u2019s testimony at a trial for defendant\u2019s alleged conduct against the other victim. According to the state, the evidence would show that, while defendant was molesting W, he was grooming his second victim, C. The two victims later spoke with each other about the abuse, and W was eventually the one who first informed the police about defendant\u2019s alleged abuse of C. The state also contended that any harm to defendant resulting from defendant\u2019s having to elect whether to testify in a joined trial did not constitute substantial prejudice under ORS 132.560(3). The state pointed out that, if defendant could \u201ccraft his scope\u201d of testimony so that he was \u201ctalking about one victim and not the other,\u201d then the state would be \u201climited to that\u201d on cross-examination, which would be \u201ccurative of any * * * specialized prejudice that the Court may find.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to sever. The court agreed with the state that defendant could control the scope of his testimony, thereby limiting the scope of the state\u2019s questioning of defendant. On that note, the court instructed the prosecutor that, if defendant testified in direct examination as to one victim in a way that the state concluded enabled it to then cross-examine defendant regarding the other victim, the prosecutor was to consult the court before proceeding. The court also highlighted that the jury would hear the standard instruction about defendant\u2019s right to remain silent, and offered to modify that instruction, if requested by defendant, to clarify that defendant had an absolute right not to testify about the other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u201cWe review a trial court\u2019s determination that a defendant failed to demonstrate the existence of substantial prejudice for errors of law based on \u2018the record at the time of the court\u2019s ruling on defendant\u2019s motion to sever.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Gensler, </em>266 Or App 1, 8, 337 P3d 890 (2014), <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 690 (2015) (quoting <em>State v. Tidwell, </em>259 Or App 152, 156, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>313 P3d 345 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 142 (2014)). \u201cWhether the joinder of charges substantially prejudiced a particular defendant involves a case-specific assessment of the charges and the facts alleged to support them.\u201d <em>Tidwell, </em>259 Or App at 154. \u201cThe reviewing court must be able to determine from the record that the trial court engaged in the required prejudice analysis.\u201d <em>State v. Luers, </em>211 Or App 34, 44, 153 P3d 688, <em>adh'd to as modified on recons, </em>213 Or App 389, 160 P3d 1013 (2007). Applying those standards, we conclude that the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Our decision in <em>Gensler </em>is dispositive. Like defendant here, the defendant in <em>Gensler </em>was convicted, in a single trial, of multiple counts of sodomy and sexual abuse for acts committed against one minor victim over a span of several years and separate acts committed against a second minor victim during a more limited time span. 266 Or App at 3. The trial court in <em>Gensler </em>denied the defendant\u2019s motion to sever, reasoning that, <em>inter alia, </em>the \u201cdefendant had not demonstrated substantial prejudice because the cases are separate enough that the jury could make a determination very easily on one case, and on the other case and not be confused by the conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6 (internal quotation marks omitted). As we noted, the trial court \u201calso explained that it could fashion limitations on cross-examination so that defendant could testify in the case pertaining to [victim 1] without having to testify in the case pertaining to [victim 2] and suggested that defendant could request instructions to guide the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We affirmed, concluding that, \u201ceven if we assume that the evidence in each case was not mutually admissible in the other, the evidence in the cases was sufficiently simple and distinct to mitigate the dangers created by joinder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9 (internal quotation marks omitted). In particular, we noted that the charges \u201carose from different incidents that occurred at different times and places and involved different victims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also concluded that any potential prejudice \u201ccould be mitigated through jury instructions and by limiting the state\u2019s cross-examination of defendant if he chose to testify in the case pertaining to [victim 1] but not the case pertaining to [victim 2].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, for the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>reasons, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">II. MOTION FOR MISTRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s fifth and sixth assignments of error, in which he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for mistrial, made after closing arguments on the basis that the prosecutor had improperly exploited evidence of defendant\u2019s past drug use throughout the course of the trial through comments during rebuttal argument to the jury. We begin by relating the remainder of the relevant facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The state called W as its first witness. Over defendant\u2019s objection based on OEC 404(3) and OEC 403, the court permitted the prosecutor to elicit general testimony from W that defendant had physically abused W \u2014 that he went \u201cbeyond normal discipline\u201d \u2014 to establish that W had been afraid of defendant and to help to explain why W delayed reporting that defendant had sexually abused her. Although the prosecutor had told the jury in opening statement that the state would prove that defendant had been physically abusive to everyone in the household, W did not testify that defendant had beaten W\u2019s mother and neither did W\u2019s mother say so, when she later testified for the state. W also explained that she had heard from relatives that defendant was sober, which she considered when deciding whether to see him again. During redirect testimony, the state asked W, \u201cBy this point in your life, had you become aware \u2014 when we\u2019re talking, like, 19-, 20-, 21-year-old \u2014 that your dad had had a drug problem when he lived with you?\u201d Defendant objected and requested a sidebar conference, following which the state withdrew the question. W finished testifying shortly thereafter, and the jury was excused for the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>The court then asked the state whether and to what extent it intended to elicit any additional testimony regarding defendant\u2019s alleged drug use. The state responded that it would continue to put on such evidence, arguing that it was relevant. The state indicated that it intended to ask W\u2019s mother about defendant\u2019s \u201cregular and persistent drug use\u201d and, more specifically, whether she was aware that he was using drugs while she was in a relationship with him and what drugs he had used. The state explained that that testimony was pertinent to defendant\u2019s statements in the recorded pretext call, in response to W\u2019s allegations, that he was \u201con drugs.\u201d The state also argued that the evidence \u201cimpeaches both the Defendant\u2019s memory and also helps explain some of the motive, some of the reason for why the Defendant did what he did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Defendant then renewed his objection on relevance grounds and for the second time moved for a mistrial, this time \u201con the question that was already asked in the presence of the jury\u201d \u2014 defendant\u2019s \u201cdrug problem\u201d when he lived with W \u2014 explaining, \u201cI don\u2019t think a jury instruction can cure that problem.\u201d Defense counsel added, \u201cI think that the State has mistakenly fallen into this hole of believing that now it\u2019s just a free-for-all and we can just talk about the Defendant\u2019s character all day long and say what a bad guy he is on so many different levels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The state then added that the court had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\u201calready ruled that it\u2019s coming in, the pretext phone call, and the jurors are going to hear the Defendant himself say that he was on drugs during this time, and to say that it\u2019s any more prejudicial that other people confirm and essentially say that this Defendant was telling the truth or is truthful when he says that is not prejudicial at all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The state also asserted that it was \u201cnot trying to show he used drugs because he\u2019s a drug user and he\u2019s a bad person; we\u2019re showing that he used drugs, and that affects somebody\u2019s ability to remember when they\u2019re recalling events that happened ten \u2014 more than ten years ago.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">The court ruled that, notwithstanding its earlier allowance of some reference to defendant\u2019s past drug use, <em>i.e., </em>as acknowledged by defendant in the pretext call and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>as relevant to W\u2019s decision to renew contact with defendant, any subsequent attempt by the state to elicit further evidence on that point was not relevant and would be unfairly prejudicial. The court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-4\">\u201cI certainly would not permit Counsel to argue to a jury that because \u2014 if they were to believe that the Defendant was on drugs, therefore they should draw the inference that he was more likely to molest children because of lowered inhibitions. That would be completely inappropriate. And I don\u2019t see any other purpose that the State is offering it for but to paint the Defendant in a bad light in front of this jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The court did not grant defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Despite the court\u2019s cautionary statement to counsel, other evidence of defendant\u2019s past drug use was elicited on the second day of trial. The state called W\u2019s mother as a witness, and, on cross-examination by defendant, W\u2019s mother denied using drugs with defendant. On redirect, the state capitalized on that questioning and elicited further testimony of defendant\u2019s drug use, to which defendant did not object:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] Was the Defendant using drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-8\">\u201c[W\u2019S MOTHER:] Yes, there was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-9\">\u201cQ. What drugs was he using?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-10\">\u201cA. Methamphetamine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-11\">\u201cQ. Anything else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-12\">\u201cA. Marijuana, alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-13\">\u201cQ. Was that regular and\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-14\">\u201cA. Yes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-15\">\u201cQ. \u2014frequent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-16\">\u201cA. \u2014it was very regular.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-17\">\u201cQ. What does very regular mean to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-18\">\u201cA. The methamphetamine was, I believe, a daily use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-19\">\u201cQ. And did that cause changes in his mood, changes in his behavior?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, it did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-4\">\u201cQ. Now, here\u2019s a tough question for you ***. If you knew that your boyfriend was using methamphetamine for a really long time every day, why would you let him watch your kids?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\u201cA. He was their father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">The state also called Helbling, the deputy who had conducted and recorded the pretext phone call between W and defendant. Over defendant\u2019s renewed objection to admission of the recording, the state introduced and the court admitted it as an exhibit. The state then played the recording for the jury in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">The state then called Wilkinson, the detective who had interviewed defendant the day after W\u2019s mother alerted the police to W\u2019s allegations. The state asked Wilkinson, \u201cDid he talk about using drugs?\u201d Defendant did not object. Wilkinson responded that defendant had told him that, \u201cin the past when he was younger that he had a drug issue and that he didn\u2019t make good decisions back then to have a close family life with them because of this drug use, faulting his parenting because of the \u2014 the drug use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Subsequently, outside the presence of the jury, defendant reiterated his objection to the admission of the recording, which, again, contained his admission of drug use: \u201cBut just for the purpose of the record now that the Court has time to have heard the recording, I\u2019d move for the motion <em>in limine </em>on the same grounds as asserted before, ask to have that excluded and stricken from the record.\u201d The court adhered to its earlier ruling and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">Defendant later took the stand to testify regarding C\u2019s allegations. During cross-examination, the state began questioning defendant regarding his drug and alcohol use at the time of the incident. Defendant testified that he had \u201cused drugs pretty frequently,\u201d including methamphetamine and marijuana, but not usually alcohol. The state asked defendant whether he was sober on the night that he allegedly abused C, and defendant responded that he was. But defendant objected on the basis of relevance when the state asked, \u201cDo you think the years of drug use * * * have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>affected your ability to remember this event?\u201d The court overruled the objection, and the state restated its question: \u201cYou don\u2019t think all the drugs you used or alcohol you used have affected your ability to remember or perceive any of the events that * * * you\u2019ve testified to?\u201d Defendant responded, \u201cCorrect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Following defendant\u2019s testimony, the parties offered their closing arguments. In defendant\u2019s closing argument, defense counsel attempted to defuse, as he characterized it, the prosecution\u2019s \u201ccharacter case.\u201d In part, he explained to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">\u201cI had objected, because I did not want to make this trial about [defendant\u2019s] character, to the introduction of evidence of his drug use, but you heard it. And you heard it referred to in the phone call; you heard it referred to on the stand by several different witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">He argued that there was reasonable doubt and that, although the state had painted defendant as \u201ca real jerk,\u201d whether defendant was a jerk was not an issue for the jury to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">During the state\u2019s rebuttal, defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR:] And for Counsel to say, Yeah, my guy is a drug dealer; yeah, my guy is a wife beater; yeah, my guy is just a bad guy and he\u2019s a jerk, but you should believe he wouldn\u2019t sexually abuse his daughter,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t really make sense. He\u2019s kind of the exact guy you would expect to abuse his daughter. Exactly the guy you would expect to be\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: Sustained. The jury will disregard that last statement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">The prosecutor then went on to reference defendant\u2019s drug use again when he argued that defendant had exploited opportunities he had found because the victims\u2019 mothers were not engaged in protective parenting. He argued with respect to W\u2019s case that it was not good parenting to leave a child \u201cevery night with somebody who uses methamphetamine\u201d and, with respect to C\u2019s case, that \u201cto allow a man who\u2019s a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>known drug user to stay in your house with your daughter and constantly let your daughter go with that person *** does not suggest the sort of protective parenting that\u2019s going to keep kids safe.\u201d The prosecutor concluded on that topic, \u201cIt\u2019s really more proof that this actually happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">After the court instructed the jury and the jury left the courtroom for deliberation, defendant moved for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s comment in rebuttal to which defendant had objected. Defendant argued that the prosecutor\u2019s comment indicated that \u201call the character evidence that was previously represented by the State not to be character evidence brought it full-circle and crystallized all those things, and now it\u2019s clearly propensity evidence.\u201d Defendant did not argue that the prosecutor had referred to matters not in evidence, that is, that there was no evidence that defendant was a drug dealer or a wife beater. The prosecutor responded that the court\u2019s ruling sustaining defendant\u2019s objection was curative. The prosecutor also argued that defendant, through his own closing argument, \u201cmade my argument for me to the jury, so I don\u2019t see how it would be causing any prejudice whatsoever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The court concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was \u201ccompletely inappropriate.\u201d Addressing the prosecutor, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">\u201cYou told this jury that they were entitled to and could infer from the fact that Defendant used drugs or engaged in other conduct that he was a child molester. And you know as well as all of us know that the rules of evidence specifically prohibit that. And I can only think that you got carried away in some kind of enthusiasm where you lost all of your training and experience.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">\u201cI am not inclined to grant a mistrial based on that comment. An objection was immediately sustained. The jury was immediately instructed to disregard it. I believe the jury has gotten appropriate instructions about what evidence they can and cannot rely on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">Although the court denied the motion for a mistrial, the court offered to provide the jury with an additional, written curative instruction, to which the parties agreed. That instruction read, \u201cYou may not use evidence of character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>traits of the Defendant unrelated to the crimes charged to infer the guilt of the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">On appeal, defendant contends that the court should have instead granted his motion for a mistrial based on the prosecutor\u2019s comment in closing that, as a \u201cdrug dealer\u201d and a \u201cwife beater,\u201d defendant was \u201ckind of the exact guy you would expect to abuse his daughter.\u201d Defendant contends that the prosecutor improperly argued that defendant\u2019s methamphetamine use made him the kind of person who would sexually abuse children and improperly inserted inflammatory facts not in evidence, both of which made it apparent that the curative instruction was insufficient to cure the prejudice to defendant\u2019s ability to obtain a fair adjudication of the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The state initially responds that we should not consider that contention because defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was untimely. Specifically, the state argues that, because defendant did not move for a mistrial until after the prosecutor had completed closing argument and the court had instructed the jury, the motion was untimely and, thus, unpreserved, citing <em>State v. Larson, </em>325 Or 15, 933 P2d 958 (1997); <em>State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 809 P2d 81 (1991); and <em>State v. Hilton, </em>187 Or App 666, 676, 69 P3d 779 (2003), <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 377 (2004). Defendant contends that his motion for a mistrial was timely and sufficiently preserved, noting that the trial court had ruled on it and decided to give a final cautionary jury instruction as a result of the motion; that the court and the state were \u201cabundantly aware\u201d of defendant\u2019s objections, with the legal issues concerning unfair propensity evidence having been argued earlier during trial; that the court had sustained previous defense objections to evidence of defendant\u2019s drug use; and that defendant had already, albeit unsuccessfully, moved for a mistrial on \u201cthe same essential issues.\u201d We conclude that defendant sufficiently preserved his contention for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">\u201cTo preserve error, a motion for mistrial must be timely.\u201d <em>Hilton, </em>187 Or App at 676. \u201cThe time to move for a mistrial is when the allegedly prejudicial act occurs, not after the incident has been allowed to pass by, for then it is too late for the trial judge to caution the jury and mend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>harm.\u201d <em>State v. Shafer, </em>222 Or 230, 235, 351 P2d 941 (1960); <em>see also Walton, </em>311 Or at 248 (stating that a motion for a mistrial \u201cis timely if it is made when the allegedly objectionable statements were made\u201d). As we have explained, the court\u2019s iteration in <em>Shafer </em>of the timeliness rule clarifies that \u201c[t]he purpose behind requiring an immediate mistrial motion is to allow the court to take prompt curative action if the court believes it is warranted.\u201d <em>State v. Veatch, </em>223 Or App 444, 453, 196 P3d 45 (2008) (citing <em>Shafer, </em>222 Or at 235). We have thus held that a defendant\u2019s motion was timely, even if not instantaneously made, when made under such circumstances that \u201cthe underlying purpose of that preservation requirement is fulfilled.\u201d <em>Veatch, </em>223 Or App at 453-54; <em>see also Larson, </em>325 Or at 21-22 (concluding that the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, based on an improper comment by the prosecutor, was timely even though it was not made immediately following that comment, given no \u201csignificant lapse of time, no additional testimony, no recess, and no discussion of another issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">We conclude that, as in <em>Veatch, </em>the underlying purposes of the preservation requirement were fulfilled. In <em>Veatch, </em>the defendant appealed his conviction for driving under the influence of intoxicants, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for a mistrial made after the arresting officer testified that the defendant had asked to speak with his attorney before deciding whether to submit to a breath test. 223 Or App at 446. The defendant\u2019s call was unsuccessful, as was his earlier phone call to his attorney, immediately after being arrested. The trial court had ruled pretrial that \u201cthere could be no mention of telephone calls unless the defense opened the door to such evidence and that, even then, \u2018[w]e don\u2019t need to know who it was to * * <em>Id. </em>at 448 (brackets and ellipses in <em>Veatch).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The defendant in <em>Veatch </em>first moved for a mistrial after the prosecutor, in opening argument, told the jury of the first attempted call. The court denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>Later, on the state\u2019s direct examination, the arresting officer, Berry, testified that \u201c[the defendant] wanted to call his lawyer before\u201d deciding whether to submit to the breath test. <em>Id. </em>at 448. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201c\u2018[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection. I have a matter for the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\u201c\u2018THE COURT: Sustained. And if I hear that word again\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201c\u2018[PROSECUTOR]: Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\u201c \u2018THE COURT: \u2014you\u2019re going to start all over again.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 448-49. Following that exchange, Berry completed testifying, the state rested its case, and the jury was excused for lunch. The defendant then moved for a mistrial based on Berry\u2019s reference to the defendant\u2019s attempt to call his attorney. The court denied the motion. <em>Id. </em>at 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">On appeal, the state argued that the claim of error regarding the motion was unpreserved because the motion was not made immediately following Berry\u2019s objectionable comment. <em>Id. </em>at 452. We disagreed. We noted that the trial court, in response to the defendant\u2019s objection,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">\u201ctook the actions that it believed to be appropriate in response to the offending testimony: It warned the prosecutor of the possibility of a mistrial and gave the jury a curative instruction. Had defense counsel expressly moved for a mistrial at the outset, rather than signaling his intent by merely saying, T have a matter for the court,\u2019 there is no reason to believe that the court\u2019s response would have been any different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 453. We then reasoned that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">\u201c[u]nder the circumstances of this case, *** [w]here it is clear that the trial court understands that the defendant intends to seek a mistrial, and it responds by giving a curative instruction, the need for an <em>immediate </em>mistrial motion is obviated. Again, the point of requiring that the motion be made immediately is to allow the court to take prompt curative action * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 453-54 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-13\">Here, by the time that defendant objected to the prosecutor\u2019s comment in rebuttal argument that, as a \u201cdrug dealer\u201d and a \u201cwife beater,\u201d defendant was \u201ckind of the exact guy you would expect to abuse his daughter,\u201d both the state and the trial court were well aware that defendant viewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>that comment as part of a series of similar references by the state to other bad acts, such as his past drug use, which the state adduced for the impermissible purpose of indirectly proving defendant\u2019s propensity for sexual abuse. Not only had defendant addressed the issue in closing, he also had attempted to preempt such arguments at trial through his motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude all or portions of the recorded pretext call, in which he contended that his statements that he was a bad father and a drug user were introduced to prove that he had a generally bad character that made it more likely that he had sexually abused W and C.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">Moreover, on the first day of trial, the trial court had warned the prosecutor about eliciting evidence of defendant\u2019s drug use and presenting improper arguments based on it. The trial court told the prosecutor that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">\u201cto just have the victim\u2019s mother and the Defendant\u2019s ex-partner get up and say he was, you know, a no-good meth-using bum, I think is way more prejudicial than probative, and I\u2019m not going to allow it. And if I were to allow it and you were to get a conviction, I would just about guarantee that we\u2019d be back trying this case over again * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">As noted above, the court also told the prosecutor that it \u201ccertainly would not permit Counsel to argue to a jury that because \u2014 if they were to believe that the Defendant was on drugs, therefore they should draw the inference that he was more likely to molest children because of lowered inhibitions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">Yet, as in <em>Veatch, </em>the prosecutor in this case invited the jury to conclude that, because defendant was a \u201cdrug dealer\u201d \u2014 presumably, the prosecutor meant to say \u201cdrug user\u201d \u2014 and \u201cwife beater,\u201d he was the kind of man who would molest his daughter \u2014 precisely the kind of comment that the trial court had earlier forbidden and about which it had warned the state. And, as in <em>Veatch, </em>defendant immediately objected to the improper comment, and the trial court issued a terse curative instruction. Defendant then moved for mistrial for a third time, after the state had completed its closing argument and the jury had left the courtroom after being instructed. The trial court both ruled on the motion and determined that it would give the jury a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>curative instruction. Given defendant\u2019s earlier objections, his first motion for a mistrial because of the state\u2019s injection of prior misconduct, namely physical abuse of W, into the trial, his second motion for a mistrial directed to the state\u2019s repeated reference to defendant\u2019s drug use and potential employment of that fact as character evidence, and the trial court\u2019s responses to them, it was not unreasonable for defendant to make his motion at that point. Both the court and the state were acutely aware of defendant\u2019s concern that the state had painted defendant as a methamphetamine addict who would sexually abuse children. We note that the state did not object at trial to defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">We also conclude that the timing of defendant\u2019s motion comported with the principles pertaining to preservation requirements more generally. <em>See State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (summarizing the purpose of requiring preservation of an issue for appeal). Defendant\u2019s position was clear, and the state had ample opportunity to respond to that position. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 356, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (reasons for rule are to allow adversary to present its position and to permit trial court to understand and correct any error); <em>see also Shields v. </em>Campbell, 277 Or 71, 77-78, 559 P2d 1275 (1977) (\u201cThe reason for such a rule is not merely to promote form over substance but to promote an efficient administration of justice and the saving of judicial time.\u201d). Nor is there any evidence, and the state does not argue on appeal, that defendant made a strategic choice in moving for a mistrial when he did. <em>See Denham et ux. v. Cuddeback, </em>210 Or 485, 493, 311 P2d 1014 (1957) (stating that a related purpose of the requirement to object during trial to any matter regarded as prejudicial is to prevent litigants from speculating on a verdict and then seeking a new trial if the verdict is against them); <em>cf. State v. Barone, </em>329 Or 210, 241-42, 986 P2d 5 (1999), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1086 (2000) (holding that the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, on the ground that the prosecutor had belittled defense counsel in rebuttal argument, was untimely and not preserved when it was made during the court\u2019s recess for jury deliberation, when or just before the jury had returned its verdict); <em>State v. Wilson, </em>121 Or App 460, 469-71, 855 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>P2d 657, <em>rev den, </em>310 Or 61 (1993) (affirming the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial on the basis of the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion during rebuttal argument that the state had evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior bad acts, when the defendant made the motion after the jury had returned its verdict). In short, we conclude here, as we did in <em>Veatch, </em>that, under the circumstances, the underlying purpose of the preservation requirement was satisfied and that defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial was sufficiently immediate.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Because defendant\u2019s motion was timely and preserved, we turn now to its merits. We review the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>Larson, </em>325 Or at 22; <em>State v. Middleton, </em>256 Or App 173, 178, 300 P3d 228, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 62 (2013). A trial court abuses its discretion in denying a motion for a mistrial if the effect is to deny the defendant a fair trial. <em>Middleton, </em>256 Or App at 178. \u201cGenerally, a proper jury instruction is sufficient to protect the defendant against any prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.; accord State v. Osorno, </em>264 Or App 742, 749-50, 333 P3d 1163 (2014). That being said, some statements are so prejudicial that, as a practical matter, an instruction cannot remedy the prejudice. <em>Middleton, </em>256 Or App at 178 (citing <em>State v. Jones, </em>279 Or 55, 62, 566 P2d 867 (1977)). Furthermore, if it is likely that the jury drew an adverse inference, we cannot assume that the jury was able to follow an insufficient curative instruction, <em>e.g., </em>one that \u201cmerely told it to disregard the improper statement.\u201d <em>Veatch, </em>223 Or App at 458 (citing <em>State v. White, </em>303 Or 333, 342-44, 736 P2d 552 (1987)). \u201cTherefore, the questions to be addressed here are the nature of the prejudice, if any, caused by the statements and whether the trial court\u2019s instructions were sufficient to cure it.\u201d <em>Middleton, </em>256 Or App at 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">We first conclude that the prosecutor gave a closing argument that was likely to have an unfairly prejudicial effect on defendant. The prosecutor in rebuttal closing made the kind of comment specifically forbidden by the trial court in this case earlier in the proceedings. The prosecutor invited the jury in rebuttal to find defendant guilty of sexual abuse because of his character as a \u201cdrug dealer,\u201d or drug user, and \u201cwife beater.\u201d And, as defendant argued, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>comment indicated that \u201call the character evidence that was previously represented by the State not to be character evidence brought it full-circle and crystallized all those things, and now it\u2019s clearly propensity evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">Additionally, in his objectionable statement in rebuttal, the prosecutor relied on inflammatory facts not in evidence. As defendant points out, there was no evidence that defendant was a drug dealer or that he had beaten W\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Then, following the trial court\u2019s <em>second </em>express censure of the state\u2019s attempt to elicit and exploit improper propensity evidence, when the court sustained defendant\u2019s objection and told the jury to disregard the comment that defendant, as a \u201cdrug dealer\u201d and \u201cwife beater,\u201d was \u201cthe exact guy you would expect to abuse his daughter,\u201d the prosecutor twice more referred to defendant\u2019s drug use and suggested that it was evidence of his predilection for sexually abusing minor children. Specifically, the prosecutor argued that it was bad parenting by W\u2019s and C\u2019s mothers to have let their girls have contact with \u201csomebody who uses methamphetamine\u201d and who is \u201ca known drug user\u201d and that \u201c[i]t\u2019s really more proof that this actually happened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion, the trial court concluded that, in making the improper comment in closing, the prosecutor \u201cgot carried away in some kind of enthusiasm where you lost all of your training and experience.\u201d Although the trial court apparently concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was not willful, the argument remains improper. <em>See Osorno, </em>264 Or App at 751-52 (observing that the trial court\u2019s view that the prosecutor inadvertently alluded to the defendant\u2019s desire not to say anything incriminating was not relevant to whether the conduct affected the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Despite the trial court\u2019s admonition, the prosecutor repeatedly referred to defendant\u2019s past drug use throughout the trial and then, in rebuttal argument, both implicitly and expressly urged jurors to infer defendant\u2019s guilt as a result. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were \u201cnot subtle, isolated, or fleeting.\u201d <em>State v. Reineke, </em>266 Or App 299, 311, 337 P3d 941 (2014) (concluding that repeated improper references by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>prosecutor in closing argument made it \u201chighly likely that the jury drew an adverse inference\u201d that defendant was guilty); <em>see also Jones, </em>279 Or at 63 (concluding that, \u201c[i]n a prosecution for rape, in which * * * the jury must decide between the credibility of the prosecuting witness and the defendant,\u201d where the prosecutor \u201cpersisted in making comments and insinuations\u201d about the defendant\u2019s past uncharged alleged misconduct, including a \u201cclearly improper attempt to get before the jury\u201d such evidence, \u201cthe prejudice resulting from the admission of such evidence was so pervasive as to lead us to the conclusion that, as a result, defendant was denied a fair trial\u201d); <em>State v. Woodall, </em>259 Or App 67, 74, 313 P3d 298 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 735 (2014) (\u201cAlthough defendant correctly assigns error separately to each of the denials of his motions for mistrial, * * * we treat the assignments as a single, cumulative argument, because together they raise a single question: Did the repeated references to defendant\u2019s status as a sex offender deprive him of a fair trial?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The dispositive question is, therefore, \u201cwhether the purportedly curative instruction was sufficient to unring the bell.\u201d <em>Osorno, </em>264 Or App at 750. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s two curative instructions in the wake of the prosecutor\u2019s impermissible comment in rebuttal argument here were insufficient. As noted, immediately after the trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, the trial court told the jury simply to \u201cdisregard that last statement.\u201d The Supreme Court has rejected that type of instruction as insufficient. <em>See, e.g., White, </em>303 Or at 343-44 (reversing and remanding for new trial where the purportedly curative instruction \u201cdid no more than tell the jury that defendant\u2019s refusal to testify * * * was irrelevant\u201d); <em>Jones, </em>279 Or at 62-63 (reversing and remanding for new trial where trial court sustained defendant\u2019s objection to improper comment and instructed the jury to \u201cdisregard the statement made by the last witness\u201d and to \u201cerase it from your mind and pay no attention to it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Then, following discussion of defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, the court further instructed the jury that it could not use \u201cevidence of character traits of the Defendant unrelated to the crimes charged to infer the guilt of the Defendant.\u201d Although that additional instruction referred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>to \u201ccharacter traits\u201d that were \u201cunrelated\u201d to the charged crimes, those traits were not identified. As a result, the jury was permitted to conclude that some, or maybe all, of the character traits that the state considered to be relevant to the charged crimes \u2014 including defendant\u2019s status as a methamphetamine abuser \u2014 were, in fact, related and appropriate for consideration. The additional instruction, therefore, did not negate the inference that the state asked the jury to draw and was insufficient to cure the prejudice to defendant. <em>See Veatch, </em>223 Or App at 460-61 (holding that the trial court\u2019s instruction that \u201ca person has a right to call their lawyer and you\u2019re not supposed to make any inferences from that, since they have a right to do it\u201d did not \u201cunring the bell,\u201d that is, did \u201cnot negate the inference\u201d that a person arrested for driving under the influence would not ask for an attorney unless concerned about failing a breath test).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In short, because the state\u2019s rebuttal argument was prejudicial to the defense and the trial court\u2019s instruction was insufficient to cure that prejudice, the trial court abused its discretion in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> Before trial, defendant moved to exclude the recording entirely or to exclude his own statements in the call that he was a bad father and a drug user, because the statements were relevant only for the impermissible purpose of proving that he had a generally bad character that made it more likely that he had sexually abused W and C. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b414-6\"> The indictment alleged that each count involved an act of the same or similar character as the other counts. <em>See </em>ORS 132.560(1)(b)(A) (providing that two or more offenses alleged to have been committed by the same person may be charged in the same charging instrument in a separate count for each offense if the offenses charged are of the same or similar character). Defendant has not argued that joinder was improper, only that the charges should have been severed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> OEC 404(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.
