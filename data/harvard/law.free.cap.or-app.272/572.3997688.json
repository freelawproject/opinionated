J.</author>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Plaintiff filed an action in the circuit court under ORS 246.910 to obtain review of a decision by the Multnomah County elections officer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The decision rejected plaintiffs prospective petition to refer parts of a county transient lodging tax ordinance to the voters. The reviewing court granted summary judgment to the elections officer, Scott, and the county. The court concluded that the refusal to accept the prospective petition was lawful because the voters\u2019 authority to refer county enactments under the Oregon Constitution, state statutes, and local ordinances only extends to legislation, and the matter sought to be referred was administrative, and not legislative, in character. On appeal, plaintiff contends that the reviewing court\u2019s decision was incorrect as a matter of law because, if the matter is administrative in character, the county elections code allows referral of administrative ordinances, and, in any event, the matter sought to be referred was legislative in character, and appropriate to refer to the ballot under the Oregon Constitution. As explained below, we conclude that the reviewing court\u2019s decision was correct and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Pursuant to Article VI, section 10, of the Oregon Constitution, county voters have the power to \u201cadopt, amend, revise or repeal a county charter.\u201d In addition, \u201c[t]he initiative and referendum powers reserved to the people by this Constitution hereby are further reserved to the legal voters of every county relative to the adoption, amendment, revision or repeal of a county charter and to legislation passed by counties which have adopted such a charter[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Multnomah County v. Mittleman, </em>275 Or 545, 551, 552 P2d 242 (1976), Article VI, section 10, \u201creserve [s] to county voters with respect to county tax legislation the same \u2018referendum powers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>previously reserved to state voters with respect to state tax legislation [.]\u201d Those include the referendum powers set forth in Article IV, section l(3)(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and section 1(5),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the <em>Oregon </em>Constitution, and the implicit referendum authority for an act \u201cregulating taxation or exemption\u201d in Article IX, section la, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">In this case, plaintiff sought to refer portions of an ordinance amending county code provisions that regulated transient lodging taxes. The question presented in this case is whether the measure that plaintiff sought to refer qualifies as a \u201cpart thereof\u2019 of \u201clegislation\u201d that can be referred under the express and incorporated terms of Article VI, section 10, and the applicable statutes, charter provisions, and ordinances implementing that referendum authority. To address that question, we turn next to the specifics of the proposed referendum, the legal conclusions of the reviewing court, and the contentions of the parties on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The ordinance provisions plaintiff sought to refer are the culmination of a series of contracts and policy enactments by the county relating to the mutual imposition, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>collection, and distribution of transient lodging taxes with the City of Portland (city). In 2001, the county, the city, and Metro<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> entered into a visitor facilities intergovernmental agreement that obligated the parties to collect and distribute public revenues (including transient lodging taxes and vehicle rental fees) to subsidize improvements to and operation of particular regional tourist facilities (including the Oregon Convention Center, the Portland Center for Performing Arts, and the stadium now known as Providence Park) and the visitor and hospitality industry.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The county board then adopted Ordinance No. 957, finding that the ordinance was \u201cnecessary to conform the code to the Visitor Facilities Intergovernmental Agreement with the City of Portland and Metro.\u201d The ordinance continued a transient occupancy tax of 11.5 percent of the rent charged by hotels, dedicating portions of the tax proceeds to the county general fund and various special funds, including an excise tax fund to be used for subsidizing particular regional tourist facilities, all as provided in the intergovernmental agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Through the years, the governmental funding priorities and debt obligations for tourism-related facilities and programs changed. In 2013, the parties entered into an Amended and Restated Visitor Facilities Intergovernmental Agreement (VFIGA) under the authority of ORS 190.010. The VFIGA revised and updated different tourism-related projects and recast the priorities and obligations of the parties. It obligated the city to impose and dedicate a portion of its transient lodging taxes, and the county to likewise dedicate parts of its transient lodging taxes and vehicle rental fees, to various dedicated funds (including the Visitor Facilities Trust Account (VFTA) and the Excise Tax Fund) for particular tourism-related expenditures. One of the agreed-upon expenditures from the VFTA was to pay for Metro\u2019s financing costs for bonds for a part of the costs to construct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>a privately-owned hotel adjacent to the Oregon Convention Center (OCC) \u201cto bring additional national convention business to the OCC.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The VFIGA provides that the convention center hotel bond debt service is the fourth of thirteen spending priorities for the VFTA. Other spending priorities were also changed from the earlier agreement. The county committed to deposit tax collections into the VFTA, and specifically agreed to make payments from the VFTA to Metro for the hotel project bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">In particular, the county agreed that, \u201c[w]ithin ninety (90) days of execution of this Agreement, the County will adopt an ordinance amending Multnomah County Code Chapter 11 consistent with this Agreement.\u201d In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-5\">\u201c[t]he County pledges [various transient lodging tax proceeds] to pay the OCC Hotel Project Bonds. The pledge is valid and binding from the date Metro signs an OCC Hotel Project Development Agreement, and will remain in effect until the OCC Hotel Project Bonds are fully paid. The [various transient lodging tax proceeds] pledged are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge, and * * * that lien is, and will remain, superior to other claims and liens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">The county agreed to maintain the transient lodging tax funds \u201cin effect until all OCC Hotel Project Bonds have been paid or the County has transferred sufficient funds to Metro to defease the OCC Hotel Project Bonds.\u201d Finally, the VFIGA required that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">\u201c[s]o long as the OCC Hotel Project Bonds are outstanding, and this Agreement is in effect, the obligations of the County to (i) collect the taxes imposed by Multnomah County Code 11.410(E), and (ii) maintain the TLT Net Revenues and transfer them to Metro to pay the OCC Hotel Project Bonds, as provided in this Agreement, may not be terminated for any reason, including a breach by any Party of its obligations under this Agreement or any amendment to this Agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">On September 19, 2013, the county board of commissioners adopted Resolution No. 2013-130, approving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>VFIGA, and further resolving that the board would amend Multnomah County Code (MCC) chapter 11 \u201cas necessary to effect the County\u2019s obligations as set forth in the\u201d VFIGA.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Accordingly, the county adopted Ordinance No. 1206 on December 19, 2013. The ordinance amended various parts of MCC chapter 11, related to revenue and taxation, to be consistent with the county\u2019s obligations under the VFIGA. Among other things, the ordinance extended the time that the vehicle rental fee surcharge remained in effect, allocated a three percent transient lodging tax surcharge to the Excise Tax Fund for particular spending priorities, allocated a two and one-half percent transient lodging tax surcharge to different types and priorities of expenditures, including debt service on the convention center hotel bonds, and extended its time in effect, allocated specific transient lodging city and county taxes generated from occupancies at the convention center hotel to the VFTA, added new exemptions from the transient lodging tax, and specified violations of the code for which fines might be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">On December 20, 2013, plaintiff filed a prospective petition with the county to refer to the voters three provisions in Ordinance No. 1206, each of which addressed the use of the VFTA to pay for debt service on Metro\u2019s convention center hotel bonds. The first provision sought to be referred amended MCC section 11.401(E) to state that the county two and one-half percent transient lodging tax surcharge dedicated to the VFTA would continue in force as long as the convention center hotel bonds are outstanding.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>The second provision excluded the specific three percent surcharge taxes collected from any convention center hotel from payment to the Excise Fund, and instead directed that those specific taxes be paid into the VFTA to be used for the expenditures specified in MCC sections 11.402(B) (1) to (5) (including to \u201cMetro for payment of debt service on the Oregon Convention Center Hotel Project Bonds\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The final provision plaintiff sought to refer was the authorization to spend a portion of the two and one-half percent transient lodging tax surcharge in the VFTA on the Oregon Convention Center Hotel Project Bonds as the third priority of expenditure from that fund.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>On December 31, 2013, Scott, the county elections officer, rejected the prospective petition on the ground that \u201c[t]he subject of the Petition *** relates to the exercise of the Board of County Commissioner\u2019s Executive and Administrative powers\u201d and thus \u201cdoes not meet constitutional or legislative requirements.\u201d Plaintiff appealed that order to circuit court under ORS 246.910(1). The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the reviewing court granted defendants\u2019 motion and denied plaintiffs motion, ruling that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-4\">\u201cOrdinance 1206-and particularly those portions plaintiff seeks to have submitted to county voters through her proposed referendum-simply implements yet one more administrative determination by the Commissioners regarding how tourism related revenues will be expended for the promotion and support of tourism in Multnomah County and the greater Portland metropolitan area. As Ordinance 1206 is an administrative act, not a legislative one, * * * the ordinance is not properly the subject of a referendum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">According to the court, the \u201cproposed referendum * * * pertains to an administrative act of the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners.\u201d The court incorporated its summary judgment order into a general judgment in favor of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">On appeal, plaintiff contends that the county\u2019s election ordinances permit a referendum on any enactment that is an \u201cordinance,\u201d without regard to the legislative or administrative character of the proposition. For that reason, she claims that the court erred in not ordering the processing of the proposed referendum even if the referendum is administrative in character. Alternatively, plaintiff asserts that the ordinance is \u201clegislative\u201d in nature under Article VI, section 10, and that the court erred in concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">In response, defendants contend that the county could not expand the initiative and referendum authority of its voters beyond that conferred directly by Article VI, section 10, and, even if the county could authorize referenda on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>administrative matters, it did not do so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Defendants argue that the court did not err in classifying the proposed referendum matter as administrative because Ordinance No. 1206 and its portions to be referred implement legislative policy already established in the county code. We conclude that the county code does not permit the referral of administrative propositions, and that the portions of Ordinance No. 1206 sought to be referred are administrative, not legislative, in character, so that the reviewing court did not err in upholding the county\u2019s refusal to process the referendum petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Plaintiff asserts that the county has home-rule authority to expand the type of measures subject to the initiative or referendum process, and has done so in its election code. According to plaintiff, the county election code provisions allow an initiative or referendum on \u201ccounty legislation,\u201d which the code defines as \u201cany ordinance,\u201d so that any law adopted as an \u201cordinance\u201d may be referred, even if the ordinance pertains to administrative matters. We are not persuaded by that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>First, the Multnomah County Charter vests all powers of the county (including the power to take administrative actions) in the board of county commissioners, except in limited circumstances. Section 2.20 provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-4\">\u201c[e]xcept as this charter or a state constitutional or statutory provision regarding the initiative and referendum provides to the contrary, the legislative power of the county shall be vested in and exercisable only by the board of county commissioners. Any other power of the county not vested by the charter elsewhere shall be vested in the board but may be delegated by it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Thus, under the charter, legislative authority can be undertaken by initiative or referendum. Administrative authority, however, is vested exclusively in the board of county commissioners unless specifically delegated by the board or conferred by the charter to a different entity. Plaintiff points to no specific delegation by the county board to the voters to make administrative decisions of any sort. Nor does the charter confer that authority, except for section 10.40, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-6\">\u201cAction by the board regarding a public improvement of the county shall be subject to the referendum in the same manner as legislative ordinances of the county.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We infer from that provision, in the context of charter section 2.20, that only \u201clegislative ordinances\u201d and public improvement actions can be \u201csubject to the referendum\u201d under the county charter. Thus, plaintiffs contention that administrative ordinances may be referred to the voters is inconsistent with the powers vested by the county charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Furthermore, even if the board of county commissioners could generally delegate to the voters the authority to take administrative actions by direct legislation, the board has not done so in its election code. The election code provides for the filing of a prospective petition for \u201creferendum for county legislation,\u201d MCC \u00a7 5.101(A), and requires that, if sufficient signatures are gathered, the \u201creferendum measure will be submitted to the electors,\u201d MCC \u00a7 5.104(I).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cCounty legislation\u201d is defined by MCC section 5.100 to be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\u201c[a]ny ordinance that has been or lawfully may be enacted by the county, and any proposed amendment, revision or repeal of the Charter. It does not include any property tax or bond measure or any emergency ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Plaintiff reasons that \u201c [a]ny ordinance * * * enacted by the county\u201d is any enactment by the county that is captioned or styled to be an ordinance, including ordinances that are administrative, and not legislative, in character. However, that is not the meaning of the term \u201cordinance\u201d as used in the county code. MCC section 1.002 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\u201cThe following definitions and rules of construction shall be observed, unless inconsistent with the intent of the Board of Commissioners or the context clearly requires otherwise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\"*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\"><em>\u201cORDINANCE. </em>A Board exercise of legislative authority granted by the Charter and state law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\"*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\"><em>\u201cRESOLUTION. </em>A Board exercise of administrative authority granted by the Charter and state law, or authorized by ordinance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">(Boldface and emphasis in original.) Thus, \u201ccounty legislation,\u201d subject to initiative and referral, requires the \u201cexercise of legislative authority\u201d as opposed to the \u201cexercise of administrative authority\u201d that is taken ordinarily by resolution. Plaintiffs proposed referral of part of Ordinance No. 1206, if administrative in nature, is not authorized by MCC section 5.101.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">Plaintiff next contends that, even if the county election code does not allow referral of administrative matters, the portions of Ordinance No. 1206 she seeks to refer are legislative in nature and, therefore, within the referendum power reserved to county voters under Article VI, section 10, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-12\">\u201cThe initiative and referendum powers reserved to the people by this Constitution hereby are further reserved to the legal voters of every county relative to the adoption, amendment, revision or repeal of a county charter and to <em>legislation passed by counties </em>which have adopted such a charter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>***. To be circulated, referendum or initiative petitions shall set forth in full the charter or <em>legislative provisions proposed for adoption or referral. </em>* * * In a county a number of signatures of qualified voters equal to but not greater than four percent of the total number of all votes cast in the county for all candidates for Governor at the election at which a Governor was elected for a term of four years next preceding the filing of the petition shall be required for a petition to order a <em>referendum on county legislation or a part thereof,?</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">(Emphases added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We construe the meaning of a provision added to the constitution after its original enactment by examining its text in context, and, if necessary, the enactment history and other aids to construction. <em>Priest v. Pearce, </em>314 Or 411, 415-16, 840 P2d 65 (1992). The text of Article VI, section 10, directly states that the referendum power only applies to \u201clegislation passed by counties\u201d and to \u201clegislative provisions,\u201d that is, provisions that themselves are legislative in nature, even if the proposed referendum is \u201con county legislation or a part thereof.\u201d The parties frame the issue accordingly\u2014debating whether the parts of Ordinance No. 1206 sought to be referred are legislative in character. We assume, for purposes of this case, that the authority to refer parts of a county ordinance under Article VI, section 10, exists only if the parts of the ordinance create policy that is legislative in character.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>In classifying an enacted or proposed law as legislative in character (and subject to the initiative and referendum provisions in the Oregon Constitution) and not executive, administrative, or adjudicative in nature (and outside the scope of those provisions), Oregon courts assess the law to determine if it makes policy of general applicability and is more than temporary in duration (and is thus legislative in nature), or if it applies previous policy to particular actions, or is otherwise compelled in substance or process by predicate policy (and is thus executive, administrative, or adjudicative in nature).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Thus, in <em>Long v. City of Portland, </em>53 Or 92, 100-01, 98 P 149 (1908), <em>reh'g den, </em>98 P 1111 (1909), the court determined that an ordinance of the City of Portland establishing a license fee for the operation of vehicles was referable, reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cThe only acts of the council that are subject to the referendum, by Section la, Article IV, are such as come within the term \u2018municipal legislation.\u2019 Legislation as here contemplated must be considered in the sense of general laws, namely, rules of civil conduct prescribed by the lawmaking power and of general application. By Opinion of the Justices, 66 N. H. 629 (33 Atl. 1076), the law is said to be a rule\u2014not a transient, sudden order to and concerning a particular person, but something permanent, uniform, and universal. The action of a municipal council may relate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>questions or subjects of a permanent or general character, or to those which are temporary and restrictive in their operation and effect; and ordinarily an ordinance relates to the former, while the latter may be adopted by resolution. The former must be enacted with all the formality required by the charter, while the latter may be adopted with less formality, and its legal effect determined less strictly, unless the charter otherwise provides. ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">\u201cWhatever may be the requirement as to the form of enactment, the former is municipal legislation, while the latter is not. In <em>Shaub v. Lancaster City, </em>156 Pa. 362, 366, (26 Atl. 1067, 1068: 21 L. R. A. 691), it is said: \u2018But there is a well-marked distinction between acts that are legislative, and that lay down a rule of action for the citizens or the city, and acts that relate to daily administration of municipal affairs. The latter may well be described as \u201cbusiness\u201d to be transacted by councils, and may be properly left to them to dispose of by \u201corder or resolution.\u201d\u2019 And this distinction is not destroyed by reason of the fact that by the Portland charter much of the latter class of business must be accomplished by ordinances, and not by resolutions. This will not bring the latter within the classification of municipal legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\"><em>See also Monahan v. Funk, </em>137 Or 580, 586, 3 P2d 778 (1931) (ordinance authorizing purchase of property for crematorium, adopted after voter approval of bonds for the project, is not referable; reasoning that ordinance \u201cprescribes no rule of civil conduct; it is not permanent, uniform or universal in its application to the general public\u201d and \u201cwas a carrying out of the business of the council ***\u201d); <em>Hebring v. Brown, </em>92 Or 176, 180, 180 P 328 (1919) (no referendum right to vote on ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution because referendum applies \u201conly to proposed laws, and not to legislative resolutions, memorials and the like\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">In a number of decisions, Oregon courts have concluded that an enactment of a local governing body that implements prior policy is not referable. <em>See Yamhill County v. Dauenhauer, </em>261 Or 154, 156, 492 P2d 766 (1972) (proposed initiative measure precluding construction of bridge not proper subject for an election because the voters earlier approved bonds for the bridge and construction of the bridge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>was approved previously by the county board); <em>Tillamook P. U. D. v. Coates, </em>174 Or 476, 481, 149 P2d 558 (1944) (ordinance approving issuance of bonds previously approved by voters is \u201cadministrative rather than legislative in character\u201d); <em>Whitbeck v. Funk, </em>140 Or 70, 75, 12 P2d 1019 (1932) (ordinance authorizing purchase of property for public market was not referable because of a prior ordinance approving the debt financing for the facility; concluding that the ordinance \u201cdoes not enact legislation\u201d but \u201cis merely carrying out a business transaction designating real property for use as a public market\u201d); <em>Roberts v. Thies, </em>70 Or App 256, 260, 689 P2d 356 (1984), <em>rev den, </em>298 Or 553 (1985) (ordinance authorizing acquisition of property for a park was administrative because prior municipal legislation and land use plans authorized development of the park).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Analogously, a particular local government decision is not subject to direct legislation if it is required to be made by a prescribed nonlegislative process. Thus, in <em>Foster v. Clark, </em>309 Or 464, 790 P2d 1 (1990), the court held that a proposed initiative measure renaming a Portland city street constituted administrative activity, rather than legislative activity, and thus, was not subject to the initiative process. The court noted that the Portland City Code contained \u201ca complete scheme for changing Portland city street names,\u201d representing a \u201ccompleted legislative plan\u201d so that street renamings \u201cbecome administrative acts, not legislative.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473. Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">\"[a] city\u2019s practice of naming or renaming streets only through specific ordinances may establish that the activity is \u2018legislation\u2019 subject to the initiative and referendum process. Another city\u2019s practice of naming and renaming streets only through a process akin to that established [in Portland\u2019s code] may establish that the activity is \u2018administrative\u2019 and not subject to the initiative and referendum process. The point is, whether a particular municipal activity is \u2018administrative\u2019 or is \u2018legislation\u2019 often depends not on the nature of the action but the nature of the legal framework in which the action occurs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 474; <em>see also Lane Transit District v. Lane County, </em>327 Or 161, 168-69, 957 P2d 1217 (1998) (in light of \u201ccompleted legislative plan for the appointment, compensation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>and removal of a transit district general manager\u201d in state statutes, proposed measure reducing the salary of a transit district general manager was \u201can administrative task under the existing legal framework\u201d and not the proper subject of an initiative process); <em>Dan Gile and Assoc., Inc. v.

The proposed measure precludes a particular expenditure of transient lodging taxes, a closely circumscribed factual situation, and does not establish or repeal general policies applicable to expenditures of tax funds. The proposed measure does not legislate the imposition of or exemption from a tax, so as to be implicitly subject to referendum under Article IX, section la.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Most importantly, adoption of the pledge of tax funds and the convention center hotel bond funding portions of the ordinance were preordained and compelled by the previously adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>intergovernmental agreement and board resolution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In contrast, legislative choices, whether by a local governing body or its voters, are discretionary in nature, and are not required to be made. Thus, both the substance of the proposed measure and the \u201cnature of the legal framework in which [the adoption of the convention center hotel financing provisions] occurs\u201d compel the conclusion that the proposed measure is administrative in nature. <em>Foster, </em>309 Or at 474.

Thus, if this clause had been in the constitution last year, the referendum petition which held up the million-dollar appropriation bill could have been so framed as to apply only to the most objectionable features of that bill, and the remaining appropriations could have been left undisturbed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-7\"><em>See also Rose v.
