He was sentenced to 70 months in prison and ordered to pay, among other amounts, $1,800 in court-appointed attorney fees. We reject without published discussion defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, in which he contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. In his second assignment, defendant contends that the trial court plainly erred in ordering him to pay $1,800 in attorney fees without determining his ability to pay. The state concedes that the trial court plainly erred by imposing attorney fees \u201con a record that was silent regarding the defendant\u2019s ability to pay them[.]\u201d We agree. <em>See State v. Chavez, </em>263 Or App 187, 326 P3d 629, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 163 (2014) (the imposition of court-appointed attorney fees is plain error where the record is silent as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay those fees); <em>State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (same). Furthermore, for the reasons articulated in <em>Coverstone, </em>we conclude that it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the plain error. 260 Or App at 716-17; <em>see also State v. Fleet, </em>270 Or App 246, 347 P3d 345 (2015) (exercising discretion to correct plain error under similar circumstances). Accordingly, we accept the state\u2019s concession and reverse the portion of the judgment relating to attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>181 CASES AFFIRMED WITHOUT OPINION (356 P3d 1171) June 24, 2015 Burnham, Douglas J., aka Burnham, Douglas John v.
