Board of Parole, </em>349 Or 461, 468, 245 P3d 119 (2010); see ORS 163.105(2) (1979) (describing sentence). When at least 15 years have passed after imposition of such a sentence on a person convicted of aggravated murder, that person \u2014 now an inmate \u2014 may petition the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision for a \u201cmurder review hearing,\u201d at which the inmate has the burden of proving by a preponderance of evidence that he or she \u201cis likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time.\u201d ORS 163.105(3) (1979) (describing murder review process available to a prisoner upon petition); <em>see Lopez v. Mills, </em>249 Or App 674, 676 n 3, 278 P3d 94, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 665 (2012) (explaining the term \u201cmurder review hearing\u201d). If the inmate meets that burden, the board will enter an order changing the terms of the inmate\u2019s confinement to \u201clife imprisonment with the possibility of parole, or work release.\u201d ORS 163.105(4) (1979). This case presents the question of whether the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires the board to grant an inmate\u2019s request for a psychological evaluation in conjunction with a murder review hearing. For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that it does not. Because petitioner\u2019s contrary argument forms the primary basis for his challenge to the board order at issue, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The background facts are mostly procedural and undisputed. Petitioner was arrested for theft in late 1979 after a store security guard accused him of shoplifting. In early 1980, petitioner returned to the store, waited outside until the guard left the store at the end of the work day, and then fatally shot the guard with a rifle. Petitioner was convicted of aggravated murder and sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of incarceration of 20 years without possibility of parole, pursuant to ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>163.105(2) (1979).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court ordered that sentence to run consecutively to sentences that petitioner already had on recent robbery and burglary convictions. Starting in the late 1990s, the board periodically held murder review hearings to determine whether petitioner was \"likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time.\u201d The board received an independent psychological evaluation of petitioner in conjunction with a 1997 murder review hearing; after that hearing, the board found that petitioner was not likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time. The board made a similar finding in 2002. The board held another murder review hearing in 2007 at which it received into evidence \u201ca packet of materials related to [petitioner\u2019s] crime, psychological evaluations, court documents, and records of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>the Department of Corrections.\u201d In addition, petitioner submitted 13 exhibits, including evidence of his participation in prison programs, his plan for release, and letters of recommendation. In the final order that issued after that hearing, the board observed that petitioner had asked the board to pay for a new psychological evaluation. The board rejected that request. Petitioner petitioned for judicial review; we affirmed the board\u2019s order without opinion, and the Supreme Court denied review. <em>Maney v. Board of Parole, </em>258 Or App 534, 311 P3d 527 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 814 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">Another murder review hearing was scheduled for November 2010. The hearing notice issued by the board informed petitioner that the hearing would be conducted in the manner prescribed by ORS 163.105 or ORS 163.115, and pursuant to the administrative rules found in OAR chapter 255, division 32. The notice also set out a nonexclusive list of criteria, as described in OAR 255-032-0020, that could indicate whether an inmate is likely to be rehabilitated. The notice informed petitioner that the board would appoint and pay for an attorney if petitioner wanted one but could not afford to pay. Regarding the presentation of evidence, the notice specified that discovery was not permitted and that it was petitioner\u2019s responsibility to provide the board with any information that he wanted it to consider at the hearing, although the board might subpoena witnesses on his behalf upon a proper showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Before the hearing, petitioner asked that the board \u201corder a psychological evaluation of [petitioner]\u201d to give him an \u201copportunity to demonstrate that his mental state has improved.\u201d In response, the board first observed that no law required it to \u201ccreate evidence on the request of the petitioner.\u201d The board also declined to exercise its discretion to order a psychological evaluation and, therefore, denied petitioner\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">The record before the board at the 2010 hearing included the judgment, pre-sentence investigation, and other materials associated with petitioner\u2019s aggravated murder conviction; psychological evaluations from 1981 and 1997; and copies of other board orders and Department of Corrections (DOC) materials related to petitioner\u2019s incarceration and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>previous murder review hearings. Petitioner, who was represented by counsel, submitted a hearing memorandum supported by several exhibits, including letters of support and thanks from prison employees, volunteers, and visitors; DOC documents reflecting petitioner\u2019s compliant behavior and prison activities; positive \u201cinmate performance reports\u201d; and petitioner\u2019s written parole plan. In addition, petitioner called several witnesses at the 2010 murder review hearing, including a person who had worked \u201cessentially as a correctional treatment therapist\u201d for about eight years and who testified favorably to petitioner, describing what he viewed as petitioner\u2019s sincere efforts in prison programs designed to help deter juveniles from criminal behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The board took the matter under advisement after the November 2010 hearing and subsequently issued an order in which it unanimously found, after applying the OAR 255-032-0020 factors,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that petitioner had \u201cnot satisfied his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>burden of proof under ORS 165.105(2)\u201d and that petitioner \u201cis not likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time.\u201d The board acknowledged petitioner\u2019s \u201cpositive employment and disciplinary history\u201d while incarcerated. However, it determined that \u201cother factors demonstrate that [petitioner] is not likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time,\u201d including that petitioner \u201csignificantly minimized his actions in murdering [the security guard], particularly in denying the planned nature of the crime.\u201d The board also acknowledged that petitioner had participated in some prison programs, but determined that he had \u201cnot demonstrated a desire to seek out and explore any deeper levels of his thinking and cognitive functioning.\u201d Relatedly, the board observed that petitioner\u2019s \u201cdemeanor during his testimony often reflected a callous disregard for the seriousness of the crime,\u201d perhaps echoing his acknowledged focus solely on his own needs at the time he committed the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The board also found that petitioner \u201cdisplayed little to no ability to identify personal weaknesses, or areas where improvement is needed.\u201d In particular, although petitioner is articulate and gave lengthy answers to many questions, the board found him \u201cunable to express how he is different now from the man who thought he could \u2018get away with it,\u2019 and who believed that if he wanted something, \u2018why not take it?\u201d\u2019 Thus, the board stated, petitioner\u2019s self-analysis during the murder review hearing still \u201ccentered on his needs and was expressed in generalities such as, T can\u2019t * * * go through this again.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">\u201cIn sum, the Board has cause to doubt that [petitioner] has fully examined the motives for his actions and the depth of his culpability, and remains unconvinced that [petitioner] is presently demonstrating the maturity, stability, self-knowledge, and responsibility, that may promote conformity to law and establish that he is capable of rehabilitation within a reasonable period of time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Finally, the board took into account a 1981 psychological evaluation, as well as petitioner\u2019s testimony in the current murder review hearing, in concluding that he continued to suffer an emotional disturbance that made him a danger to the community:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u201cA psychological evaluation, completed in 1981 by Dr. F. Robert Stuckey as part of the presentence investigation, states that it is advisable to evaluate [petitioner] \u2018on his past performance and behaviors rather than totally accepting his verbalizations.\u2019 Dr. Stuckey also said [petitioner] is a person \u2018who could behave in a way that would cause different people to form different impressions of him.\u2019 Dr. Stuckey concluded at that time that [petitioner] fit the diagnosis of borderline personality, and that the prognosis for crime-free behavior was poor. Although [petitioner] has not submitted a current psychological evaluation, based upon his presentation to the Board, as well as the historical information which is in the record, the Board finds there is evidence that [petitioner] suffers from a present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community. OAR 255-032-0011(8)(h).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">The board therefore concluded, as it had after the previous hearings, that petitioner had not met his burden of proving the likelihood of rehabilitation. The board also confirmed its earlier decision not to provide petitioner with a new psychological evaluation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201c[Petitioner\u2019s counsel] objected to the Board\u2019s denial of [petitioner\u2019s] motion requesting that the Board order a psychological evaluation to assist [petitioner] in demonstrating \u2018that his mental state has improved.\u2019 [Petitioner\u2019s counsel] argued that a current psychological examination is necessary to counter a 1997 psychological examination that is in the Board\u2019s file, and that failure to order one violates due process requirements * * * as well as the [Administrative Procedures Act], The board declines to revisit the decision not to order an evaluation ***. As stated [in an earlier order], [petitioner] has the burden of proof, and no contested case procedures require that an agency create evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Petitioner sought administrative review, and the board issued an administrative review response affirming its determination that petitioner had not proved that he was capable of rehabilitation within a reasonable period of time. \u201cSimply put,\u201d the board explained, it \u201cdid not find that evidence of rehabilitation outweighs the evidence that [petitioner] lack[s] the maturity, stability, responsibility, and personality development required for a finding of rehabilitation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>within a reasonable period of time.\u201d Petitioner seeks judicial review of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">On review, petitioner argues, as he did to the board, that he has a due process right to a current psychological evaluation, to be conducted at the board\u2019s expense. Petitioner argues, first, that the board\u2019s decision deprived him of a liberty interest in his eventual release on parole, for which he can become eligible only after he proves that he is likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time. Next, applying the balancing test set out in <em>Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 US 319, 96 S Ct 893, 47 L Ed 2d 18 (1976), petitioner argues that the procedures associated with his murder review hearing did not satisfy due process requirements.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, petitioner contends that he was constitutionally entitled to a current psychological evaluation, supplied by the board, because the lack of such an evaluation deprived him of \u201ca significant opportunity to meet and to make a record concerning critical elements of his burden of proof\u2019 to establish that he is likely to be rehabilitated and, therefore, should become eligible for parole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\">\u201cWithout a <em>current </em>psychological evaluation, the risk of an erroneous determination that a prisoner is <em>not </em>likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable period of time is great, because the board has effectively denied the indigent inmate a meaningful opportunity to prove critical components of that determination and to make an evidentiary record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">(Emphasis in petitioner\u2019s brief.) Asserting that he has a significant interest in becoming eligible for parole and that the board\u2019s interest in avoiding the expense of a psychological evaluation is minimal, petitioner concludes that a balancing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>of the <em>Mathews </em>factors establishes that \u201cthe board\u2019s procedures must provide for an appointed psychological evaluation when requested by an indigent inmate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Petitioner\u2019s application of the <em>Mathews </em>factors to the circumstances of this case is well-reasoned. However, petitioner\u2019s argument does not address controlling post-<em>Mathews </em>precedent that resolves the case against him\u2014 even assuming, as we do for purposes of this opinion, that petitioner has a protected liberty interest in becoming eligible for release on parole pursuant to ORS 163.105(3) (1979). <em>See Stogsdill v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 332, 335-36, 154 P3d 91 (2007) (an inmate has a protected liberty interest under ORS 144.120 and ORS 144.245, which entitle an inmate to be released on parole \u201cunless the board is persuaded that he has a present severe emotional disturbance that constitutes a danger to the health or safety of the community\u201d); <em>Miller v. Oregon Board of Parole, </em>642 F3d 711, 716 (9th Cir 2011) (ORS 163.105 (1981) gives rise to a liberty interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">That controlling precedent starts with <em>Greenholtz v. Inmates of Neb. Penal and Correctional Complex, </em>442 US 1, 3-4, 99 S Ct 2100, 60 L Ed 2d 668 (1979), in which inmates challenged the procedures by which the Nebraska Board of Parole determined their eligibility for release on parole. That determination was guided by a statute that required the parole board to release an inmate unless it determined that release should be deferred for one of four statutorily specified reasons, including that there was \u201c\u2018a substantial risk that [the inmate would] not conform to the conditions of parole\u2019\u201d or that the inmate\u2019s \u201c\u2018continued correctional treatment, medical care, or vocational or other training in the facility [would] substantially enhance his capacity to lead a law-abiding life when released at a later date.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11 (quoting Nebraska statute). In addition, the statute set out factors that the parole board was \u201crequired to take into account in deciding whether or not to grant parole,\u201d including such things as the inmate\u2019s \u201cpersonality, including his maturity, stability, sense of responsibility and any apparent development in his personality which may promote or hinder his conformity to law,\u201d and the inmate\u2019s \u201cmental or physical makeup, including any disability or handicap which may affect his conformity to law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>The inmates argued that the Due Process Clause entitled them to certain protections during parole-release proceedings, and the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, requiring the board to give each parole-eligible inmate <em>\u201ca </em>full formal hearing\u201d at which the inmate could appear in person and present documentary evidence in his own behalf. <em>Id. </em>at 6. That court also required the parole board, within a reasonable time after hearing, to \u201csubmit a full explanation, in writing, of the facts relied upon and reasons for the Board\u2019s action denying parole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">The Supreme Court reversed, rejecting the idea that the inmates had a due process right to such procedures. Noting the discretionary nature of the parole board\u2019s decision, even as guided by the pertinent statutes, the Court held that the Due Process Clause does not require \u201crepeated, adversary hearings in order to continue the confinement\u201d of a person who already has been convicted. <em>Id. </em>at 13-14. Accordingly, the Court rejected the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding that due process required the parole board to give each inmate a full hearing and, when denying parole, a statement of the evidence that the board had relied upon. <em>Id. </em>at 14-15. Rather, the Court held, due process requirements were satisfied by Nebraska\u2019s existing parole procedures, which allowed each inmate \u201cto appear before the Board and present letters and statements on his own behalf,\u201d supplementing the board\u2019s own records, and which told each inmate \u201cin what respects he [fell] short of qualifying for parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15-16. \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d the Court held, \u201cdoes not require more.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">The Court stated the principle even more bluntly in <em>Swarthout v. Cooke, </em>562 US 216, 131 S Ct 859, 178 L Ed 2d 732 (2011). In that case, the Court addressed what procedures are constitutionally required in association with a California statute that requires its parole board to \u201c\u2018set a release date unless it determines that * * * consideration of the public safety requires a more lengthy period of incarceration.\u2019\u201d 562 US at 216-17 (quoting California statute). In reviewing decisions made under that statute, the California Supreme Court had explained, state appellate courts would consider \u201cwhether \u2018some evidence\u2019 supports the conclusion that the inmate is unsuitable for parole because he or she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>currently is dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217 (quoting <em>In re Lawrence, </em>44 Cal 4th 1181, 1191 (2008)). In federal habeas corpus proceedings, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that a decision denying an inmate release on parole \u201cwas an unreasonable application of California\u2019s \u2018some evidence\u2019 rule and was an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 219 (quoting <em>Clay v. Kane, </em>384 Fed Appx 544, 546 (9th Cir 2007) (unpublished)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Again, the Supreme Court reversed, this time in a per curiam decision. To the extent that the Ninth Circuit may have concluded that the Due Process Clause required \u201ccorrect application of the State\u2019s \u2018some evidence\u2019 standard,\u201d the Court held, it was mistaken. <em>Id. </em>at 219-20. Citing <em>Greenholtz, </em>the Court reiterated that statutes governing inmates\u2019 release on parole ensure that inmates receive \u201cadequate process\u201d through \u201can opportunity to be heard\u201d and \u201ca statement of the reasons why parole was denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 220. The Court observed that the California inmates had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201creceived at least this amount of process: They were allowed to speak at their parole hearings and to contest the evidence against them, were afforded access to their records in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why parole was denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-6\"><em>Id. </em>\u201cThat,\u201d the Court held, \u201cshould have been the beginning and the end of the federal habeas courts\u2019 inquiry into whether [the inmates] received due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court emphasized that, when the liberty interest at issue is the interest in receiving parole when state standards for parole have been met, \u201cthe minimum procedures adequate for due-process protection of that interest are those set forth in Greenholtz.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Holdings of the Oregon Supreme Court are consistent with those principles. In <em>Stogsdill, </em>the court addressed the protections that are due an inmate who seeks parole pursuant to ORS 144.120 and ORS 144.125(3), which require the board to set initial parole release dates for most inmates and to postpone such a release date only upon finding that the inmate has a \u201c\u2018present severe emotional disturbance such as to constitute a danger to the health or safety of the community.\u2019\u201d 342 Or at 335-36 (quoting ORS 144.125(3)). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>In <em>Stogsdill, </em>the board postponed the petitioner\u2019s release date after it found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he had such a condition. <em>Id. </em>at 334. The petitioner sought review, arguing that the Due Process Clause required the board to apply a higher standard of proof. In rejecting that argument, the Supreme Court held that, although an inmate has a liberty interest in obtaining parole under those statutes, \u201cthe significance of [that] interest is diminished by the existence of a conviction that permits the state to hold him for the duration of his sentence].]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Although petitioner cites <em>Cooke </em>and <em>Stogsdill, </em>he does not acknowledge the holdings in those cases or in Greenholtz; nor does he explain why Oregon\u2019s murder review proceedings differ so fundamentally from the statutory proceedings at issue in those cases that a different due process analysis should apply. And the arguments that petitioner does make do not persuade us that <em>Greenholtz, Cooke, </em>and <em>Stogsdill </em>are materially distinguishable. In arguing that he had a due process right to a board-funded psychological evaluation, petitioner emphasizes that he had the burden of proving that he was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time and contends that, absent a current psychological evaluation, he had no meaningful way to make that showing. Petitioner points to OAR 255-032-0020, which directs the board to consider factors to which a psychological evaluation could be relevant, like the inmate\u2019s \u201cmaturity, stability, demonstrated responsibility, and any apparent development in the inmate personality which may promote or hinder conformity to law\u201d and whether the inmate has \u201ca mental or emotional disturbance, deficiency, condition or disorder predisposing them to the commission of a crime to a degree rendering them a danger to the health and safety of the community.\u201d OAR 255-032-0020(4), (8).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">The difficulty for petitioner is two-fold. First, to the extent that due process considerations may be affected by the legislature\u2019s allocation of the burden of proof to the inmate, the result does not benefit petitioner. If anything, an inmate\u2019s liberty interest in parole is further diminished when the statutory scheme creates a presumption against parole, rather than for it. <em>Cf. Board of Pardons v. Allen, </em>482 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>US 369, 374, 107 S Ct 2415, 96 L Ed 2d 303 (1987) (explaining that, in deciding in <em>Greenholtz </em>that a Nebraska statute created a protected liberty interest, the Court \u201cfound significant its mandatory language \u2014 the use of the word \u2018shall\u2019\u2014 and the presumption created \u2014 that parole release must be granted unless one of four designated justifications for deferral is found\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">Second, the balancing that petitioner asks us to conduct already has been conducted by the United States Supreme Court, which has held that the Due Process Clause guarantees inmates seeking parole nothing more than a right \u201cto speak at their parole hearings and to contest the evidence against them, [to have] access to their records in advance, and [to be] notified as to the reasons why parole was denied.\u201d <em>Cooke, </em>562 US at 220. That is true even when, as in <em>Greenholtz, </em>a parole board is required to consider such matters as the inmate\u2019s mental state, maturity, stability, sense of responsibility, and ability to conform behavior to the <em>law </em>\u2014 i.e., factors similar to those that the parole board considered here. 442 US at 16-17. It follows that the <em>Greenholtz </em>rule applies in this context, notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s focus on the fact that the board necessarily considered his mental state in determining whether he had met his burden of proving that he was likely to be rehabilitated within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">In the end, what matters for the <em>Greenholtz</em>/<em>Cooke </em>analysis is the process that petitioner received in conjunction with his murder review hearing, <em>not </em>what additional procedures might have benefited either him or the board in making its determination. We turn to that question. Petitioner received notice of his 2010 murder review hearing, prehearing access to his records, the right to present evidence in his favor and to make a statement to the board, and a complete explanation of why the board declined to declare him eligible for parole under ORS 163.105(3) (1979). Those procedures satisfied the requirements of the Due Process Clause. <em>See Miller, </em>642 F3d at 717 (an Oregon inmate was afforded all process that was due in conjunction with his murder review hearings when he \u201cwas afforded access to his records in advance of the hearings, * * * he was given the opportunity to submit information to the Board and to make a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>during the hearing\u201d and he was \u201ceventually provided with a written statement of the reasons why he was denied early eligibility for parole\u201d); <em>see also Smith v.
