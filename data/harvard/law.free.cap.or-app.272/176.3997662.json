Petitioner did not seek review of the board\u2019s order at that time. In September 2011, the board amended the conditions of petitioner\u2019s supervision and, in its order, again stated that petitioner was a predatory sex offender. In June 2012, petitioner sought administrative review of the predatory sex offender designation. The board denied review of the predatory sex offender designation as untimely, noting that petitioner had signed the 1998 order designating him a predatory sex offender and, therefore, had notice of the designation at that time. In addition, to the extent that petitioner sought to have the board reopen and reconsider its earlier order designating him a predatory sex offender, the board denied that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Petitioner contends that the board erred when it designated him a predatory sex offender in 1998 and in its later orders \u201cre-impos[ing]\u201d that designation. The state asserts that we lack jurisdiction to review the board\u2019s orders because petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies and because, in light of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mastriano v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 684, 159 P3d 1151 (2007), the board\u2019s order denying reopening and reconsideration of its earlier order is not a final order for purposes of judicial review. The state further notes that, contrary to petitioner\u2019s characterization of the later orders as \u201cre-impos[ing]\u2019\u2019 the predatory sex offender designation, \u201cthe board did not \u2014 and <em>could </em>not \u2014 \u2018re-impose\u2019 a designation that had never been removed.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Under ORS 144.335(1), a person over whom the board exercises jurisdiction may seek review of a final order if \u201c(a) [t]he person is adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the board;\u201d and \u201c(b) [t]he person has exhausted administrative review as provided by board rule.\u201d As the court explained in <em>Mastriano, </em>\u201ca board order denying reopening and reconsideration of an earlier final order is not itself a final order for purposes of judicial review pursuant to ORS 144.335(1).\u201d 342 Or at 686; <em>see id. </em>at 690 (a denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>of review or reconsideration that does not \u201creexamine the prior order\u201d is \u201cnot a final order subject to judicial review\u201d); <em>see also Dawson/Fletcher v. Board of Parole, </em>346 Or 643, 217 P3d 1055 (2009) (rejecting the petitioners\u2019 contention that dismissal was inappropriate because, in its order denying reopening and reconsideration, the board \u201cconstructively reopened\u201d earlier final orders); <em>Eli v. Board of Parole, </em>187 Or App 454, 457, 67 P3d 982 (2003) (dismissing judicial review for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, observing that, under ORS 144.335(1), an inmate must use the process of administrative review provided by board rule before seeking judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">Here, petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies as to the board\u2019s predatory sex offender designation. Furthermore, as in <em>Mastriano </em>and <em>Dawson/Fletcher, </em>the board\u2019s later order denying reopening and reconsideration is not a final order for purposes of judicial review. <em>See Abraham v. Board of Parole, </em>272 Or App 173, 354 P3d 761 (2015) (dismissing judicial review under substantially similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Petition for judicial review dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
