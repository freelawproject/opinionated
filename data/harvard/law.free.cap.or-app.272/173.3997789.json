Petitioner did not seek review of the board\u2019s order at that time. However, in 2012, petitioner sent a letter to the board seeking to \u201cchallenge [his] \u2018predatory sex offender\u2019 status [.]\u201d In response, in 2013, the board denied review of the 1995 order as untimely. In addition, to the extent that petitioner\u2019s letter was a request to reopen and reconsider the 1995 order designating him a predatory sex offender, the board denied that request. In its decision, the board explained that \u201c[interests of administrative efficiency and finality of Board orders militate against reopening and reconsidering a final Board order based on issues that could have been raised through the established procedures for administrative and judicial review of Board orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Petitioner contends that the board erred both in designating him a predatory sex offender in 1995 and in its response to his 2012 challenge to that designation. The state, citing ORS 144.335(l)(b), asserts that, \u201c[b]ecause petitioner did not exhaust administrative remedies, this court lacks jurisdiction to review the board\u2019s order.\u201d (Boldface omitted.) Furthermore, the state asserts that, in light of the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mastriano v. Board of Parole, </em>342 Or 684, 159 P3d 1151 (2007), the board\u2019s order is not a final order for purposes of judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The state is correct. Under ORS 144.335(1),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-7\">\u201cA person over whom the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision exercises its jurisdiction may seek judicial review of a final order of the board as provided in this section if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201c(a) The person is adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order of the board; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u201c(b) The person has exhausted administrative review as provided by board rule.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">As the court explained in <em>Mastriano, </em>\u201ca board order denying reopening and reconsideration of an earlier final order is not itself a final order for purposes of judicial review pursuant to ORS 144.335(1).\u201d 342 Or at 686; <em>see id. </em>at 690 (a denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>of review or reconsideration that does not \u201creexamine the prior order\u201d is \u201cnot a final order subject to judicial review\u201d); <em>see also Dawson/Fletcher v. Board of Parole, </em>346 Or 643, 217 P3d 1055 (2009) (rejecting the petitioners\u2019 contention that dismissal was inappropriate because, in its order denying reopening and reconsideration, the board \u201cconstructively reopened\u201d earlier final orders); <em>Eli v. Board of Parole, </em>187 Or App 454, 457, 67 P3d 982 (2003) (dismissing judicial review for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, observing that, under ORS 144.335(1), an inmate must use the process of administrative review provided by board rule before seeking judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Because petitioner failed to seek timely review of the board\u2019s 1995 order designating him a predatory sex offender, and because the board\u2019s 2013 decision denying reopening and reconsideration is not a final order for purposes of judicial review, we agree with the state that judicial review in this case must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Petition for judicial review dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
