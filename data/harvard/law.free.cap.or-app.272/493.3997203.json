Petitioner argues that the rules violate the board\u2019s statutory authority because they place limits on persons whom an inmate may have in attendance at board hearings. Petitioner also argues that the board\u2019s rulemaking is invalid because the board rules were not \u201cpromulgated jointly\u201d with the Department of Corrections (the department), as required by ORS 144.123. Petitioner recognizes that the department promulgated corresponding rules regarding who may accompany inmates to a board hearing, but he contends that the agencies were required to promulgate a \u201csingle joint rule.\u201d We reject petitioner\u2019s rule challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Petitioner\u2019s challenge addresses the amended versions of OAR 255-030-0025 and OAR 255-030-0026, which became effective in November 2013. OAR 255-030-0025, entitled \u201cInmate Accompaniment to Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision Hearing,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201c(1) Purpose: The purpose of these rules is to jointly establish with the Department of Corrections policies and procedures governing who may accompany an inmate in a hearing before the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">\u201c(2) Policy: It is the joint policy of the Department of Corrections and Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision that inmates be permitted to have a person accompany them in hearings before the Board in accordance with ORS 144.123, as provided in these rules. The decision to approve a person\u2019s physical access to a Board hearing held within a Department of Corrections facility will be made by the functional unit manager or designee of the facility in which the inmate is confined, in accordance with the department\u2019s rules on Facility Access (OAR 291-016) and Visiting (Inmate) (OAR 291-127). A person\u2019s physical access to a Department of Corrections facility may be prohibited or restricted by the functional unit manager or designee consistent with these rules; the health, safety and security of staff, inmates, and the public; and with the safe, secure, and orderly operation and management of the facility.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>The other challenged rule, OAR 255-030-0026, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-4\">\u201c(1) Inmate Accompaniment: When appearing before the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision in a hearing, an inmate may be accompanied at the Department of Corrections facility in which the inmate is confined, subject to the prior approval of the facility functional unit manager or designee, by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-5\">\u201c(a) A person who has been approved for privileged visiting in accordance with the Department of Corrections rule on Visiting (Inmate) (OAR 291-127);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-6\">\u201c(b) An assigned inmate legal assistant, selected in accordance with the Department of Corrections rule on Legal Affairs (Inmate) (OAR 291-139), from the Department of Corrections facility where the inmate is confined; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-7\">\u201c(c) The inmate\u2019s attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201c(2) In addition to those persons specified in subsection (1) of this rule, the inmate may be accompanied at the hearing via telephone or videoconference by such other person or persons as the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision, in its discretion, may approve by prior arrangement. The inmate may select one person to speak on his/her behalf. The statement shall not exceed 15 minutes. The presiding Board member may grant the support person additional time upon a finding that further testimony is likely to be relevant to the Board\u2019s decision. The presiding Board member may exclude or limit irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious testimony and evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Petitioner brings his rule challenge under ORS 183.400, which permits \u201cany person\u201d to petition this court to review the validity of a rule as long as the petitioner is not \u201ca party to an order or a contested case in which the validity of the rule may be determined by a court.\u201d ORS 183.400(1). Under that statute, \u201cwe may declare the rule invalid only if we conclude that it violates constitutional provisions, exceeds the statutory authority of the agency that adopted the rule, or was adopted without complying with rulemaking procedures.\u201d <em>Assn. of Acupuncture v. Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>260 Or App 676, 678, 320 P3d 575 (2014) (citing ORS 183.400(4)). Petitioner does not argue that either rule violates a constitutional provision, so our inquiry focuses on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>whether the board complied with rulemaking procedures and acted within its statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">We first address petitioner\u2019s contention that the board exceeded its statutory authority by enacting OAR 255-030-0025 and OAR 255-030-0026, because those rules place limits on people the inmate may select to attend a board hearing. <em>See Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Dept. of Human Res., </em>297 Or 562, 565, 687 P2d 785 (1984) (describing \u201cproper sequence of analyzing\u201d validity of a challenged administrative rule). When reviewing whether the board acted within its statutory authority, our inquiry is limited to \u201cthe wording of the rule itself (read in context) and the statutory provisions authorizing the rule.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Oregon Lottery Commission, </em>344 Or 345, 355, 182 P3d 180 (2008) (citing ORS 183.400(3)(a), (b)); <em>see also Oregon Newspaper Publishers v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>329 Or 115, 118-19, 988 P2d 359 (1999) (if rules \u201con their face comply with applicable constitutional and statutory requirements * * * any further challenge to them must be made on an \u2018as applied\u2019 basis\u201d). As with other questions of statutory construction, in determining the scope of an agency\u2019s statutory authority, \u201cwe seek to discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the relevant statutes and, if useful to the analysis, pertinent legislative history.\u201d <em>Assn. of Acupuncture, </em>260 Or App at 678 (citing <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The premise of petitioner\u2019s rule challenge is that ORS 144.123 creates a \u201cright\u201d for the inmate to bring any \u201cperson of the inmate\u2019s choice\u201d to board hearings. We reject petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the pertinent law. ORS 144.123 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">\u201cWhen appearing before the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision an inmate <em>shall have the right to be accompanied by a person of the inmate\u2019s choice pursuant to rule promulgated jointly </em>by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision and the Department of Corrections.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">(Emphasis added.) Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the statute ignores the phrase that qualifies the inmate\u2019s \u201cchoice\u201d of who may accompany him before the board; that choice must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>be made \u201cpursuant to rule promulgated jointly by the\u201d board and department. As used in this context, \u201cpursuant to\u201d is a legal phrase that \u201cmeans either \u2018[i]n compliance with; in accordance with; under\u2019 or \u2018[a]s authorized by; under.\u2019\u201d <em>Jones v. Douglas County (A148612), </em>247 Or App 81, 93, 270 P3d 278 (2011) (quoting <em>Black's Law Dictionary </em>1272 (8th ed 2004) (brackets in original)). The text of the statute, thus, is inconsistent with defendant\u2019s suggestion that the legislature intended to grant inmates an unlimited \u201cright to be accompanied\u201d at board hearings by <em>any person </em>of the inmate\u2019s choice. On the contrary, the statute demonstrates the legislature\u2019s intent that the inmate\u2019s choice must be in compliance with and to the extent authorized by the administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">The legislative history reflects that intention as well. ORS 144.123, originally introduced as House Bill (HB) 2995, was enacted in 1981. <em>See </em>Or Laws 1981, ch 644, \u00a7 1. According to the testimony of State Parole Board member Ira Blalock:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cThe reason for having the Parole Board adopt rules, promulgate rules with the Corrections Division about who can appear is that those hearing rooms are inside the institutions and should be controlled somewhat by the access to those secure spaces. So that\u2019s the reason for having the Corrections Division and Board of Parole jointly promulgate rules. It\u2019s not that we\u2019re trying to keep anybody out. But that they do have those secure spaces and it would work a hardship on the Corrections Division to have to approve somebody who is not on the visitors list for the last minute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, Subcommittee 1, HB 2995, May 27, 1981, Tape 422, Side A (statement of Ira Blalock). The board\u2019s rules regulating attendance at hearings held within department facilities are consistent with its statutory authority under ORS 144.123.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We also reject petitioner\u2019s argument that the board followed invalid \u201crulemaking procedures\u201d when it adopted the 2013 amendments to OAR 255-030-0025 and OAR 255-030-0026. As a preliminary matter, we emphasize that petitioner does not contend that the board failed to comply with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>general administrative rulemaking procedures found in ORS 183.335, or agency-specific rulemaking procedures found in OAR chapter 255, division 1, or OAR chapter 137, division 1. Rather, petitioner continues to rely on ORS 144.123, which he interprets as requiring a degree of rulemaking coordination between the board and the department greater than that employed here. Petitioner focuses on the statutory requirement that the inmate\u2019s right to choose the person who accompanies him or her at a hearing must be exercised \u201cpursuant to <em>rule promulgated jointly </em>by the State Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision and the Department of Corrections.\u201d ORS 144.123 (emphasis added). According to petitioner, that text directs the board and the department together \u201cto enact a single joint rule,\u201d and the board\u2019s rules fail because they \u201cwere adopted at a different date than the related rules adopted by the Department of Corrections, have different assigned rule numbers in the Oregon Administrative Rules Compilation (OARC), and although similar, do not contain the same provisions.\u201d We again turn to principles of statutory construction to determine what the legislature intended by the phrase \u201crule promulgated jointly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">As an initial matter, we reject petitioner\u2019s contention that the legislature\u2019s use of the term \u201cpursuant to rule\u201d means that the accompaniment policy must be promulgated by both agencies as a single rule. The term \u201crule\u201d does not have an exclusively singular connotation in Oregon law. <em>See, e.g., </em>ORS 183.310(9) (\u201c\u2018Rule\u2019 means any agency directive, standard, regulation or statement of general applicability that implements, interprets or prescribes law or policy, or describes the procedure or practice requirements of any agency.\u201d) Notably, ORS 144.123 does not refer to \u201ca rule,\u201d but to \u201crule,\u201d which, in this context, suggests simply the product of agency rulemaking. Had the legislature intended the joint promulgation to result in a single administrative rule, it could have worded the statute specifically to require that different grammatical structure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Moreover, the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>has specifically cautioned that, in interpreting its statutes, \u201c[t]he singular number may include the plural and the plural number, the singular.\u201d ORS 174.127(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Petitioner also objects, however, that the challenged board rules were not \u201cpromulgated jointly\u201d with the department, as required by ORS 144.123. Following the framework described by the Supreme Court to answer that question, we first determine whether \u201cpromulgated jointly\u201d \u201cis an \u2018exact\u2019 term, an \u2018inexact\u2019 term, or a \u2018delegative\u2019 term \u2014 that is, how much interpretive authority the legislature delegated to the agency when using that term.\u201d <em>See Blachana, LLC v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>354 Or 676, 687, 318 P3d 735 (2014). The board argues that the phrase is an \u201cinexact\u201d term, meaning that it communicates \u201ca complete policy statement,\u201d but with imprecise words that require further interpretation by the agency. <em>See id. </em>at 687. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The legislature has not provided a definition for the term \u201cpromulgated jointly.\u201d However, there is no indication that the legislature used the words in any sense apart from their plain, natural, and ordinary meaning, and we look to dictionaries in use at the time ORS 144.123 was enacted to determine the \u201cordinary meaning\u201d of its words. <em>See State v. Ziska/Garza, </em>355 Or 799, 804-05, 334 P3d 964 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">For \u201cpromulgate,\u201d the definitions include \u201cto issue or give out (a law) by way of putting into execution.\u201d <em>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary </em>1816 (unabridged ed 2002).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has noted, <em>Webster\u2019s </em>also defines the word \u201cissuance\u201d as equivalent to \u201c\u2018promulgating.\u2019\u201d <em>Dept. of Transportation v. Stallcup, </em>341 Or 93, 100 n 9, 138 P3d 9 (2006) (citing <em>Webster\u2019s </em>at 1201). \u201cJoint\u201d is defined, as pertinent to this context, as meaning \u201cUNITED, COMBINED,\u201d \u201ccommon to two or more,\u201d and \u201cunited, joined, or sharing with another.\u201d <em>Webster's </em>at 1219.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">Although petitioner\u2019s desire for a single rule adopted simultaneously by two agencies on the same date and with identical text and structure would be a \u201crule promulgated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>jointly,\u201d the ordinary definitions of those words are not so precise as to be capable only of the meaning petitioner proposes. The phrase describes a complete policy that the board and the department put \u201cinto execution\u201d through a \u201ccombined\u201d or \u201cshared\u201d regulation that affects both the board and the department. The requirement that the board and the department jointly promulgate rules recognizes that both agencies have an interest in regulating attendance at board hearings held in department facilities and ensures that those regulations set consistent criteria for attendees. The board\u2019s interpretation of the inexact term \u201crule promulgated jointly\u201d must be consistent with that policy. <em>See Blachana, </em>354 Or at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">Here, the process by which the board and the department amended their rules is consistent with the legislative policy conveyed by the phrase \u201crule promulgated jointly.\u201d The board\u2019s rules regarding hearing attendance specifically recite a purpose \u201cto jointly establish with the Department of Corrections policies and procedures governing who may accompany an inmate in a hearing before the Board of Parole and Post-Prison Supervision.\u201d OAR 255-030-0025(1). OAR 255-030-0025 sets out the board\u2019s \u201cjoint policy\u201d with the department \u201cthat inmates be permitted to have a person accompany them in hearings before the Board\u201d and a purpose to \u201cjointly establish\u201d procedures implementing that joint policy. The board\u2019s rules carrying out that policy (OAR 255-030-0025 and OAR 255-030-0026) and the department\u2019s corresponding rules (OAR 291-153-0005 and OAR 291-153-0020) were all originally adopted in 2004. As petitioner acknowledges, the original versions of the rules were \u201cvirtually identical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">In 2012, the board published its notice of proposed amendment to OAR 255-030-0025 and OAR 255-030-0026 within a month of the department\u2019s notice of proposed amendment to OAR 291-153-0005 and OAR 291-153-0020, and the proposed amendments to all four rules took effect in 2013.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although petitioner objects that the amended rules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>are now only \u201csimilar\u201d to each other, petitioner has identified no substantive point on which they differ. In fact, the amendment language for the board rules was essentially\u2014 except for two words \u2014 identical to the amendment language for the department rules.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> That process reflects a permissible interpretation of \u201crule promulgated jointly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">OAR 255-030-0025 and OAR 255-030-0026 held valid.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-5\"> Petitioner objects that the board and the department rules have \"different assigned rule numbers in the Oregon Administrative Rules Compilation (OARC).\u201d But, given the agency-specific numbering system for that compilation, it is understandable that even jointly promulgated rules would have different numbers in each agency\u2019s compilation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> <em>See State v.
