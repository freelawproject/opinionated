J.</author>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for one count of third-degree assault, ORS 163.165, assigning error to the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal. He specifically argues that ORS 163.165 requires evidence that he used a weapon which made direct physical contact with the victim and that the state failed to proffer such evidence. Because we conclude that defendant caused the victim\u2019s injuries by means of a dangerous weapon, his car, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">When reviewing the denial of defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the state \u201cto determine whether a rational trier of fact, making reasonable inferences, could have found the essential elements of the crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>327 Or 568, 570, 966 P2d 208 (1998). Our focus \u201cis not whether we believe defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, but whether there was sufficient evidence for a jury to so find.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We state the facts in accordance with that standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">On August 3, 2011, defendant drove his car south on King\u2019s Valley Highway in Polk County. It was daylight, and the highway offered an unobstructed view of the oncoming traffic in the northbound lane. Without stopping, defendant made a fast, sharp left turn onto a connecting gravel road. In order to turn left, defendant had to cross the northbound lane of the highway. As defendant turned, the victim was approaching the intersection on a motorcycle in the northbound lane. Defendant cut across the northbound lane in front of the victim, causing the victim to brake hard before having to \u201cdump\u201d his motorcycle in order to avoid a collision with defendant. The motorcycle fell and slid on its side as the victim rolled down the highway behind the motorcycle. Before coming to a stop, the motorcycle slid under defendant\u2019s car and hit it. Once the defendant completed his turn, he hesitated for a moment before speeding away. As a result of the incident, the victim suffered serious physical injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">Defendant was indicted for failure to perform the duties of a driver involved in an injury accident, ORS 811.705; assault in the third degree, ORS 163.165; recklessly endangering another person, ORS 163.195; and reckless driving, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ORS 811.140. After the state presented all of its evidence, defendant moved for judgment of acquittal on the third-degree assault charge. Defendant argued that the state had failed to proffer sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could find that defendant caused the victim\u2019s injuries by means of a dangerous weapon. The state responded that there was no indication of obstructions between the two vehicles as they approached each other, but plenty of evidence that defendant was going too fast, made a sharp turn when he should not have, and caused the victim to suffer serious physical injuries as a result of his maneuver. The trial court denied the motion, adopting the state\u2019s reasoning. The jury found defendant guilty, and he now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">ORS 163.165 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of assault in the third degree if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201c(a) Recklessly causes serious physical injury to another by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Defendant concedes that he caused the victim to abandon his motorcycle in an attempt to avoid colliding with defendant\u2019s recklessly operated car, which in turn caused victim\u2019s injuries. However, defendant argues that the trial court erred because there was insufficient evidence to show that he caused the victim\u2019s injuries <em>by means of a </em>dangerous weapon (defendant\u2019s car), because his car never came into direct physical contact with the victim. Defendant instead contends that the victim\u2019s injuries were caused by the victim\u2019s impact with the pavement in his attempt to avoid contact with defendant\u2019s car. The state responds that the trial court ruled correctly because ORS 163.165(1) does not require proof of direct physical contact; instead, the state need only prove that defendant\u2019s use of the car caused the victim\u2019s injuries. For the reasons explained below, we agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The issue before us is whether defendant caused the victim\u2019s injuries \u201cby means of\u2019 defendant\u2019s operation of his car, even though the car did not come into direct contact with the victim. First, a recklessly driven car can be a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d when it \u201cis used in a manner capable of causing death or serious physical injury.\u201d <em>State v. Lopez, </em>56 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Or App 179, 182, 641 P2d 596, <em>rev den, </em>293 Or 146 (1982). Here, defendant does not contest that his car was a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d under ORS 163.165(1)(a). He concedes that his reckless use of the car caused the victim\u2019s injuries and, thus, that he used his car \u201cin a manner capable of causing * * * serious physical injury.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>56 Or App at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">The Supreme Court has previously examined the issue of whether a defendant can cause injury to a passenger \u201cby means of\u2019 a dangerous weapon, a vehicle, under ORS 163.165(l)(a). In <em>State v. Hill, </em>298 Or 270, 272, 692 P2d 100 (1984), the defendant was charged with third-degree assault under ORS 163.165(l)(a) after he injured a passenger while driving a car. The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that a driver cannot injure his passenger \u201cby means of\u2019 the car he drives and \u201cthat a weapon is something that must be <em>directed at </em>a victim to cause injury.\u201d <em>Hill, </em>298 Or at 277-78 (emphasis in original). In concluding that passengers in a car could be injured \u201cby means of\u2019 a car that is a dangerous weapon, the court held that, \u201c[i]f injuries result from the reckless operation of the vehicle, and if the use of the vehicle is such as to render it capable of causing serious injury, then the injuries are caused \u2018by means of a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 278.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Here, as noted, defendant concedes that the victim\u2019s injuries resulted from defendant\u2019s reckless operation of the car. Furthermore, defendant\u2019s use of the car\u2014making a fast turn into oncoming traffic and causing the victim to have to abandon his motorcycle to avoid a collision\u2014rendered the car capable of causing serious injury. Thus, under <em>Hill, </em>the victim\u2019s injuries were \u201ccaused \u2018by means of a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of <em>Hill, </em>we conclude that direct physical contact between a defendant\u2019s recklessly operated car and the victim is not required to satisfy the \u201cby means of\u2019 prong of third-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Accordingly, there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find defendant guilty of third-degree assault, and the trial court did not err in denying the motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
