He raises two arguments on appeal. First, defendant makes an admittedly unpreserved argument that the trial court plainly erred by not merging the guilty verdicts for UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm into a single conviction. He relies on our opinion in <em>State v. Flores, </em>259 Or App 141, 313 P3d 378 (2013), <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 735 (2014), in which we determined that the trial court erred by not merging guilty verdicts for those same two crimes. For the reasons set out below, we reject that unpreserved argument. Defendant\u2019s second argument is also unpreserved; he contends that the trial court plainly erred by ordering him to pay fees for his court-appointed counsel without first considering his ability to pay. The state concedes the point, and we conclude that the concession is appropriate. Accordingly, we reverse the portion of the judgment requiring defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees and we otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The pertinent facts are, for these purposes, undisputed. After defendant shot four men in the parking lot of a bar, he was charged with 10 crimes, including four counts of attempted aggravated murder with a firearm (ORS 161.405, ORS 163.095, ORS 161.610), one count of first-degree assault with a firearm (ORS 163.185, ORS 161.610), three counts of second-degree assault with a firearm (ORS 163.175, ORS 161.610), UUW-firearm (ORS 166.220, ORS 161.610), and FIP-firearm (ORS 166.270, ORS 161.610). The case went to trial, and the jury acquitted defendant of the attempted-aggravated-murder charges, but found him guilty of the remaining charged crimes, including UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm. Defendant did not argue to the trial court that the guilty verdicts for UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm should merge into a single conviction, and the court did not merge those verdicts. The court imposed sentences on the convictions that result in a total 250-month term of incarceration, plus post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>On appeal, defendant first argues that the trial court erred by not merging the UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm verdicts. As noted, that argument is unpreserved. Accordingly, it can form a basis for reversal only if it establishes that the trial court committed error that is \u201cplain,\u201d that is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201cif (1) the error is one of law, (2) the error is \u2018obvious, not reasonably in dispute,\u2019 and (3) the error \u2018appears on the face of the record,\u2019 so that we need not \u2018go outside the record to identify the error or choose between competing inferences, and the facts constituting the error are irrefutable.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><em>State v. Corkill, </em>262 Or App 543, 551, 325 P3d 796, <em>rev den, </em>355 Or 751 (2014). In this case, the first \u201cplain error\u201d requirement is met, as the alleged error is one of law. And the state does not contend that any pertinent facts are in dispute or that we would need to go outside of the record to identify the error; nor do we perceive any such dispute or need to consider extra-record matters. Accordingly, the third \u201cplain error\u201d requirement is met. What remains at issue is the second requirement: whether the alleged error is \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d We turn to that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Defendant\u2019s merger argument is based both on the text of ORS 161.067 \u2014 the \u201canti-merger statute\u201d \u2014 and on our decision in <em>Flores. </em>In determining whether that argument establishes, beyond reasonable dispute, that the trial court erred, we begin by considering the settled statutory analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">ORS 161.067(1), on which defendant relies, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">\u201cWhen the same conduct or criminal episode violates two or more statutory provisions and each provision requires proof of an element that the others do not, there are as many separately punishable offenses as there are separate statutory violations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Here, the parties agree that defendant committed UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm during a single criminal episode. Moreover, defendant does not dispute that UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm involve separate statutory provisions. Consequently, the only remaining question under ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>161.067(1) is whether \u201ceach provision requires proof of an element that the other [] do[es] not,\u201d so as to prevent merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">For purposes of the merger analysis, \u201c[t]he elements of proof of a criminal offense are controlled by the statute defining the offense, not by the factual circumstances recited in the indictment.\u201d <em>State v. Burris, </em>270 Or App 512, 517, 348 P3d 338 (2015). However, when a statute sets out alternative forms of a single crime, we look to the indictment (and, if necessary, to jury instructions) to determine which form is charged, and we use the elements of the crime as charged in conducting the merger analysis. <em>Id.; see also Flores, </em>259 Or App at 145 n 5 (\u201c[W]e look to the indictment or jury instruction to determine which form of the crime is relevant for purposes of merger.\u201d). Finally, and as pertinent here, when the state charges a defendant with an aggravated form of a felony based on an allegation that the defendant used or threatened to use a firearm during the commission of that crime, the \u201cwith a firearm\u201d allegation is an element of the crime for merger purposes. <em>Id. </em>at 148. That is, ORS 161.610 \u2014 the \u201cgun minimum\u201d statute\u2014 not only requires the trial court to impose a particular minimum sentence on a defendant who is convicted of having used or threatened to use a firearm during the commission of a felony, it creates a new, aggravated form of the underlying felony, one element of which is the use or threatened use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">In this case, the elements of UUW-firearm, as charged by the state and explained in the jury instructions, are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">(1) the act occurred on or about November 10, 2012;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">(2) defendant carried and possessed a dangerous or deadly weapon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">(3) defendant intended to use unlawfully the weapon against another person; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">(4) defendant personally used or threatened to use a firearm during the commission of this crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number><em>See </em>ORS 166.220 (defining the crime ofUUW)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; ORS 161.610 (defining the \u201cwith a firearm\u201d aggravating element).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The elements of FIP-firearm, as charged by the state and explained in the jury instructions are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">(1) the act occurred on or about November 10, 2012;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">(2) defendant had been previously convicted of a felony under the laws of Oregon;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">(3) defendant knowingly had in his possession, custody and control a firearm; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">(4) defendant personally used or threatened to use a firearm during the commission of this crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-9\"><em>See </em>ORS 166.270 (defining crime of FIP);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 166.610.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">In his argument to this court, defendant does not engage in a point-by-point comparison of the elements of those two crimes. Instead, he relies solely on <em>Flores </em>to argue that, because UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm were charged similarly in this case as they were in <em>Flores, </em>the merger holding in <em>Flores </em>necessarily applies here. For the reasons that follow, we do not find defendant\u2019s Flores-based conclusion to be \u201cobvious, not reasonably in dispute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>We first observe that FIP-firearm includes an element that UUW-firearm does not: that the defendant was previously convicted of a felony. The remaining question is whether UUW-firearm includes an element that FIP-firearm does not. In arguing that it does, the state focuses on the fact that \u2014 as UUW-firearm was charged here \u2014 defendant could be convicted of that crime only if the state proved that he \u201cintended to use unlawfully the weapon against another person.\u201d The state contends that intent to use the weapon (here, the firearm) <em>unlawfully against another person </em>is not an element of FIP-firearm, which (because of the \u201cwith a firearm\u201d allegation) requires the state to prove only that the defendant used or threatened to use the firearm. According to the state, a felon could use or threaten to use a firearm during the commission of a crime \u2014 and, therefore, be guilty of FIP-firearm \u2014 without intending to use the weapon both unlawfully and against another person in a way that would also make the person guilty of UUW-firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">At least for purposes of our plain-error analysis, we agree with the state. In the context of the gun-minimum statute, the legislature intended the phrase \u201c'use or threatened use\u2019 of a firearm * * * to refer to discharge or threatened discharge.\u201d <em>State v. Harris, </em>174 Or App 105, 112, 25 P3d 404 (2001). The state posits several hypothetical situations in which, it argues, a person could use or threaten to use a firearm by discharging it without also intending to use the firearm unlawfully and against another person. For example, the state asserts, a convicted felon who fired a pistol at a paper target while he or she was at a gun range could be convicted of FIP-firearm because the person both possessed the firearm and personally discharged it. However, those facts would not establish, by themselves, that the person also intended to use the gun unlawfully <em>against another person. </em>Accordingly, the state contends, although the person could be convicted of FIP-firearm on those facts, the evidence would not support a conviction for UUW-firearm, which \u2014 as charged here \u2014 includes the additional element of intent \u201cto use unlawfully the weapon against another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">That hypothetical set of facts supports a plausible argument that the crimes of UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>do not always merge, because each may include an element that the other does not. Our holding in <em>Flores </em>does not definitively defeat that argument. In <em>Flores, </em>the state argued against merger of UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm primarily on the theory that the \u201cwith a firearm\u201d allegation associated with each crime was not an element to be taken into account in the merger analysis. We rejected that argument and, therefore, held that the guilty verdicts for those crimes should have merged. 259 Or App at 146-48.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But in <em>Flores, </em>the state did not meaningfully develop the argument that it does here: that, even if \u201cwith a firearm\u201d is an element of each crime, the guilty verdicts still do not merge because each crime includes <em>another </em>element that the other crime does not. Moreover, our opinion in <em>Flores </em>did not address such a theory; that is, we did not analyze whether a person\u2019s use or threatened use of a firearm in conjunction with a crime, for purposes of ORS 161.610(2) (the \u201cgun minimum\u201d statute), necessarily encompasses an intent to use a firearm <em>unlawfully against another person, </em>for purposes of UUW as defined by ORS 166.220(1)(a). That is, we did not engage in the element-by-element comparison contemplated by ORS 161.067.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Because the state has presented a plausible argument that UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm, as charged here, each includes an element that the other does not, and because <em>Flores </em>did not address such a theory, we conclude that it is not \u201cobvious, beyond reasonable dispute\u201d that the guilty verdicts for UUW-firearm and FIP-firearm merge in this case. In other words, defendant has not established that the trial court plainly erred by not merging those guilty verdicts into a single conviction. We reject his argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">We reach a different conclusion, however, with respect to defendant\u2019s second assignment of error, in which he challenges the trial court\u2019s requirement that he pay $1,600 in court-appointed attorney fees pursuant to ORS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>161.665. Although defendant did not object at trial to the imposition of that requirement, he contends that the trial court plainly erred by ordering him to pay the fees \u201cin the absence of evidence in the record of his ability to pay those fees.\u201d Defendant is correct. ORS 161.665(4) provides that a court may not enter a judgment requiring a defendant to pay costs, including court-appointed attorney fees, \u201cunless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d A trial court plainly errs by requiring a defendant to pay attorney fees when the record \u201cis silent as to [the] defendant\u2019s ability to pay the attorney fees ordered.\u201d <em>State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">In this case, as the state concedes, the record includes no information about defendant\u2019s financial resources (other than his application for court-appointed counsel), his employment history, or his ability to work. Accordingly, the trial court plainly erred by requiring defendant to repay $1,600 in court-appointed attorney fees. We conclude that this is an appropriate case in which to exercise our discretion to correct the unpreserved claim of error, given the significant amount of fees required to be paid and the many years for which defendant will be incarcerated on these convictions. <em>See id. </em>at 716-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay court-appointed attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b154-11\"> ORS 166.220 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-12\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of [UUW] if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-13\">\u201c(a) Attempts to use unlawfully against another, or carries or possesses with intent to use unlawfully against another, any dangerous or deadly weapon as defined in ORS 161.015 [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b154-14\"> ORS 161.610 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-15\">\u201c(2) The use or threatened use of a firearm, whether operable or inoperable, by a defendant during the commission of a felony may be pleaded in the accusatory instrument and proved at trial as an element in aggravation of the crime as provided in this section.
