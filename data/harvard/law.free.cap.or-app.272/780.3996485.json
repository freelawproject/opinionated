We reject without written discussion defendant\u2019s first and second assignments of error and write only to address his third assignment, which challenges the trial court\u2019s imposition of a $60 \u201cmandatory state amount\u201d for each conviction. Defendant points out that the trial court imposed fines of $500 or $250 for each conviction, as allowed by ORS 153.633, and argues that there is no statutory authority to separately impose additional fines.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that the $60 \u201cmandatory state amount\u201d fees were imposed in error.
