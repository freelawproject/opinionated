Williams, </em>357 Or 1, 346 P3d 455 (2015). Defendant was charged with first-degree theft, first-degree forgery, and first-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument. At trial, defendant opposed, under OEC 404(3), the admission of evidence of his prior convictions. The trial court admitted that evidence for the purpose of demonstrating that defendant had knowledge that the checks he had cashed were forged. Following <em>Williams, </em>we conclude that the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence but remand to correct an error in imposing a sentence that exceeded the maximum permitted by law. OAR 213-005-0002(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The facts are primarily procedural and are undisputed. Defendant attempted to cash a number of falsified checks made payable to him.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He was arrested, questioned, and charged with first-degree theft, ORS 164.055, first-degree forgery, ORS 165.013, and first-degree criminal possession of a forged instrument, ORS 165.022.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">At trial, defendant denied knowing that the checks were \u201cbad\u201d and contended that he had been unwittingly induced to cash them. In response, the state tendered direct and indirect evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions. An officer began to recount his interview with defendant and explain that his knowledge of defendant\u2019s forgery convictions influenced how he questioned defendant. The state eventually proffered copies of defendant\u2019s judgments of conviction for theft, forgery, identity theft, and possession of a forged instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Defendant objected to the evidence and requested a hearing to determine admissibility under <em>State v. Johns, </em>301 Or 535, 555, 725 P2d 312 (1986) (setting forth case-by-case considerations for the admissibility of prior bad acts evidence). He argued that, under <em>Johns, </em>the state had not established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>the similarity between defendant\u2019s prior convictions and the charges at issue. He added that, under OEC 403, the evidence should not be admissible, because the \u201cprejudice substantially outweighs any small bit of probative value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The trial court deemed a <em>Johns </em>hearing unnecessary and ruled that the evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions was admissible for the purpose of establishing \u201cguilty knowledge.\u201d The trial court considered OEC 403, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">\u201cThe second part of it is the weighing issue, and I want to be clear that I have done the weighing, and that the probative value is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice. * * * Because of the difficulty in proving knowledge, what\u2019s going on in somebody\u2019s mind is so difficult, the evidence is necessary in order to establish that particular- \u2014 \u2022 or to disprove that particular position. And since the state has to prove that it was done with knowledge, the probative value was substantial in this particular case on that issue.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">The officer went on to testify that he knew that defendant had been arrested in previous cases \u201cfor multiple counts of forgery, identity theft, and theft.\u201d When the officer had questioned defendant, the officer had confronted defendant with the prior arrests and suggested to him that \u201cit\u2019s unlikely that a person associated with [that criminal] experience in fraud and theft would not have known what was going on.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Later, the court admitted certified copies of defendant\u2019s judgments of conviction for a number of forgery, theft, and identity theft offenses, exhibits numbered 30, 31, 32, 33, 35, and 36.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>The trial court gave a limiting instruction that the jury should not infer that prior convictions make it \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that defendant was guilty of the offenses at issue at trial and that the jury \u201ccannot use it for that purpose.\u201d The court explained that it admitted the evidence \u201conly as it applies to [defendant\u2019s] guilty knowledge in this particular case, and that is the only purpose for which they will be admitted.\u201d The jury found defendant guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">On appeal, defendant first assigns error to the admission of the six convictions. Second, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to offer an instruction consistent with <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>352 Or 172, 282 P3d 857, <em>adh'd to as modified on recons, </em>352 Or 622, 292 P3d 522 (2012), that the jury could not consider defendant\u2019s prior convictions as evidence of defendant\u2019s mental state until first finding that defendant had committed the <em>actus reus </em>of forgery. Lastly, defendant questions the length of his sentence and imposition of attorney fees. We take each issue in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">After defendant submitted his brief for our review, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>Williams, </em>altering the analytical framework for consideration of evidence of \u201cother bad acts\u201d in criminal cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 357 Or at 3. In <em>Williams, </em>the defendant was charged with two counts of first-degree sexual abuse. The state offered evidence of the defendant\u2019s possession of two pairs of children\u2019s underwear for the purpose of establishing that the defendant \u201chad touched the victim with a sexual purpose rather than accidentally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The trial court admitted that evidence under OEC 404(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant had argued that the evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>inadmissible because it was not relevant under OEC 401 and because it was unfairly prejudicial under OEC 403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">On review, the court addressed the relationship between OEC 404(3) and OEC 404(4) and, in turn, the relationship between OEC 404(4) and OEC 403.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court determined that, \u201c[f]rom the text, context, and legislative history of OEC 404(4), * * * the legislature intended OEC 404(4) to supersede OEC 404(3) in criminal cases, except, of course, as otherwise provided by the state or federal constitutions.\u201d 357 Or at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The court reached <em>\u201ca </em>different conclusion with respect to the relationship between OEC 404(4) and OEC 403[.]\u201d 357 Or at 15. The court concluded that, when a trial court admits \u201cother acts\u201d evidence pursuant to OEC 404(4), the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution requires that the trial court engage in balancing under OEC 403.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> 357 Or at 19. In reviewing the analytical framework, the court recited that \u201cother acts\u201d evidence is admissible if that evidence is relevant under OEC 401 and survives scrutiny when comparing probative value and unfair prejudice under OEC 403. The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">\u201c[w]hen a party objects, under OEC 403, to \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence offered under OEC 404(4), a trial court must engage in the balancing anticipated by OEC 403. At one end of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>spectrum, \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence that is offered for nonpropensity <em>purposes </em>\u2014 i.e., to prove motive, intent, identity, or lack of mistake or accident \u2014 generally will be admissible as long as the particular facts of the case do not demonstrate a risk of unfair prejudice that outweighs the probative value of the evidence. At the other end of the spectrum, * * * when \u2018other acts\u2019 evidence \u2018goes only to character and there are <em>no </em>permissible inferences the jury may draw from it,\u2019 it is more likely that the evidence will be excluded. Such evidence generally will have little or no cognizable probative value, and the risk that the jury may conclude improperly that the defendant had acted in accordance with past acts on the occasion of the charged crime will be substantial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">357 Or at 19-20 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis in original). The court did not consider whether the trial court erred in applying OEC 403, because the defendant did not raise that issue on appeal. 357 Or at 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">In light of <em>Williams, </em>defendant here filed a supplemental brief contending that the trial court abused its discretion in failing to properly engage in OEC 403 balancing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the trial court was required to \u201cengage in a four-step balancing process\u201d under OEC 403, as described in <em>State v. Mayfield, </em>302 Or 631, 645, 733 P2d 438 (1987) (outlining \u201cfour steps\u201d for when a trial judge makes an OEC 403 ruling). Defendant asserts that the trial court \u201cdid not properly assess the probative value of the evidence\u201d and \u201cfailed to consider the prejudice to defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The state responds that the trial court\u2019s ruling was consistent with the framework set out in <em>Williams. </em>The state argues that the Supreme Court did not reach whether the trial court in <em>Williams </em>erred in its ruling under OEC 403 and therefore \u201cleft open whether due process balancing differs from traditional balancing.\u201d Unlike defendant, the state believes that the analytical framework for admissibility of \u201cother acts\u201d evidence imposes a narrower \u201cdue process balancing\u201d rather than customary balancing under OEC 403. The state urges that \u201c[a] due process violation occurs only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>when the prejudicial effect of evidence so outweighs its probative value as to render the defendant\u2019s trial fundamentally unfair.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">As we explain below, we conclude that the trial court did not err in its application of OEC 403 in light of <em>Williams. </em>Although the state argues that a unique \u201cdue process\u201d standard governs balancing when \u201cother act\u201d evidence is considered, we need not decide that issue in this case. In <em>Williams, </em>the court observed, \u201cGiven the result that we reach in this case \u2014 that the trial court correctly admitted the underwear evidence under \u2018traditional\u2019 or \u2018subconstitutional\u2019 balancing\u2014 we need not further explore the parties\u2019 arguments about whether \u2018due process\u2019 balancing differs from \u2018traditional\u2019 or \u2018subconstitutional\u2019 balancing.\u201d 357 Or at 19 n 17. Similarly, in this case, the trial court engaged in \u201ctraditional\u201d OEC 403 balancing of defendant\u2019s prior convictions. As in <em>Williams, </em>the trial court \u201cdid not make a distinction between \u2018due-process,\u2019 and \u2018traditional,\u2019 or \u2018subconstitutional,\u2019 balancing, and we leave the significance of those distinctions, if any, to another day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For the reasons that follow, we ultimately conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in its \u201ctraditional\u201d balancing under OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Applying OEC 403, the court first considers why the evidence was relevant. As the court explained in <em>Williams, </em>\u201c\u2018other acts\u2019 evidence that is offered for nonpropensity pur<em>poses </em>\u2014 i.e., to prove motive, intent, identity, or lack of mistake or accident \u2014 generally will be admissible as long as the particular facts of the case do not demonstrate a risk of unfair prejudice that outweighs the probative value of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 19. Here, the trial court explained that the evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions was offered for a nonpropensity purpose. Defendant did not dispute that the checks were forged or that he was the individual who attempted to cash them. Rather, defendant contended that, because he did not know he possessed forged instruments, he lacked the requisite mental state to commit the charged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>offenses. To refute that contention, the state offered evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions. That evidence was relevant to show that defendant had not made a mistake or otherwise lacked knowledge of the status of the checks at the time he attempted to cash them.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Second, OEC 403 requires the court to consider the probative value of the evidence. A trial court may consider the proponent\u2019s need for the proffered evidence, how likely it was that the defendant committed the \u201cother act\u201d at issue, the relative strength or weakness of the evidence as a whole, and the similarity between the other act and the offenses at issue. <em>Cf. Johns, </em>301 Or at 555 (discussing such considerations under the rubric of OEC 404(3)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In this case, the trial court indicated that, on balance, the probative value was \u201csubstantial.\u201d The court found that the need for the proffered evidence was significant \u201c[b]ecause of the difficulty in proving knowledge\u201d and because \u201cthe evidence is necessary\u201d to establish defendant\u2019s mental state, a central issue in the case. The other acts evidence was presented reliably in the form of judgments of conviction. That defendant had committed the other acts was uncontroverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Finally, OEC 403 requires the trial court to consider how substantial is the risk of unfair prejudice. A \u201ctrial court may consider whether other evidence that does not carry the same risk of unfair prejudice is available to prove an element of the charged crime.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>357 Or at 22 n 21. And, a trial court may consider the effectiveness of a limiting instruction to minimize the risk of prejudice. Evidence is unfairly \u201cprejudicial if it invites the jury to resolve the case on the improper basis that the defendant is a bad person.\u201d <em>Johns, </em>301 Or at 558. It is a risk \u201cthat the jury may conclude improperly that the defendant had acted in accordance with past acts on the occasion of the charged crime.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>357 Or at 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In this case, the evidence of defendant\u2019s prior convictions was potentially prejudicial to the extent that it demonstrated a pattern of similar offenses and presented a risk that jurors would conclude that defendant had acted in accordance with his past acts. That risk, however, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>mitigated by the court\u2019s limiting instruction that the jury should not infer that prior convictions make it \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that defendant was guilty of the offenses at issue at trial and that the jury could not consider the other acts evidence for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Although the trial court would seem to have properly applied OEC 403, defendant insists that the trial court erred in failing to \u201cengage in a four-step balancing process\u201d under <em>Mayfield. </em>302 Or at 645. In <em>Mayfield, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cestablished an \u2018approved method of analysis\u2019 that should guide trial courts in their decision-making under OEC 403.\u201d <em>State v. Borck, </em>230 Or App 619, 637, 216 P3d 915, <em>adh'd to as modified on recons, </em>232 Or App 266, 221 P3d 749 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 291 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Walton, </em>311 Or 223, 235, 809 P2d 81 (1991)). The court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-5\">\u201cthe judge should analyze the quantum of probative value of the evidence and consider the weight or strength of the evidence. In the second step the trial judge must determine how prejudicial the evidence is, to what extent the evidence may distract the jury from the central question whether the defendant committed the charged crime. The third step is the judicial process of balancing the prosecution\u2019s need for the evidence against the countervailing prejudicial danger of unfair prejudice, and the fourth step is for the judge to make his or her ruling to admit all the proponent\u2019s evidence, to exclude all the proponent\u2019s evidence or to admit only part of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-6\"><em>Mayfield, </em>302 Or at 645.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Because <em>Mayfield </em>is a matter of substance, not form or litany, the trial court\u2019s ruling comported with <em>Mayfield. </em>Although the court did not recite a four-step analysis, \u201cthe record establishes that, in deciding to admit [the evidence] , the trial court considered the matters prescribed in <em>Mayfield.\u201d Borck, </em>230 Or App at 637. The court made findings that the probative value was substantial and that it outweighed the prejudice to defendant. The court specified that the evidence was necessary to establish defendant\u2019s mental state and that the evidence was particularly significant in the context of the case. Therefore, \u201c[a]lthough the court\u2019s statements are not extensive, the totality of the attendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>circumstances indicate that the court did engage in the conscious process of balancing the costs of the evidence against its benefits that <em>Mayfield </em>requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638 (internal quotation marks omitted). Also, the trial court did not admit the evidence \u201cwholesale and indiscriminately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court excluded evidence of defendant\u2019s prior drug-related conviction and offered a limiting instruction admonishing the jury not to consider the evidence for impermissible purposes. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s determination under OEC 403 was within the range of legally permissible outcomes. <em>See id. </em>at 638-39 (demonstrating a determination within the range of permissible outcomes). The court did not err in admitting the evidence of prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">We turn to defendant\u2019s second issue, asking whether the trial court erred in failing to give a <em>Leistiko </em>jury instruction that would have required the jury to find that defendant had committed the charged act before considering the prior acts as evidence of his intent. <em>See </em>352 Or at 184. As an initial matter, we agree with the state that, in the absence of a request for a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction, defendant\u2019s argument that he was entitled to that instruction is unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Defendant requests alternatively that we review for plain error. The state rejoins that the trial court did not plainly err, because the <em>Leistiko </em>limiting instruction was not required in this case. Among other things, the state contends that a precondition of a <em>Leistiko </em>limiting instruction is that the defendant does not admit the charged acts. The state argues that there was no dispute that defendant committed the <em>actus reus </em>of the offenses at issue and, therefore, defendant lacked a basis for the instruction in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">We may review an unpreserved assignment of error as \u201can error of law apparent on the record\u201d under ORAP 5.45(1) if certain conditions are met: (1) the error is one of law; (2) the error is \u201capparent\u201d \u2014 that is, the legal point is obvious and is not reasonably in dispute; and (3) the error appears \u201con the face of the record\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201c [w] e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Even where an error meets those criteria, the decision to review the error remains in our discretion. <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 383, 823 P2d 956 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In this case, we conclude, for the reason the state asserts, that the trial court\u2019s failure to offer a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction is not plain. There was no dispute that defendant acted to cash the checks. In addition, <em>Leistiko </em>is founded on OEC 404(3), a provision that <em>Williams </em>re-evaluated. Although we express no opinion as to the continued vitality of <em>Leistiko, </em>it suffices to say that the failure to give a <em>Leistiko </em>instruction <em>sua sponte </em>was not plain error. <em>State v. Horner, </em>272 Or App 355, 356 P3d 111 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Finally, we address defendant\u2019s assignments of error relating to matters of sentencing. Defendant acknowledges that the issues are unpreserved, but he argues that the trial court plainly erred in imposing 60 months of imprisonment in addition to 12 months of post-prison supervision (PPS), exceeding the maximum allowable by law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> OAR 213-005-0002(4) (where the incarceration term, together with the PPS term, exceed the statutory maximum, rule requires that \u201cthe sentencing judge * * * first reduce the duration of post-prison supervision to the extent necessary to conform the total sentence length to the statutory maximum\u201d). The state concedes that the sentence was unlawful and that the court plainly erred in imposing an unlawfully excessive sentence. We agree with defendant, accept the state\u2019s concession, and, for the reasons stated in <em>State v. Ramos, </em>254 Or App 748, 749, 295 P3d 176 (2013), exercise our discretion to correct the error. Because we must remand for resentencing on that basis, it is unnecessary to address defendant\u2019s remaining argument that the trial court plainly erred in imposing $600 in attorney fees without first determining whether he had the ability to pay. That issue can be resolved at resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-8\"> Evidence adduced at trial included security camera footage of defendant presenting and cashing forged checks. That the checks were forged was uncontroverted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-7\"> The officer recalled that defendant continued to deny knowledge of bad checks but began by commenting, \u201cI\u2019m screwed either way.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> Exhibit 30 was a judgment of conviction in 1997 for first-degree theft, including the court\u2019s finding that \u201cdefendant was part of a criminal operation to steal, wash, forge and cash checks.\u201d Exhibit 31 was a judgment of conviction in 1997 for first-degree forgery.
