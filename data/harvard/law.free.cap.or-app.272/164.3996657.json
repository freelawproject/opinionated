In 2007, however, a trial court reduced the felony to a misdemeanor offense. Thus, defendant contends, when he possessed a firearm in 2012, which was the basis for the charge of felon in possession of a firearm with a firearm, he was not a felon for the purposes of the conviction, and the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. The state concedes the error, and we accept the concession.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Felon in possession of a firearm with a firearm conviction reversed; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-6\"> Defendant was also convicted of several other counts \u2014 first- and second-degree robbery, reckless driving, and attempting to elude an officer \u2014 not at issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> Defendant also raises, in a <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief, other assignments of error, which we reject without further written discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\"> OES 166.270(3)(a) provides that a felony conviction \u201cshall not be deemed a conviction of a felony if *** [t]he court declared the conviction to be a misdemeanor <em>at the time of judgment\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In <em>State v. Stark, </em>354 Or 1, 17, 307 P3d 418 (2013), the Supreme Court interpreted the phrase \u201cat the time of judgment\u201d to mean \u201cthe time of the judgment of conviction that was in effect at the time of the alleged firearm possession.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
