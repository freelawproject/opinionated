J.</author>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">In this criminal case, defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment convicting him of one count of driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII), ORS 813.010. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence that a sheriffs deputy obtained after following defendant onto farm property owned by defendant\u2019s father. Defendant argues that the deputy\u2019s entry onto the property violated Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As explained below, the trial court erred in its analysis of whether the deputy\u2019s entry violated Article I, section 9, because it failed to determine whether the state carried its burden of proving that a reasonable person would have believed that he or she could enter the private farm property without permission, as the deputy did. Therefore, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We review the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress for errors of law, and we are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implicit findings of fact, provided there is constitutionally sufficient evidence in the record to support the findings. <em>State v. Ehly, </em>317 Or 66, 75, 854 P2d 421 (1993); <em>State v. Tegland, </em>269 Or App 1, 3, 344 P3d 63 (2015). Stated in accordance with that standard, the relevant facts are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">On the night of the incident for which defendant was charged, a sheriffs deputy was on patrol in a rural area where there had been three reported burglaries in the preceding weeks. The burglaries involved, among other things, the theft of gas, tools, and batteries from vehicles. At approximately 11:00 p.m., the deputy saw a truck, which defendant was driving, and began following it. Neither the truck nor defendant was associated with the reported burglaries. The deputy testified that he \u201cprobably would have followed any vehicle * * * for an amount of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The deputy followed defendant for approximately one mile and he did not see defendant commit any traffic violations. Defendant then turned onto a farm property. The deputy followed defendant onto the farm property \u201csimply to ask why [defendant was] there.\u201d The property was fenced, but there were two driveways to the property from the road on which defendant and the deputy had been driving, and the driveways were not gated. There were barns on the property, and there was a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign on the side of the barn closest to the driveway that defendant and the deputy used.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Defendant parked near a gas pump which was directly underneath a large security light. The deputy parked his patrol car behind defendant\u2019s truck but did not block the truck. Defendant got out of his truck, and, immediately thereafter, the deputy got out of his patrol car. The deputy then saw defendant walk \u201cdown the driver\u2019s side of the [truck], leaning against [it].\u201d It appeared to the deputy that \u201cthere was some reason that [defendant] needed to use the truck for balance \u2014 maybe to correct his balance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The deputy asked why defendant was on the farm property, and defendant answered that it was his family\u2019s farm and he was there to get gas. The deputy continued his conversation with defendant and noticed that defendant smelled of alcohol and his speech was slurred. Based on those observations, the deputy began investigating defendant for DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Defendant\u2019s father is the current owner of the farm property, and his family has owned the property for approximately 20 years. At the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, defendant\u2019s father testified that, in addition to the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign on the barn, there are other \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs posted throughout the property, including \u201cone at the driveway entrance.\u201d Defendant\u2019s father also testified that the family had posted the signs and fenced the property in order to exclude the public. One reason the family posted the signs was because there is a lake on the property and they wanted to restrict access to the lake for safety and insurance reasons. Defendant\u2019s father also noted that there is a culvert around the front of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The deputy testified that he believes he has the authority to enter property on which \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs are posted if he has a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity on the property. When asked why he followed defendant onto the farm property, the deputy testified that, \u201cin fairness to the property owner, it \u2014 it\u2019s almost my responsibility to go and check, because *** of the time of night, * * * the area that [the truck] came from and went to[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">At the close of the hearing, defendant argued that the deputy did not have reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant was engaged in criminal activity; he contended that, \u201c[a] 11 [the deputy] knows is there\u2019s a car out in the country, it\u2019s late at night, pulls onto a piece of property, posted No Trespassing, and decides to enter and inquire.\u201d Defendant further argued that the deputy could not enter the property unless he did so pursuant to a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement because the property was \u201cposted with an intent to exclude the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">For its part, the state argued that the deputy\u2019s entry onto the farm property did not constitute an \u201cinvasion of privacy.\u201d The state also argued that the deputy\u2019s encounter with defendant did not become a stop until the deputy had reasonable suspicion to believe that defendant had committed DUII.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, ruling that the deputy\u2019s entry onto the farm property was lawful because the deputy had \u201csome reasonable suspicion\u201d to justify contacting defendant \u201c[e]ven on private property.\u201d The trial court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">\u201cI think the trespass signs are * * * kind of a red herring. *** I\u2019m also not completely sure that the No Trespass signs, under these circumstances, then, would exclude a law enforcement officer, who has this reason to go onto the property. It\u2019s not probable cause. In fact, one might actually argue he has a duty to go onto the property, to at least look into this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The trial court further ruled that the deputy\u2019s actions on the farm property did not constitute a stop until the deputy had developed reasonable suspicion to initiate a DUII investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>After the trial court denied his motion, defendant entered a conditional guilty plea, reserving his right to appeal the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion. <em>See </em>ORS 135.335(3) (a defendant may enter a conditional guilty plea to reserve the right to appeal an adverse determination on a pretrial motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">On appeal, defendant renews his argument that, by entering the farm property, the deputy violated Article I, section 9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant does not dispute the legality of the actions the deputy took after entering the property; he does not challenge the trial court\u2019s ruling that, after entering the property, the deputy did not stop defendant until he had reasonable suspicion that defendant had driven under the influence of intoxicants. Thus, the only issue on appeal is whether the deputy violated Article I, section 9, by entering the farm property.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The state argues that the deputy did not violate Article I, section 9, by entering the farm property. But the state does not defend the trial court\u2019s reasoning. Instead, the state asks us to affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling for an alternative reason. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (an appellate court may affirm for an alternative reason when (1) the evidentiary record is sufficient to support the alternative basis, (2) the alternative basis is legally correct, and (3) the reasons for the trial court\u2019s decision are either erroneous or unnecessary in light of the alternative basis for affirmance).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The state recognizes that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs were not a \u201cred herring.\u201d If a person manifests an intention to exclude the public from private property outside the curtilage of a residence by, for example, posting signs or erecting fences, a law enforcement officer cannot enter the property based solely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>on reasonable suspicion; the officer\u2019s entry must be justified by a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement. <em>State v. Dixson/Digby, </em>307 Or 195, 212, 766 P2d 1015 (1988) (\u201c[I]f land is fenced, posted or otherwise closed off, one does not enter it without permission or, in the officers\u2019 situation, permission or a warrant.\u201d). As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Dixson/Digby, </em>for the purposes of Article I, section 9, a person has a protected privacy interest in property outside the curtilage of a residence if the person manifests an intention to exclude the public from the property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-3\">\u201cAn individual\u2019s privacy interest in land he or she has left unimproved and unbounded is not sufficient to trigger the protections of Article I, section 9. Thus, it is not sufficient that the property in question is privately owned, or that it is shielded from view by vegetation or topographical barriers, because those features do not necessarily indicate the owner\u2019s intention that the property be kept private. A person who wishes to preserve a constitutionally protected privacy interest in land outside the curtilage must manifest an intention to exclude the public by erecting barriers to entry, such as fences, or by posting signs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 211-12. In this case, if defendant\u2019s family manifested an intention to exclude the public from the farm property, then the deputy could not enter the property unless he did so pursuant to a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement. Thus, contrary to the trial court\u2019s reasoning, the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs were not a \u201cred herring\u201d because, if the signs adequately manifested an intent to exclude the public, then the deputy could not enter the property based solely on \u201csome reasonable suspicion\u201d of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Because the trial court\u2019s reasoning was erroneous, we turn to the state\u2019s proffered alternative basis for affirmance, that defendant did not have a protected privacy interest in the farm property because his family had not taken sufficient steps to exclude the public from the farm property.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>The state, as the proponent of the evidence that resulted from the deputy\u2019s warrantless entry onto private property, bore the burden of proving that defendant lacked a protected privacy interest in the property. <em>See State v. Tucker, </em>330 Or 85, 88-89, 997 P2d 182 (2000) (\u201c[I]n the context of a warrantless search, a defendant is not required to assert a protected property or privacy interest on which the state intruded.\u201d); <em>State v. Knox, </em>160 Or App 668, 673, 984 P2d 294, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 527 (1999) (\u201c[T]he state has the burden of proving the negative proposition that no interest of the defendant\u2019s was involved.\u201d); <em>see also </em>ORS 133.693(4) (\u201cWhere the motion to suppress challenges evidence seized as the result of a warrantless search, the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the validity of the search is on the prosecution.\u201d). As we explained in <em>State v. Howard/Dawson, </em>204 Or App 438, 441, 129 P3d 792 (2006), <em>aff'd, </em>342 Or 635, 157 P3d 1189 (2007), when a defendant moves to suppress evidence on the ground that the evidence is the result of a warrantless search by government officials, the state must demonstrate that the government officials\u2019 actions did not violate Article I, section 9. \u201cThe state can meet that burden in either or both of two ways.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, \u201cthe state can show that a defendant had no protected privacy or possessory interest in the property\u201d or \u201cthat the circumstances of the search *** fit within an exception to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441-42; <em>see also State v. Galloway, </em>198 Or App 585, 591, 109 P3d 383 (2005) (the state bore the burden of proving that the defendants lacked a protected privacy interest in their garbage). Here, the state\u2019s only claim is that defendant did not have a protected privacy interest in the farm property; the state does not argue that the deputy\u2019s entry onto the property was justified by an exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Whether a property owner or occupant has manifested an intention to exclude the public from property outside the curtilage of a residence depends on the particular actions that the owner or occupant has taken. <em>See State v. McIntyre/Pereira, </em>123 Or App 436, 440, 860 P2d 299 (1993), <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 351 (1994) (\u201c[C]ourts must consider all surrounding circumstances *** to determine the residents\u2019 intent.\u201d). As mentioned, a person can \u201cpreserve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>a constitutionally protected privacy interest in land outside the curtilage\u201d of a residence by taking steps to exclude the public from the property. <em>Dixson/Digby, </em>307 Or at 211. Those steps may include posting signs and erecting fences. <em>Id. </em>at 212. Whether such steps are sufficient to give a reasonable person notice that entry onto the property is prohibited depends upon, among other things, the nature of the property and the characteristics and locations of the signs and fencing. <em>See State v. Roper, </em>254 Or App 197, 202, 294 P3d 517 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 714 (2013) (\u201cWhether the signs on an individual\u2019s property are sufficient to manifest intent to exclude the public depends on the factual circumstances in each case. For example: How far are the signs from the entrance to the property? How large is the type on the signs? Were the signs obvious or obscured? Did the officers notice the signs? Did the officers look for the signs?\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">For example, in <em>Roper, </em>we held that the defendant had excluded the public from his property, including his driveway, by fencing the property and posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs on, and adjacent to, a gate across the driveway to the property. 254 Or App at 201-02. Based on that holding, we further held that law enforcement officers who drove down the property\u2019s driveway violated the defendant\u2019s Article I, section 9, rights, even though the gate to the driveway was open. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In contrast, in <em>State v. Gorham, </em>121 Or App 347, 349, 353, 854 P2d 971, <em>modified on recons, </em>123 Or App 582, 859 P2d 1201, <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 171 (1993), we held that the defendant, who had posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d and \u201cNo Hunting\u201d signs on trees in a fenced field adjacent to his driveway, had not restricted public access to the driveway. Therefore, we concluded, it was not a violation of Article I, section 9, for law enforcement officers to drive down the driveway.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>In this case, defendant argued that his family had manifested an intention to exclude the public from the farm property by fencing it and posting \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs, but the trial court, when analyzing the legality of the deputy\u2019s entry onto the property, focused only on whether the deputy had reasonable suspicion that defendant was engaged in criminal activity. As a consequence, the trial court did not make factual findings regarding the characteristics of the property, including its fencing and signage. For example, it did not make any findings regarding the size and legibility of the \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign on the barn, nor did it make any findings regarding the locations of the other signs that defendant\u2019s father mentioned, including the one at \u201cthe driveway entrance.\u201d Such factual findings \u2014 which are relevant to whether the state carried its burden of proving that an objectively reasonable member of the public would have believed that he or she could enter the private farm property without permission, as the deputy did \u2014 are for the trial court to make in the first instance. <em>McIntyre, </em>123 Or App at 441 (trial courts are required to make factual findings relevant to whether an officer\u2019s entry onto private property was legal). Therefore, we must reverse and remand for further proceedings. <em>See State v. Cruz-Renteria, </em>250 Or App 585, 586, 280 P3d 1065 (2012) (where a defendant\u2019s conditional guilty plea is predicated on a suppression ruling that was erroneous in part, appellate court must reverse and remand for further proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> Article I, section 9 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-8\">\u201cNo law shall violate the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable search, or seizure; and no warrant shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath, or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the person or thing to be seized.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b396-7\"> In his brief, defendant mentions the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but, because his arguments are based solely on Article I, section 9, we consider only whether Article I, section 9, requires suppression. <em>See State v. Kinkade, </em>247 Or App 595, 599 n 1, 270 P3d 371 (2012) (declining to address Fourth Amendment claim where the defendant made a \u201cpassing reference in his opening brief to the Fourth Amendment\u201d but did not develop a \u201cseparate argument under the federal constitution\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b397-6\"> In the trial court, the state did not dispute that defendant had an interest in the farm property. As the state acknowledges in its brief, \u201cit did not raise an issue regarding whether defendant lived with his family or had any interest in the property\u201d and, as a result, the state \u201cdoes not raise an issue regarding defendant\u2019s interest in the property\u201d on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b399-5\"> <em>See also State ex rel Juv.
