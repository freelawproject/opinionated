We conclude, however, that the state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that termination was in the best interest of the child. Accordingly, we reverse the termination of mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">At the time of the termination trial, J was not quite 10 years old. The juvenile court has asserted dependency jurisdiction over J multiple times since 2009. Most recently, the court asserted jurisdiction in December 2013, and J was placed in nonrelative foster care. J told his caseworker that, if he cannot live with mother, he would like to live with his adult sister. About three weeks before trial, the Department of Human Services (DHS) changed J\u2019s placement to family foster care with that sister. Three weeks was not enough time, however, for the state to evaluate the sister as a permanent adoptive placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On appeal, mother contends that the record does not establish a factual basis for termination or that termination is in the best interest of the child. The factual basis for the termination of parental rights, \u201cunless admitted, must be established by clear and convincing evidence!.]\u201d ORS 419B.521(1). To be clear and convincing, the evidence must make \u201cthe existence of a fact \u2018highly probable\u2019\u201d or be of \u201c\u2018extraordinary persuasiveness.\u2019\u201d <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. A. M. P., </em>212 Or App 94, 104, 157 P3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>283 (2007) (quoting <em>State ex rel Dept. of Human Services v. Hinds, </em>191 Or App 78, 84, 81 P3d 99 (2003)). On <em>de novo </em>review of the record, we conclude that the evidence identified in the state\u2019s brief establishes by clear and convincing evidence the grounds for termination under ORS 419B.504. Further discussion of that evidence would not benefit the bench, bar, or parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Determining whether mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated, however, requires an additional consideration \u2014 the best interest of the child. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.500 (\u201cThe parental rights of the parents of a ward may be terminated as provided in this section and ORS 419B.502 to 419B.524, only upon a petition filed by the state or the ward for the purpose of freeing the ward for adoption if the court finds it is in the best interest of the ward.\u201d). As the Supreme Court has explained, termination requires a two-stage analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u201cThe first stage focuses on the conduct of a parent, i.e., the alleged statutory grounds for termination. The second stage focuses on whether the best interests of the child will be served by termination. In a termination proceeding, if a parent\u2019s conduct justifies termination, then the best interests of the child are considered explicitly, and could even then prevent termination from occurring.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\"><em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Beasley, </em>314 Or 444, 451-52, 840 P2d 78 (1992); <em>see also State ex rel SOSCF v. Thomas, </em>170 Or App 383, 396, 12 P3d 537 (2000) (under the two-step analysis, the \u201cbest-interests determination can prevent termination, even if the statutory grounds for termination are established\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Mother argues that the department failed to meet its burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that it is in J\u2019s best interest to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights. We agree. The evidence is not clear and convincing that J\u2019s interests are best served by terminating mother\u2019s parental rights to make way for an adoption at this time. Indeed, given the overwhelming evidence regarding J\u2019s strong attachment to mother, it seems clear that an arrangement that accommodates a continuing relationship with mother would serve J\u2019s best interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Prior to trial, psychologist Dr. Glenna Giesick conducted an evaluation of J and prepared a report. She noted that, during his \u201cParent Attachment Structured Interview,\u201d J identified his mother as the \u201cmost important person in the world.\u201d J\u2019s permanency caseworker, Jose Landin, testified that, when he talked to J about mother, \u201chis eyes would light up, and he always would say the same thing: \u2018I want to be with my mother.\u2019\u201d Landin also testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">\u201cI think the last time when he was placed once more in [nonrelative] foster care, it was very hard for him. He was sad. He cried a lot. I gave him my business card and I told him, \u2018You call me if you need something, if you want to talk about something.\u2019 I would say 90 percent of the phone calls I got from [J] on our voice mail was, \u2018I want my mom.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">We emphasize that the facts establishing mother\u2019s unfitness do not include any abuse of J. Moreover, caseworker Landin testified that he observed a \u201cpositive\u201d and \u201cnurturing relationship\u201d between mother and J during J\u2019s visits with mother. Finally, according to psychologist Giesick, \u201c[t]he risk of not returning [J] to his mother is that he will continue to mourn his loss in an extended manner which could interfere with his ability to attach to another family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">On <em>de novo </em>review of this record, we are not convinced that the state has proved by clear and convincing evidence that it is in J\u2019s best interest to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> The trial court also based termination on a finding that mother failed or neglected to provide for the basic physical and psychological needs of the child for the six months prior to the filing of the petition, ORS 419B.506. The state concedes on appeal that the evidence does not establish this basis for jurisdiction, and we accept that concession as well founded, without further discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
