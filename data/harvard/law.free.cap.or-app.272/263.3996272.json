It subsequently accepted a claim for a combined condition but later denied the claim on the ground that the accepted lumber strain had ceased to be the major contributing cause of the combined condition. Claimant challenged the denial, but the board upheld it. Claimant sought judicial review of the board\u2019s order, contending that, in assessing the continued compensability of the combined condition, the board had made the wrong <em>inquiry </em>\u2014 viz., whether the accepted lumbar strain continued to be the major contributing cause of the disability or need for treatment of the combined condition. He argued that, instead, the proper inquiry was whether his otherwise compensable injury continued to be the major contributing cause of disability or need for treatment of the combined condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">While claimant\u2019s petition for judicial review was pending, claimant died of causes unrelated to his claim, without a surviving spouse or other statutory beneficiary. SAIF moved to dismiss claimant\u2019s petition for review, arguing that no one was entitled to pursue claimant\u2019s claims. The personal representative of claimant\u2019s estate opposed SAIF\u2019s motion and moved to be substituted for claimant on judicial review. In <em>Sather v. SAIF, </em>262 Or App 597, 325 P3d 819 (2014), <em>rev'd, </em>357 Or 122, 347 P3d 326 (2015), we agreed with SAIF, holding that the personal representative of claimant\u2019s estate was not entitled to pursue claimant\u2019s claim for benefits. Accordingly, we denied the personal representative\u2019s motion to be substituted for claimant, and we granted SAIF\u2019s motion to dismiss the proceeding. The Supreme Court reversed our decision, holding that the personal representative of claimant\u2019s estate was entitled to pursue claimant\u2019s claim for benefits and remanding the case to us. <em>Sather v. SAIF, </em>357 Or 122, 142, 347 P3d 326 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Based on the court\u2019s decision, we grant the personal representative\u2019s motion to be substituted for claimant on judicial review, and we deny SAIF\u2019s motion to dismiss the proceeding. We turn to the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Since our decision in <em>Sather, </em>we have held that, in cases such as this one, the board\u2019s task is to determine whether the otherwise compensable injury, as distinguished from the accepted conditions, has ceased to be the major contributing cause of the worker\u2019s disability or need for treatment for an accepted combined condition. <em>See Brown v. SAIF, </em>262 Or App 640, 645-56, 325 P3d 834, <em>rev allowed, </em>356 Or 397 (2014) (so holding). Therefore, we reverse and remand this case to the board to make that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Personal representative\u2019s substitution motion granted; SAIF\u2019s motion to dismiss denied; reversed and remanded for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
