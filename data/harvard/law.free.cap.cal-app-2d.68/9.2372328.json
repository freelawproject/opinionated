Howard, wife of appellant, died testate November 9, 1938. Her will was duly admitted to probate and an inventory and appraisement was filed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">' On June 9, 1941, the executors of decedent\u2019s estate filed an action to quiet title to all of the properties listed in the inventory and appraisement, claiming that such properties were the sole and separate property of decedent. Appellant was the defendant in such action. On September 29, 1941, he filed an answer by which he admitted he claimed a right, title and interest in and to all of the properties, except one, listed in the inventory and appraisement. On the same day he filed a cross-complaint in which he alleged that he owned an undivided one-half interest in the properties of the estate. When the action was tried a judgment was rendered in behalf of the estate finding all of the real and personal properties, with the exception of some miscellaneous household furniture and a stick pin, to be property of the estate. Thereafter the present proceeding was instituted to have it declared that appellant had forfeited all of his interest in the estate of Mrs. Howard by reason of the \u201ccontest provision\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">This is the sole question necessary for us to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>\n<em>Did the trial court properly -find, in view of the foregoing facts, that appellant had forfeited by his acts all of his right, title and interest in or to any property of decedent\u2019s estate?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">This question must be answered in the affirmative and is governed by the following pertinent rules of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">(1) A condition in a will that a beneficiary who contests, assails or draws in question any provision of a will thereby revokes a bequest made to him is valid and such a provision is not against public policy. <em>(In re Kitchen, </em>192 Cal. 384, 389 [220 P. 301,-30 A.L.R. 1008]; <em>Estate of Miller, </em>156 Cal. 119, 121 [103 P. 842, 23 L.R.A.N.S. 868]; <em>Estate of Hite, </em>155 Cal. 436, 440 [101 P. 443, 17 Ann.Cas. 993, 21 L.R.A.N.S. 953].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">(2) The word \u201ccontest\u201d as used in a forfeiture provision in a will means any legal proceeding which is designed to result in the thwarting of the testator\u2019s wishes as expressed in his will. <em>(Estate of Hite, supra, </em>at p. 444.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-9\">(3) A devisee or legatee who claims title to property of an estate must elect to either rely upon his claim of ownership and waive his rights under the will, or accept the provisions of the will and waive his rights of ownership. <em>(Williams </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>170 Cal. 625, 627 [151 P. 10]; <em>In re Stewart, </em>74 Cal. 98, 103 [15 P. 445]; <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>29 Cal. 337, 351; <em>Estate of Moore, </em>62 Cal-App. 265, 274 [216 P. 981].)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">(4) The good faith of one who asserts rights contrary to the claims of an estate does not toll the operation of a forfeiture clause. <em>(In re Kitchen, supra, </em>at p. 392.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-12\">In the present case the ninth paragraph in decedent\u2019s will provided for the forfeiture of any legatee\u2019s or devisee\u2019s rights under the will, in case such devisee or legatee should \u2018 \u2018 commence any suit or action, or submit to any court or other tribunal, or be a party to any pleading or proceeding, which suit, action, pleading or other proceeding assails or draws in question the validity or operation of any of the provisions of said will, or shall in any way question my acts in making this will, or any of its provisions. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-13\">Clearly appellant by claiming to be the owner, through the quiet title action referred to above, of an undivided one-half interest in the properties of the estate was a \u201cparty to\u201d a \u201cproceeding which\u201d drew in question the validity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>provisions of decedent\u2019s will, since in clauses of decedent\u2019s will the testatrix referred to the property as her \u201cseparate property\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cmy stock.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Appellant, having acted contrary to the forfeiture provision in decedent\u2019s will, forfeited all rights under the will and the trial court properly entered a judgment so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">Moore, P. J., and Wood, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-9\">Paragraph nine of decedent\u2019s will read thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-10\">\u201cIn case any legatee or devisee or beneficiary mentioned or referred to in this my Will, for whom or for whose benefit I have made any provision therein, shall endeavor in anywise to contest in any court, or before any tribunal, this will or the validity thereof, or its due and proper execution, of the provisions applicable to him or her, or any other provision of this my will, or shall commence any suit or action, or submit to any court or other tribunal, or be a party to any pleading or proceeding, which suit, action, pleading or other proceeding assails or draws in question the validity or operation of any of the provisions of said will, or shall in any way question my acts in making this will, or any of its provisions, then and in that event such legatee, devisee or beneficiary shall thereupon forfeit and shall thenceforth cease to have any right, title or interest in or to any portion of my estate, or any property devised or bequeathed hereunder, or any income therefrom; and any and all provisions in this will in favor of or for the benefit of such person are hereby absolutely revoked and eliminated and any and all rights or interests which such person would otherwise have had hereunder shall as wholly fail as if such person had predeceased me; and I further direct that any expense incurred by my executors in defending any contest in or about, or in respect to this will, or the provisions thereof, shall be paid from my estate.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b30-17\">The will contained this clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acv\"><em>\u201c</em>I declare that I am married, that my husband is W. D. Howard, that I have no children, that all of the property of my estate is <em>my separate property, </em>and that my next of. kin now living are my brother, Albert Austin Bennett, arid the children of my deceased sister, Alberta Hays, said children being Vivian Marquis Howard and Wilma Hays Case.\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b30-19\">The will also provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-20\">\u201cI give and bequeath all of <em>my stock </em>in the Hollywood State Bank to my nephew, Wade Emmons Bennett.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
