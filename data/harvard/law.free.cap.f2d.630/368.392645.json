Finding that a salt royalty can be neither a residence nor a farm, even though the salt deposit may be beneath a farm or residence, we affirm the Tax Court\u2019s decision, 71 T.C. 901, denying a charitable deduction for this legacy of such an interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">Fred A. Brock, prior to his death, owned a ranch in Brazoria County, Texas. In 1960, he entered into a \u201cSalt and Storage Agreement,\u201d pursuant to which Dow Chemical Company agreed to make royalty payments in return for the right to mine salt from and store it on the property. When Mr. Brock died in 1972, he willed to his wife a life interest in this salt royalty. He left the remainder interest in the royalty to the First Presbyterian Church of Angleton. The estate could not, of course, claim a deduction for the life interest that passed to the surviving spouse because it was a terminable interest, IRC \u00a7 2056(b)(1), but in reliance on Section 2055(a)(2), it deducted the value of the remainder interest as a gift to a qualifying charitable organization. Relying on Section 2055(e)(2), however, the Internal Revenue Service disallowed the deduction. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">Although Section 2055(a)(2) allows a deduction from the gross estate for all gifts to qualified charitable organizations, Section 2055(e)(2) forbids the deduction if the interest is split between the charity and an unqualified person or a noncharitable use. Congress provided a special exception to the rule of nondeductibility, however, for \u201ca contribution of a remainder interest <em>in </em>a personal residence or farm\u201d or \u201can undivided portion of the decedent\u2019s entire interest in property.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) IRC \u00a7 170(f)(3)(B)(i) \u2014 (ii). The estate claims, in effect, that the remainder interest in the salt royalty is deductible because the property from which the salt is mined and on which the royalty owner has a right to store the salt is a farm or personal residence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">This argument must fail. The Tax Court upheld the Commissioner\u2019s determination on two grounds. First, the court found as fact that the estate had not satisfied its burden of proving that the land associated with the salt royalty was used by the decedent as a farm or personal residence. This factual determination was not clearly erroneous and would suffice to sustain the decision. The Tax Court held in addition, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>matter of law, that the interest in the salt royalty could not qualify as a farm or personal residence. It was the royalty that was the subject of both bequests not the ranch. This conclusion is a correct interpretation of the statute\u2019s requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The decedent\u2019s wife and the church received different interests, but each was a portion of the right described by the decedent in his will, as \u201cmineral interests ... from which there are producing salt brine wells, . .\u2022. presently operated by the Dow Chemical Company, from which I receive royalty and which I will hereinafter designate as \u2018salt royalty.\u2019 \u201d The interest left to the charity was only the remainder of the salt royalty. No reading of the devise can make it fit the terms of the statute or convert it into an interest in a farm or residence. That the royalty was real property under Texas law and that it underlay or included the right to use part of the surface of a farm did not suffice to convert it to the interest described in the statute. Congress left no opportunity to broaden the statutory exemption. It used precise words and we apply them accordingly. Therefore, the deduction was properly disallowed under Section 2055(e)(2) and the Tax Court is thereby, AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-12\">. At oral argument before this court, the appellant, for the first time, claimed the estate was entitled to the deduction because the devise was \u201can undivided portion of the decedent\u2019s entire interest in property\u201d and thereby within the other exception to Section 2055(e)(2). We agree with the Tax Court\u2019s statement, in a footnote of its opinion, that such an argument is \u201cfatally defective.\u201d Because the decedent granted certain rights in the royalty to his wife for her life, and the remainder rights to the church, it cannot be contended seriously that the church received an undivided interest in the property. See Treas.Reg. \u00a7 20.2055(e)(2)(i). We pretermit consideration of whether the royalty could be considered separately from the ranch in determining what was \u201cthe decedent\u2019s entire interest.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
