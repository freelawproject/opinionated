By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Bonner is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">Bonner first argues that the district court erred in dismissing his \u00a7 1983 claims regarding a search and seizure and the imposition of conditions of pretrial release as frivolous because they were filed beyond the applicable statute of limitations. The district court found, and the record shows, that Bonner knew the factual basis underlying these claims more than two years before filing this action. <em>See Piotrowski v. City of Houston, </em>237 F.3d 567, 576 (5th Cir.2001). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing these claims as untimely. <em>See Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 291 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-18\">Next, Bonner contends that the district court erred in dismissing his RICO claims for failure to state a claim for which relief could be granted. The district court, in dismissing these claims, determined that the conduct alleged (ordering and collecting fees as conditions of pretrial release) did not qualify as either extortion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(2) or any other \u201cracketeering activity\u201d as defined by RICO. We find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that the defendants\u2019 conduct did not rise to the level of extortion. <em>See United States v. Snyder, </em>930 F.2d 1090, 1093 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-19\">Bonner has not demonstrated that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>(5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Bonner\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 n. 24. Because his appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20, the appeal is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Bonner\u2019s complaint as frivolous and for failure to state a claim and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal as frivolous count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Bonner is warned that if he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
