On appeal, Bryant argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred in finding that he could perform work that existed in the national economy, because the ALJ should not have given any weight to the unreliable testimony of the Vocational Expert (\u201cVE\u201d). After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-23\">We review the Commissioner\u2019s factual findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Social Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1260 (11th Cir.2007). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number><em>Bloodsworth v. Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983). In reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s decision, we do not \u201cdecide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Commissioner\u2019s legal conclusions are reviewed <em>de novo. Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">The Social Security regulations establish a five-step sequential process for determining whether a claimant is disabled. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). Under the first two steps, the claimant must demonstrate that he has not engaged in substantial gainful activity and has a severe impairment or combination of impairments. <em>Id. </em>Under the third step, if the claimant can prove that his impairment meets or equals a listed impairment, he is automatically found to be disabled. <em>Id. </em>Otherwise, the claimant must move to the fourth step and prove that he is not able to perform his past relevant work. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAt the fifth step, the burden shifts to the Commissioner to determine if there is other work available in significant numbers in the national economy that the claimant is able to perform.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIf the Commissioner can demonstrate that there are jobs the claimant can perform, the claimant must prove [he] is unable to perform those jobs in order to be found disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One way in which the ALJ may determine whether the claimant is able to perform other work is by posing hypothetical questions to a VE. <em>Id. </em>at 1229. The Social Security regulations provide that an ALJ may rely upon a VE\u2019s knowledge or expertise. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1560(b)(2), 416.960(b)(2); <em>see also Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1230 (explaining that a VE\u2019s testimony is \u201ccrucial to ... step 5 of the sequential evaluation process\u201d because the VE can supplement the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d) with additional information gleaned from his experience with employers and from literature such as census reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">In this case, the ALJ properly credited the VE\u2019s testimony that Bryant could perform other work that existed in the national economy. The VE testified that Bryant had the functional capacity to perform the jobs of small products assembler, merchandise marker, and final inspector. Although Bryant argues that those three positions are sedentary in nature,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> they are classified as light work in the DOT, <em>see </em>DOT \u00a7\u00a7 739.687-030, 209.587-034, 727.687-054 (4th ed., revised 1991), and the VE testified that they typically are performed at the light exertional level in the national economy. Therefore, the ALJ properly viewed those jobs as light work positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">Bryant\u2019s argument that the VE failed to explain adequately how she reduced the number of positions to account for his functional limitations also lacks merit. The VE testified that she based her reductions on census figures, state information, labor market surveys, and job analyses. Given that information, she arrived at an \u201capproximate percentage\u201d of jobs that an individual with Bryant\u2019s functional limitations would be able to perform. Thus, the record reflects that the VE had a reasoned basis for the figures at which she arrived. The Social Security regulations provide that an ALJ may rely on a VE\u2019s knowledge and expertise, and they do not require a VE produce detailed reports or statistics in support of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>Because a reasonable person would accept the VE\u2019s testimony as being adequate to support a conclusion that Bryant is able to perform other work that exists in the national economy, the ALJ\u2019s Step Five findings are supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-6\">. Bryant argues that the only jobs identified by the vocational expert (\"VE\u201d) as ones he could perform were unskilled <em>sedentary </em>jobs because Medical-Vocational Grid Rule 201.12 would require the Commissioner to find Bryant disabled if he was an individual approaching advanced age with no transferable skills who was limited to sedentary work.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
