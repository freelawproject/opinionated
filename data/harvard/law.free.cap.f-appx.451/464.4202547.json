Smith filed a claim with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on September 23, 2009. On August 23, 2010, the EEOC issued Smith a right-to-sue letter. Smith did not, however, file her suit until December 16, 2010 \u2014 116 days after the issuance of the right-to-sue letter. The Appellee filed a motion to dismiss based on Eleventh Amendment immunity and a motion for summary judgment based on the time bar. The district court granted both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u201cA plaintiff alleging employment discrimination must file a civil action no more than ninety days after she receives statutory notice of her right to sue from the EEOC. The ninety-day window is strictly construed and is a precondition to filing suit in district court.\u201d <em>Duron v. Albertson's LLC, </em>560 F.3d 288, 290 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks, citations, and footnotes omitted). Smith claims that she filed her suit on November 22, 2010 (within the ninety-day window), but there is no evidence in the record to support this. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Appel-lee.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
