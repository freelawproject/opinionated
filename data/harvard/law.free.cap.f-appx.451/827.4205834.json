Cole, incarcerated and proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his amended complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Specifically, Cole argues that fear of retaliation from the prison staff rendered any administrative remedies unavailable.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-24\">Section \u00a7 1997e, as amended by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), provides that the court shall not address a prisoner\u2019s complaint regarding prison conditions unless \u201csuch administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Such exhaustion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>mandatory and \u201cunexhausted claims cannot be brought in court.\u201d <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 211, 127 S.Ct. 910, 918-19, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). An administrative remedy is not available for purposes of the PLRA, though, if prison officials render pursuit of the remedy irrational through serious threats of substantial retaliation. <em>Turner v. Burnside, </em>541 F.3d 1077, 1084-85 (11th Cir.2008). To demonstrate such unavailability under <em>Turner, </em>a prisoner must establish that: (1) the threat actually deterred him from lodging a grievance or pursuing a particular part of the administrative process; and (2) the threat is one that would so deter a reasonable inmate of ordinary firmness and fortitude. <em>Id. </em>at 1085.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">The exhaustion requirement is an affirmative defense, and a prisoner is not required to plead or demonstrate exhaustion in his complaint. <em>Jones, </em>549 U.S. at 216, 127 S.Ct. 910. However, a complaint may be dismissed under \u00a7 1915A(b) if lack of exhaustion appears on the face of the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 214-15, 127 S.Ct. 910 (noting that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure generally apply to section 1997(e) and Rule 12(b)(6) allows for dismissal when an affirmative defense appears on the face of the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The district court did not err in dismissing Cole\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies as required by \u00a7 1997e(a). Cole conceded in his amended complaint that he had not pursued any administrative remedies. He did not allege that a serious threat of substantial retaliation was made or, moreover, that any threat was made in the present context. Rather, he simply stated that a prison officer had filed an allegedly false disciplinary report against him the previous year in retaliation for his lodging a grievance regarding exposure to cold. Even if this is somehow taken as a continuing threat, such a threat would not deter a reasonable inmate from pursuing his grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
