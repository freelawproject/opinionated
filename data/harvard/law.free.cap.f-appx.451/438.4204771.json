In the district court, he conceded some of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-17\">The district court explained its ruling in a thorough and convincing Memorandum Opinion and Order. The court noted that there was no evidence of direct discrimination and that under the burden-shifting framework, the employer had proffered a legitimate reason for choosing another person for the position that Autrey sought. Specifically, the company relied on the fact that the other person already had experience in the warehouse and had a bachelor\u2019s degree. Autrey\u2019s other arguments asserted on appeal are similarly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-22\">The summary judgment is AFFIRMED, essentially for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b464-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
