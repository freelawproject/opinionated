Quintero now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) and argues that he may bring his challenge as a \u00a7 2241 petition pursuant to the \u201csavings clause\u201d of \u00a7 2255. In the alternative, he requests authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. He also requests leave to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">As an initial matter, because Quintero sought relief under \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain a COA to appeal. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). However, because he did not file his \u00a7 2241 petition in the district of his current incarceration, the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider it as a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Lee v. Wetzel, </em>244 F.3d 370, 373 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-16\">Federal courts may recharacterize a pro se litigant\u2019s motion for various reasons, including to avoid an unnecessary dismissal. <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-82, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Because it lacked jurisdiction to consider Quintero\u2019s claims as a \u00a7 2241 petition, and because \u00a7 2255 provides the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence, the district court did not err by recharacterizing Quintero\u2019s petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Lee, </em>244 F.3d at 373; <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 425-26. However, a district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a successive \u00a7 2255 motion unless this court has granted permission to file a successive motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). <em>United States v. Key, </em>205 F.3d 773, 774 (5th Cir.2000). Because this court has not yet granted such authorization the district court correctly found that Quintero\u2019s motion should be dismissed as an unauthorized successive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-17\">Quintero requests in the alternative that this court grant him authorization to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. A second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>or successive \u00a7 2255 motion must be certified by this court to contain either newly discovered evidence or \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\u201d \u00a7 2255(h). Quintero argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), and <em>Chambers v. United States, </em>555 U.S. 122, 129 S.Ct. 687, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009), are retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review and demonstrate that his prior convictions that were used for enhancement purposes under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) were not qualifying crimes of violence. \u201cWhen seeking leave to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion on the basis of a new rule of constitutional law, a movant must point to a Supreme Court decision that either expressly declares the collateral availability of the rule ... or applies the rule in a collateral proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Tatum, </em>233 F.3d 857, 858 (5th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); <em>see also Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 662, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001) (\u201c \u2018[M]ade\u2019 means \u2018held\u2019 and, thus, the requirement is satisfied only if [the Supreme] Court has held that the new rule is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\u201d). Quintero has not met this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">MOTIONS FOR COA, AUTHORIZATION TO FILE A SUCCESSIVE \u00a7 2255 MOTION, AND LEAVE TO PROCEED IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b435-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
