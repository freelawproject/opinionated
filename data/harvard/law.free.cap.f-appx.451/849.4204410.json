He argues that Dobbins failed to allege a constitutional violation and that, even if he did, it was not a violation of clearly established law.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. <em>Roberts v. Spielman, </em>643 F.3d 899, 902 (11th Cir.2011). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). A district court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom, to the extent supported by the record, \u201cin the light most favorable to the nonmovant.\u201d <em>Jean-Baptiste v. Gutierrez, </em>627 F.3d 816, 820 (11th Cir.2010). If an inmate submits a sworn complaint, the factual allegations therein are sufficient for summary judgment purposes, and he need not file a separate affidavit. <em>Sammons v. Taylor, </em>967 F.2d 1533, 1544 n. 5 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">\u201cQualified immunity shields federal and state officials from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct.\u201d <em>Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2080, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts may address these prongs in either order. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">The Eighth Amendment proscribes the infliction of cruel and unusual punishments. U.S. Const. amend. VIII. The Supreme Court has made clear that this proscription governs prison officials\u2019 use of force against inmates. <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 327, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986). The core judicial inquiry in determining whether a prison official\u2019s use of force was excessive is \u201cwhether force was applied in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, or maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 7, 112 S.Ct. 995, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992). Relevant factors in this inquiry include \u201cthe need for the application of force, the relationship between the need and the amount of force that was used, and the extent of injury inflicted.\u201d <em>Whitley, </em>475 U.S. at 321, 106 S.Ct. 1078 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-16\">\u201cThe absence of serious injury is ... relevant to the Eighth Amendment inquiry, but does not end it.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 7, 112 S.Ct. 995. \u201cWhen prison officials maliciously and sadistically use force to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>cause harm, contemporary standards of decency always are violated ... whether or not significant injury is evident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, 112 S.Ct. 995. However, \u201c[t]he Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishments necessarily excludes from constitutional recognition <em>de minimis </em>uses of physical force, provided that the use of force is not of a sort repugnant to the conscience of mankind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9-10, 112 S.Ct. 995 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">After thorough review, we affirm. In <em>Skrtich v. Thornton, </em>280 F.3d 1295 (11th Cir.2002), we considered a \u00a7 1983 suit by a prisoner who alleged an excessive force claim against corrections officers. We concluded, under the facts of that case, that \u201ca defense of qualified immunity is not available in cases alleging excessive force in violation of the Eighth Amendment, because the use of force maliciously and sadistically to cause harm is clearly established to be a violation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court decisions in <em>Hudson </em>and <em>Whitley.\u201d Skrtich, </em>280 F.3d at 1301 (internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, when a plaintiff making an excessive force claim \u201chas alleged facts sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment\u201d demonstrating that the officer used force maliciously and sadistically to cause harm, he has necessarily established the two prongs required to defeat a defense of qualified immunity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Here, Dobbins alleged, and tendered proof in the form of his verified complaint, that Officer Hulett struck and slapped him for no reason after he expressed an inability to transfer from his bed to his wheelchair. In particular, Dobbins alleged that on the evening of November 2, 2008, between six and eight officers came to a room where he was laying on a bed to \u201cshake down\u201d the inmates in that room. Hulett approached Dobbins\u2019 bed and told him to get up. Dobbins responded that he was unable to rise because he was wheelchair-bound and had \u201ca boil on his butt,\u201d which made sitting down painful. Hulett found pencil lead in Dobbins\u2019s drawer and threw it in his face, swore at Dobbins, and told all the other inmates to leave the room. According to the complaint, Hulett then struck Dobbins between the eyes with his fist and slapped Dobbins in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Taking Dobbins\u2019 version of the facts as true, as we must for present purposes, Hulett\u2019s use of force was wanton and unnecessary. To the extent that the evidence showed that there was no need for force, Dobbins pleaded and tendered sufficient facts to support an excessive force claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Hulett qualified immunity. <em>See Skrtich, </em>280 F.3d at 1301.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-10\">. Although Dobbins does not allege the extent of his physical injuries, the Supreme Court has made clear that the \"core judicial inquiry\u201d is not the extent of the injury, but rather the nature of the force, and whether it was applied \"maliciously and sadistically to cause harm.\u201d <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 7, 112 S.Ct. 995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b877-11\">. Additionally, we reject Hulett's invitation to overrule <em>Skrtich </em>because \"only the Supreme Court or this [C]ourt sitting <em>en banc </em>could accomplish such a task.\u201d <em>Black v. United States, </em>373 F.3d 1140, 1145 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
