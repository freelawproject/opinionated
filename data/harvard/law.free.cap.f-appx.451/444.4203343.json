The BIA\u2019s determination that an alien is not eligible for withholding of removal is a finding of fact reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>E.g., Efe v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 899, 903 (5th Cir.2002). \u201cWe will affirm the B[IA]\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Carbajal-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>78 F.3d 194, 197 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">Mairena contends the BIA erred in determining he did not demonstrate past persecution. Substantial evidence supports that finding. Mairena\u2019s account of verbal threats over a four to five month period and one physical attack does not constitute past persecution. <em>See Eduard v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 182, 187-88 (5th Cir.2004); <em>Abdel-Masieh v. INS, </em>73 F.3d 579, 583-84 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">Mairena also contends the BIA erred in determining he had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution. Because Mairena\u2019s above-described past treatment does not amount to persecution, it does not support a presumption of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i) (showing of past persecution results in rebuttable presumption life will be threatened in future). Additionally, Mairena\u2019s generalized fear of violence cannot constitute a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See Eduard, </em>379 F.3d at 190. Further, the reasonableness of Mairena\u2019s fear of future persecution is diminished because a number of Mairena\u2019s family members have continued to reside in Nicaragua and have remained unharmed. <em>Id. </em>at 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b471-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
