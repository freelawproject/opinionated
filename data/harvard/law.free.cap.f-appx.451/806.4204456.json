Rivera-Soto urges this court to set aside his conviction for the following reasons. First, he argues that his immigration records were improperly admitted under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. Second, he contends that the introduction of his immigration records into evidence violated the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Finally, he asserts that the government failed to prove two essential elements of the offense \u2014 namely, that at the relevant time, he was an alien and that he did not receive the Attorney General\u2019s consent to reapply for admission into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-9\">I. Hearsay Exception</p>\n<p id=\"b833-10\">\u201cWe review evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Caraballo, 595 </em>F.3d 1214, 1226 (11th Cir.2010). Hearsay is defined as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), business records are not excluded as hearsay if they are kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of the business activity to make the records, \u201call as shown by the testimony of the custodian or other qualified witness, or by certification that complies with Rule 902(11), Rule 902(12), or a statute permitting certification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>803(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(8), documents are generally not excluded as hearsay if they are records, reports, statements, or data compilations, in any form, of public agencies, which set forth the activities of the agency or matters observed pursuant to a legal duty to report, unless circumstances indicate a lack of trustworthiness. <em>Id. </em>803(8)(A), (B). Public records may be authenticated by showing that they are \u201cfrom the public office where items of [that] nature are kept.\u201d <em>Id. </em>901(b)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-13\">Rivera-Soto argues that the district court erred in admitting his immigration records under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. This contention is unavailing because the district court also admitted the immigration records under the public records exception. The district court did not abuse its discretion in so doing. We have previously held that \u201croutinely and mechanically kept\u201d immigration records, such as deportation warrants, are admissible as public records. <em>United States v. Agustino-Hernandez, </em>14 F.3d 42, 43 (11th Cir.1994); <em>see also Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1226.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-14\">Rivera-Soto has not otherwise argued that the records in this case are so untrustworthy that the jury should not have been allowed to consider them. <em>See generally </em>Fed.R.Evid. 803(8) (providing that public records may be excluded if \u201ccircumstances indicate [a] lack of trustworthiness\u201d). Nor has he asserted that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>government failed to provide sufficient evidence to authenticate the records as those of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). <em>See generally id. </em>901(b)(7) (providing that public records may be authenticated by showing that the records are \u201cfrom the public office where items of [that] nature are kept\u201d). Under these circumstances, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting the immigration records into evidence under the public records exception to the hearsay rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">II. Confrontation Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">\u201c[W]e review <em>\u2018de novo </em>the question of whether hearsay statements are \u2018testimonial\u2019 for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1226 (quoting <em>United States v. Lamons, </em>532 F.3d 1251, 1261 n. 15 (11th Cir.2008)). \u201c[T]he Confrontation Clause bars the admission of the <em>testimonial </em>statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless the witness was unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him or her.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1227 (citing <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004)). Statements \u201care testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that ... the primary purpose of the [statement] is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In <em>United States v. Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d 1142 (11th Cir.2005), we held that a deportation warrant is non-testimonial and not subject to confrontation because it is \u201crecorded routinely and not in preparation for a criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1145. We noted that a deportation warrant simply \u201crecords facts about where, when, and how a deportee left the country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Caraballo, </em>we similarly held that an alien file\u2019s I-213 form, which \u201cis primarily used ... for the purpose of tracking the entry of aliens into the United States,\u201d is non-testimonial. 595 F.3d at 1229. We observed that an I-213 form contains \u201croutine biographical information that is required of every foreign entrant for the proper administration of our immigration laws and policies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">As Rivera-Soto acknowledges, these precedents foreclose his argument that in this case, the admission of the immigration records into evidence violated the Confrontation Clause. A deportation warrant is non-testimonial. <em>Cantellano, </em>430 F.3d at 1145. And while we have not previously considered whether an I-867 form is testimonial, our reasoning in <em>Caraballo </em>brings us to the conclusion that it is also non-testimonial. Like an I-213 form, the 1-867 form that records the sworn statement of an alien prior to removal contains \u201croutine biographical information\u201d obtained primarily \u201cfor the proper administration of our immigration laws and policies.\u201d <em>Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d at 1229. The immigration records in this case are thus non-testimonial and do not implicate the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">III. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b834-13\">\u201cWe review whether the record contains sufficient evidence to support a jury\u2019s verdict <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Byrd, </em>403 F.3d 1278, 1288 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIn so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>doing, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, with all reasonable inferences and credibility choices drawn in the government\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA conviction must be upheld unless the jury could not have found the defendant guilty under any reasonable construction of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Chastain, </em>198 F.3d 1338, 1351 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">To obtain a conviction for the offense of illegal reentry by an alien, the government must prove that the defendant (1) was an alien; (2) had previously been deported from the United States; (3) was thereafter found to be in the United States voluntarily; and (4) had not received the express consent of the Attorney General to reapply for readmission to the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>111 F.3d 111, 113-14 (11th Cir.1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rivera-Soto argues that the government failed to provide sufficient evidence for the jury to find the first and fourth elements of the offense. We are not persuaded by this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">First, Rivera-Soto\u2019s 2004 1-867 form states that he is a citizen of Mexico. The jury could have reasonably inferred from that statement, and the execution of the deportation warrant in 2004, that Rivera-Soto was an alien at the relevant time. Rivera-Soto relies on cases such as <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>105 F.3d 1330 (9th Cir.1997), to argue that a defendant\u2019s admission that he is an alien is insufficient to establish the element of alienage. This effort is misdirected. Cases such as <em>Hernandez </em>concern the insufficiency of an admission made at the time of, or after, the arrest leading up to the conviction that is being challenged. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 1331-33. In this case, the government did not introduce evidence of such a confession in its effort to prove the element of alienage.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-13\">Second, the jury could also have reasonably found that Rivera-Soto did not obtain the consent of the Attorney General to reapply for admission. An Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent testified that he was unable to find any physical or electronic record indicating that Rivera-Soto had applied for readmission into the United States. The jury\u2019s decision to credit that testimony is not ours to question. <em>See United States v. Parrado, </em>911 F.2d 1567, 1571 (11th Cir.1990) (\u201cCredibility determinations are the exclusive province of the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">Rivera-Soto contends that in lieu of or in addition to the ICE agent\u2019s testimony, the government was required to offer a Certificate of Nonexistence of Records.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rivera-Soto cites no cases that support this specific proposition. In any event, it conflicts with \u201cthe familiar, standard rule that the prosecution is entitled to prove its case by evidence of its own choice.\u201d <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 186, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). In light of the ICE agent\u2019s testimony here, the jury could have reasonably found that Rivera-Soto did not obtain the requisite permission to reenter the United States following his 2004 removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">For the reasons set forth above, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>affirm Rivera-Soto\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\">. We also note that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who conducted the interview to elicit the answers on the 1-867 form was a witness at trial and was thus available for cross-examination. Thus, even if the sworn statement were testimonial, there was no Confrontation Clause violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b835-7\">. Rivera-Soto was convicted for violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). A conviction under that statutory provision requires the government to establish the elements for a violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b835-16\">. A Certificate of Nonexistence of Records certifies that a DHS employee searched the immigration records databases and found no record indicating the alien received permission to reenter the United States. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>States v. Villarreal-Martinez, </em>382 Fed.Appx. 379, 380 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b836-35\">.
