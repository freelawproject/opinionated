After a thorough review of the record, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">On November 6, 2000, Cika and his family attempted to enter the United States using fraudulent entry documents. The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued notices to appear, charging them as removable. In December 2001, Cika filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief, alleging that he had been persecuted based on his political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">Following a hearing, at which Cika testified, the IJ denied relief. Specifically, the IJ stated that Cika lacked credibility due to inconsistencies between the information in the asylum application and Cika\u2019s testimony. The IJ further noted that Cika had submitted a fraudulent party membership card in support of his allegations of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">On appeal to the BIA, Cika challenged the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The BIA dismissed the appeal, concluding that there was no error in the IJ\u2019s credibility findings. Cika filed a motion to reconsider, alleging that the BIA made a legal error and overlooked highly relevant facts about his persecution claims. The BIA denied the motion, finding no legal or factual error in its previous decision. Cika now petitions this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">We review \u201cthe BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Calle v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, our review \u201cis limited to determining whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the [manner] of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Montano Cisneros v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>514 F.3d 1224, 1226 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C). A motion to reconsider that \u201cmerely republishes the reasons that had failed to convince the tribunal in the first place gives the tribunal no reason to change its mind.\u201d <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (quotation omitted). \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or law' as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Cika\u2019s motion to reconsider. The BIA noted inconsistencies between Cika\u2019s testimony, his asylum application, and his supporting documents. Moreover, Cika\u2019s submission of counterfeit documents to establish his membership in a political party was a sufficient basis for the IJ and BIA to discredit his testimony. <em>In re O-D-, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1079, 1083 (BIA 1998). Therefore, based on the record, the BIA\u2019s decision was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <em>Montano Cisneros, </em>514 F.3d at 1226. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b916-14\">.
