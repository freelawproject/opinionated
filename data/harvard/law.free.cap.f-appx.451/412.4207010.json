Morris asserts that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Almany, </em>598 F.3d 238 (6th Cir.2010), the district court erred in imposing a consecutive sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) for the firearm offense because her underlying drug conviction carried a longer mandatory minimum sentence. The district court concluded that Morris\u2019s claims were more properly raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and dismissed the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Morris contends that the district court erred in dismissing her petition on jurisdictional grounds and asserts that she is entitled to relief on the merits of her claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of her conviction or sentence must file a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [her] detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). Morris has not made such a showing, as she has not established that her claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that she was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Moreover, as the district court found, the Supreme Court has rejected the merits of Morris\u2019s claim that the minimum statutory sentence for her drug offense bars the sentencing court from imposing consecutive sentences for the drug and firearm convictions. <em>See Abbott v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 18, 23, 178 L.Ed.2d 348 (2010). Because Morris is not entitled to relief, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is DENIED. The Government\u2019s motion for an extension of time to file an appellate brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
