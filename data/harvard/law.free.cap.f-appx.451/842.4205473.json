Neder, Jr. appeals the denial of his <em>pro se </em>motion asking the district court to exercise its supervisory power to dismiss his indictment and vacate his federal convictions. After his \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate was denied in 2003, Ned-er filed this <em>pro se </em>motion in 2009. Because the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for the district court to dismiss Neder\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In 1992, a jury convicted Neder on 73 counts stemming from Neder\u2019s fraudulent real estate deals. Neder was sentenced to 144 months\u2019 imprisonment and five years\u2019 supervised release. Neder\u2019s convictions and sentences were affirmed on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Neder, </em>136 F.3d 1459 (11th Cir.1998), <em>aff'd in part and rev\u2019d in part, </em>527 U.S. 1, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999), <em>convictions reinstated on remand, </em>197 F.3d 1122 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">In December 2001, Neder filed a motion to vacate his convictions and sentences pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Neder\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion on August 21, 2003. Both this Court and the district court denied Neder\u2019s motions for a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">In December 2009, Neder filed the instant <em>pro se </em>motion requesting that the district court use its supervisory power to vacate his original 73 convictions and dismiss his 73-count indictment. Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion argued that the requested relief was necessary due to the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct. Specifically, Neder claimed that during his 1992 trial, the prosecutor withheld exculpatory documents and knowingly presented perjured testimony from one of Neder\u2019s co-conspirators, Thomas Turner. Then, in December 2004, the prosecutor destroyed a box of escrow records that Neder claimed would have rebutted Turner\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">According to Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion: (1) in August 1994, Neder moved to protect the records, but the district court \u201cturned a blind eye\u201d; (2) before his \u00a7 2255 hearing in 2003, Neder asked the government to return the escrow records; (3) in his \u00a7 2255 proceedings, Neder raised the issue of his access to the allegedly exculpatory escrow records, but his request \u201cto search the escrow records ... in government possession was denied\u201d; and (4) in denying his \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court found that \u201cit was sufficient that a court appointed attorney for Neder had been given access to the thousands of records in government possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-13\">The district court denied Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion. The district court noted that Neder had unsuccessfully raised the same arguments at least twice before, including in his \u00a7 2255 motion, and that the government did not have an obligation to keep documents forever. The district court concluded that Neder failed to show a violation of a recognized right or a defect in his convictions or sentences that would warrant the remedy requested. Neder appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b870-15\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>2003). Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAED-PA\u201d), when a prisoner previously has filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, he must apply for and receive permission from this Court before filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2244(a), (b)(3), 2255(h). Absent this Court\u2019s permission, the district court lacks jurisdiction to address the motion, and it must be dismissed. <em>United States v. Holt, </em>417 F.3d 1172, 1175 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">After the denial of a prisoner\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion, we will look beyond the label of the prisoner\u2019s subsequently filed post-conviction motion to determine if it is actually, in substance, a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, or if it is similar enough that failing to hold it to the same requirements would be inconsistent with the AEDPA. <em>Franqui v. Florida, </em>638 F.3d 1368, 1372-74 (11th Cir.2011) (concluding Rule 60(b) motion in fact was an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion over which district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Here, Neder already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion that was denied in 2003. Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion ostensibly asks the district court to use its supervisory powers to cure the government\u2019s 2004 destruction of documents. However, the substance of Ned-er\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion seeks to invalidate his convictions and obtain his release based on alleged prosecutorial misconduct and <em>Brady </em>and <em>Giglio </em>violations during his 1992 trial, which the 2004 destruction of documents merely continues to \u201ccover up.\u201d As such, Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion is actually a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, filed without the requisite certification from this Court. Accordingly, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Ned-er\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">Neder alternatively asks us to construe his <em>pro se </em>motion as a petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255(e). Under the \u201csavings clause,\u201d a federal prisoner may file a \u00a7 2241 petition if an otherwise available remedy under \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [a defendant\u2019s] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(e). However, restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions, standing alone, do not render that section \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d within the meaning of the savings clause. <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999). Thus, the savings clause does not permit a prisoner to circumvent the requirements for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion merely by filing a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion does not satisfy the criteria for applying the savings clause given that it does not rely on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, much less one that establishes that Neder was convicted of nonexistent offenses. <em>See id. </em>at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Because the district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Neder\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, we vacate the district court\u2019s September 22, 2011 order and remand so the district court may dismiss Neder\u2019s motion for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b871-7\">. Whether subject matter jurisdiction exists is a question of law we review <em>de novo. United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b871-14\">. Even if an independent jurisdictional basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>were to exist for entertaining Neder\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motion, the district court did not err in refusing to exercise its supervisory powers to vacate Neder\u2019s convictions and sentences and dismiss his indictment. The alleged \"prose-cutorial misconduct\u201d Neder complains about is the December 2004 destruction of a box of escrow records subpoenaed by the grand jury in 1991. Neder was convicted in 1992 and exhausted his direct and collateral appeals of his convictions and sentences by 2003. In fact, Neder raised the issue of his access to the escrow records in his prior \u00a7 2255 motion, which was denied. Neder admits he knew of the escrow records before his 1992 trial, so they are not \"newly discovered evidence\u201d that might permit a successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"Ahr\">And, as the district court noted, the government is not required to preserve records indefinitely. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that Neder\u2019s requested remedy was not warranted. <em>See United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 505-06, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1978-79, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983) (stating that courts may use their supervisory powers to remedy a violation of a recognized right, to preserve judicial integrity or to deter illegal conduct).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
