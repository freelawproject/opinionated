Partee filed his \u00a7 2254 petition in the District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, challenging his two prior Georgia drug convictions, sustained in 1996, for which he had received two concurrent, two-year sentences. Partee indicated in his petition that he was currently serving a 324-month federal sentence imposed by the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">In November 2010, the district court dismissed Partee\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, finding that his 1996 state sentences had expired and that he was no longer \u201cin custody\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2254(a). The court noted that, if Partee wished to challenge his current federal sentence, he should do so via a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion in the court that imposed the sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">We granted Partee a certificate of ap-pealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issues of whether the district court erred in failing to construe his \u00a7 2254 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, and whether the court should have dismissed the construed \u00a7 2255 motion for lack of jurisdiction and transferred the motion to the Northern District of Illinois, where Partee\u2019s federal criminal judgment was entered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">In examining a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, we review questions of law <em>de novo. Grossman v. McDonough, </em>466 F.3d 1325, 1335 (11th Cir.2006). When a federal prisoner seeks to challenge an expired state sentence that was used to enhance his current federal sentence, he must bring suit under \u00a7 2255. <em>Means v. Alabama, </em>209 F.3d 1241, 1242 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-16\">\u201cIt is true that federal courts must look beyond the labels of motions filed by pro se inmates to interpret them under whatever statute would provide relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, however, construing Partee\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>\u00a7 2254 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion would have been futile, providing no relief. Specifically, Partee received his federal sentence in the Northern District of Illinois, and a \u00a7 2255 motion must be filed in the \u201ccourt which imposed the sentence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(a); <em>see Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1056-57 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that \u00a7 2255 alleviated procedural difficulties \u201cby directing prisoners to file the motion in the court where they were convicted\u201d). Accordingly, even if the district court had construed the \u00a7 2254 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, it would have lacked jurisdiction over the motion and would have been required to dismiss the case. <em>See Owensby v. Clark, </em>451 F.2d 206, 207-09 (5th Cir.1971) (holding that a non-sentencing district court had no jurisdiction to hear a prisoner\u2019s habeas petition because the prisoner could have obtained relief through a \u00a7 2255 motion, which should have been filed in the district court that sentenced him).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">Partee might have received some relief if the district court had transferred his construed \u00a7 2255 motion to the appropriate district under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, which allows a district court to transfer a case over which it lacks jurisdiction if such a transfer is \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. However, a significant factor in the interest-of-justice analysis is whether a denial of a transfer would effectively bar the plaintiff from relief in the proper court. <em>See Guenther v. Holt, </em>173 F.3d 1328, 1331 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that the interests of justice did not warrant a \u00a7 1631 transfer of a prisoner\u2019s habeas petition because, after the district court had dismissed his petition, the prisoner had three months within the limitations period in which to properly refile the petition, and the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation notified the prisoner of the necessary procedure for doing so).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">In this case, at the time the district court dismissed Partee\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, nothing barred him from refiling the petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion in the proper court. The one-year statute of limitations for filing \u00a7 2255 motions began to run for Partee on October 18, 2010, when the Supreme Court denied certiorari in his direct appeal, rendering his federal conviction final. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f); <em>Partee v. United States, </em>562 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 439, 178 L.Ed.2d 340 (2010) (denying certiorari in Partee\u2019s direct appeal); <em>Washington v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 1299, 1300-01 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that a conviction becomes final for purposes of \u00a7 2255 when the Supreme Court denies certiorari). The district court dismissed his \u00a7 2254 petition in November 2010, giving him ample opportunity (almost a year) to file a \u00a7 2255 motion in the proper district before the statute of limitations expired. <em>See Washington, </em>243 F.3d at 1300-01. In fact, the court alerted Partee to this opportunity by stating that a challenge to his federal sentence must be brought via a \u00a7 2255 motion in the Illinois district court. Accordingly, the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d would not have warranted a transfer of Partee\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631; <em>Guenther, </em>173 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-8\">Because construing Partee\u2019s habeas petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion would have resulted in a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction and would not have granted Partee any relief, the district court did not err by failing to construe his petition as such. <em>See Means, </em>209 F.3d at 1242. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b883-11\">. Section 2254 allows a federal district court to entertain a habeas petition of \"a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a). By contrast, \u00a7 2255 governs post-conviction relief for federal prisoners. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b883-17\">. In his brief on appeal, Partee challenges the district court\u2019s finding regarding the \"in custody\u201d requirement, but we do not address this issue because \"appellate review is limited to the issues specified in the COA.\u201d <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
