He argues that the district court erred in determining his base offense level pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) because his prior Texas conviction for evading detention using a vehicle was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). He concedes that his argument is foreclosed by our precedent in <em>United States v. Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d 531 (5th Cir.2009); however, he contends that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sykes v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 L.Ed.2d 60 (2011), \u201ccasts doubt on the validity of current case law\u201d and \u201cmay affect this Court\u2019s precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-28\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008). In <em>Harrimon, </em>we held that the Texas offense of evading detention with a vehicle is a violent felony under the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) because it \u201cinvolves a serious potential risk of physical injury to others.\u201d <em>Harrimon, </em>568 F.3d at 534, 536-37. The relevant residual definitions of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA and \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2) are interchangeable. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>635 F.3d 774, 776 (5th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">In <em>Sykes, </em>the Supreme Court held that a conviction under Indiana\u2019s 2004 felony vehicle flight law constituted a violent felony under the ACCA because it created \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2273, 2277. The Court rejected Sykes\u2019s argument that because Indiana Code \u00a7 35-44-3-3(b)(1)(B) separately \u201ccriminalize[d] flight in which the offender \u2018operate[d] a vehicle in a manner that create[d] a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person,\u2019 \u201d it must not have intended for \u00a7 35-44-3-3(b)(l)(A)\u2019s general prohibition against vehicle flight \u201cto encompass the particular class of vehicle flights that \u00a7 35-44-3-3(b)(1)(B) reache[d].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2276. The Court found significant that Indiana treated \u201cviolations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude,\u201d noting that they were both class D felonies and that they carried the same range of punishment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Whitfield argues that flight using a vehicle under the Texas statute is not a crime of violence because, unlike the 2004 Indiana statute, the Texas statute does not separately criminalize vehicle flight that causes a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, and it provides for different sentences depending on whether or not the vehicle flight caused another person to suffer serious bodily injury. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 38.04(b)(1) and (b)(2)(B) (2003).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, he reasons that because he was convicted under the state jail felony section of the Texas statute, which carries a lesser punishment than the third degree felony section of the statute, requiring that another person suffer serious bodily injury, his crime was not a violent felony under the ACCA and therefore not a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The <em>Sykes </em>decision in not dispositive of the issue raised by Whitfield. In <em>Sykes, </em>the Court compared two subsections of the Indiana statute that imposed the same punishment for using a vehicle during flight and therefore both involved creating a substantial risk of bodily injury to another. <em>Sykes, </em>131 S.Ct. at 2276. The Court expressly declined to consider whether a vehicular flight provision is not a crime of violence under the ACCA when the offense carries a less severe penalty than a greater offense that includes it. <em>See id. </em>at 2277; <em>see also id. </em>at 2293 (Kagan, J., dissenting). \u201cIt is a firm rule of this circuit that in the absence of an intervening contrary or superseding decision by this court sitting en banc or by the United States Supreme Court, a panel cannot overrule a prior panel\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Burge v. Parish of St. Tammany, </em>187 F.3d 452, 466 (5th Cir.1999). As Whitfield\u2019s argument remains foreclosed by our decision in <em>Harrimon, </em>the district court did not err in overruling his objection to its finding that he had a prior crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a). His sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b441-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
