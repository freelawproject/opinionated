In 2008 he filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. He sought asylum based on his political opinion and membership in the Human Rights Defense Group and his father\u2019s membership in the Southern Cameroon National Council. In 2009 the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued a notice to appear to Dinou alleging he was subject to removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">At his removal hearing, Dinou testified that his father had been arrested in Cameroon and had disappeared. He also testified that when he returned to Cameroon from Italy to look for his father he was arrested, imprisoned, and tortured. He submitted a document that he asserted was a State Department country report on Cameroon which referred to his father\u2019s disappearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">The IJ found the country report had been altered to include the reference to Dinou\u2019s father. Based on the- fabricated country report, the lack of other corroborating documents, and the inconsistency and implausibility of Dinou\u2019s testimony, the IJ found that Dinou\u2019s testimony was \u201cflawed, lacking in details, unpersuasive, and not credible.\u201d Based on that adverse credibility finding, the IJ found that Dinou had failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, making him ineligible for asylum.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She concluded that because Dinou could not satisfy the lower burden of proof for an asylum claim, he could not establish the higher burden for withholding of removal. Further, Dinou had failed to meet his burden to be eligible for CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and this petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">\u201cWhere the BIA issues a decision, we review that decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cInsofar as the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, we review both BIA\u2019s decision and the IJ\u2019s decision because the BIA adopt the IJ\u2019s reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">We review for substantial evidence the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s fact findings, and we review <em>de novo </em>their legal determinations. <em>D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817-18 (11th Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination is a finding of fact that we review for substantial evidence. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). The substantial evidence test is highly deferential, and we affirm conclusions \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence\u201d based upon the record as a whole. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>For us to reverse, we must find that the record compels a contrary conclusion, not merely that it supports one. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b867-17\">In order to be eligible for asylum, an applicant must establish with specific and credible evidence a well-founded fear of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>future persecution on account of a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b); <em>Mejia v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>498 F.3d 1253, 1256 (11th Cir.2007). The denial of asylum relief can be supported solely by an adverse credibility determination, especially if the alien fails to produce corroborating evidence. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. If the same facts underlie each claim, an alien unable to establish eligibility for asylum will fail to demonstrate eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief. <em>See Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, upheld by the BIA, was supported by substantial evidence. In addition to finding that Dinou had submitted a fabricated country report, the IJ pointed to inconsistent dates in Dinou\u2019s testimony and inconsistencies between Dinou\u2019s asylum application and his testimony. It also found his alleged concern for his father implausible because it was inconsistent with Dinou\u2019s actions, including a vacation to the United States and several months of delays in Italy before Dinou returned to Cameroon to look for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Accordingly, the record does not compel the conclusion that the BIA and IJ erred by determining Dinou was not credible. We therefore deny Dinou\u2019s petition for review on his asylum claim. Because Dinou is unable to meet the lower burden for asylum, he has also failed to show eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief because those claims are based on the same underlying facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-9\">. Flaubert Dinou is the lead petitioner. His daughter, Venus, is a derivative applicant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b867-11\">. The IJ also found that Dinou\u2019s asylum application was frivolous. Dinou was given an opportunity to withdraw the application, but he did not. The IJ further found that Dinou was \"firmly resettled\u201d in Italy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-8\">. Because we deny Dinou\u2019s petition based on the adverse credibility finding, we need not address whether his asylum application was frivolous or whether he had \"firmly resettled\u201d in Italy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
