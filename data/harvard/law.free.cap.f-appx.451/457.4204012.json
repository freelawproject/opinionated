The district court struck the petition because Gutierrez\u2019s counsel failed to include in it his federal-identification num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>ber, in accordance with Southern District of Texas Local Civil Rule 11.3A(4). Gutierrez contends the district court should have waived application of the local rule in the interest of justice. (Gutierrez filed a corrected petition after the first petition was denied, but this corrected petition was denied as untimely. He does not challenge that ruling.)</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">A district court\u2019s application of local rules is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>E.g., Victor F. v. Pasadena Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>793 F.2d 633, 635 (5th Cir.1986). Absent \u201cimpelling reasons\u201d, local rules should not be ignored. <em>Id. </em>Gutierrez offers no justifiable reason \u2014 much less an impelling one \u2014 for not applying the local rules in this instance. Accordingly, Gutierrez has not shown that striking the petition was an inappropriate exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 636.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b483-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
