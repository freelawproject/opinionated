The district court sentenced him to 180 months in prison, the statutory minimum provided by the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (ACCA). Eddins appeals, arguing that his 1985 Texas burglary conviction does not qualify under the ACCA. The Government moves for summary affirmance or, alternatively, an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">We review the interpretation of a sentence enhancement provision de novo. <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>402 F.3d 482, 485 (5th Cir.2005). Pursuant to <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 599, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990), generic burglary, which is a listed ACCA predicate offense, is the \u201cunlawful or unprivileged entry into, or remaining in, a building or structure, with intent to commit a crime.\u201d The charging documents to which Eddins pleaded guilty state that Eddins entered a building not open to the public, without the effective consent of the owner, with the intent to commit theft. This language tracks that of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) of the Texas Penal Code, under both the current version and the version in effect in 1985. We have held that burglary under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>\u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes generic burglary for purposes of the ACCA. <em>United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992); <em>see also United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 585-86 (5th Cir.2008) (noting that <em>Silva </em>held that burglary under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) is generic burglary). Ed-dins\u2019s reliance on our holding in <em>Constante, </em>544 F.3d at 587, that an offense under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) is not generic burglary because it lacks the requisite element of intent, is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Eddins attempts to distinguish his offense because it was a second degree felony under the 1985 version of the burglary statute and thus necessarily lacked the violent or potentially violent conduct that would make it a first degree felony. He relatedly argues that his crime did not involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, which he contends is required by the analysis of <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008). We discern nothing in his arguments that alters our holding in <em>Silva, </em>957 F.2d at 162, that the elements of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) correspond to those of generic burglary, i.e., the \u201cnonconsensual entry into a building with intent to commit a crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Finally, Eddins contends that the district court improperly enhanced his sentence in violation of the rule of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). He argues that whether the prior convictions were committed on different occasions, as required under the ACCA, is a fact that must be alleged in the indictment and either proved by the Government beyond a reasonable doubt or admitted by the defendant. As Eddins concedes, this argument is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. White, </em>465 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Although we conclude that the judgment should be affirmed without further briefing, summary disposition is not appropriate. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). Thus, we deny the Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance or, alternatively, for an extension of time to file a brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
