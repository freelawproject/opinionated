We review the Government\u2019s alleged breach of a plea agreement <em>de novo. United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">\u201cDue process requires the government to adhere to the terms of any plea bargain or immunity agreement it makes.\u201d <em>United States v. Harvey, </em>869 F.2d 1439, 1443 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>Cir.1989) (en banc). The federal courts, though, have authority to review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion only if the refusal is based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843-44, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). A defendant\u2019s claim that he \u201cmerely provided substantial assistance\u201d or generalized allegation of improper motive does not entitle him to a remedy. <em>Id. </em>at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Here, Davis does not allege that the Government had an unconstitutional motive in deciding not to file a substantial-assistance motion. Furthermore, the plea agreement gave the government sole discretion to determine whether Davis provided substantial assistance. The record reflects that the Government refused to file the motion due to Davis\u2019s untruthfulness and inconsistent cooperation, which is not an unconstitutional motive. Therefore, relief is not proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Davis also argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by using protected statements he uttered during his debriefing sessions at sentencing. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 provides that the admissibility of plea discussions and related statements is governed by Federal Rule of Evidence 410. Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(f). Rule 410 states that any statement made during the course of guilty plea proceedings or plea discussions with the prosecution that do not result in an ultimate plea are inadmissible against the defendant in criminal proceedings. In addition, the Sentencing Guidelines provide that when the Government agrees that self-incriminating information provided pursuant to the cooperation agreement will not be used against the defendant, such information \u201cshall not be used in determining the applicable guideline range, except to the extent provided in the agreement.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-8\">Here, the Government agreed not to use the statements Davis made pursuant to the agreement only if Davis satisfied the terms and conditions of the agreement. Davis did not comply with the terms because he did not fully cooperate with the Government; therefore, the Government did not violate the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">Finally, Davis argues several general violations of his plea agreement. When analyzing whether a defendant\u2019s rights have been substantially affected or prejudiced, we examine the three \u201ccore concerns\u201d of Rule 11: \u201c(1) ensuring that the guilty plea is free of coercion; (2) ensuring that the defendant understands the nature of the charges against him; and (3) ensuring that the defendant is aware of the direct consequences of the guilty plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1354 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). A plea colloquy is not grounds for reversal so long as it adequately addresses these three core concerns. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThere is a strong presumption that the statements made during the [plea] colloquy are true.\u201d <em>United States v. Medlock, </em>12 F.3d 185, 187 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-11\">Davis claims that the Government violated a prior agreement that it would dismiss a counterfeiting charge if he cooperated. Davis does not provide any evidence to support this assertion. Rather, Davis stated during his plea colloquy that he did not enter into an oral agreement with the Government after his 2005 arrest and that the plea agreement represented the entire agreement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-12\">Davis then argues that the Government failed to advise the court of the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>nature and extent of his cooperation. The record reflects that the Government did inform the court of Davis\u2019s cooperation. The Government characterized Davis\u2019s cooperation as \u201cunsuccessful\u201d and explained that he refused to fully cooperate. Additionally, a Federal Law Enforcement Officer testified that Davis had never been truthful, candid, or complete in his debriefings.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Lastly, Davis argues that the Government ignored his requests for counsel when Agents discussed his plea agreement with him and then incorrectly advised him about the terms of the agreement. However, Davis admitted during his plea colloquy that he had the opportunity to discuss his plea agreement with his attorneys and his counsel of record signed the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">After reviewing the parties\u2019 briefs and the record before us we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b903-11\">. The Government contends that we do not have jurisdiction over this appeal because Davis did not obtain a certificate of appeala-bility (COA). However, a COA is not necessary because Davis is not challenging the constitutionality of his sentence and incarceration through a habeas motion, but is simply seeking to enforce the terms of his plea agreement. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b903-21\">. Davis contends that he is entitled to relief under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(b). Although we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings, we cannot permit a party to bring a claim which they are prohibited from bringing under the Rules. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) (allowing a reduction in sentence for substantial assistance only upon the government's motion).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
