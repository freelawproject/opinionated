The court explained that McPhearson\u2019s previous guideline range was 262 to 327 months of imprisonment and that his amended guideline range was 210 to 262 months of imprisonment. The district court reduced McPhearson\u2019s term of imprisonment to 262 months of imprisonment, the top end of the amended sentencing range. The district court stated: \u201cThe reduced sentence is the statutory minimum sentence within the guideline range.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>McPhearson argues that the district court erred in reducing his sentence to 262 months when it intended to reduce it to the statutory minimum sentence, 210 months. The Government disagrees that the district court clearly intended to impose a sentence of 210 months, but it agrees that the district court\u2019s order is ambiguous on the intended sentence reduction and the court\u2019s understanding of its discretion under \u00a7 3582(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The district court may have simply mis-communicated its intended description of the 262-month reduced sentence, saying \u201cminimum\u201d when it meant \u201cmaximum\u201d sentence within the amended guideline range. Alternatively, the district court may have intended to note that the 262-month reduced sentence was the minimum sentence it could have imposed at the original sentencing, using the phrase \u201cguideline range\u201d to mean the original guideline range, not the amended guideline range. That description is unnecessary but not erroneous. On the other hand, the district court\u2019s statement could refer to the minimum of the amended guideline range, 210 months, indicating that the court intended to reduce McPhearson\u2019s sentence to the minimum term in the amended range. If so, the district court misstated its intended sentence, and McPhearson would be entitled to have the judgment amended accordingly to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">Another possibility is that the district court accurately stated its intent to reduce the sentence to 262 months but may have erroneously believed that it lacked the authority to reduce the sentence any lower. The district court\u2019s description of the 262-month sentence as the \u201cstatutory minimum\u201d might reflect an erroneous belief by the district court that the Sentencing Commission\u2019s policy statements limited the extent of a sentence reduction to the minimum of the original guideline range. The policy statements allow the district court to reduce a prison term to any point within but not less than the minimum of the amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A). The district court had the authority to reduce the sentence to 210 months if it so intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The district court\u2019s order is ambiguous as to the reduced sentence the court intended to impose and as to the court\u2019s understanding of the extent of its discretion under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). As suggested by the Government, we retain jurisdiction over the case and make a limited remand for clarification of the record. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Rodriguez, </em>640 F.3d 129, 134 (5th Cir.2011); <em>United States v. Runyan, </em>275 F.3d 449, 468 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">McPhearson argues that the circumstances of his erroneous release, rehabilitation, and reincarceration constitute a waiver by the Government of its jurisdiction over him, or warrant an evidentiary hearing on the propriety of the Government\u2019s inaction. He also argues that the district court erred in failing to give him credit for the time that elapsed while he was erroneously at liberty. For the first time in his appellate brief, he asserts that the district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, and he characterizes his motion for equitable relief as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Section 2241 is the proper procedural vehicle if a prisoner is challenging the execution of his sentence rather than the validity of his conviction and sentence. <em>Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). Because McPhearson is challenging the execution of his sentence, a \u00a7 2241 petition is proper. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830; <em>see also Leggett v. Fleming, </em>380 F.3d 232, 233-34 (5th Cir.2004) (action for credit against sentence for time spent at liberty brought under \u00a7 2241).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>However, McPhearson did not file a \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court. He filed a \u00a7 3582(c) motion and a motion to invoke the court\u2019s equitable authority. The district court determined that McPhearson\u2019s request for equitable relief did not fall within any of the limited circumstances by which the court could modify his term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c). Alternatively, assuming that it had the equitable power necessary, and assuming that McPhearson\u2019s motion was the proper avenue to raise such a claim, the district court denied the claim on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The district court correctly ruled that it lacked authority to grant McPhearson\u2019s claim for equitable relief under \u00a7 3582(c). Section 3582(c)(2) proceedings are not full resentencing proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2690-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). In ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c) motion, a sentencing court lacks discretion to reduce a sentence to a term that is less than the minimum of the amended guideline range as provided in \u00a7 1B1.10, p.s. <em>Id.; United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">McPhearson could and should have sought the relief requested in a \u00a7 2241 petition filed in the district of his confinement, in this ease in California. The only district that may consider a habeas corpus challenge to present physical confinement pursuant to \u00a7 2241 is the district in which the prisoner is confined. <em>Rumsfeld v. Padilla, </em>542 U.S. 426, 442-43, 124 S.Ct. 2711, 159 L.Ed.2d 513 (2004); <em>Lee v. Wetzel, </em>244 F.3d 370, 375 n. 5 (5th Cir.2001). The Government cannot be considered to have waived its objection to the district court\u2019s jurisdiction under \u00a7 2241. McPhearson did not assert below that the district court had jurisdiction to modify his sentence under \u00a7 2241, and the district court did not consider \u00a7 2241 as a possible source of jurisdiction. The Government objected to \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction at the first opportunity presented, in its brief opposing McPhearson\u2019s assertion of \u00a7 2241 jurisdiction in his brief for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">We AFFIRM the judgment denying equitable modification of the sentence. We REMAND to the district court for clarification of its intended sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b411-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
