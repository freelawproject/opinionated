He asserts that when he pleaded guilty to misprision of a felony in 2004, he relied on <em>In re Sloan, </em>12 I &amp; N Dec. 840 (AG 1968) (reversing 1966 BIA decision), that misprision of a felony is not a CIMT because the BIA did not issue a decision holding that misprision of a felony was a CIMT until <em>In re Robles-Urrea, </em>24 I &amp; N Dec. 22, 28 (BIA 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Our jurisdiction over an immigration proceeding is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Section 1252(a)(2)(C) \u201cgenerally prohibits judicial review of \u2018any final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed\u2019 certain designated criminal offenses.\u201d <em>Larin-Ulloa v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 456, 460-61 (5th Cir.2006) (aggravated felony case). However, \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D) provides that judicial review of \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law\u201d is not precluded. <em>Id. </em>at 461. Whether a past conviction constitutes a CIMT is a question of law. <em>Smalley v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 332, 335 (5th Cir.2003). As the question whether Ahmad committed a CIMT is a legal one, we have jurisdiction to review this question, and our review is de novo. <em>See Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>519 F.3d 532, 538 (5th Cir.2008). We review the BIA\u2019s decision and the decision of the IJ to the extent that it influenced the BIA. <em>Zhu v. Gonzales, </em>493 F.3d 588, 593-94 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Ahmad\u2019s arguments hinge on his assertion that he relied on the 1966 BIA ruling in <em>In re Sloan, </em>that misprision of a felony is not a CIMT. The BIA found that \u201cthere was no settled rule of law for him to rely upon.\u201d This is correct. The United States Attorney General reversed <em>In re Sloan </em>in 1968, and the reversal was noted by this court in 2003. <em>Smalley, </em>354 F.3d at 339 n. 6 (stating that <em>In re Sloan </em>lacked any precedential value). Accordingly, the BIA did not err in finding that Ahmad was removable for having committed a CIMT. This portion of Ahmad\u2019s petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">As Ahmad committed a CIMT, the review preclusion provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 apply. <em>See Smalley, </em>354 F.3d at 335-39. Ahmad argues, without any specific allegation of error, that he is eligible for a waiver of inadmissibility under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). We do not have jurisdiction to review discretionary determinations related to an application for a waiver of inadmissibility under \u00a7 1182(h). <em>Cabral v. Holder, </em>632 F.3d 886, 889 (5th Cir.2011). As Ahmad has raised no legal or constitutional questions, this portion of Ahmad\u2019s petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">Ahmad argues that he is eligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b. \u201cA court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d \u00a7 1252(d)(1). To satisfy the exhaustion requirement of \u00a7 1252(d)(1), a petitioner must fairly present an issue to the BIA. <em>Claudio v. Holder, </em>601 F.3d 316, 318 (5th Cir.2010). Compliance with \u00a7 1252(d)\u2019s exhaustion requirement is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318, 324-25 (5th Cir.2009). The record shows that he did not present this issue to the BIA. This portion of Ahmad\u2019s petition for review is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">PETITION DENIED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b465-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
