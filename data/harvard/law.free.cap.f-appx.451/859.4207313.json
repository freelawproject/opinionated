Chinn argues on appeal that PNC Bank wrongfully initiated foreclosure proceedings in violation of 12 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h). After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal for failure to state a claim. <em>Cunningham v. Dist. Attorney\u2019s Office for Escambia County, </em>592 F.3d 1237, 1255 (11th Cir.2010). In reviewing a dismissal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), we view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and accept well-pleaded facts as true. <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir.2007). Although the complaint need not set forth detailed factual allegations, it must allege sufficient facts to render the claim \u201cplausible on its face.\u201d <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">Section 590.4 of the Code of Federal Regulations, entitled \u201cFederally-related residential manufactured housing loans-consumer protection provisions,\u201d sets forth a federal preemption scheme that protects certain borrowers from unfair lending and foreclosure practices. <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(b)(1). The regulation applies only to \u201cmanufactured homes\u201d as defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5402(6). <em>See </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.2(g); 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">The district court dismissed Chinn\u2019s claim because Chinn\u2019s residence is not a \u201cmanufactured home\u201d and therefore 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h) is not applicable to her claim. Chinn did not argue on appeal that 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4(h) applied to her residence and has therefore abandoned the argument. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (stating although we liberally construe pro se briefs, issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief are deemed abandoned). Even if Chinn had made this argument, it would have failed. The plain language of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 590.4 explicitly limits its scope to manufactured housing, defined as structures \u201ctransportable in one or more sections.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 5402(6). Chinn did not allege in her complaint that her property qualifies as a manufactured home and the district court, relying on readily accessible public records, took judicial notice that Chinn\u2019s property is not manufactured housing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-7\">. A district court may take judicial notice of facts capable of accurate and ready determination by using sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned, including pub-lie records. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 20(b); <em>Garfield v. NDC Health Corp., </em>466 F.3d 1255, 1260 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
