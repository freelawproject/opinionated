(He does not challenge the dismissal of the individual defendants.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Sublet\u2019s claim arises out of being handcuffed. (He has abandoned his claim regarding resulting medical treatment.) He contends the district court erred in ruling it lacked jurisdiction because his physical injury was inadequate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(2) (prisoners may not bring action against United States for mental or emotional injury without first showing physical injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">A Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) dismissal is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards as the district court. <em>E.g., Rodriguez v. Christus Spohn Health Sys. Corp., </em>628 F.3d 731, 734 (5th Cir.2010) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Sublet, as the party invoking the district court\u2019s jurisdiction, had the burden of proving that jurisdiction existed. <em>E.g., Ramming v. United States, </em>281 F.3d 158, 161 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Although Sublet relies on an affidavit and medical records attached to his brief here, we \u201cgenerally will not enlarge the record to consider evidence that was not before the district court\u201d. <em>Price v. Johnson, </em>600 F.3d 460, 465 (5th Cir.2010). Sublet points to nothing in the record showing the district court clearly erred in finding his injury consisted of only temporary pain stemming from numbness and tenderness in his left hand and arm. Because his physical injury was <em>de minimis, </em>his compensatory-damages claim was properly dismissed. \u00a7 1346(b)(2); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997) (construing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e)) (holding bruised ear that was sore for three days was <em>de minimis </em>injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">Sublet also challenges the dismissal of his punitive-damages claim. But, the FTCA specifically states: \u201cThe United States ... shall not be liable ... for punitive damages\u201d. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2674.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Finally, Sublet complains that \u201crecords show no completion of a BP-140 (Injury Report)\u201d. Because he did not raise this claim in the district court, it will not be considered on appeal. <em>E.g., Stewart Glass &amp; Mirror, Inc. v. U.S. Auto Glass Disc. Ctrs., Inc., </em>200 F.3d 307, 316-17 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
