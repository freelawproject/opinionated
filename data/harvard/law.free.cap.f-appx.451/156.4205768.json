By a short separate trial and special verdict, the jury also found that the sum of $363,522.75 in U.S. currency and property known as 444 East Mount Pleasant Avenue in Philadelphia were involved in the money laundering offense or traceable to it (and thus forfeitable under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-22\">Rashid\u2019s sentencing hearing took place on May 17, 1994. In the judgment of sentence, dated May 17, 1994, and entered on the record on May 31, 1994, the District Court imposed a term of imprisonment of 168 months, three years of supervised release, a $15,000 fine, a $2,700 special assessment, and an order of restitution in the amount of $1,696,47o.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>the District Court also signed a separate order, entered on the docket two days later, granting the Government\u2019s motion for an entry of forfeiture relating to the sum of $368,522.75 and the property known as 444 East Mount Pleasant Avenue in Philadelphia.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Rashid appealed from the judgment of sentence, which this Court affirmed. <em>See United States v. Rashid, </em>66 F.3d 314 (3d Cir.1995) (unpublished table decision). As we have explained before, the forfeiture aspect of Rashid\u2019s case continued in the District Court: \u201cas part of the criminal forfeiture order, the district judge required the United States to publish notice of the forfeiture so third parties could claim any possible interest in the property before the United States sold it.\u201d <em>United States v. Rashid, </em>373 Fed.Appx. 234, 236 (3d Cir.2010). The subsequent ancillary proceedings included a challenge from Rashid\u2019s wife, as trustee on behalf of her minor children, who filed a petition for declaration of innocent owner status and remission of forfeited property. <em>Id. </em>The District Court denied the petition, and we affirmed the decision on appeal. <em>Id. </em>There were also proceedings in District Court to adjudicate a saving and loan\u2019s interest in the property. After that hearing, in May 1997, the Government moved for \u201cjudgment and final order of forfeiture,\u201d and, on May 19, 1997, the District Court entered a \u201cjudgment and final order of forfeiture as to Amin A. Rashid re: $363,522.75 in U.S. Currency and the premises known as 444 East Mount Pleasant Ave., Phila., PA.\u201d District Court Docket Entry No. 310. Rashid appealed without success. <em>See United States v. Rashid, </em>168 F.3d 480 (3d Cir.1998) (unpublished table decision). It appears that the property was sold by the United States Marshals Service in September 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In various proceedings, Rashid has challenged his judgment of sentence and the forfeiture order since their imposition. In a more recent challenge to the forfeiture order, in 2009, he filed three motions: (1) a motion for reconsideration of a 1999 District Court order that had denied Rashid\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion; (2) a motion to intervene on behalf of his adult sons; and (3) a motion \u201cto void ab initio criminal forfeiture of 444 East Mount Pleasant Ave.\u201d The District Court denied the three motions, which we have described as motions seeking reconsideration of the criminal forfeiture order, <em>United States v. Rashid, </em>373 Fed.Appx. 234, 237 (3d Cir.2010), and a subsequent motion for reconsideration of that denial. We affirmed the District Court\u2019s orders. <em>Rashid, </em>373 Fed.Appx. at 237-39 (agreeing that the motion for reconsideration of the 1999 order was \u201cabsurdly tardy\u201d and otherwise finding no error in the District Court\u2019s rulings).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">This past August in the District Court, Rashid filed a \u201cmotion to void free-standing criminal forfeiture order.\u201d In his motion, he argued that the District Court\u2019s failure to have included the forfeiture order in the judgment makes the forfeiture order void, citing <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>423 F.3d 271 (3d Cir.2005). The District Court ruled that all issues were presented in previous motions and resolved by previous orders, noting specifically Rashid\u2019s 2009 challenge to the forfeiture order and our decision affirming the orders denying those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Rashid appeals. In response to his case being listed for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e) or for possible summary action, Rashid presents a motion for summary reversal of the District Court\u2019s decision. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>issue is presented on appeal, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>3d Cir. Local Rule 27.4; 3d Cir. I.O.P. 10.6. We will deny Rashid\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">After reviewing the motions that the District Court discussed as well as other filings, it does not appear that Rashid has raised this particular issue based on <em>Bennett </em>before (although in his bankruptcy proceedings, he did make an apparently similar claim that the District Court did not include the provision for criminal forfeiture in the judgment and commitment order, <em>see In re Rashid, </em>No. 04-1585, 2004 WL 2861872, at *5, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25032, at *13-14 (E.D.Pa. Dec. 13, 2004)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, regardless of whether Rashid raised this issue before and putting aside whether he even could have raised it properly at this point through the motion he filed, the issue is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">As Rashid points out, in <em>Bennett, </em>we said that that \u201ca freestanding final order of forfeiture\u2019 has no legal effect.\u201d 423 F.3d at 275. However, Rashid omitted an important word from that sentence. The word we used to modify our discussion of freestanding final orders of forfeiture was the word \u201csuch\u201d (specifically, we stated, \u201csuch a freestanding final order of forfeiture\u2019 has no legal effect,\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 275). The \u201csuch\u201d described a type of forfeiture order entered pursuant to Rule 32.2(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See id. </em>As we noted in <em>Bennett, </em>under Rule 32.3(b)(3), a final order of forfeiture is normally part of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 275 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">However, as we pointed out in <em>Bennett, </em>there is a \u201csecond kind of \u2018final order of forfeiture.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 275 n. 1. In some cases, as in Rashid\u2019s, but not in Bennett\u2019s, the forfeiture involves ancillary proceedings to adjudicate the rights of the third parties to the forfeited property. In those cases, the procedural rule is different: \u201cthe court enters a \u2018final order of forfeiture by amending the preliminary order as necessary to account for any third-party rights.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 275 n. 1 (citing Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(c)(2)). Our holding in <em>Bennett </em>recognized that difference. As Rashid contends, in Bennett\u2019s case, we held, \u201cin accordance with the language of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, that the final order of forfeiture must be included in the sentence and judgment imposed on the defendant.\u201d <em>Bennett, </em>423 F.3d at 276. However in the very next sentence, we stated, <em>\u201c[e]xcept in ancillary proceedings </em>... a final order of forfeiture\u2019 that is not part of the judgment has no effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added) (also referring to the first footnote in the decision, where we distinguished forfeiture orders that are normally part of the sentence from orders in forfeiture cases that involve ancillary proceedings).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">In short, Rashid\u2019s case is distinguishable from Bennett\u2019s. Although his order of forfeiture was entered separately from his judgment of sentence, as was Bennett\u2019s, his case, unlike Bennett\u2019s, included ancillary proceedings. Given the ancillary proceedings in Rashid\u2019s case, the portions of <em>Bennett </em>that Rashid cites, when read in context, do not support his claim that the forfeiture order is void.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">For these reasons, the District Court properly denied Rashid\u2019s \u201cmotion to void <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>free-standing criminal forfeiture order.\u201d We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment. Rashid\u2019s motion for summary reversal is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-13\">. The obligation to pay restitution was later discharged in bankruptcy proceedings. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number><em>In re Rashid, </em>210 F.3d 201, 209 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b185-8\">. In that case, the District Court concluded that \"Rashid could have raised any challenge to the criminal judgment form \u2014 which is, in essence, a challenge the forfeiture itself \u2014 in that earlier litigation. His failure to do so bars him from litigating this claim in the present action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *5, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 25032, at *14. Although we reversed one unrelated aspect of the District Court's ruling, we affirmed on all other grounds. <em>In re Rashid, </em>210 F.3d 201 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
