He argues that the district court did not provide adequate reasons for the dismissal and it erred by failing to address the merits of his arguments. The Government has moved for dismissal of the appeal, summary affirmance, or an extension of time to brief the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-20\">Alexander, who remains incarcerated, is not eligible for coram nobis relief. <em>See United States v. Esogbue, </em>357 F.3d 532, 534 (5th Cir.2004) Alexander\u2019s pleading challenged his federal sentence and is therefore a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court lacked jurisdiction because Alexander has previously filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, and we have not authorized him to file a successive motion. <em>See Hooker v. Sivley, </em>187 F.3d 680, 681-82 (5th Cir.1999). As the appeal is utterly without merit, the motion to dismiss is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); <em>see </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The Government\u2019s alternative motions for summary affirmance or an extension of time to brief the merits are DENIED. We CAUTION Alexander that future frivolous filings may result in the imposition of sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b493-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
