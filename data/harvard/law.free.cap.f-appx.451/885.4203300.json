The district court reimposed the 144-month sentence after having granted Barrow\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate the original sentence. On appeal, Barrow argues that the district court erred by including his prior conviction for resisting a police officer with violence, under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, when applying the career offender provision of the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-26\">We apply <em>de novo </em>review to the district court\u2019s decision to sentence a defendant as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Whitson, </em>597 F.3d 1218, 1220 (11th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>In order to be sentenced as a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant must have at least two felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1(a). For purposes of the career offender provision, the Guidelines define a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as one that \u201c(1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-4\">In <em>United States v. Nix, </em>628 F.3d 1341, 1342 (11th Cir.2010), this Court held that a conviction for resisting a police officer with violence, in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01, constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). We have repeatedly recognized that the ACCA\u2019s definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)\u2019s definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). As a result, <em>Nix </em>forecloses Barrow\u2019s argument that a conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 843.01 is not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">We reject Barrow\u2019s contention that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010), compels this Court to modify our binding precedent. In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court held that a battery under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(l)(a) is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>at 1270. The <em>Johnson </em>court, however, explicitly declined to consider the meaning of \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA\u2019s \u201cresidual clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274. Because the ACCA\u2019s \u201cresidual clause\u201d is at issue here, <em>Johnson </em>is not clearly on point and does not bind us in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-10\">Accordingly, the district court did not err in sentencing Barrow as a career offender based on his prior conviction for resisting an officer with violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b912-8\">. We find persuasive this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>440 Fed.Appx. 857, 858 (11th Cir.2011) (unpublished). In <em>Jackson, </em>a panel of this Court affirmed a determination that resisting an officer with violence under Florida law was a \"violent felony\u201d within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court, however, subsequently remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Johnson. </em>On remand, this Court noted <em>Nix </em>remained binding precedent and again held that \"resisting an officer with violence constitutes a violent felony within the meaning of the residual clause of the ACCA.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
