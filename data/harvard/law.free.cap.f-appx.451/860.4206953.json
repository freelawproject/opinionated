Finklea argues that the district court violated his rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments by sentencing him as a career criminal based on prior convictions that were neither charged in his indictment nor admitted by him. Fink-lea\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1222, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and Finklea acknowledges that we are \u201cbound to follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until the Supreme Court itself overrules that decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>242 F.3d 1028, 1035 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">We AFFIRM Finklea\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
