Instead of taking a direct appeal, Fake filed a collateral attack motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied the motion on May 8, 2008, and we denied Fake\u2019s request for a certificate of appeala-bility. <em>See United States v. Fake, </em>C.A. No. 08-2789 (3d Cir. Dec. 5, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-22\">On July 22, 2011, Fake filed a self-styled application for a \u201cwrit of error coram vo-bis.\u201d Fake contended in that application that she was \u201c \u2018denied\u2019 her 5th, 6th, [and] 14th Amendment rights], where the prosecution set forth \u2018materially false facts\u2019 by a deliberate deception of the courts by the presentation of known false evidence which is incompatible with rudimentary demands of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-23\">By order entered August 25, 2011, the District Court denied Fake\u2019s application. The District Court found it to be \u201cnothing more than a second 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, but under a different name.\u201d The District Court explained to Fake that if she \u201cwishes to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, she must seek leave to do so from the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d Fake filed a notice of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-24\">We will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s August 25, 2011 order because this appeal fails to present a substantial question. <em>See Murray v. Bledsoe, </em>650 F.3d 246, 247 (3d Cir.2011) (per curiam). Fake\u2019s application for a writ of error co-ram vobis was an impermissible successive collateral attack, and the District Court appropriately rejected it as such. <em>See Robinson v. Johnson, </em>313 F.3d 128, 139-40 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-25\">We note for Fake\u2019s benefit that the presumptive means by which a federal prisoner can challenge the validity of her conviction or sentence is a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>See Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). In order to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, Fake must apply for permission directly from this Court and meet the ga-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>tekeeping standard set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-20\">.
