He seeks to appeal the dismissal of his suit alleging that the defendants violated his civil rights when they failed to financially compensate him after he submitted to them, and they used, his plans for a device designed to stop the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The district court dismissed the suit without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(b) because Vann did not comply with the magistrate judge\u2019s order to answer a questionnaire seeking further information about his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">Vann\u2019s IFP motion challenging the certification decision \u201cmust be directed solely to the trial court\u2019s reasons for the certification decision.\u201d <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). This court\u2019s inquiry into whether the appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cTo aid in the determination of whether an IFP complaint if frivolous or fails to state a claim, this Court has approved the use of an evidentiary hearing or questionnaires.\u201d <em>Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999) (citing <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179, 181-82 (5th Cir.1985)). A district court may sua sponte dismiss an action for failure to prosecute or to comply with any court order. Rule 41(b); <em>McCullough v. Lynaugh, </em>835 F.2d 1126, 1127 (5th Cir.1988). Because the dismissal at issue was without prejudice and the applicable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>statute of limitations would not currently bar Vann\u2019s refiling of the suit, we review for an abuse of discretion. <em>See McCullough, </em>835 F.2d at 1127; <em>Berry v. CIG-NA/RSI-CIGNA, </em>975 F.2d 1188, 1190-91 (5th Cir.1992); <em>Helton v. Clements, </em>832 F.2d 332, 334 (5th Cir.1988); Tex. Civ. Prac. <em>&amp; </em>Rem.Code Ann. \u00a7 16.003(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Given that the \u201canswers\u201d that he provided (including one advising that pertinent information would not be supplied until discovery) were brief and generally unresponsive, and, further, given that the great majority of his response challenged the magistrate judge\u2019s authority to issue the questionnaire and threatened legal action against the district court, Vann fails to show that the district court abused its discretion. <em>See McCullough, </em>835 F.2d at 1127. Vann\u2019s motion to proceed IFP is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
