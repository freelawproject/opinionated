Terry Iven Smith appeals his conviction of conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute (Record No. 0845-85). On appeal, these cases have been consolidated as they raise the following identical issues: (1) whether a wiretap interception was valid under the \u201cVirginia Wiretap Statute;\u201d and (2) whether the \u201cVirginia Wiretap Statute\u201d is void for vagueness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>and therefore, unconstitutional. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Pursuant to an investigation concerning illegal drugs, an order was entered by a judge of the Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit, which includes Franklin County, to tap certain phones in Franklin County. All physical alterations, including splices, relating to the wiretap were performed in Franklin County. The actual listening to and recording of the intercepted conversations occurred at a listening post in Henry County, which is outside the boundaries of the Twenty-Second Judicial Circuit. As a result of these wiretaps, evidence was obtained which led to appellants\u2019 arrests in Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Pursuant to a motion for a change of venue made by the appellants and the Commonwealth, the cases were moved to Montgomery County. Prior to their trials, appellants moved the court to suppress the evidence obtained pursuant to the wiretaps because they alleged the interception of the incriminating telephone conversations was illegal, The court denied the motions. George Clinton Smith was tried by a jury and convicted on the conspiracy charge and sentenced to serve forty years in the penitentiary and pay a $25,000 fine. In a bench trial, George Clinton Smith also was convicted of the possession of cocaine and sentenced to a concurrent term of forty years in the penitentiary and to pay a $25,000 fine. Terry Iven Smith was tried by a jury and convicted of the conspiracy charge and sentenced to serve twenty-five years in the penitentiary and to pay a $25,000 fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">I. The Wiretap Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">Appellants first argue that the intercepted conversations introduced at trial should have been suppressed because they were obtained in contravention of Chapter 6 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia, entitled \u201cInterception of Wire or Oral Communications.\u201d Specifically, appellants argue that the order obtained pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-66, which authorized the intercept of wire communications, was invalid. Code \u00a7 19.2-66 details when the Attorney General may apply for a wiretap authorization and provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">The Attorney General or Chief Deputy Attorney General, if the Attorney General so designates in writing, in any case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>where the Attorney General is authorized by law to prosecute or pursuant to a request in his official capacity of an attorney for the Commonwealth in any city or county, <em>may apply to a judge of competent jurisdiction for the jurisdiction where the proposed intercept is to be made </em>for an order authorizing the interception of wire or oral communications by the Department of State Police, when such interception may reasonably be expected to provide evidence of the commission of a felonious offense ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-6\">Such application shall be made, and such order may be granted, in conformity with the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-68.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">(emphasis added). Thus, the validity of the intercept order must be determined under the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-66 and 19.2-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-9\">Chapter 6 of Title 19.2 of the Code of Virginia contains two separate definitions of the term \u201cintercept.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-61(3) contains a general definition of \u201cintercept\u201d and states: \u201c\u2018Intercept\u2019 means the aural acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.\u201d \u201cAural acquisition\u201d means an acquisition by hearing. <em>See Cogdill </em>v. Commonwealth, 219 Va. 272, 277, 247 S.E.2d 392, 395 (1978). Appellants argue that this definition of \u201cintercept\u201d is applicable throughout the entire statute. Accordingly, they assert there is no \u201cintercept\u201d until the conversations are actually overheard. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cinterception\u201d means \u201can acquisition by overhearing\u201d). Applying this interpretation to their case, appellants contend that the \u201cintercept\u201d occurred at the Henry County listening post where the conversations were heard and recorded and thus, the intercept order was invalid as it was entered by a judge in Franklin County. As discussed below, Code \u00a7 19.2-68 was amended in 1980 and a second definition of \u201cintercept\u201d was added. As <em>Cogdill </em>was decided two years prior to the statutory amendment which added the second definition of \u201cintercept,\u201d <em>Cogdill </em>provides minimal guidance for the resolution of the issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>The second definition of \u201cintercept\u201d added in 1980 and contained in Code \u00a7 19.2-68(3)(e) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">A wire or oral communication shall be deemed to be intercepted ... in the jurisdiction where the communication is actually intercepted and the monitoring of such intercepted communication may be at any location within the Commonwealth of Virginia. <em>For the purposes of this section, the definition of \u201cintercept\u201d means the acquisition of the contents of any wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical or other device.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">(emphasis added). Code \u00a7 19.2-68 outlines the procedural requirements of a wiretap application and clearly qualifies Code \u00a7 19.2-66 which provides in pertinent part: \u201cSuch application shall be made, and such order may be granted, in conformity with the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-68.\u201d Thus, the Commonwealth argues and we agree that \u00a7 19.2-66, which delineates the parties who may initiate an application for a wiretap and the crimes for which a wiretap can be obtained, is subordinate to and must be read with Code \u00a7 19.2-68. Thus, this definition of \u201cintercept\u201d applies to both Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-66 and 19.2-68. For purposes of these sections, \u201cintercept\u201d means the physical act (such as splicing) by which the interceptor gains the ability to exercise dominion and control over the communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">In support of this we note that subsection (e) was added to the statute in 1980. <em>See </em>Ch. 244, Acts of Assembly of 1980. Prior to this amendment, \u201cintercept\u201d was defined in Code \u00a7 19.2-61(3) and meant an \u201caural acquisition.\u201d Under that definition, a wiretap order could only be entered by a judge sitting in the jurisdiction where the conversation would be heard. Thus, the Commonwealth points out that a wiretap order could be entered, for example, in Richmond, where the listening post would be located, while the actual conversation might occur in Franklin County. This would deprive the local authorities of knowledge of the investigation involving their jurisdiction. To avoid this result, the General Assembly enacted Code \u00a7 19.2-68(3)(e), defining \u201cintercept\u201d as the physical act of acquiring the means to intercept the conversation. As Code \u00a7 19.2-66 must conform with the requirements of Code \u00a7 19.2-68, we hold that the \u201cintercept\u201d in the instant case occurred in Franklin County when the telephone line was broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>and the splicing occurred. While we recognize that these intercepted conversations could not have been transcribed but for the listening post in Henry County where they were monitored, we note that these conversations could not have been monitored <em>anywhere </em>but for the physical alterations or \u201cintercept\u201d in Franklin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">This interpretation of \u201cintercept\u201d is reinforced by the additional language of Code \u00a7 19.2-68(3)(e) which states: \u201c[MJonitoring of such intercepted communication may be at any location within the Commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d Although \u201cmonitor\u201d is undefined by the statute, it is clear that in this context the legislature intended to distinguish between the terms \u201cintercept\u201d and \u201cmonitor.\u201d Under established principles we note that \u201c[n]on-technical words in statutes are taken to have been used in their ordinary sense and acceptation.\u201d <em>Gomes </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, 220 </em>Va. 449, 452, 258 S.E.2d 582, 584 (1979)(quoting <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boaz, </em>176 Va. 126, 130, 10 S.E.2d 498, 499 (1940)). \u201cMonitor\u201d is defined as \u201cto watch, observe, or check; to keep track of, regulate, or control the operation of.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">In summary, we find that the interception of the conversations occurred in Franklin County and was authorized by an order obtained pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-66 and 19.2-68. Additionally, we hold that the monitoring of these conversations occurred in Henry County and was authorized pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-68 (3) (e). Accordingly, we hold that the trial court properly denied appellants\u2019 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">II. The Constitutional Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Appellants next argue that the \u201cVirginia Wiretap Statute\u201d is void for vagueness and therefore unconstitutional. Specifically, appellants argue that the two definitions of \u201cintercept\u201d within the statute render it ambiguous. Further, they argue that the terms \u201cmonitor\u201d and \u201cacquisition\u201d are undefined. They contend that a fundamental tenet of constitutional law is that criminal statutes must be reasonably definite as to persons and conduct within their purview so that men of ordinary intelligence will not have to guess at their meaning and application. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Chatman, </em>538 F.2d 567, 568-69 (4th Cir. 1976). For this reason, appellants urge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>us to find this statute unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Upon examination of the record before us, however, we find that this issue was not presented to the trial court and is therefore improperly before this court. Rule 5A:18. Accordingly, we decline to consider this issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">However, we do note that the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires particular scrutiny of penal statutes to protect against arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement without fair warning that an act is prohibited. <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). The challenged portions of the \u201cVirginia Wiretap Statute,\u201d however, are not penal in nature. Rather, those sections simply prescribe the procedure for obtaining and conducting a wiretap. Thus, the void-for-vagueness doctrine is not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">Hodges, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
