On appeal, he challenges the refusal of the trial court to grant him access to certain corporate records, and he argues that the court erred in certain rulings regarding expert testimony. For the reasons stated below, we find error and reverse the convictions, remanding the case for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">White\u2019s Truck Stop, Inc., located off Interstate 81 in Rock-bridge County, Virginia, provides services for commercial truck drivers. David A. White owns the business, and first hired Patterson in February 1972. Patterson rose to become president and chief financial officer of the company, a position through which he managed the company\u2019s financial affairs. After an accountant allegedly found irregularities in the books which led him to believe that Patterson had been removing funds from the corporation, Patterson was fired on February 1, 1983. The matter was then taken to the appropriate authorities and this prosecution followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Patterson defended on two grounds. First, he claimed that he had broad authority to approve all expenditure of funds. He contended that this authority derived from a 1978 arrangement in which he personally loaned the corporation $136,000. Second, he argued that the types of transactions which he had engaged in were a common and accepted practice among members of this closely held corporation. In order to attempt to prove the facts relevant to his defense, Patterson sought, prior to trial, certain corporate records pursuant to then existing Rules 3AT4<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter referred to as the Brady<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> motion) and 3A:15<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (hereinafter referred to as the motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum). </em>At issue were requests for the production of the corporate minute books and for other corporate records and documents relating to the financial transactions of others in the corporation. The court ruled that only the corporate records involving Patterson\u2019s transactions were relevant to the proceedings, and refused to order the produc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tion of documents relating to four other named employees of the company. In reference to the minute book, the court determined that it would examine the book <em>in camera, </em>and photocopy any relevant pages for distribution to Patterson.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">At trial, Richard A. Nossen, an expert in the investigation, detection and analysis of financial crimes, testified that he had reviewed financial documents which had been introduced by the Commonwealth. Through his analysis of the documents, he concluded that some of the transactions were \u201cirregular.\u201d For example, Nossen stated that the \u201csame vendor\u201d method appeared to have been used whereby an individual would retain for his personal use the services of tradesmen who also provided services to the company. Tradesmen would present invoices to the company seeking payment for those services. Nossen maintained that the invoices for the individual\u2019s personal work were mixed with invoices for company work, thus causing the company to pay for services rendered to the individual. Additionally, Nossen described a second irregular transaction, the \u201cjournal adjusting entry.\u201d White\u2019s Truck Stop maintained a fund from which its employees could borrow money for their personal use. Once the money was borrowed, an entry in that amount was placed in the records of that employee\u2019s \u201caccounts receivable.\u201d Nossen testified that on various occasions Patterson borrowed money by this method. However, the books indicated that he was relieved of the obligation of repaying these sums due to adjustments made on various journal entries. Most noticeable, according to Nossen, were erasures on Patterson\u2019s \u201cemployee accounts receivable\u201d record.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">After explaining these two techniques, Nossen was asked whether he was able to form an opinion as to the \u201cregularity\u201d of the erasures on Patterson\u2019s \u201cemployee accounts receivable\u201d records. Nossen stated that \u201cthe erasures that I found there would constitute a highly irregular action on the part of the person who made them.\u201d Later in his testimony, Nossen again stated that an entry was \u201chighly irregular.\u201d When asked by the Commonwealth why this was so, Nossen replied: \u201cBecause it - it just doesn\u2019t conform to proper bookkeeping and accounting practices.\u201d Still later, Nossen again described a transaction as \u201chighly irregular.\u201d Patterson objected, arguing that these characterizations went to the ultimate issue in the case and invaded the province of the jury. The court overruled the objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>Nossen was also asked whether he was able to form an opinion as to the regularity of the transactions involving purchases from the same vendors. Nossen stated: \u201cIt is a common embezzlement technique.\u201d Patterson objected and moved for a mistrial. The court sustained the objection, struck the question and the response, denied the motion for a mistrial, and instructed the jury to disregard the statement. The court told the jurors that Nossen\u2019s testimony was offered only to assist them, and that they should form their own opinions as to Patterson\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Nossen also stated that his testimony and a summary chart used to assist him in that testimony were based upon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-6\">a review of the documentary evidence that has been received here, a summary of the oral testimony that was furnished to me by Mr. Kaestner [a private prosecutor employed by White\u2019s Truck Stop, Inc. to assist the Commonwealth] and .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-8\">based upon my review of the books and records, and based upon my preparation of the trial schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Patterson moved to strike all of Nossen\u2019s testimony, arguing that the testimony was based on out-of-court summaries of the testimony of other witnesses furnished to him by the private prosecutor. The trial court ruled that the testimony forming the basis of Nossen\u2019s opinion was in evidence, and overruled Patterson\u2019s objection.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-10\">The following issues are presented for our consideration:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">1. Whether the trial court erred in refusing to permit Patterson to have access to certain corporate records of White\u2019s Truck Stop, Inc., thereby preventing Patterson from presenting evidence in support of his theory of the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-12\">2. Whether the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness was required to aid the jurors in their determination, and whether that testimony invaded their exclusive province by going to the ultimate issue in the case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-13\">3. Whether the trial court erred by refusing to grant a mistrial when the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness spoke to the ultimate issue in the Case;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>4. Whether the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness used an improper basis in forming his opinion of Patterson\u2019s actions, and if so, whether that error requires reversal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">Through a <em>Brady </em>motion and a motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>Patterson sought access to certain corporate records of White\u2019s Truck Stop, Inc. Patterson attacks the trial court\u2019s ruling restricting his access to those portions of the corporate minute book which specifically refer to Patterson or to the general functions of the corporate officers. Additionally, he attacks the trial court\u2019s response to his motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Patterson objects to the limitations contained in this order. Patterson also sought access to the minute book by means of the same motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\"><em>Cox v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 324, 315 S.E.2d 228 (1984), established the framework for courts to analyze a motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum. </em>Cox was convicted of embezzling funds from the City of Fairfax. Cox filed a pretrial motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>seeking production of certain bank records. When the banks failed to produce a large amount of the requested material, the trial court conducted a hearing and ruled that the bank records were not material, and denied a request for a continuance. The Supreme Court held that the trial court erred in finding that the bank records were not material. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-6\">Article 1, \u00a7 8, of the Constitution of Virginia provides that, in criminal prosecutions, the accused has the right \u201cto call for evidence in his favor.\u201d This unqualified right includes \u201cthe right to prepare for trial which, in turn, includes the right to interview material witnesses and to ascertain the truth.\u201d <em>Bobo </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>187 Va. 774, 779, 48 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1948). <em>See also Winston </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>188 Va. 386, 49 S.E.2d 611 (1948). This right applies with equal force to the procurement of documentary evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b31-7\">When a defendant seeks disclosure of evidence, the standard to be applied in determining its materiality is whether \u201ca substantial basis for claiming materiality exists.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Agurs, </em>427 U.S. 97, 106 (1976). If materials in the hands of third parties \u201ccould be used at the trial,\u201d they are the proper subject of a subpoena <em>duces tecum. Bowman Dairy Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>341 U.S. 214, 221 (1951).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-5\">In the present case, the Commonwealth virtually conceded some of the bank records were \u201cnecessary and material to prove the Commonwealth\u2019s case,\u201d and the defendant produced witnesses, albeit at trial, who testified regarding the materiality of the records. Moreover, the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses relied in part upon some of these very records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 328, 315 S.E.2d at 230.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The Supreme Court of Virginia recently adopted a test to be used to determine if evidence not disclosed to the defense was \u201cmaterial.\u201d In <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 142, 341 S.E.2d 159 (1986), a crucial prosecution witness had \u201cfailed a polygraph test administered by the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 147, 341 S.E.2d at 162. This information was not revealed to the defense until the fourth day of trial, even though a <em>Brady </em>motion had been filed prior to trial. Upon disclosure of the information, the defense moved for a mistrial or a continuance to assess the impact of this seemingly exculpatory material. The court denied the motion. The Supreme Court affirmed, but defined \u201cmateriality\u201d in the process, adopting the language used by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. -, 105 S. Ct. 3379 (1985). That Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b32-10\">The evidence is material only if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b32-12\"><em>Id. </em>at_, 105 S. Ct. at 3384. The <em>Robinson </em>Court determined that the \u201cprobability\u201d did not exist in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-14\">Applying this test to the facts of the instant case, we conclude that a \u201creasonable probability\u201d does exist that undermines our confidence in the outcome of the trial proceeding. Through his motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum, </em>Patterson sought access to documents which he claimed would prove that there was an infor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>mal agreement among the members of this closely held corporation that the members, including Patterson, were entitled to use corporate accounts for personal purposes. While we do not condone the possible tax evasionary implications of these tactics, we nevertheless recognize that the existence of such a scheme would negate the element of intent required for a conviction of embezzlement from White\u2019s Truck Stop, Inc. \u201cSince the crime of embezzlement depends upon the existence of a fraudulent intent ... a wide scope is given to the evidence which may be introduced . . . in behalf of the defense to show the absence thereof.\u201d <em>Page </em>v. Commonwealth, 148 Va. 733, 741, 138 S.E. 510, 512 (1927) (quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Moyer, </em>58 W.Va. 146, 151, 52 S.E. 30, 33 (1905)); <em>see also Bourgeois </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 268, 273, 227 S.E.2d 714, 718 (1976). Patterson contends that he had the authority to engage in the \u201cirregular\u201d bookkeeping transactions and that the prosecution against him was commenced because of a \u201cfalling out\u201d between White and himself. Evidence of business practice and custom is often admitted to assist in interpreting contracts between parties, and in clarifying the intent of the parties in contracting. C. Friend, The Law of Evidence in Virginia \u00a7 151 (2d ed. 1983). The denial of access to the required documents raises a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that Patterson was unable to effectively assert his defense. For this reason, we reverse the rulings of the trial court which limited access accorded Patterson to the corporate minute book and the other materials listed in footnote 4. Upon remand, if a retrial is to be held, we instruct the court to fully grant the motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum </em>previously submitted by Patterson. We are not, by granting access to records which may be critical to the defense, ruling on the admissibility of such evidence at trial. Whether the evidence is material and relevant in proving or refuting an intent to embezzle is for the trial court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Patterson also claims that his <em>Brady </em>motion entitles him to have access to these documents. He concedes that documents not in the possession, control or custody of the Commonwealth cannot be discovered by a <em>Brady </em>motion. <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 377, 337 S.E.2d 729, 734 (1985). However, Patterson argues that the employment of a private prosecutor, hired by White\u2019s Truck Stop to work with the Commonwealth, effectively brings the documents within the possession, control or custody of the Commonwealth, and hence are discoverable under <em>Brady. </em>We do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>not reach the merits of this argument due to our holding that the trial court erred in limiting Patterson\u2019s access to the documents pursuant to his motion for a subpoena <em>duces tecum.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">Patterson also challenges the trial court\u2019s ruling with reference to the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness. First, he contends that the court erred in allowing expert testimony regarding accounting procedures because the testimony was unnecessary to aid the jurors in their determination. Second, he argues that the court improperly allowed the expert to voice an opinion on the ultimate issue in the case. We address these arguments in the order presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">As Patterson noted in his opening brief, the standard to be applied in Virginia concerning the admissibility of expert testimony was succinctly enunciated in <em>Coppola </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 243, 252, 257 S.E.2d 797, 803-04 (1979):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-8\">[E] Xpert testimony concerning matters of common knowledge or matters as to which the jury are as competent to form an opinion as the witness is inadmissible. Where the facts and circumstances shown in evidence are such that men of ordinary intelligence are capable of comprehending them, forming an intelligent opinion about them, and drawing their own conclusions therefrom, the opinion of an expert based upon such facts and circumstances is inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">Here, the trial court instructed the jury on the purpose of and weight to be given Nossen\u2019s testimony. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-10\">This witness is here because there are accounting techniques involved, and bookkeeping techniques that are probably outside the ordinary transactions of most people who serve on juries, or, for that matter, who serve in the court system. This witness is here to assist you, and for that purpose only. The decision, again, as to the ultimate question of guilt or innocence is only yours.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>It is well established that the admissibility of expert testimony is within the sound discretion of the trial court, and that court\u2019s decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Thorpe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 609, 614, 292 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1982). The trial court found that Nossen\u2019s testimony would be an aid to the jurors because the accounting techniques involved were likely to be outside the range of experience of most jurors. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">Patterson also argues that the trial court erred in permitting Nossen to state that certain bookkeeping transactions were \u201cirregular.\u201d He argues that, in the context presented, \u201cirregular\u201d was a not-so-subtle synonym for illegal. Thus, Patterson contends that Nossen improperly expressed an opinion on the case\u2019s ultimate issue, thus violating the Virginia rule of law in criminal cases. <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 538, 311 S.E.2d 769, 771-72 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">Patterson primarily relies on two cases in support of his argument. In <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>141 Va. 541, 127 S.E. 368 (1925), a bank officer was convicted of making entries with the intent to conceal the true standing of his own account. The Commonwealth asked a non-expert witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\">Will you state whether or not the effect of such entries made upon the books of the bank would be to conceal the true state of the account of John Mitchell, Jr., in the bank?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 565, 127 S.E. at 376. The witness answered: \u201cYes.\u201d The Supreme Court reversed the conviction because the witness spoke to the ultimate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-11\">In <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>204 Va. 24, 129 S.E.2d 22 (1963), the defendant was convicted of embezzlement. A witness was asked what was the \u201ceffect\u201d of two unrecorded receipts prepared by the defendant. In essence, the witness replied that they had the effect of replacing funds converted by the defendant for her own use. <em>Id. </em>at 33, 129 S.E.2d at 29. This was the ultimate issue in the case. The Supreme Court found error, and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-12\">In a similar fashion, the Supreme Court has ruled, for example, that (a) an expert in a capital murder case cannot state that the defendant did not \u201cdeliberate and premeditate at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>killing,\u201d <em>Waye </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 696, 251 S.E.2d 202, 210 (1979); (b) an expert in a rape trial improperly testified that the two victims had indeed been \u201craped,\u201d <em>Cartera </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978); and (c) an expert improperly testified that a statement made to the State Corporation Commission was \u201cnot a true statement,\u201d when the falsity of the statement was the ultimate issue in the case, <em>Thornton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>113 Va. 736, 744-45, 73 S.E. 481, 484-85 (1912).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">In the present case, we are unconvinced that Nossen\u2019s testimony regarding the \u201cirregular\u201d transactions went to the ultimate issue in the case. Patterson claims that he had the broad authority to engage in these transactions, and that others in the corporation did the same. The fact that transactions were \u201cirregular\u201d is not synonymous with their being illegal, or amounting to embezzlement. Indeed, Nossen highlighted the fact that his use of the term \u201cirregular\u201d concerned normal bookkeeping procedures, not the legality or illegality of the transactions. When asked why the entries were \u201cirregular,\u201d he replied: \u201cBecause it - it doesn\u2019t conform to proper bookkeeping and accounting procedures.\u201d Seen in this light, we find that the trial court did not err in permitting Nossen to testify as he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Patterson argues that the court erred in failing to grant a mistrial when Nossen testified that the \u201csame vendor\u201d technique was a \u201ccommon embezzlement technique.\u201d The court instructed the jury to disregard the question and answer. Patterson argues that the presumption that an improper remark can be cured by admonishing the jury is overcome in this instance due to the highly prejudicial nature of Nossen\u2019s statement. <em>See Stotler </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 2 </em>Va. App. 481, 485, 346 S.E.2d 39, 41 (1986). Due to the fact that we are reversing and remanding this case, we need not address the question whether the presumption was overcome in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">Patterson contends that the trial court committed reversible error in not striking all of Nossen\u2019s testimony because that testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>mony was based, in part, on the private prosecutor\u2019s out-of-court summary of the testimony of other witnesses. Nossen stated that his testimony was based on (a) a review of the documentary evidence in the case, (b) a summary of the other witnesses\u2019 testimony as related by the private prosecutor, (c) a review of the corporate books and records, and (d) his preparation of the \u201ctrial schedule.\u201d The court overruled Patterson\u2019s objection, stating: \u201cThe testimony [of the other witnesses] is in evidence. That\u2019s the thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">This question is governed by <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 557, 318 S.E.2d 386 (1984). There, in a capital murder trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s expert witness testified concerning the purported sequence of events leading to the victim\u2019s death. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">On cross-examination, Dr. Massello [the expert witness] admitted that his opinion was based upon his observations at the autopsy, which he conducted personally; his medical experience and training; the medical examiner\u2019s investigative report of death, which was in evidence; and the records of St. Paul Hospital, which were not in evidence. Simpson moved to strike the opinion, which was the only evidence relating Tabron\u2019s [the victim\u2019s] death to the crime, because of its partial reliance upon the hospital records.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 565, 318 S.E.2d at 391.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">The Court noted that, as a general rule, experts in criminal cases in Virginia may give opinions based only on either their own knowledge, or on the facts presented to them in a hypothetical. <em>Id. </em>The Court specifically held that Code \u00a7 8.01- 401.1, which deviates from this rule, applies only to civil actions. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 318 S.E.2d at 391. However, the Court found that the expert\u2019s opinion had a sufficient factual basis for admission without reference to the out-of-court hospital records.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">In conducting this analysis, the court implied, without explicitly so stating, that the hospital records were not a legitimate basis on which the expert could form an opinion. Without ever declaring it error, the Court held that the opinion was harmless in that instance because of the \u201cmore than sufficient\u201d foundation formed by the other bases of the expert\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>In the present case, we disagree with the trial court\u2019s ruling. It is true, as the court stated, that the testimony of the other witnesses was in evidence. This is not the point, however. Nossen\u2019s opinion was based not on that testimony, but on an out-of-court summation of that testimony. Neither Nossen, the court, the jury, nor we have any way to judge the accuracy and reliability of that summation. Nor can we assess the impact that the summation had on Nossen\u2019s testimony. As such, we hold that it was error for the court to allow Nossen to use the out-of-court summation as a basis for his opinion. In so doing, we in no way question the integrity of the private prosecutor or imply that he would intentionally color the summation given Nossen. However, the mere fact that, under the circumstances, the summation was given is sufficient to establish error.
