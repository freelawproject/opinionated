We reverse the Commission\u2019s decision denying disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">Laura J. Bradley, the employee, injured her back on December 10, 1984, while lifting boxes during her employment as a manager of a convenience store operated by Southland Corporation. She received medical attention from a physician she selected from a panel offered by Southland, but she did not miss any time from work. On April 15, 1985, she exacerbated her back injury while lifting boxes again. She reported the accident to her supervisor, but he did not direct her to seek medical care from Southland\u2019s panel of physicians or otherwise authorize her to obtain medical care at Southland\u2019s expense. She sought treatment from an orthopedic specialist who was not on Southland\u2019s panel of physicians. Southland denied liability for the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">The Commission denied Bradley disability benefits because she did not obtain medical care from a panel physician. It reasoned that, because Bradley was a store manager, she \u201cwas aware that the panel was posted on the bulletin board in her store,\u201d and that, since, at a recent store manager\u2019s meeting, her supervisor had discussed the procedure they were to follow when an employee is injured, she should have known of the \u201cnecessity that a panel physician be seen for industrial injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">The Commission\u2019s analysis overlooks Southland\u2019s failure to authorize Bradley to obtain medical care at Southland\u2019s expense. Without this authority the medical care would have been at Bradley\u2019s expense. An employee is required to accept only medical care which \u201cthe employer . . . furnish [es]. . . free of charge . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>Code \u00a7 65.1-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">Southland\u2019s denial of liability for the injury demonstrates why its authorization for medical Care was needed. In addition to refusing to pay Bradley compensation because she did not seek medical care from a panel physician, Southland also denied liability because, it contended, the injury did not arise out of the course of her employment. The Commission did not address this latter contention but it may have impacted Bradley\u2019s choice of medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Southland was not required to furnish Bradley medical service at its own expense if she were not injured in the course of her employment, <em>see McGregor </em>v. <em>Crystal Food Corp., </em>1 Va. App. 507, 509, 339 S.E.2d 917, 919 (1986); nor was it required to offer her a panel of physicians as required by Code \u00a7 65.1-88 when it denied her claim. <em>See Chesapeake Masonry Corp. </em>v. <em>Wiggington, 229 </em>Va. 227, 231, 327 S.E.2d 121, 123 (1985). Southland\u2019s denial of liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was equivalent to a refusal to provide Bradley with medical service.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Southland never repudiated this refusal to provide medical care. There was no evidence that the list of physicians posted on the store\u2019s bulletin board, the manager\u2019s manual, nor any statements made at the manager\u2019s meeting authorized Bradley to seek medical care at Southland\u2019s expense for an injury for which it had not acknowledged liability under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In the face of Southland\u2019s denial of liability, Bradley had no authority to obtain medical care at Southland\u2019s expense. Without authorization the expense of medical care may not be compensable. <em>Cf. Breckenridge </em>v. <em>Marvel Poultry Co., </em>228 Va. 191, 196, 319 S.E.2d 769, 772 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">Therefore, Southland could not refuse to provide Bradley with medical service and also insist that she seek medical care only from physicians it selects. That policy would require an employee to seek treatment from a physician chosen by the employer but would not require the employer to pay the physician\u2019s charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>The Supreme Court of Tennessee reached the same conclusion in <em>CNA Insurance Co. v. </em>Transou, 614 S.W.2d 335, 338 (Tenn. 1981). In responding to the argument of an employer who denied liability and contended that an employee should have chosen a physician from a list of physicians posted on a bulletin board at his place of business, it said: \u201cAn employer who denies all liability for an accident ... is in no position to insist upon the statutory provisions respecting the choosing of physicians.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">If an employer fails to furnish a physician, an employee may choose his own. Code \u00a7 65.1-88. Therefore, the Commission erred in determining that Bradley\u2019s claim for disability benefits was barred because she failed to select a physician from Southland\u2019s panel. For these reasons we reverse its decision and remand this matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b653-10\"><em> </em>The issue of whether an employee shall be denied disability benefits when an employer denies liability but offers the employee a panel of physicians at the employer\u2019s expense is not raised in this proceeding; therefore, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
