We reverse because the increase was not related to any evidence of actual expenses that the mother will incur on behalf of the child in the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">Plaintiff and defendant were divorced on July 11, 1978. Mrs. Young was awarded custody of their only child and began receiving child support payments of $150 per month which were increased to $175 per month in January, 1980, while Mr. Young was a college student. This current proceeding began with Mrs. Young\u2019s petition in the juvenile and domestic relations court for an increase in child support. That court awarded Mrs. Young $225 per month in child support. After a <em>de novo </em>hearing on Mr. Young\u2019s appeal, the trial judge set Mr. Young\u2019s monthly payment at $275 per month plus one-half of the cost of any medical expenses not reimbursed by insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-11\">Code \u00a7 20-107.2(2) vests discretion in the trial court in awarding child support and such awards will not be reversed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Thomas v. </em>Thomas, 217 Va. 502, 505, 229 S.E.2d 887, 889-90 (1976). Any award must be based upon the evidence relating to the factors contained in the statute, and the award must be re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>lated to the actual needs and expenditures made or to be made on behalf of the child \u201cwithin the immediate or reasonably foreseeable future.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 505, 229 S.E.2d at 889-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">When this case was heard in the circuit court, Mrs. Young and her ten-year old child were living with Mrs. Young\u2019s mother and paying her $225 a month for food and rent for both Mrs. Young and the child. Mrs. Young testified that she spent about $600 a year on vacations and planned to spend about $500 a year for the child\u2019s school clothes. School lunches would cost $20 per month. If she purchased a home, it would cost about $47,000 and her payments would be almost $500 a month.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">The judge found that it would cost about $200 to feed the child plus $100 a month for clothing and school expenses, including piano lessons, $50 a month for gifts, recreation, and vacation expenses, and approximately $200 for the child\u2019s portion of housing cost. Based upon all the evidence, the trial judge concluded that the average cost of maintaining the child in separate housing from Mrs. Young\u2019s mother would be about $550 per month. The trial judge expressed the opinion that each parent was responsible for one half of the child\u2019s expenses and fixed Mr. Young\u2019s payments at $275 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">Mrs. Young introduced evidence to prove what it would cost to live in a separate home from her mother. However, Mrs. Young did not testify that she would, in fact, obtain separate housing and there was insufficient evidence to prove that if she were awarded the increased child support, she would spend it on separate housing and expenses in the reasonably foreseeable future. <em>See id. </em>at 505, 229 S.E.2d at 890. Therefore, we reverse the judgment for this reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Because the case must be retried, we also point out that although both parents owe their child a duty of support during the child\u2019s minority, <em>Featherstone </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>220 Va. 443, 448, 258 S.E.2d 513, 516 (1979), there is no presumption that each party should contribute equally to the financial cost even if both earn the same income. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 20-107.2(2). The earnings of the parties is only one factor of the many enunciated in Code \u00a7 20-107.2(2).<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number><footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the \u201ccontributions, monetary and non-monetary, of each party to the well-being of the family\u201d is a factor that the trial court may weigh in setting the amount of support. Code \u00a7 20-107.2(2)(f). In a case such as this, where the parties earn about the same amount of income, approximately $25,000 annually, but one parent provides considerable nonmonetary contributions to the well-being of the child, the court in its discretion may require the other parent to pay more than one-half of the support. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Koontz, C.J., and Coleman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b107-7\"> The court, in determining the amount of support of a child or children to whom a duty of support is owed pursuant to \u00a7 20-61, shall consider the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">a.
