Adkins is permanently disabled by irreversible, third-stage byssinosis. Dan River contends: (1) that Adkins\u2019 claim is time-barred; (2) that the Commission\u2019s appointment of an independent expert under Code \u00a7 65.1-90 violated the Commission\u2019s own rules and deprived Dan River of due process; and (3) that no credible evidence supports the finding of byssinosis. We hold that Adkins\u2019 claim is time-barred and reverse the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">Adkins worked in Dan River\u2019s textile manufacturing establishment, with several interruptions in time, from the late 1920\u2019s to 1976. She retired on May 28, 1976. Adkins filed a claim with the Commission on May 24, 1983. At the time of Adkins\u2019 retirement, the worker\u2019s compensation statute provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">The right to compensation [for occupational disease] shall be forever barred unless a claim be filed with the Industrial Commission within three years for coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis and two years for all other occupational diseases after a diagnosis of an occupational disease is first communicated to the employee or within five years from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment, whichever first occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Code \u00a7 65.1-52 (1980 Repl. vol.). In 1982, the General Assembly amended this provision to read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">The right to compensation [for occupational disease] shall be forever barred unless a claim be filed with the Industrial Commission within one of the following time periods:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-13\">2. For byssinosis, two years after a diagnosis of the disease is first communicated to the employee or within seven years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment, whichever first occurs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">1982 Va. Acts c. 82 (codified at Code \u00a7 65.1-52 (1980 Repl. vol. &amp; Cum. Supp. 1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The deputy commissioner adversely decided the merits of Adkins\u2019 claim. In addition, the deputy commissioner concluded that although Adkins filed her claim within two years after a diagnosis was communicated to her, the claim was untimely because the five-year period in former Code \u00a7 65.1-52 expired on May 28, 1981, before the legislature extended the period to seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">A majority of the Commission found, as did the deputy commissioner, that Adkins received a diagnosis of byssinosis on May 17, 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Using the date of her retirement as the date of her \u201clast injurious exposure\u201d as provided by the statute, <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Buchanan County Coal Co., </em>54 O.I.C. 299 (1972), the Commission found that Adkins had filed her claim within the seven-year period of the amended Code \u00a7 65.1-52. In holding that the seven-year period applied, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">[T]he law in effect at the time of the accident is controlling in this case, and . . . under \u00a7 65.1-49, the date of communication of occupational disease to the employee is the date of \u201chappening of an injury by accident.\u201d The Commission has so held in prior cases including <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Co., </em>57 OIC 83 (1977).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Thus, the Commission concluded that Adkins filed her claim within the time allowed from the date of her \u201caccident,\u201d seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Chairman James, in a dissenting opinion, concluded that Adkins\u2019 claim was barred when the five-year period in former Code \u00a7 65.1-52 expired. He stated that Dan River then acquired a \u201cvested right\u201d in the limitations bar and the General Assembly subsequently could not revive Adkins\u2019 \u201cdead claim.\u201d As authority for this position, Chairman James cited, <em>inter alia, Parris </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Appalachian Power Company </em>(I.C. Claim No. 637-202). Dan River reiterates the \u201cvested right\u201d position of Chairman James\u2019 dissenting opinion and urges us to find <em>Parris </em>dispositive of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">In order to determine whether Adkins\u2019 claim was timely filed, we must decide whether to apply the limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.1-52 as it existed five years after the date of her last injurious exposure, or the limitation period in effect on the date that she first received communication of the diagnosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">In deciding to apply the limitation period in effect on the date Adkins first received communication of a diagnosos of byssinosis, the Commission did not address the issue whether Dan River acquired a vested right in the five-year limitation period of former Code \u00a7 65.1-52. That limitations period was in effect on May 28, 1976, the date of Adkins\u2019 last injurious exposure in employment. It remained in effect on May 28, 1981, five years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Former Code \u00a7 65.1-52 established a two-prong limitation covering byssinosis claims. Worded in the disjunctive, it provided that upon the occurrence of <em>either </em>event (two years after first communication of a diagnosis or five years from the date of last injurious exposure in employment), the employee\u2019s right to compensation for an occupational disease was forever barred. Each prong described a distinct event, measured from a different point in time. The occurrence of one event immediately triggered the statutory bar. Once a claim was barred, the employer acquired a vested right. In <em>Kesterson </em>v. Hill, 101 Va. 739, 45 S.E. 288 (1903), the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">[I]t has been held that the right to set up the bar of a statute of limitations as a defense to a cause of action after the statute has run is a vested right, and cannot be taken away by legislation, either by a repeal of the statute without saving clause, or by an affirmative act; and that it is immaterial whether the action is for the recovery of real or personal property, or for the recovery of a money demand, or for the recovery of damages for a tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 743-44, 45 S.E. at 289; <em>see also Hupman </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>640 F.2d 497 (4th Cir. 1981); <em>Nicholas </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Training School &amp; Hospital, </em>44 O.I.C. 198, 200 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">After the oral argument in Adkins\u2019 case, this Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision in <em>Parris </em>v. <em>Appalachian Power Co., 2 </em>Va. App. 219, 343 S.E.2d 455 (1986), concluding that an employee who had not filed a claim within the five-year limitation period of former Code \u00a7 65.1-52 could not receive the benefit of the later amendment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court held that the employer acquired a vested right in the running of the five-year limitation period. <em>Id. </em>at 228, 343 S.E.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">In <em>Parris, </em>the date of the employee\u2019s last injurious occupational exposure was October 22, 1975. In June 1981* he received a diagnosis of asbestosis. He filed his first claim in August 1981. In holding that the statute of limitations expired before Parris filed his claim, the court stated: \u201cThe running of the statute, standing alone, is a bar to subsequent claims. This is true even though the limitations period was subsequently amended.\u201d 2 Va. App. at 229, 343 S.E.2d at 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The court in <em>Parris </em>also acknowledged: \u201cWe note, however, that an amendment to a period of limitation that enlarges the period is generally applicable to existing causes of action provided that an action already barred is not revived.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229, 343 S.E.2d at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">We find the holding in <em>Parris </em>to be persuasive authority in the determination of Adkins\u2019 claim. In applying the <em>Kesterson </em>analysis to a workers\u2019 compensation claim, <em>Parris </em>recognized that once a single prong of the limitation period is fulfilled, the employee\u2019s claim expires and the employer acquires a vested right in its expiration.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>In <em>Buenson Division Aeronca, Inc. v. McCauley, </em>221 Va. 430, 270 S.E.2d 734 (1980), the Supreme Court emphasized the significance of a vested right in determining what limitations period is applicable to a given claim. In <em>Buenson, </em>the employee sustained an injury in January 1977. At that time, Code \u00a7 65.1-99 placed a twelve month limitation period on the filing of an application for review based upon a change in condition. This twelve-month period was measured from the last day for which compensation was paid pursuant to an award. Code \u00a7 65.1-99 was amended, effective July 1977. The amendment enlarged the limitations period to twenty-four months. The employee filed an application for a change in condition nineteen months after the last day for which compensation was paid. The Commission held that amended Code \u00a7 65.1-99 applied and allowed the claim. The Supreme Court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision and stated: \u201cPersuasive here is the fact that the new limitation period became effective before the old limitation would have barred McCauley\u2019s claim.\u201d 221 Va. at 434, 270 S.E.2d at 736. The court then distinguished that situation from a petition for appeal it refused in <em>Biller </em>v. <em>ARA-Va. Skyline Co., </em>219 Va. liii (1978). In <em>Biller, </em>the employee was last paid compensation for June 28, 1976. On December 6, 1977, he filed an application for review based upon a change of condition. The Commission denied the application based on timeliness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Supreme Court contrasted the facts of <em>Biller </em>with the facts before it in <em>Buenson:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-5\">Unlike the situation here, however, Biller\u2019s claim was barred by the old limitation before the enlarged restriction became effective. To have given retroactive effect to the amendment there would have resulted in the revival of a dead claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-6\"><em>Buenson, </em>221 Va. at 434 n.2, 270 S.E.2d at 736 n.2. Applying this principle, we find that to allow Adkins\u2019 claim based on amended Code \u00a7 65.1-52 would result in the revival of a dead claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>In finding that Adkins\u2019 claim had not expired, the Commission relied on Code \u00a7 65.1-49 and its holding in <em>Crenshaw </em>v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock </em>Co., 57 OIC 83 (1977). It reasoned that because \u00a7 65.1-49 assigns the date of first communication of the diagnosis of an occupational disease as the date of \u201chappening of an injury by accident,\u201d this became the \u201cinjury date\u201d for purposes of determining which limitations period applies to Adkins\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Although Code \u00a7 65.1-49 was designed to place occupational diseases within the general structural and definitional framework of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, we cannot find that it operates to fix the applicable limitations period where the specific statute setting forth the limitations period indicates a different legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">As stated above, both versions of Code \u00a7 65.1-52 establish a two-prong limitation period. One prong runs prospectively from the date of last injurious exposure in employment. The second prong runs prospectively from the date that the diagnosis of an occupational disease is first communicated. Thus, it is clear that the legislature intended that a different date fix the starting point of each of the two prongs. Both prongs contain an implicit recognition of the unique circumstances involved in making a claim for an occupational disease. In contrast, the purpose of Code \u00a7 65.1-49 is to place occupational diseases within the general operating framework of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act by creating a date of \u201cinjury.\u201d Without this statutory link, parallel provisions dealing with occupational disease would have to be enacted that would merely duplicate existing provisions of the Act pertaining to injury by accident. Therefore, we conclude that the creation of an \u201cinjury\u201d date in Code \u00a7 65.1-49 was not intended to limit or otherwise affect the unambiguous provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-52. Those provisions contain fixed starting points and must be applied as they are plainly worded.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Adkins\u2019 last injurious exposure in employment was May 28, 1976. At that time, former Code \u00a7 65.1-52 allowed her to file her claim either five years from this date or two years from May 16, 1983 (the date of first communication of a diagnosis of byssinosis), <em>whichever occurred first. </em>The five-year period expired first. This occurred on May 28, 1981. After that date, by operation of former Code \u00a7 65.1-52, Adkins\u2019 claim was barred. The amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ment to \u00a7 65.1-52 did not take effect until July 1982. It could not operate to extend a claim that was barred. <em>Parris, </em>2 Va. App. at 229, 343 S.E.2d at 460. To hold otherwise would negate the vested right which Dan River acquired on May 28, 1981, when the limitation period then in effect expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">We recognize that our interpretation of Code \u00a7 65.1-52 may result in an individual losing a cause of action for an occupational disease before he is first told he has the disease. This potential for inequity, however, is inherent in the two-prong nature of the statute. To eliminate any inequity, legislative action would be required. The legislature, in its 1982 amendment to Code \u00a7 65.1-52, partially acknowledged this problem by extending one prong of the time limit in byssinosis cases from five to seven years. While this does not eliminate the above-stated problem, it does evince a legislative intent to address the problem from <em>within </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-52, rather than by application of Code \u00a7 65.1-49 or any other section of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">We also note that in the special context created by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, this problem cannot be resolved by a liberal construction of the statute. As stated by the Supreme Court in <em>Winston v. City of Richmond, </em>196 Va. 403, 407-08, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">The right to compensation under the workmen\u2019s compensation law is granted by statute, and in giving the right the legislature had full power to prescribe the time and manner of its exercise. When the legislature has spoken plainly it is not the function of courts to change or amend its enactments under the guise of construing them. The province of construction lies wholly within the domain of ambiguity, and that which is plain needs no interpretation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.1-52 is part of the substantive right of recovery created by the Act. <em>Barksdale </em>v. <em>H.O. Engen, Inc., </em>218 Va. 496, 499, 237 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1977). Absent clear language to the contrary, this statute cannot be construed in derogation of another substantive right, namely, the vested right acquired by Dan River on May 29, 1981, when the five-year limitation period on Adkins\u2019 cause of action expired. Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>cordingly, we find that the Commission erred in applying the seven-year limitation period of amended Code \u00a7 65.1-52, and that Adkins\u2019 claim was time-barred after May 28, 1981, by the five-year limitation period in effect on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Cole, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-11\"> The diagnosis was actually communicated to Adkins on May 16. Dan River contends that Adkins did not prove that the diagnosis was communicated to her on this date; however, Adkins testified that Dr. Hayes informed her of his diagnosis on the date of her examination, May 16, 1983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b349-9\"> In <em>Parris, </em>the employee\u2019s claim alleged occupation-related asbestosis. He sought benefit of the 1983 amendment to Code \u00a7 65.1-52, Which removed the five-year limitation period for asbestosis and requires only the filing of a claim within two years after a diagnosis of asbestosis is first communicated to the employee. Prior to July 1, 1983, Code \u00a7 65.1-52 provided the same Imitations period for asbestosis as the pre-1982 language of that section allowed for byssinosis. Therefore, although <em>Parris </em>involved a different occupational disease, the statutory language interpreted by the court was the same as in the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b350-7\"> We note that in Biller, the employee was not seeking compensation as a result of an occupational disease. Therefore, in determining which limitations period applied, the Supreme Court needed only to consider the date of injury in determining whether a vested right had accrued, based on the statute of limitations in effect on that date. The court was not required, as we are here, to apply the two-prong provision of former Code \u00a7 65.1-52 in determining whether a vested right had accrued.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b353-7\">Benton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqO\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">I believe the Commission correctly determined that the statute in effect at the time that Adkins first received communication of a diagnosis of byssinosis governs this case. I would hold, therefore, that Adkins\u2019 claim was timely, and I would affirm the award of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\"><em>In civil actions </em>in Virginia, a party obtains a vested right in the protection afforded by a statute of limitations that has expired. When the limitations period runs without institution of suit, the legislature cannot disturb the right to rely upon the statutory bar. <em>Kesterson\u2019s Administrator </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>101 Va. 739, 743-44, 45 S.E. 288, 289-90 (1903).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> General statutes of limitations that govern civil claims are designed to require prompt assertion of claims. <em>See Locke </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Corp., </em>221 Va. 951, 957, 275 S.E.2d 900, 904 (1981). Generally, <em>in civil actions </em>the limitations provision regulates the availability of the remedy, which arises from a separate body of law. <em>See </em>53 C.J.S. <em>Limitations of Actions </em>\u00a76(b) (1948).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">Limitations measures occupy a somewhat different place in the workers\u2019 compensation statute, which creates purely statutory rights and obligations of employees and employers. <em>See Barksdale v. H.O. Engen, Inc., </em>218 Va. 496, 498, 237 S.E.2d 794, 796 (1977); <em>Winston v. City of Richmond </em>196 Va. 403, 407-08, 83 S.E.2d 728, 731 (1954). \u201c[C]ompensation acts are <em>sui generis, </em>and the rights and liabilities created thereunder are to be given full force and effect according to their own unique status, although they may not fit into the time worn grooves of other areas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>of the law.\u201d <em>Todeva </em>v. <em>Oliver Iron Mining Co., </em>232 Minn. 422, 428, 45 N.W.2d 782, 787-88 (1951). Unlike their analogues in the civil law, limitations provisions in Virginia\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statute, such as the measures in Code \u00a7 65.1-52, are part of the right as well as the remedy. In <em>Barksdale </em>the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\">[The claimant] argues that the limitation period in issue is more akin to the procedural statute of limitations in a common law tort action than to a wholly new statutory right of action. We do not agree. The right to recover under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, which is not based on negligence and is not barred by common law tort defenses of contributory negligence, negligence of a fellow servant, or assumption of risk, is a purely statutory right unknown at common law. The statute created a new right of action for the benefit of an employee or his dependents for work-related personal injuries or death without regard to the employee\u2019s negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">We have long recognized that there is a marked distinction between a pure statute of limitations and a special limitation prescribed by a statute creating a new right. The special limitation is part of the right as well as the remedy, an integral part of the statute, and a condition precedent to maintenance of the claim. As we said in <em>Winston </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, supra, </em>196 Va. at 407, 83 S.E.2d at 731, \u201c[t]he right to compensation under the workmen\u2019s compensation law is granted by statute, and in giving the right the legislature had full power to prescribe the time and manner of its exercise.\u201d Thus the limitation is a part of the new substantive right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-7\"><em>Barksdale, </em>218 Va. at 498-99, 237 S.E.2d at 796 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">The legislature can add a limitations provision to a basis for compensation where none existed previously, <em>see Allen </em>v. <em>Mottley Construction Co., </em>160 Va. 875, 170 S.E. 412 (1933); lengthen a limitations period, <em>see Buenson Division, Aeronca, Inc. </em>v. <em>McCauley, </em>221 Va. 430, 270 S.E.2d 734 (1980); or even do away with a limitations provision with regard to a particular type of claim. <em>See </em>1983 Va. Acts c. 469; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>E.I. DuPont De </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Nemours &amp; Co., 62 O.I.C. 322 </em>(1983). In each such case the legislature did more than merely fix a time period (or absence of such period) in which an employee must pursue her remedy under the workers\u2019 compensation statute; it changed in a significant way her <em>right </em>to compensation. I believe this aspect of limitations provisions in the workers\u2019 compensation statute should control the decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">A majority of the Commission took the view that the applicable limitations period was determined as of the date that Adkins received a diagnosis of byssinosis. The Commission\u2019s position is consistent with the workers\u2019 compensation statute which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">When the employer and employee are subject to the provisions of this Act, first communication of the diagnosis of an occupational disease to the employee . . . shall be treated as the happening of an injury by accident . . . and the employee . . . shall be entitled to compensation as provided by the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Code \u00a7 65.1-49. Dan River assails the Commission\u2019s reliance upon \u00a7 65.1-49, which it characterizes as \u201ca constructive, and artificial \u2018date of injury\u2019 <em>for administrative purposes </em>in accommodating an occupational disease coverage into an act structured for compensating victims of injury by accident.\u201d (emphasis added). Dan River maintains that Adkins\u2019 \u201ccause of action\u201d arose during her injurious exposure, before a diagnosis that would transform it into a \u201cright of action\u201d for compensation, and that the expiration of the five-year period in old \u00a7 65.1-52 barred forever her <em>right </em>to compensation. I believe that Dan River\u2019s position, which the majority opinion adopts, is unsupported by precedent and misperceives the nature of the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The date an employee receives a diagnosis of occupational disease is not simply an administrative device in the workers\u2019 compensation statute. It is instead a fundamental element in the scheme of rights and duties that exist under the statute. For example, in Code \u00a7 65.1-45 the legislature expressed an intention that employers and their employees voluntarily resolve cases of work-related disability. Accordingly, a disabled employee must give written notice to her employer within certain legislatively prescribed time limits. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-51 (within 60 days after di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>agnosis of disease); Code \u00a7 65.1-85 (within 30 days after an industrial accident). In Code \u00a7 65.1-49 the legislature fixed a definite point at which <em>both </em>the employer and employee can determine whether the employee\u2019s disability resulted from an occupational disease entitling her to benefits. <em>See Bray </em>v. <em>Dynatech Corp., </em>60 O.I.C. 57, 59 (1981). Code \u00a7 65.1-49 also provides a fixed point at which an employer\u2019s duty to furnish medical care can be determined. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 65.1-49;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Davis v. Armstrong Cork Co., </em>49 O.I.C. 86, 88 (1967). Significantly, an employee can lose the right to compensation even if her claim is filed within the pertinent limitation period if she fails to give the written notice required by Code \u00a7 65.1-51 and the failure prejudices her employer\u2019s rights. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lynchburg Foundry Co., </em>204 Va. 303, 307, 130 S.E.2d 429, 432 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Code \u00a7 65.1-49, in conjunction with Code \u00a7 65.1-50,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> further serves the substantive function of identifying <em>which </em>employer is liable for disability due to occupational disease. The Supreme Court explained this function as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">On a claim based upon an accident, the employer on the date of the accident is the employer liable, and that date determines the applicable notice equirements, statute of limitations, and rate of compensation. In a claim based upon a disease, the date of the accident (fixed by the statute as the date of the \u201cfirst communication of the diagnosis\u201d) plays a similar, but not an identical, role. Standing alone, it does not identify the employer liable on the claim; it is \u201cotherwise provided\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.1-50 which adds another criterion. Under that section, the employer on the date of the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>may be the employer liable but only if he is also \u201cthe employer in whose employment [claimant] was last injuriously exposed to the hazards of the disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Mary E. Coal Corp., </em>215 Va. 806, 809, 214 S.E.2d 162, 164-65 (1975). <em>See generally </em>Vokoun, <em>Using the Last Exposure Rule in the Determination of Liability of Employers and Insurers for Occupational Diseases, </em>20 Forum 102 (1984). It is of no consequence that Adkins suffered injurious exposure only in Dan River\u2019s employment; the signal importance of the date a diagnosis is communicated to an employee remains clear. By the plain terms of the workers\u2019 compensation statute, Adkins was not entitled to compensation or medical care, and Dan River was not liable for the benefits, until she received the diagnosis of byssinosis on May 16, 1983. On that date, Code \u00a7 65.1-52, as amended, applied to all diagnoses \u00f3f byssinosis first communicated to claimants after the effective date of the amendment, July 1982, and provided for the filing of a claim within seven years after the date of last injurious exposure. Adkins filed her claim with the Commission on May 24, 1983, Within the statutory period. I believe, therefore, that her claim was timely and that the time limit in effect at the date of communication of the diagnosis of injury was a part of Adkins\u2019 right to recover. <em>See Barksdale, </em>218 Va. at 496, 237 S.E.2d at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In my opinion, the majority\u2019s application of the statute in effect at the time of Adkins\u2019 last injurious exposure is contrary to the scheme of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Moreover, I find no Supreme Court case which suggests that the law in effect at the time of the last injurious exposure governs the filing of a claim. The result reached by another panel of this Court in <em>Parris </em>v. <em>Appalachian Power Co., 2 </em>Va. App. 219, 343 S.E.2d 455 (1986) is not inconsistent with a determination in this appeal that Adkins\u2019 claim was timely. In <em>Parris, </em>the employee received a diagnosis of occupational disease (in June 1981) <em>before </em>the effective date (July 1, 1982) of the amendment to \u00a7 65.1-52. 2 Va. App. at 220-21, 343 S.E.2d at 456. Furthermore, the reference in <em>Parris </em>to the date of last injurious exposure was germane only to the time the statute of limitation began to run, not to the question of which statute of limitations was to be applied. I believe that Parris\u2019 claim properly was barred because it was filed more than five years, <em>the limitations period in effect on the date of diagnosis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>from Parris\u2019 last injurious exposure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The majority opinion also cites in support of its position the Supreme Court\u2019s refusal of a petition in <em>Biller </em>v. <em>ARA-Va. Skyline Co., </em>219 Va. liii (1978). It should be noted, however, that in <em>Biller </em>the Commission held that the claim was controlled by the twelve-month limitation <em>in effect on the date of Biller\u2019s injury. </em>That was the basis of the decision from which the Supreme Court refused a petition for appeal. <em>See Biller </em>v. <em>ARA-Va. Skyline Co., </em>Claim No. 494-062 (unpublished opinion of the Commission, February 14, 1978). <em>Biller </em>is therefore in derogation of the majority\u2019s position and is more appropriately cited in support of the Commission\u2019s decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">It appears that the majority believes that the application of Code \u00a7 65.1-52, as amended, would constitute an impermissible retroactive application of a statute resulting in the impairment of a vested right which Dan River acquired. I believe that this case does not involve the retroactive application of the statute as amended or the impairment of vested rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In Virginia an employee cannot assert a claim for compensation in occupational disease cases until there has been a communication of the diagnosis of an occupational disease. The communication of the diagnosis is treated as the \u201chappening of an injury by accident.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-49. <em>See generally Kiser </em>v. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>225 Va. 357, 302 S.E.2d 44 (1983); <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>215 Va. 599, 212 S.E.2d 263 (1975); <em>Anderson v. Clinchfield Coal Co., </em>214 Va. 674, 204 S.E.2d 257 (1974); <em>Blue Diamond Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Pannell, </em>203 Va. 49, 122 S.E.2d 666 (1961). Until there has been a diagnosis of occupational disease the claimant has no claim for benefits and the employer is exposed to no liability. Thus, applying the law in effect at the time of the communication of diagnosis of an occupational disease (the \u201chappening of an injury by accident\u201d) to a claim arising from that disability does not involve a retroactive application of the statute and does not impair any vested rights. <em>See Wood </em>v. <em>J.P. Stevens &amp; Co., </em>297 N.C. 636, 256 S.E.2d 692 (1979); <em>Dickow </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeals Board, </em>34 Cal. App. 3d 762, 109 Cal. Rptr. 317 (1973); <em>McCann </em>v. <em>Walsh Construction Co., </em>282 App. Div. 444, 123 N.Y.S.2d 509 (1953), <em>aff'd, </em>306 N.Y. 904, 119 N.E.2d 596 (1954).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>A law is not retroactive merely because part of the factual situation to which it is applied occurred prior to its enactment; rather, a law is retroactive only when it operates upon transactions which have been completed or upon rights which have been acquired or upon obligations which have existed prior to its passage. In cases such as the present, the right to compensation does not accrue and the rights of the parties do not become fixed until the occurrence of the event, in this case appellant\u2019s disability, which gives rise to a cause of action. Consequently, application of the law in effect at the time the disability occurred to a claim arising from that disability does not involve a retroactive application of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>Frisbie v. Sunshine Mining Co., </em>93 Idaho 169, 457 P.2d 408, 411 (1969) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Dan River had no vested right in the limitations period in effect on the date of Adkins\u2019 last injurious exposure; Dan River\u2019s rights became fixed on May 16, 1983, the date of the communication of the diagnosis to Adkins. It was only then that Adkins\u2019 disability was established and she had a cause of action. In <em>Buenson, </em>upon which the majority opinion relies, the issue before the court was whether to retrospectively apply an amendment extending the statute of limitation <em>to an injury claim that arose prior to the effective date of the statute. </em>In making the decision to apply the statute retrospectively, the court was persuaded by the fact that the new limitation became effective before the old limitation period barred the claimant\u2019s claim. I believe that fact was important precisely because the court was concerned whether vested rights would be impaired by the <em>retroactive </em>application of the statute. Unlike <em>Buenson, </em>the situation before us does not involve the retroactive application of the statute. Because Code \u00a7 65.1-52 was amended prior to the date of the diagnosis of byssinosis, the issue before us is whether to apply the statute in effect at the time of the diagnosis of disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">The effect of increasing the limitations period from five years to seven years following the last injurious exposure was to give the right of action to Adkins and to each claimant who received a diagnosis of occupational disease subsequent to the amendment of the statute. The limitation, or condition on filing a claim, must be determined at the time the cause of action accrues, which is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>date of diagnosis of the disease. Adkins could not have first initiated and maintained a claim to a successful conclusion until a diagnosis of byssinosis was communicated to her. Thus, her right to initiate a claim first accrued on May 16, 1983. Since Adkins had no right of action prior to May 16, 1983, Dan River obtained no vested right. On May 16, 1983, the statute then in effect only barred claims filed more than seven years from the date of the last injurious exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">For these reasons I believe that Adkins\u2019 claim was timely. Furthermore, I believe that there is credible evidence in the record to support the award of the Commission.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-11\"> The Virginia rule with respect to civil actions is not required as a matter of federal constitutional law. <em>See Chase Securities Corp. </em>v.
