We agree with the Industrial Commission that the total number of persons employed by the subcontractors should be counted when calculating whether the contractor employs the minimum number of workers required for workers\u2019 compensation coverage. For this reason, we affirm the Commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">Eric C. Smith, an individual trading as Eric Smith Construction, contracted with the owner of a home in Virginia Beach to construct an addition to the home. Smith had no employees of his own but performed his work through subcontractors. He did not carry workers\u2019 compensation insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">For this job he subcontracted with Don McLawhorn to frame the addition; McLawhorn in turn subcontracted with Robert E. Gibson, Jr. to install the exterior siding. Both of these subcontractors also operated as sole proprietors and carried no workers\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>pensation insurance. The claimant, Duane R. Weber, an employee of Gibson\u2019s, was injured on this job when he fell from scaffolding during the course of his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">None of the three contractors employed as many as three people, Smith had no employees; McLawhorn had only one regular employee; and Gibson had two regular employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Smith contended that he was not liable to the claimant under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act because of the provision which exempts employers who have \u201cless than three employees in the same business within this State.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-28.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Commission rejected this contention, finding that Smith was subject to the Act and liable for compensation to the claimant. To reach this conclusion the Commission determined Gibson\u2019s two employees and McLawhorn\u2019s one employee were employees of Smith for the purpose of determining Smith\u2019s exemption claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">To conclude that the employees of Smith\u2019s subcontractors should be considered employees of Smith under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, the Commission had only to look at another of the Act\u2019s provisions. Code \u00a7 65.1-30 imposes liability on a contractor to pay workers\u2019 compensation to a subcontractor\u2019s employee \u201cwhich he would have been liable to pay if the workman had been immediately employed by him.\u201d Thus the subcontractor\u2019s employees are employees of the contractor for purposes of liability. Since they are the contractor\u2019s employees for purposes of determining liability, reason dictates that they should also be considered employees for determining applicability of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">This construction of the Act is essential to prevent evasion of compensation liability. If the subcontractor\u2019s employees were not considered in determining the contractor\u2019s exemption under the Act, the work could simply be subdivided among different contracting entities to evade liability under the Act. Employees working on a project would not be protected even if their total number exceeded three. <em>Accord Withers </em>v. <em>Black, </em>230 N.C. 428, 434, 53 S.E.2d 668, 673 (1949); <em>Pruitt </em>v. <em>Harker, </em>328 Mo. 1200, 43 S.W.2d 769, 771 (1931); 1C A. Larson, <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensa</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number><em>tion Law </em>\u00a7 52.32 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">This case demonstrates how this result could be accomplished. Three separate employers with a collective total of three employees were engaged to complete the project. None of the employers regularly had three or more employees in service. If we accepted Smith\u2019s construction of the Act, none of these employees would be protected by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act even though the project required three employees, the minimal amount required for coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">The Commission\u2019s interpretation of the Act also promotes another purpose of the statute, namely, the protection of \u201cemployees of irresponsible and uninsured subcontractors.\u201d <em>See Greene </em>v. <em>Spivey, </em>236 N.C. 435, 443, 73 S.E.2d 488, 494 (1952). The principal contractors and subcontractors should be held financially responsible for all employees because they are able to assure compliance with the workers\u2019 compensation statute. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Smith points to another provision in the Act which provides that \u201c[njothing in this Act contained shall be construed to make, for the purposes of this Act, the employees of an independent contractor the employees of the person . . . contracting with such independent contractor.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-5. However, it has long been understood that Code \u00a7 65.1-5 must be read and reconciled with the provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-30.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>Stone &amp; Webster Engineering Corp., </em>186 Va. 116, 121, 41 S.E.2d 469, 471 (1947) (construing predecessors to current code sections).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Code \u00a7 65.1-30, as well as the parallel provisions contained in Code \u00a7\u00a7 65.1-29 and 65.1-31, are designed to assure employees of protection under the Act. Together these provisions impose liability on an owner, contractor or subcontractor who subcontracts work which is a part of his trade to another person or a subcontractor who in turn subcontracts with another person. All are lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ble to pay compensation to any worker employed in the work that each undertakes.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">In contrast, Code \u00a7 65.1-5 assures that an employer whose business is not part of the work being performed by another\u2019s employee is not liable to that employee for compensation; however, the employee retains a right of action at common law against such employer. <em>Sykes, </em>186 Va. at 122-23, 41 S.E.2d at 472. When these provisions are reconciled Code \u00a7 65.1-5 does not contradict the interpretation the Commission has placed on Code \u00a7 65.1-30 but, instead, supports it.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">For these reasons we conclude that the Commission correctly determined that the employees of Smith\u2019s subcontractors should be considered in determining whether Smith employed three or more employees and was subject to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Therefore, we affirm the Commission\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Benton, J., and Cole, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\"> On the date of the accident Code \u00a7 65.1-28 read in part: \u201cThis Act shall not apply to . . . any person, firm or private corporation . . . that has regularly in service less than three employees in the same business within this State; unless such employees and their employers voluntarily elect to be bound by this Act . . . .\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-30 provides in part: \u201cWhen any person . . . referred to as \u201ccontractor\u201d . . . contracts to perform or execute any work for another person which work or undertaking is not a part of the trade, business or occupation of such other person and contracts with any other person . . . referred to as \u201csubcontractor\u201d ... for the execution or performance by or under the subcontractor of the whole or any part of the work undertaken by such contractor, then the contractor shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in the work any compensation under this Act which he would have been liable to pay if that workman had been immediately employed by him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"> Other issues raised by Smith on this appeal have no precedential or public value and, therefore, are considered and disposed of in an unpublished memorandum opinion filed with the clerk of this court from whom it is available upon request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
