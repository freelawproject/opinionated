Mull\u00eds was convicted of first degree murder and use of a firearm during the commission of the murder. The court imposed sentences of twenty and two years, respectively, as recommended by the jury. Mull\u00eds appeals, contending that: (1) the trial court erred in not striking for cause four pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>spective jurors who acknowledged that they would accept the testimony of police officers over the testimony of other witnesses; (2) the trial court improperly refused to admit evidence regarding the decedent\u2019s lifestyle; (3) the court erred in allowing cross examination of appellant about her status as beneficiary of decedent\u2019s life insurance policy; (4) the court erred by rejecting appellant\u2019s proffered Instruction D; and (5) the evidence was insufficient to sustain the convictions. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Following established principles, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth and give it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). The trial court\u2019s judgment will not be disturbed unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. Code \u00a7 8.01-680. When the Commonwealth relies upon circumstantial evidence, the evidence must exclude all reasonable hypotheses of innocence. <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 164, 169, 313 S.E.2d 390, 393 (1984). Nevertheless, circumstantial evidence which is convincing is entitled to the same weight as direct evidence. <em>See Parks </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 1029 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Viewing the facts from the vantage point most favorable to the Commonwealth, on July 23, 1983, appellant and her husband, Michael Mullis, the decedent in this case, were living in Wood-bridge, Virginia. According to appellant they left home together that evening between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. with appellant driving, headed for Clifton, Virginia. Appellant eventually drove to Kinchloe Road, a somewhat deserted location where the road changed from gravel to dirt, and parked the car on the shoulder. Evidently, while seated in the parked car, Mr. Mullis was shot and killed. There were no known eye-witnesses. Norman Longerbeam, who lived nearby on Kinchloe Road, testified that at approximately 9:30 p.m., he heard knocking on the door at his residence and heard a lady\u2019s screams that somebody had just shot her husband. He testified that when he let Mrs. Mullis in, she was hysterical. He called the law enforcement authorities. When the police officers and emergency vehicles arrived fifteen or twenty minutes later, they found Michael Mullis\u2019s body behind the steering wheel on the left side of the automobile with three gunshot wounds to his head and neck. One wound was on the left side of his head, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>above his ear; the second was in his left external ear; and the third was on the left side of the back of his neck. According to the medical examiner, the wound to the left side of his head was lethal. The other two wounds resulted from gunfire within two inches (the neck wound) and four to six inches (the ear wound) of his head. Appellant told the police that she and Mr. Mullis had gone for a ride, and she had to stop \u201cto go to the bathroom\u201d in the woods. While in the woods, she heard \u201cwhat sounded like cap-shots,\u201d but when she returned, she found that her husband \u201chad been shot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">At the time of Mullis\u2019s death, he and appellant were estranged, planning to divorce, and were staying in separate rooms in their Woodbridge home. Two men whom appellant had dated soon before the homicide gave incriminating testimony against her. Michael Young, whom appellant had been seeing for about one year, testified that approximately one week after they began dating, appellant asked him if he knew \u201canybody that would kill\u201d her husband. Young further stated that she had asked him several times to kill her husband, and suggested that it could be done by \u201cshoot[ing] him.\u201d On one occasion she suggested that Young could shoot him while she and her husband were on a camping trip. Approximately one week prior to the homicide, appellant called Young and asked him to meet her, at which time she told Young that her husband \u201cwas going to be taken care of.\u201d Another boyfriend, John Hughes, testified that two weeks before Mr. Mullis was killed appellant told Hughes that \u201cshe was not getting along with her husband\u201d and \u201che\u2019s not going to be around anymore.\u201d Hughes testified that appellant asked to borrow his gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">No murder weapon was found at the scene. A ballistics expert examined portions of a bullet recovered from decedent\u2019s brain and the base of his skull, a bullet found on the passenger\u2019s floorboard side of the car which had passed through the center of the floor mat, and .22 caliber shell casings found near the driver\u2019s door and trunk and in the back seat. The ballistics expert determined that all \u201cwere acquired from one gun.\u201d An unfired .22 caliber cartridge was found on the ground near the driver\u2019s door. A large quantity of blood was on the front seat to the right of the driver\u2019s seat. Blood was also on the center of the \u201chead-liner\u201d of the car, on the head rest, and sprayed toward the passenger side of the roof, to the far right corner of the windshield.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>The murder weapon was never recovered. Undisputed evidence proved that Michael Mull\u00eds owned a .22 caliber Ruger pistol, which he received from his family. After his death, the police searched his home but were unable to locate the pistol. The appellant was familiar with the guns owned by the decedent, having described them to the police officers, including the missing .22 caliber Ruger pistol. She acknowledged having handled the .22 caliber pistol as recently as the morning of the homicide when she removed Mullis\u2019s guns from the kitchen table where the decedent had been cleaning them and put them in his room.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">An autopsy report revealed that the decedent had eaten \u201ca pickle, ham, french fries, and some other meat fragments\u2014possibly hamburger,\u201d less than a half hour before his death. The appellant testified that she had not seen him eat anything prior to leaving home between 8:30 and 9:00 p.m. and they only had orange juice and a Pepsi after they left. The appellant testified that the decedent was shot at approximately 9:46 p.m. This portion of the autopsy report casts doubt upon the appellant\u2019s account of when and where she and the decedent were and whether they were together until less than a half hour before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Appellant was the beneficiary of Mr. Mullis\u2019s life insurance policy. She testified thdt they had agreed to cancel the policy, and that she thought her name had been removed as the beneficiary in February 1983. She stated that she first learned from the police after the murder that she remained the beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">\n<em>Voir Dire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">We consider whether certain jurors should have been excluded from the panel for cause due to personal bias or prejudice. During <em>voir dire </em>examination of the jury, defense counsel asked: \u201c[I]f a police officer gives some testimony and a private citizen gives testimony that differs from what the police officer said\u2014are there any of you who would believe or have a tendency to believe the police officer as opposed to the private citizen? . . . This is if all things are equal.\u201d Four of the veniremen answered \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cprobably.\u201d Other than the one general abstract question, defense counsel did not pursue the inquiry. At the conclusion of <em>voir dire, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>defense counsel moved to strike the four prospective jurors for cause, contending that they were biased for the prosecution. The trial judge denied the challenge for cause. Defense counsel used peremptory strikes to exclude three of the four jurors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The fourth juror sat on the case. Appellant contends that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defense\u2019s motion to remove the four prospective jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">An accused in a criminal case \u201cis entitled to an impartial jury as a matter of constitutional guarantee, reenforced by legislative mandate and by the Rules of . . . court.\u201d <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 436, 444, 271 S.E.2d 123, 128 (1980) (footnote omitted); <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>1 Va. App. 447, 451, 339 S.E.2d 889, 901 (1986). \u201cThe trial judge\u2019s fulfillment of this duty involves the exercise of sound judicial discretion, which ordinarily is binding on appeal absent manifest error.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>2 Va. App. 134, 137, 342 S.E.2d 65, 67 (1986) (citing <em>Calhoun </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 256, 258-59, 307 S.E.2d 896, 898 (1983)). On review, the decision of the trial judge who had the opportunity to \u201cweigh the meaning of the answers given in light of the phrasing of the questions posed, the inflections, tone, and tenor of the dialogue, and the general demeanor of the prospective juror\u201d is entitled to much deference. <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 455, 464-65, 248 S.E.2d 135, 141 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">However, any reasonable doubt whether a juror stands impartial is sufficient to ensure his exclusion because \u201cit is not only important that justice should be impartially administered, but it should also flow through channels as free from suspicion as possible.\u201d <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>73 Va. (32 Gratt.) 941, 943 (1879); <em>see also Barker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 374, 337 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1985). <em>Voir dire </em>examination is the principle method of ensuring that jurors \u201cstand indifferent in the cause\u201d and are free of \u201cbias or prejudice\u201d for or against one of the parties. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.01-358; Rule 3A:14. Whether a prospective juror should have been excluded for cause must be decided upon a review of the entire <em>voir dire, </em>rather than an isolated question and answer. <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 628, 292 S.E.2d 798, 805 (1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1228 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>In an appropriate case, counsel may inquire of prospective jurors whether they would give greater or less weight to the testimony of a police officer than to that of another witness <em>simply because of his official status. </em>\u201cA defendant cannot be fairly tried by a juror who would be inclined to give unqualified credence to a law enforcement officer simply because he is an officer .... [But] jurors have a right and a duty to determine credibility and to believe, in a particular case, the testimony of a law enforcement officer over that of a defendant.\u201d <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>258 F.2d 816, 819 (10th Cir. 1958) (dictum), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Tenoria v. United States, </em>359 U.S. 916 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">The credibility of witnesses is a matter for the jury to decide, weighing such factors as the appearance and manner of the witnesses on the stand, their intelligence, their opportunity for knowing the truth and observing the things about which they testify, their interest in the outcome of the case, their bias, and if any had been shown, their prior inconsistent statements and prior criminal convictions. <em>Zirkle </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 862, 870, 55 S.E.2d 24, 29 (1949). For a juror to give unqualified credence to the testimony of a law enforcement officer and to decide credibility issues solely on that basis is an impermissible basis for resolving credibility and would constitute bias. When it is anticipated that a major part of the prosecution\u2019s case will hinge upon a credibility determination between prosecution witnesses who have an official status and other defense witnesses who do not, then not only is such an inquiry of whether jurors would give unqualified credence to those witnesses appropriate but may be required. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>United States, </em>338 F.2d 543, 544 (D.C. Cir. 1964) (case reversed for refusal to permit similar, but significantly different, question to be asked in <em>voir dire </em>when government\u2019s case relied on two military police officers and credibility was major issue).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In the present case, looking at the entire record before the trial judge rather than considering the isolated abstract question and answer of each juror, we conclude that there was no manifest error in refusing to exclude the prospective jurors. The general abstract question put to the jurors, without more, made it difficult for them to give a meaningful answer and is a poor indication of the manner in which they would serve as jurors and evaluate any particular police testimony. Certainly their responses did not indicate to the trial judge who heard the entire <em>voir dire </em>and observed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the prospective jurors that they would give unqualified credence to the testimony of a police officer. At most, their responses indicated that as an abstract proposition they would probably or would have a tendency to give some weight to the fact that a witness was a police officer in resolving credibility issues if all else were equal. <em>Cf. United States ex rel. Parson v. Anderson, </em>354 F. Supp. 1060, 1081 (Del. 1972). \u201c[T]he question, as framed, amount [ed] to an ingenious effort to commit a juror in advance as to how he will handle credibility choices between <em>a government official and the defendant, </em>before either of them takes the witness stand.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>448 F.2d 539, 542-43 (5th Cir. 1971) (case affirmed trial court\u2019s refusal to ask similar, but significantly different, question on <em>voir dire </em>on whether \u201capt to believe . . . official [or] the Defendant\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The four challenged veniremen stated they had no opinion as to the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence, expressed no knowledge concerning the facts of the case, had no bias or prejudice against either side, and stated they could give appellant a fair and impartial trial \u201cbased solely on the law as [the court] will explain it. . . and the evidence that [they] hear in court.\u201d The degree of impact which credibility issues played in the case as a whole was minimal and could have had very little significance on the jury\u2019s resolution of the case. The juror responses could not be classified as a state of mind which would give unqualified credence to the testimony of a police officer. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to dismiss the veniremen for cause and conclude that there was no manifest error in his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">\n<em>Evidence of Decedent\u2019s Lifestyle</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Appellant contends that the court erred in refusing to admit certain evidence of the decedent\u2019s lifestyle and his alleged involvement with drugs. Specifically, she asserts that it was error for the court to disallow: (1) testimony of a lay witness that the decedent was \u201cparanoid\u201d and thought somebody was out to hurt him, and (2) evidence of the decedent\u2019s medical history, particularly referring to drug abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The record is replete with evidence of the decedent\u2019s involvement with drugs and his allegedly bizarre behavior. The trial judge admitted such evidence when shown to be relevant to an issue in the case. However, the court sustained the Commonwealth\u2019s objection to the testimony of a former roommate of the Mullis\u2019s after the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-5\">Q. \u201cDid Michael keep guns in the house?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-6\">A. \u201cYes, he did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-7\">Q. \u201cWere those guns kept in the house loaded or unloaded?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">A. \u201cLoaded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-9\">Q. \u201cDo you know why?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-10\">A. \u201cMichael was paranoid about people, that somebody was out to hurt him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The trial court ruled that the witness was a layman, not a doctor, and qould therefore not draw a medical conclusion about the reason for the decedent\u2019s actions. Lay witnesses cannot express an opinion as to the existence of a particular mental disease or condition. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>207 Va. 214, 220, 148 S.E.2d 784, 789 (1966). The fact that the layman is familiar with the term \u201cparanoid\u201d does not qualify her to render an opinion that someone is \u201cparanoid.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 236, 241, 117 S.E.2d 67, 71 (1960). Although not being offered as a medical opinion but rather used as a term that has meaning in lay parlance, the court avoided a problem by requiring the witness to answer without using terms that might lead the jury to conclude that Michael Mull\u00eds had been diagnosed as paranoid. The court did not abuse its discretion in that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-12\">Finally, appellant asserts that the trial court, in not permitting certain evidence about the decedent\u2019s lifestyle and drug habits, erroneously thwarted the defense\u2019s attempt to establish that the murder could have been drug-related and that another individual could have committed the murder. However, neither appellant nor any other witness testified or suggested that the decedent went to this location to buy or sell drugs. No evidence suggested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the location was frequented by persons involved with drugs. While the circumstantial evidence must exclude all reasonable hypotheses of innocence to support a conviction, the theory of innocence must flow from the evidence, and not from the ruminations of defense counsel. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 427, 432-33, 309 S.E.2d 325, 328-29 (1983). There was no evidence tending to suggest that the murder was drug-related; the evidence proffered by the defense was not shown to be connected by time or place or other way to the murder. The defense sought to introduce evidence which would have invited the jury to speculate or imagine that the murder was drug related. We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contention that the trial court unduly restricted the introduction of evidence about decedent\u2019s lifestyle.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">\n<em>Cross-examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">While appellant concedes that, for the purpose of showing motive, the Commonwealth was entitled to question her about her knowledge that the decedent owned a life insurance policy naming her as beneficiary, she argues that the following question was improper: \u201c[Y]o\u00fa are aware, are you not, that if you are convicted of this offense, you will not get any of that insurance proceeds?\u201d Appellant contends that the question was improper because it was not asked whether <em>at the time of the alleged murder </em>she knew if she was convicted she would not receive the policy proceeds, and that her knowledge of this fact at the time of trial had no bearing on her motive at the time of the crime. Appellant asserts that the question was irrelevant, inflammatory, and unduly prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">The Commonwealth asserts that appellant\u2019s knowledge of whether she would receive the insurance proceeds if she were convicted was relevant both to her motive to commit the offense and to her bias as a witness. We agree. If appellant knew at the time she was testifying that she had to be acquitted to receive the proceeds, the jury might believe that she would falsify her testimony. Whether a motive existed to commit the offense and whether incentive existed to testify falsely were both factors which the jury had a right to consider in determining appellant\u2019s guilt and credibility. <em>See Barker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 370, 373-74, 337 S.E.2d 729, 732 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">\n<em>Jury Instruction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Appellant contends that the language of her proffered Instruction D<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was necessary to clarify for the jury that they were not to be influenced by the inability of the Commonwealth or the defense to identify any other criminal agent or person who committed the crime, and that appellant could not be called upon to establish her own innocence by naming or identifying the guilty person.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Instruction 1, given to the jury, defined the burden of proof upon the Commonwealth and stated: \u201cThere is no burden on the defendant to produce any evidence and the defendant does not have to prove who killed her husband.\u201d We find that appellant\u2019s proffered Instruction D was repetitive and was properly refused by the court as unnecessary. <em>See Hevener </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>189 Va. 802, 813, 54 S.E.2d 893, 898 (1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">\n<em>Sufficiency of the Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">Finally, appellant asserts that the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to convict her of first degree murder. Appellant contends that a fatal flaw in the case was that the Commonwealth never established that she had a .22 caliber pistol and .22 caliber ammunition in her possession, or that she used the weapon to fire the bullets which killed Michael Mullis. Thus, appellant argues, the Commonwealth failed to prove the essential element of means.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">Appellant cites <em>Bishop v. Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 164, 313 S.E.2d 390 (1984), for the proposition that in a murder case in which all the evidence is circumstantial, the Commonwealth must prove time, place, means and conduct, and they must form an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>broken chain which links the defendant to the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. In <em>Cantrell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 387, 329 S.E.2d 22 (1985), the Supreme Court explained that the language in <em>Bishop </em>should not be too narrowly construed. Rather, the Court said that the circumstantial evidence cases stand for \u201cthe proposition that those circumstances which <em>are </em>proved must each be consistent with guilt and inconsistent with innocence, and that they . . . must <em>concur </em>in pointing to the defendant as the perpetrator beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Cantrell, </em>229 Va. at 398, 329 S.E.2d at 29 (emphasis in original). Appellant confuses the species of circumstances which may or may not be available for proof in any given case, such as motive, time, place, means, and conduct, with the elements of the crime, which must each be proved in every case if a conviction is to be had. <em>Id. </em>at 397, 329 S.E.2d at 28. Means is merely a circumstance which, when proved, tends to support a finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We find that the evidence before us, viewed under familiar principles, is sufficient to sustain the conviction. The evidence showed, among other things, that appellant knew her husband owned a .22 pistol, knew where it was kept, and in fact handled her husband\u2019s guns on the morning of the homicide. The pistol was missing after the homicide, and the jury could have reasonably inferred from its unexplained absence that she used it to kill her husband and then successfully secreted or disposed of it. The Commonwealth established time, place, opportunity, conduct, and motive for the defendant to have committed the homicide. Moreover, the evidence proved overt efforts by the defendant to procure third parties to kill Michael Mull\u00eds and most recently twice declared that \u201che was going to be taken care of\u2019 and \u201che\u2019s not going to be around anymore.\u201d Except for the defendant\u2019s bare suggestion that some other person may have committed the offense, all circumstances concur to implicate her. We do not go outside the evidence to create a doubt. We find from the evidence that all of the elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and the circumstances proven\u2014 time, place, motive, conduct, and means\u2014concurred to support the jury\u2019s finding of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Hodges, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-7\"> The fact that the veniremen did not sit on the jury which convicted appellant is irrelevant to the issue framed on appeal. <em>See Breeden </em>v. Commonwealth, 217 Va. 297, 300, 227 S.E.2d 734, 736-37 (1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b599-12\"> Instruction D provided: The court instructs the jury that, notwithstanding the fact that Susan Mullis was present at the time Michael Mullis was shot and killed, she is not to be prejudiced by the inability of the Commonwealth to point out any other criminal agent or person who committed the crime, nor is Susan Mullis called upon to vindicate her own innocence by naming, or identifying, the guilty person, but she rests secure in the presumption of innocence until proof is adduced which establishes the fact beyond all reasonable doubt that she actually shot and killed the deceased, Michael Mullis, and if the Commonwealth has failed to prove by clear, distinct and reliable evidence beyond all reasonable doubt that she shot and killed the deceased, the law requires the jury to find her not guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
