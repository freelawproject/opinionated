We assigned the case to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed. <em>State v. Nobles, </em>122 Idaho 509, 835 P.2d 1320 (App.1991). We granted Nobles' request for review of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">We have reviewed and considered the briefs, the record, the transcript, and the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion. We have also listened to and considered the oral arguments presented to us. We concur with the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision with an additional rationale that supports their decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">The Court of Appeals determined that the trial court had found that Nobles\u2019 confession to his parole officer was voluntary and, therefore, that the second confession was not the fruit of a poisonous tree. The Court of Appeals determined that the trial court implicitly found that Nobles gave both confessions voluntarily because of the trial court\u2019s conclusion that under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d the second confession was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-14\">We conclude that the trial court\u2019s implicit finding of voluntariness is further demonstrated by the trial court\u2019s statement that Nobles\u2019 confession to his parole officer could be used for impeachment. The use of this confession would have been admissible to impeach Nobles only if the confession were voluntary, although it was given without the benefit of <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 U.S. 222, 91 S.Ct. 643, 28 L.Ed.2d 1 (1971); <em>see also State v.
