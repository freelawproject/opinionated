AMIC appeals its respective allocation of medical costs viz-a-viz the portion allocated to LNIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-24\">LNIC was Basic American Foods\u2019 workers\u2019 compensation carrier during the period from August 1, 1976 through November 1, 1988. On November 1, 1988, AMIC began coverage which ceased one year later on November 1, 1989. Thereafter, Lumberman\u2019s Mutual Casualty Company has been the workers\u2019 compensation carrier for Basic American Foods.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-25\">Alice Blang began working as a potato trimmer for Basic American Foods in 1983, and continues to work for Basic American Foods. She first noticed pain and numbness in her wrist in late 1984. Her wrist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>problems persisted intermittently through 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">The Industrial Commission\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order filed December 20, 1990, does not explicitly find the date when \u201cdisablement\u201d occurred as a result of Blang\u2019s injury. <em>See </em>I.C. \u00a7 72-102(17) (prior to January 1,1990; after that dated codified at I.C. \u00a7 72-102(18)(c)). As a result, AMIC and LNIC dispute what they term to be the implicit findings made in the Commission\u2019s Order that establish when this statutory prerequisite occurred. The date of this finding is necessary to accurately assess whether the Commission properly allocated workers\u2019 compensation benefits between the two sureties and to establish the statutory eligibility of the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">We have previously returned a case to the Industrial Commission to make the necessary statutory findings of when disablement occurred. <em>See Cawley v. Idaho Nuclear Corp., </em>117 Idaho 34, 784 P.2d 890 (1989). Without this explicit finding the case must be returned to the Industrial Commission, as we decline to become finders of fact. Accordingly, we vacate the Commission\u2019s Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order and remand the cause for complete findings including the date when disablement occurred within the meaning of the Idaho workers\u2019 compensation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">No costs or attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b111-7\">BAKES, C.J., and JOHNSON and McDEVITT, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b111-8\">BOYLE, J., fully concurred prior to his resignation on March 31, 1992.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
