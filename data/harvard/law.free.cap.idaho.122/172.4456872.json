Appellant reported to the \u201c911\u201d operator that his parents, Ray E. Thomasson and Judith A. Thomasson, had been shot and appeared to be dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">The Lewiston police arrived at appellant\u2019s home, arrested appellant, and transported him to the Lewiston Police Department. Shortly after arriving at the department, appellant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights and questioned by Officer Alan Johnson. During this interview, appellant claimed not to know who shot his parents and he speculated that a robber had committed the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">Subsequent to the interview with Officer Johnson, appellant was again read his rights and questioned by Officer Russell Ellis. During the Ellis interview, appellant denied involvement with or any firsthand knowledge of the shootings. However, after a break late in the interview, appellant changed his story, stating that he saw who shot his parents and describing a man with a rifle near the window of the living room. Officer Ellis expressed doubt, telling appellant that he wanted to know why appellant had committed the murders. It was then that appellant admitted to shooting his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\n<em>Procedure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">On September 25, 1989, a criminal complaint was filed in the Second Judicial District Court of the State of Idaho against appellant. In this complaint, appellant was charged with two counts of first degree murder, in violation of I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 18-4001, 18-4002, and 18-4003.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">On September 25, 1989, the court appointed the firm of Knowlton, Miles &amp; Merica to represent appellant. Appellant\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit on October 5,1989, in which he stated that \u201cpremeditation and malice aforethought are the primary issues which will be tried, including the capacity of the [appellant] to premeditate\u201d and requested the court to appoint Dr. Roger White as an expert psychiatrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-13\">On October 11, 1989, an amended criminal complaint was filed. In the amended criminal complaint, the State added a sentencing enhancement \u2014 possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, in violation of I.C. \u00a7 19-2520.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-14\">On October 17, 1989, a criminal information was filed against appellant. The information contained the two counts of first degree murder, the sentencing enhancement, and a list of known witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-15\">On October 18, 1989, appellant was arraigned. At the arraignment, appellant pled \u201cnot guilty\u201d to both counts of first degree murder. In addition, the court set dates for pretrial motions and the jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-16\">On November 2, 1989, appellant moved for a change of venue. The motion requested moving the cause from Nez Perce County, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-1801 and I.C.R. 21, or, alternatively, selecting the jurors from another county, pursuant to I.C. \u00a7 19-1816. On January 15, 1990, the motion for a change of venue was granted to the extent that jurors would be empaneled from another county.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-17\">On November 3, 1989, appellant filed a motion to suppress certain evidence. Appellant requested suppression of statements he made to officers Alan Johnson and Russell Ellis on September 22, 1989, and a videotape of appellant taken at the crime scene on September 22,1989. Appellant argued that the statements were not the product of his free and voluntary actions and were, thus, violative of Idaho and United States law. He contended that the videotape violated I.C. \u00a7 19-615. On January 15, 1990, the motion to suppress was denied. However, the videotape taken of appellant at the crime scene was rejected when offered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-18\">On January 22, 1990, the State filed a notice of its intent not to seek the death penalty. The notice was based.on the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, and the State requested the court to notify the jury of the State\u2019s intent not to seek the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Also on January 22, 1990, the court ordered appellant transferred to the Ada County jail for the purpose of jury selection. Jury selection in Ada County began on January 23, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">On January 25, 1990, the trial began. On January 31, 1990, an amended information was filed. The amended information contained the two counts of first degree murder and the sentencing enhancement of possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime. The next day, on February 1, 1990, the jury returned its verdicts. The jury found appellant guilty of both counts of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Sentencing proceedings began on May 1, 1990. After each side called its witnesses, the district court sentenced appellant to a minimum term of ten (10) years for each count of first degree murder, with each ten (10) year sentence to be served consecutively-</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">On May 10, 1990, the district court entered a judgment of conviction against appellant. In the judgment, the court stated that appellant \u201cis guilty of the crime of Two Counts of MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE, I.C. \u00a7 18-4001, 18-4002, and 18-4003, a felony____\u201d For each count, appellant was sentenced to \u201ca term of LIFE, consisting of a minimum period of confinement of TEN (10) years during which the [appellant] shall not be eligible for parole or discharge or credit or reduction of sentence for good conduct (except as provided by Section 20-101D, Idaho Code) and a subsequent indeterminate term of custody of LIFE.\u201d Furthermore, the court stated that \u201cthe sentences ... shall run consecutive\u201d and \u201c[t]hat the total minimum term of confinement for Counts I and II combined shall be a period of TWENTY (20) years and a total subsequent indeterminate term of custody of LIFE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">Appellant filed his notice of appeal, pursuant to I.A.R. 11(c)(1) and (6), on June 20, 1990, appealing \u201cfrom that certain Judgment of Conviction entered ... on the 10th day of May, 1990____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-10\">I.Did the district court abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Carl Koenen to testify regarding the positions of the victims\u2019 bodies at the time they were shot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-12\">II. Did the district court err by not instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, as requested by appellant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-13\">III. Did the district court abuse its discretion in ordering that the sentences imposed be served consecutively?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-14\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b218-15\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-16\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN ALLOWING DR. KOENEN TO TESTIFY REGARDING THE POSITIONS OF THE VICTIMS\u2019 BODIES AT THE TIME THEY WERE SHOT?</p>\n<p id=\"b218-17\">At trial, the State called Dr. Carl Koenen for the purpose of testifying as an expert witness. During Dr. Koenen\u2019s testimony, the State asked if he had an opinion as to the position of each of the decedents at the time they were shot. Counsel for appellant objected to these questions. At trial, and on appeal, appellant contends that these questions were designed to elicit from Dr. Koenen testimony regarding how the deaths occurred rather than an expert medical opinion. Further, appellant argues that this testimony did not require special skills or knowledge beyond that possessed by ordinary citizens such as those comprising the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-18\">This Court has stated that \u201cI.R.E. 702 provides the appropriate test for determining whether an adequate foundation had been laid to admit the testimony of the expert witness regarding scientifically derived evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Rodgers, </em>119 Idaho 1047, 1049, 812 P.2d 1208, 1210 (1991). Idaho Rule of Evidence 702 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-19\">Rule 702. Testimony by experts. \u2014 If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201cAn expert witness has been defined by this Court \u2018as someone possessing a certain skill or knowledge which is beyond the competence of the average layman or juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rodgers, </em>119 Idaho at 1051, 812 P.2d at 1212 (citing <em>Potter v. Mulberry, </em>100 Idaho 429, 599 P.2d 1000 (1979); <em>Stoddard v. Nelson, </em>99 Idaho 293, 581 P.2d 339 (1978); <em>Bean v. Diamond Alkali Co., </em>93 Idaho 32, 454 P.2d 69 (1969)). It is within the discretion of the district court to determine whether a person is qualified to testify as an expert witness. <em>Rodgers, </em>119 Idaho at 1051, 812 P.2d at 1212; <em>Jones v. Jones, </em>117 Idaho 621, 627, 790 P.2d 914, 920 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Dr. Koenen testified that he was currently a physician specializing in pathology, that he had attended college at Kalamazoo College in Michigan and medical school at Marquette School of Medicine in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and explained the difference between forensic and clinical pathology. He further stated that he was currently a licensed medical physician in Idaho, that he was certified by the American Board of Pathology, that he had devoted a substantial part of his practice to the area of forensic pathology over the past years, that he had been called upon a number of times in the past to testify as a forensic pathologist, that performing autopsies and determining locations of wounds were duties he had performed as a forensic pathologist, that he had performed the autopsies on decedents Ray E. Thomas-son and Judith A. Thomasson, and that he had followed standard procedures in performing both of these autopsies.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Given Dr. Koenen's qualifications, experience, and the foundation laid for his testimony, this Court cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Dr. Koenen to testify as to the location of the victims\u2019 bodies when they were shot. <em>See Rodgers, </em>119 Idaho at 1051-52, 812 P.2d at 1212-13. The testimony of Dr. Koenen, including the testimony regarding the position of the decedents\u2019 bodies at the time they were shot, is helpful, or of assistance, to the jury, as the finder of fact, in understanding the evidence at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ERR BY NOT INSTRUCTING THE JURY ON THE LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSE OF VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AS REQUESTED BY APPELLANT?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">After the close of his case, appellant requested the district court to instruct the jury on the lesser offense of voluntary manslaughter, as defined by I.C. \u00a7 18-4006(1). Instead, the district court instructed the jury on first degree murder and second degree murder. Appellant argues that the district court erred because the evidence was sufficient to support an instruction on voluntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-9\">When a district court is requested to give an instruction on a lesser included offense, it must look to <em>all </em>of the evidence presented at the trial to determine if there is a reasonable view of the evidence to support the requested instruction. <em>State v. Fodge, </em>121 Idaho 192, 195, 824 P.2d 123, 126 (1992); <em>State v. Olsen, </em>103 Idaho 278, 284, 647 P.2d 734, 740 (1982). Once the district court makes this discretionary determination, it must then look to the language of the proposed instruction and determine whether it is an erroneous statement of law or adequately covered by other instructions. <em>Fodge, </em>121 Idaho at 195, 824 P.2d at 126; <em>Olsen, </em>103 Idaho at 285, 647 P.2d at 741. However, if the district court makes the determination that there <em>is </em>a reasonable view of the evidence to support an instruction on the lesser included offense, then it <em>must </em>instruct the jury on that lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">In this case, appellant brings before this Court a challenge to the district court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on voluntary manslaughter. However, we find ourselves unable to rule on whether the district court made the correct discretionary determination. This is because we do not have a complete record on appeal before us. Instead, we have a transcript of the sentencing proceedings, the pleadings and orders on file in the district court, a transcript of Dr. Carl Koenen\u2019s testimony, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>certain exhibits from trial. We do not have a complete transcript of the trial. In order for us to review and rule upon a district court\u2019s denial of a proposed instruction on a lesser included offense, we have to look to <em>all </em>of the evidence presented at the trial to determine if there is a reasonable view of the evidence to support the requested instruction. <em>Fodge, </em>121 Idaho at 195, 824 P.2d at 126; <em>Olsen, </em>103 Idaho at 284, 647 P.2d at 740 (1982). In this case, we reject this issue and accept the instructions as given by the district court. In <em>Lisher v. City and/or Village of Potlatch, </em>101 Idaho 343, 612 P.2d 1190 (1980), wherein the appellant failed to request a reporter\u2019s transcript of the testimony offered at trial, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-4\">Because no such transcript was provided, the factual findings of the trial court cannot be reviewed on appeal, <em>Baker v. Ore-Ida Foods, Inc., </em>95 Idaho 575, 585, 513 P.2d 627, 637 (1973); <em>Neer v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>92 Idaho 361, 365, 442 P.2d 771, 775 (1968), and we must accept them as valid. <em>See Beneficial Life Ins. Co. v. Wakamatsu, </em>75 Idaho 232, 238, 270 P.2d 830, 833 (1954) <em>[overruled on other grounds, Downing v. Boehringer, </em>82 Idaho 52, 349 P.2d 306 (1960) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-5\"><em>Lisher, </em>101 Idaho at 344, 612 P.2d at 1191.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">DID THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION IN ORDERING THAT THE SENTENCES BE SERVED CONSECUTIVELY?</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">At the conclusion of the sentencing proceedings, the district court sentenced appellant to two (2) consecutive fixed ten (10) year terms<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to be followed by indeterminate terms of up to life in prison. Thus, at a minimum, appellant will spend twenty (20) years in prison. On appeal, appellant challenges this sentence. In particular, appellant challenges the reasonableness of the consecutive nature of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"AMo\">\u201cIn reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence, we are exercising our authority as an appellate court to determine whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Broadhead, </em>120 Idaho 141, 143, 814 P.2d 401, 403 (1991) citing <em>State v. Wolfe, </em>99 Idaho 382, 384-85, 582 P.2d 728, 730-31 (1978), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Brown, </em>121 Idaho 385, 388, 825 P.2d 482, 485 (1992). Furthermore, in <em>Broadhead, </em>this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">In <em>State v. Dillon, </em>100 Idaho 723, 724, 604 P.2d 737, 738 (1979), the Court succinctly stated the standard we must follow in reviewing sentences:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6U\">Sentencing is a matter committed to the discretion of the trial judge, and the defendant has the burden of showing a clear abuse thereof on appeal. In exercising that discretion, reasonableness is a fundamental requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-14\"><em>Broadhead, </em>120 Idaho at 144, 814 P.2d at 404; <em>Fodge, </em>121 Idaho at 195, 824 P.2d at 126. As to the reasonableness of a sentence, we must ask \u201cwhether the sentence was excessive under any reasonable view of the facts.\u201d <em>Fodge, </em>121 Idaho at 195, 824 P.2d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">Our review of the record indicates that appellant was seventeen (17) years old when he murdered both of his adoptive parents. Additionally, the record reveals that appellant had previously been in trouble with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">Based on the record before us, we cannot say that the district court abused its discretion, and we therefore affirm the sentence of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">For the above reasons, we affirm the decision of the district court in all respects.</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-18\">BAKES, C.J., JOHNSON, J\u201e and WINMILL, J., Pro Tern., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b220-9\">.

Likewise, it delineates the procedures which took place relative to prosecution, conviction, and imposition of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">I see nothing amiss in what the opinion relates under Part I of the \u201cAnalysis,\u201d and see no need to agree or disagree, and comment only to the extent of noting that the prosecution\u2019s utilization of Dr. Koenen\u2019s expert testimony was unnecessary. Prior to the time that he was brought into the case the authorities were able to investigate to their own satisfaction and had obtained evidence to establish the occurrence of two homicides. Sergeant Ellis had in a professional manner obtained the appellant\u2019s confession. The parents were both dead, and the appellant admitted that he dealt the fatal shots, a clear case of homicides with Brad Thomasson being the person who should be charged. There were no other probable suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The appellant, obviously reposing confidence in Sergeant Ellis, had furnished the authorities with a confession which provided the details of the incident, culminating in what appeared to be a rather severe confrontation involving the youth and the father. Then, in the aftermath, the mother was shot during a heated exchange which included her declaration that Brad would be sent to prison. Apparently in recognition of that naked truth the youth reacted with violence. Clearly all that happened could have been forecastable in light of the deterioration of the parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">PART II</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Turning to Part II of the opinion for the Court, there is much to which I am unable to subscribe. That with which I do readily agree is the statement which reads, \u201c... if the district court makes the determination that there <em>is </em>a reasonable view of the evidence to support an instruction on the lesser included offense, then it <em>must </em>instruct the jury on that lesser included offense.\u201d 122 Idaho at 175, 832 P.2d at 746 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The majority opinion states that \u201cwe have a transcript of the sentencing proceedings, the pleadings and orders on file in the district court, a transcript of Dr. Carl Koenen\u2019s testimony, and certain exhibits from trial. We do not have a complete transcript of the trial.\u201d 122 Idaho at 175-176, 832 P.2d at 746-747. I readily agree that we do not have a complete transcript of the testimony presented at trial, and accordingly, \u201cwe do not have a complete record on appeal before us.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 832 P.2d at 746. But, that circumstance does not preclude the majority from ruling on Thomasson\u2019s contention that the district court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, as defined in I.C. \u00a7 18-4006.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Not presented by the majority is any reason for not having taken the appropriate action which would have resulted in our having a complete trial transcript. Where the Court sees that it does not have a complete transcript, as here, rather than bemoan the problem, the Court knows how to order augmentation of an appeal record and remedy that defect. So doing is not at all an unusual happening. <em>In this very case the Court has done so, sua sponte.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b221-12\">The records in our clerk\u2019s office demonstrate that the Court ordered augmentation of the record on February 13, 1992, <em>but selectively omitted requesting those portions thereof which it now declares that we do not have, </em>now lamenting that \u201cwe find ourselves <em>UNABLE TO RULE </em>on whether the district court made the correct discretionary determination,\u201d (emphasis supplied) <em>i.e., </em>whether the jury should have been instructed on manslaughter. In a case of this magnitude, the Court\u2019s failure to order a complete trial transcript amounts to an exercise of judicial <em>in </em>discretion. A copy of the Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>order is attached hereto as Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-13\">The Court should, if we are interested in achieving justice, immediately have the record on appeal supplemented with the trial transcript, and for the present withhold all opinions until the Court has obtained the remainder of the transcript and will no longer be unable to rule. Only in that manner can the Court remedy the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>justice it appears to be dealing to young Brad Thomasson. He is as much entitled to a fair appellate review as was he entitled to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">The Court has the authority to order such supplementation as it may direct. I.A.R. 44. Not known is <em>why </em>the Court, when it entered its prior order for a limited augmentation of the trial transcript, did not also order that the record be supplemented with a transcript of the entire trial proceedings. For certain highly unusual, the selective use of only portions of the transcript is intolerable in a review of a criminal prosecution for two counts of first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">The existence of the situation is attributable in large part to this Court\u2019s aforesaid directive to the clerk of the district court in Nez Perce County, which selectively required only certain portions of the reporter\u2019s transcript. The Court so functioned without this one member being informed as to the Court\u2019s action until it was a <em>fait accompli.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">PART III</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Supplementing the record with the trial testimony is necessary in order that this Court be able to perform its function of ascertaining that the appellant received a fair trial, meaning that no error occurred therein which was prejudicial to the appellant. In view of the above extenuating circumstances, it is equally required in the interests of justice. Moreover, following the completion of our review and the order affirming the trial court, it is as certain as night follows day that there will be the inevitable petition for post-conviction relief. The majority today will be casting the die, because, implicit in the augmentation procedures of which we all belatedly now have knowledge, will be the cry that it was for appellant\u2019s counsel to provide the reporter\u2019s transcript as part of the appeal record. Such post-conviction petition will additionally tax our already heavily burdened district court, attorney general\u2019s office, and public defenders, as well as causing unnecessary delay. As the late Chief Justice Shepard wrote, \u201cJustice delayed is justice denied.\u201d That is a philosophy of which we who follow must be ever mindful.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Further, what record we do have before us strongly suggests that the evidence presented, taken as a whole, supports the giving of instructions as to manslaughter. While it appears that appellant did admit to Ellis that he shot both his mother and father, equally true is it that the shooting of the father occurred as the byproduct of a heated confrontation between the appellant and his father, with his mother\u2019s unfortunate appearance on the scene after hearing the gun shots, all the while tempers and passion were high, and reason was non-existent. At the request of the police, appellant made a statement as to the episode, knowing that it was being taped and that his statement could be used against him. A transcript of a portion of that recorded statement is attached as Appendix B. Appellant\u2019s statement, which the jury heard and was at liberty to believe, was that during the quarrel his father struck him several times, and declared that appellant was nothing but trouble to the extent that he would be putting the boy away. Appellant also told the Ellis that he became angered on his father declaring his regret in having adopted him. The shots were fired shortly after that comment. Considering that appellant was an immature seventeen year old youth, and as well a very troubled person it would have been within the province of the jury to conclude under a reasonable view of this evidence, that appellant fired the shots \u201cupon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion,\u201d a definition of voluntary manslaughter. I.C. \u00a7 18-4006(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Whether there was or was not sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s first degree murder verdict is not the issue upon which we focus our appellate inquiry. The issue presented to this Court is the defense contention that the district court committed reversible error in rejecting defense instructions on manslaughter. I.C. \u00a7 19-2132(b)(2). In so doing the district court usurped the jury\u2019s function: to decide the degree of the homicide. The jury was in that manner finessed out of knowing that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>homicide can be other than murder. The jurors might have comprehended that there were two degrees of murder, but not being in any way apprised as to the penalty, would have little regard as to which degree of murder upon which they would place their imprimatur of \u201cguilty.\u201d Under I.C. \u00a7 19 \u2014 2132(b)(2), a lesser-included instruction must be given even though the jury, under proper instructions would also be at liberty to weigh the evidence and conclude that the homicide did rise to the level of first degree murder. Simmered down to the bare essence, the issue before us, properly viewed, is the validity of a district court\u2019s ruling which, in practical effect, was <em>a directed verdict </em>on two counts of charged first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">The majority opinion, by avoiding a question that must inevitably be resolved, will cause an unwarranted expenditure of time, money, and effort, and will unnecessarily delay the final resolution of this cause, to the detriment of all involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">PART IV</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Although the trial court did not err in instructing the jury as to the elements of first degree murder, and there is no such assertion by defense counsel, yet there remains good cause to question the validity of the court\u2019s decision ruling out the giving of the law relative to any of the lesser included homicide offenses which are not murder. Moreover, this was a trial where <em>there was no failure on the part of defense counsel to register a well stated objection </em>to the court\u2019s instructions which would be given to guide the jurors in their deliberations. Because that issue is of foremost importance, it is in order to unfold the discourse which involved the judge and defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">Your Honor, I believe it was the state\u2019s requested instruction number three that was the instruction' upon malice and stated that malice may be express or implied. I think that has ultimately been incorporated into the court\u2019s instructions and I object to that on the basis that the malice definition is provided by statute in the Idaho Code and that that instruction as submitted and given by the court does not contain the same definition of the word malice as is included within that instruction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">State\u2019s requested instruction number four which is also \u2014 has also been included within the instructions to be given by the court to the jury I believe is confusing and does not accurately state the law. I believe that instruction was meant to be directed towards the single element of premeditation while the beginning of the instruction makes reference to all three separate elements, willful intent, deliberation and premeditation and intends to lump those altogether as one element through the subsequent definition that as I say I believe was included by the court as a definition in regards to the element of premeditation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\">In regards to the state\u2019s instructions that were submitted today I had the state\u2019s instructions submitted yesterday going through instruction number thirteen, Your Honor. What I have as state\u2019s requested instruction number fourteen is a \u2014 another definition of premeditated meaning merely thought beforehand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\">It goes on to incorporate the element of intent to kill if entertained but for a moment is sufficient for premeditation and there need be no appreciable space of time between the intention to kill and the act of attempted killing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-12\">I also would object to that as not being an accurate statement of the law and again serves to confuse the jury by combining what are separate elements of the offense into one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-13\">What I have as state\u2019s requested instruction number sixteen is that which I had already previously addressed, Your Honor, in regards to what I had as state\u2019s requested instruction number four. That instruction is again in regards to the statement requiring the willful intent, deliberation or premeditation exists for any particular length of time before the crime is committed. It is sufficient if it appears from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that there was design and determination to kill dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>tinctly formed in the mind of the defendant any moment before the killing took place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-4\">I had previously stated my objection to that, Your Honor. I think it is also cumulative based on the other instructions the court is giving in regards to those particular elements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-5\">That\u2019s the extent of my objections on instructions that the court intends to give, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">I would also state an <em>objection in regards to the court\u2019s refusal to instruct upon the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">There were instructions submitted by the defense setting forth not only the offense of second degree murder as a lesser included offense but also the offense of voluntary manslaughter. Voluntary manslaughter being defined as an unlawful killing without malice and upon sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap3\">I believe the evidence that has been submitted in this case is present where if the jury chose to believe those particular items of evidence that the \u2014 there exists sufficient evidence to justify the court\u2019s giving of the ... various instructions on the offense of voluntary manslaughter as were submitted by the defendant and would <em>object to the court\u2019s not including any instructions on the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter for both count one and count two and the accompanying instructions defining the elements of voluntary manslaughter and including the instructions defining what will constitute heat of passion, </em>which was defendant\u2019s requested instruction number 19.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-9\">The instructions as the court now intends to give them contain no reference of any kind to the offense of voluntary manslaughter as were requested in numerous of the instructions submitted by the defense in this matter and I would object to the court\u2019s non giving of those instructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-10\">THE COURT: Thank you Mr. Brudie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-11\">With regard to your objections just briefly, commenting on those. First with regard to the definition of malice. Of those submitted to the court it appears that the definition that\u2019s going to be given is the easiest to understand, and is an improvement which does not change the meaning of the definition contained within the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-13\">There is some duplication in the instruction, \u2014 in the instructions that\u2019s difficult to avoid. I felt the duplication was necessary in order to instruct as to give the jury a complete picture as to the law involved in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-14\">With regard to the court refusing to give the definition or refusing to submit to the jury the lesser included offense of voluntary manslaughter, <em>it is my opinion that there is not sufficient evidence in the record to support a verdict of voluntary manslaughter in that if the jury believes and finds the defendant guilty of anything it\u2019s going to have to be murder either in the first or second degree.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-15\">With the facts that are before the court there is \u2014 there is no basis from which a jury could find the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The facts would not support an interpretation that the \u2014 if the jury finds the killings took place from all of the evidence that has been submitted if the killings took place at the hand of the defendant and from \u2014 if the jury chooses to find the defendant guilty of any crimes I can<em>not </em>\u2014 cannot <em>see a set of facts that will support a finding that there was not malice involved in the killings.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-16\">There was not <em>a </em>\u2014 there\u2014it <em>was not a situation where there was a sudden quarrel or heat of passion. </em>Even the statement which was heard by the jury indicated that there was some period of time between the end of any quarrel and the time that the shots were fired. The defendant\u2019s own version is that there was discussion back and forth between the \u2014 between Ray Thomasson and himself before the shot was fired. And there \u2014 all indications and inferences are that that shot was not the fatal shot, that the fatal shot was fired at a later time and certainly <em>the evidence </em>which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>support a verdict of guilty of the defendant as to Judith Ann Thomasson <em>did not indicate any set of facts which would support a finding that that killing took place upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-4\">I can\u2019t justify in my own mind submitting that \u2014 that lesser included offense to the jury and it\u2019s my determination that the only lesser included offense that would be submitted to the jury is that of murder in the second degree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">R. Augmentation, 8-14 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">Comment is in order in regard to three instructions submitted to the court <em>by the prosecution, </em>none of which were given. The shortest of the three reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">INSTRUCTION NO__</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-8\">YOU ARE INSTRUCTED THAT VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER is the intentional and unlawful killing of a human being without malice aforethought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-9\">There is no malice aforethought if the killing occurred upon a sudden quarrel or heat of passion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">That language is beyond reproach, and would have the immediate effect of informing the jury the part played by malice aforethought, <em>i.e., </em>presence of malice is essential to proving a charge of murder. More importantly, the jury would know that a homicide which arises out of a <em>sudden quarrel or heat of passion </em>excludes malice aforethought from consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-11\">A second instruction requested by the prosecution is both definitive and instructive, and which would have informed the jury as to what constitutes the \u201cheat of passion\u201d which will reduce a homicide from murder to manslaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-12\">INSTRUCTION NO__</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-13\">The heat of passion which will reduce a murder to manslaughter must be such a passion as naturally would be aroused in the mind of an ordinarily reasonable person in the same circumstances. A defendant is not permitted to set up his own standard of conduct and to justify or excuse himself because his passions were aroused unless the circumstances in which he was placed and the facts that confronted him were such as also would have aroused the passion of the ordinarily reasonable man faced with the same situation. The basic inquiry is whether, at the time of the killing, the reason of the accused was obscured or disturbed by passion to such an extent as would cause the ordinarily reasonable person of average disposition to act rashly and without deliberation and reflection, and from such passion rather than from judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-17\">The identical instruction was submitted to the court as Defendant\u2019s Requested Instruction No. 19. That instruction could not but have had considerable impact upon the jury, <em>had </em>it been given. Where both parties requested the same instruction, it is not understood why the court did not submit it to the jury. The only apparent reason is the trial court\u2019s self-determination that the jury would be given two, and <em>only two </em>options of a returnable verdict: first degree murder or murder in the second degree.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-18\">The State also submitted voluntary manslaughter instructions as to both Count I and Count II:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-19\">INSTRUCTION NO__</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-20\">A charge of MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE also includes the lesser charge of VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. The material elements of the lesser offense of VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER for Count I are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-21\">1. That the defendant did wilfully, unlawfully, knowingly, intentionally and feloniously kill one Ray E. Thomasson [and Judith A. Thomasson];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>2. That the defendant acted without malice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-4\">3. That the act was a result of a sudden quarrel or heat of passion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-5\">4. That the act was committed on or about September 22, 1989, in Nez Perce County, State of Idaho.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">In sum, I am able to agree with the majority as set forth in part I of my opinion, but because this Court is \u201cunable to rule because we do not have a complete record\u201d I must dissent in large part to the majority opinion. The record presented to us prior to our making a ruling should be complete, and, if not, we should immediately have the record on appeal supplemented. With the prosecution and the defense requesting identical instructions on the most pivotal issue involved in this controversy, it is not in the least inappropriate to suggest that the trial court should have given more consideration to instructing the jury as both the prosecution and defense requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">Moreover, had the court not boxed the jury out of reaching a verdict of manslaughter, the jury very well might have reached a verdict which was <em>not </em>voluntary manslaughter. The jury was denied that opportunity. Yet, this is Idaho, part of the United States of America, wherein it has forever been believed that trials are <em>the </em>proper forum to resolve allegations of criminal wrongdoing, and, correspondingly, that juries of one\u2019s peers make the final determination of the degree of the crime under the proven facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">In the Supreme Court of the State of Idaho</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">State of Idaho, Plaintiff-Respondent,</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">v.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Bradley R.
