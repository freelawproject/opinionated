The sole issue on appeal is whether there is substantial and competent evidence to support the Commission\u2019s denial of benefits based on its finding that the claimant\u2019s breathing problems are not causally related to an industrial accident. We conclude that there is substantial and competent evidence to support the Commission\u2019s decision and affirm the Commission\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-29\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-30\">THE BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-31\">William Aldrich was employed by Lamb-Weston, Inc. (Lamb-Weston) and worked as a general laborer at Lamb-Weston\u2019s potato processing plant. On November 29, 1988, Aldrich was helping freeze hash browns in the hash brown room. In this room a mist consisting of water and chlorine was sprayed onto the hash browns to prevent bacterial growth. The chlorine level was maintained at thirty to fifty parts per million (ppm). On that day, however, the chlorine level rose to at least 200 ppm during Aldrich\u2019s shift. Aldrich was exposed to the high chlorine level for five and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>one-half hours before Lamb-Weston shut down the line.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Aldrich testified that he began having breathing problems after the exposure. On January 4, 1989, Aldrich was treated at the emergency room of a local hospital. Aldrich testified that he went to the emergency room because he was gasping for air and coughing up blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Aldrich had been laid off for a few days after the exposure. He returned to work on January 20, 1989, and worked next to a room that also contained chlorine gas. Aldrich testified that he and several other employees near this room complained of sore throats and breathing problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Aldrich quit working on April 20, 1989. Aldrich began seeing a physician in March 1989 and continued to see this physician monthly for approximately fourteen months. The physician concluded that Aid-rich suffered from chronic bronchitis, most likely caused by smoking.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Aldrich saw a pulmonary lung specialist on July 18, 1990. After testing Aldrich, the specialist diagnosed Aldrich as having mild interstitial lung disease. The specialist initially stated that the disease \u201cmay possibly\u201d be related to the chlorine exposures. Shortly before the hearing, the specialist stated that Aldrich\u2019s disease was \u201cmore likely than not\u201d related to the exposures.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Aldrich alleges that accidents occurred on November 29, 1988, and on January 20, 1989, and that these accidents caused his breathing problems. Following two days of hearing, the Commission issued its findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order. The Commission found persuasive testimony by two physicians who testified on behalf of Lamb-Weston that the exposure had not injured Aldrich.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The first physician testified that Aldrich did not have interstitial lung disease, but that his bronchitis resulted from smoking or asthma. This physician also stated that chlorine exposure would not cause interstitial lung disease, but that levels above twenty-five ppm for more than a few minutes could cause other injuries and that Aldrich did not display such symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">The second physician testified that a massive exposure to chlorine gas, such as 900 ppm, might cause interstitial lung disease, but that it would result in an immediate medical emergency. This physician had examined the equipment that generated chlorine gas that was installed during Aldrich\u2019s lay-off. The second physician testified that the chlorine gas was causing employees\u2019 eye and throat irritation.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-11\">The Commission found that the records from the emergency room visit did not include references to the chlorine exposure or any complaints by Aldrich or finding that Aldrich was coughing up blood. The records did state that Aldrich complained of fevers, chills, and coughing and that Aldrich\u2019s wife was complaining of the same symptoms. The doctor at the emergency room diagnosed and prescribed bronchitis medicine for Aldrich and his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">The Commission was not persuaded by the diagnosis of Aldrich\u2019s pulmonary lung specialist because of the specialist\u2019s inconsistent conclusions and because the specialist\u2019s conclusion that the disease was \u201crelated to\u201d the exposures did not establish causation. The Commission also gave little weight to the testimony by Aldrich\u2019s family that Aldrich did not display breathing problems prior to his accident because these witnesses were neither present at the accident nor were they medically trained.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-13\">The Commission denied benefits to Aid-rich, and Aldrich appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">THE COMMISSION\u2019S FINDING THAT ALDRICH\u2019S BREATHING PROBLEMS WERE NOT CAUSALLY RELATED TO HIS INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS WAS SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL AND COMPETENT EVIDENCE.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">Aldrich asserts that the Commission should have found that Aldrich\u2019s breathing problems were causally related to his accidents. Aldrich argues that the Commission erred when it relied on the testimony of the two physicians who testified for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>Lamb-Weston because these doctors disagreed on whether exposure to high chlorine levels could cause interstitial lung disease. In addition, Aldrich argues that the Commission must liberally construe evidence in favor of the claimant and that the Commission should have accepted the pulmonary lung specialist\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">This Court will not overturn factual findings made by the Commission when those findings are supported by substantial and competent evidence. Idaho Const, art. 5, \u00a7 9; I.C. \u00a7 72-732. The Commission is not required to construe facts liberally in favor of the worker when evidence is conflicting. <em>Bennett v. Bunker Hill Co., </em>88 Idaho 300, 305, 399 P.2d 270, 272 (1965). This Court will uphold findings supported by substantial and competent evidence, even if conflicting evidence exists. <em>Olvera v. Del's Auto Body, </em>118 Idaho 163, 164, 795 P.2d 862, 863 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">After reviewing the record and the Commission\u2019s decision, we conclude that the Commission\u2019s finding of fact that Aldrich\u2019s breathing problems are not related to an industrial accident is supported by substantial and competent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">CONCLUSION.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">We affirm the Commission\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">We award costs on appeal to respondent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b407-10\">BAKES, C.J. and McDEYITT, J\u201e and REINHARDT, J., Pro Tern, concur.</judges>\n<author id=\"b407-11\">BISTLINE, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"A9D\">writing separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">Not convinced that I can join the opinion for the Court, in that it relies on <em>Bennett v. Bunker Hill, </em>88 Idaho 300, 399 P.2d 270 (1965), and <em>Olvera v. Del\u2019s Auto Body, </em>118 Idaho 163, 795 P.2d 862 (1990), for two differing rulings, and noting that another vote is not necessary to achieve a majority, I write only to reaffirm the content of my dissent in <em>Olvera, </em>118 Idaho at 166-68, 795 P.2d at 865-67. In that dissent, I reiterated what this Court previously had held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-15\">[T]he Workers\u2019 Compensation Act should be liberally construed in favor of the employee, and in favor of coverage instead of exemption from coverage:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-16\">The statutory basis for the principle of liberal construction of the workers\u2019 compensation laws in favor of claimants is I.C. \u00a7 72-201 (1989). This declaration of the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation system in Idaho states that \u201csure and certain relief for injured workmen and their families and dependents is hereby provided regardless of questions of fault as is otherwise provided in this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-17\">For almost seventy years this Court has adhered to the principle that the workers\u2019 compensation law should be liberally construed in favor of the claimant in order to effect the object of the law and to promote justice. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-18\"><em>Olvera, </em>118 Idaho at 167, 795 P.2d at 866 (quoting <em>Haldiman v. American Fine Foods, </em>117 Idaho 955, 793 P.2d 187 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-19\">I also recommend <em>Olvera </em>as required reading in regard to what Justice Boyle wrote relative to the dispute as to whether Olvera was an employee or an independent contractor. I was particularly gratified to read the opening sentence to his Part III: \u201cThe law in this state is ... well established that when doubt exists as to whether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor under the Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, the Act must be given a <em>liberal construction </em>by the Industrial Commission____\u201d <em>Olvera, </em>118 Idaho at 165, 795 P.2d at 864 (emphasis added). Fortunately, most referees, in the words of Justice Boyle, \u201c[are] keenly aware of this principle of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Hopefully, all of the referees will give it recognition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
