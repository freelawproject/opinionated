The State then filed a petition for review of the Court of Appeals decision, which this court granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Russell pled guilty to two counts of obliterating the vehicle identification numbers on snowmobiles in June, 1988, and was sentenced to two concurrent five-year terms. Execution of the sentences was suspended, and Russell was placed on probation. Russell violated several of the conditions of his probation, and the district court revoked his probation in August, 1989, at the same time amending the sentences down to one year fixed and three years indeterminate, which he commenced serving. The court retained jurisdiction for 180 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-15\">On February 27, 1990, at the end of the retained jurisdiction period, the court brought Russell back and again placed him on probation, including as a condition of that probation that Russell \u201cnot contact his wife in any fashion.\u201d However, the court allowed Russell to go to his wife\u2019s home to pick up some of his personal belongings if he was accompanied by a \u201cresponsible adult.\u201d That same day Russell went with his lawyer to his wife\u2019s home when she was not present, broke in through the back door of the garage, splintering the door casing, and obtained certain of his personal belongings. The next day, at Russell\u2019s request, his stepfather telephoned Russell\u2019s wife, asking her to speak with Russell regarding their taxes, automobile insurance, and other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-16\">The district court was informed of Russell\u2019s contact with his wife and ordered him into court on March 3,1990, to determine if he had violated his probation. At the end of the hearing the trial court revoked his probation and ordered the remainder of the suspended sentence to be served. Russell later filed a motion to reconsider his probation revocation. The trial court treated this motion as a Rule 35 motion for reduction of sentence and, after a hearing, denied the motion. Russell appealed the trial court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-17\">On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed the district court\u2019s order revoking Russell\u2019s probation, holding that the condition of probation prohibiting him from contacting his wife was unreasonable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The State filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>this petition for review.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">Preliminarily, regarding our standard of review, when this Court reviews a decision of the Court of Appeals, we give consideration to the ruling of the Court of Appeals, but make an independent appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision. <em>Rice v. Hill City Stock Yards, </em>121 Idaho 576, 826 P.2d 1288 (1992); <em>Sato v. Schossberger, </em>117 Idaho 771, 792 P.2d 336 (1990). If substantial and competent, though conflicting, evidence supports the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, we will uphold those findings on appeal. <em>Rice v. Hill City Stock Yards, supra; MacNeil v. Minidoka Memorial Hosp., </em>108 Idaho 588, 701 P.2d 208 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Russell argues that the condition of probation that he not \u201ccontact his wife in any fashion\u201d was unreasonable. In rebuttal, the State argues that Russell failed to raise the issue at either the probation hearing in which the condition was imposed or at the probation revocation hearing, and therefore Russell cannot now raise it on appeal. We have recently reiterated that issues not raised before the trial court will not be considered on appeal. <em>State v. Pizzuto, </em>119 Idaho 742, 810 P.2d 680 (1991); <em>State v. Martin, </em>119 Idaho 577, 808 P.2d 1322 (1991). A review of the record discloses that Russell did not raise the issue of the reasonableness of the condition either when it was imposed or at the violation of probation hearing. The only issue raised was whether his actions violated the terms of the probation. Accordingly, Russell\u2019s claim on appeal that the term of probation that he not contact his wife was unreasonable has not been preserved. <em>State v. Martin, supra. </em>The Court of Appeals decision concluding otherwise is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Russell nevertheless argues that, aside from his reasonableness claim, there was insufficient evidence for the trial court to revoke his probation. Specifically, he argues that the condition that he not \u201ccontact his wife in any fashion\u201d was vague and that he thought it meant only that he could not speak to her personally. Russell also argues that his asking his stepfather to telephone his wife did not warrant the trial court\u2019s decision to revoke his probation. The trial court, exercising its discretion, concluded otherwise. We find no abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Hooper, </em>119 Idaho 606, 809 P.2d 467 (1991); <em>State v. Barton, </em>119 Idaho 114, 803 P.2d 1020 (Ct.App.1991) (\u201cOnce a probation violation has been proved, the decision to revoke probation and pronounce sentence is within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d). The trial court explicitly stated to Russell that \u201cyou will not contact your wife in any fashion. You will not go onto her premises or into her dwelling without any exceptions.\u201d Mark Branson, a probation officer, testified at the probation violation hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIJ\">THE COURT: Did you have any discussions with [Russell] about contacting his wife?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-8\">THE WITNESS: I did that same evening, which should have been Tuesday the 27th. This would have been after they had been to the home. He came to my office, as he was getting ready to leave we discussed any potential contact with his wife. He was informed by myself and by Mr. Peterson that he was to have no contact whatsoever. He inquired about what about the insurance on my truck, I need to get ahold [sic] of her about that and such things as that. <em>He was advised at that time that any contact that was necessary would have to be handled through his attorney. </em>We discussed that before he left the of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fice. That came up again later that evening when I was at his home. <em>I again told him any contact whatsoever has to be handled through your attorneys. </em>So there were two times on the 27th. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">In light of Mr. Branson\u2019s testimony and the trial court\u2019s specific statement to Russell that he not contact his wife <em>\u201cin any fashion,\u201d </em>we conclude that Russell should reasonably have known that when he asked his stepfather to call his wife he was violating the court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The trial court had ample opportunity to determine whether Russell was an appropriate candidate for continued probation. His probation had been revoked once before for numerous violations. He had been before the court many times. Throughout Russell\u2019s various court proceedings, the trial court repeatedly remarked that he had an extremely poor attitude and that he had been \u201cdefiant to all kinds of authority,\u201d \u201cresistive to the probation officer,\u201d and that he had \u201cargued with the Court.\u201d The trial court was able to judge Russell\u2019s demeanor throughout these proceedings. After noting that Russell had an extremely poor attitude, the court considered the threat to society if Russell continued to be released on probation. He looked at Russell\u2019s previous actions while on probation, understandably concluding that Russell would be likely to violate any probation conditions in the future, given his past record.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In view of these facts, we hold that the trial court did not err in revoking Russell\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Russell contends that the trial court improperly based its decision to revoke his probation on the court\u2019s previous concerns with Russell and on the method in which Russell broke into his wife\u2019s house to get his personal belongings. Russell\u2019s past behavior and his method of entry into his wife\u2019s house were factors which the trial court was entitled to consider in determining how to exercise his discretion in the revocation proceeding.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-12\">In the process of determining whether a grant of probation is appropriate ..., the trial court necessarily must be permitted to evaluate a broad range of information about the defendant\u2019s personality. This information may be gathered from many sources____ Very little information about a defendant will be irrelevant to the effort of the law to individualize treatment of convicted persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-15\"><em>State v. Moore, </em>93 Idaho 14, 17, 454 P.2d 51, 54 (1969). In that same case, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-16\">In a determination of the appropriateness of a grant of probation, the trial court must consider the defendant\u2019s \u201cprevious character and actions, * * * [his prospects for] abidpng] by the terms of his probation and * * * [for] rehabilitation,] and * * * the interests of society.\u201d The primary consideration has been stated to be the \u201cgood order and protection of society.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-17\"><em>State v. Moore, </em>93 Idaho 14, 17, 454 P.2d 51, 54 (1969), <em>quoting State v. Moore, </em>78 Idaho at 359, 363, 304 P.2d 1101-1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-18\">Next, Russell argues that the trial court erred in denying his Rule 35 Motion. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-19\">I.C.R. 35 permits the filing of such a motion \u201cupon revocation of probation.\u201d The trial court revoked Russell\u2019s probation on March 2, 1990. Russell did not file his Rule 35 motion until March 9, 1990. The motion was untimely, and absent any special circumstances or any misleading conduct on the part of the government which could explain the delay, the trial court has no jurisdiction to entertain the motion. (Citation omitted.) Thus, the trial court did not err in denying the motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-20\">We agree. \u201cWhen a reduction of a sentence is sought upon revocation of probation, the motion must be made at the time probation is revoked. It cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>filed after revocation and after the prison sentence has been ordered into execution.\u201d <em>State v. Hocker, </em>119 Idaho 105, 106-07, 803 P.2d 1011, 1012-1013 (Ct.App.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Finally, Russell argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion to dismiss at the end of the State\u2019s case in chief at the second probation revocation hearing. He contends that there was inadequate proof that he requested his stepfather to phone his wife and thus the State failed to prove its case and the motion to dismiss should have been granted. However, Russell\u2019s estranged wife testified, without objection, for the State that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">He [Russell\u2019s stepfather] called, he said, \u201cRichard would like to talk to you.\u201d And I indicated to him at that time, I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he contact me or talk to me before they decided to break into my house yesterday?\u201d Tony said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d I said, \u201cThen I suggest you ask him about that.\u201d He said, \u201cAll he wants to talk to you about is your taxes.\u201d And I said, \u201cI suggest he call and talk to the attorneys about it, then,\u201d and I hung up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In this probation violation proceeding, that was sufficient evidence that the call was made at Russell\u2019s request to survive a motion to dismiss. Russell himself acknowledged in his testimony that he had in fact asked his stepfather to make the call. The trial court did not err in denying Russell\u2019s motion to dismiss the action to revoke his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We affirm the trial court\u2019s decision to revoke Russell\u2019s probation. That portion of the Court of Appeals opinion holding otherwise is vacated. We also affim the trial court\u2019s decision to deny Russell\u2019s Rule 35 motion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b536-8\">JOHNSON and McDEVITT, JJ., and CAREY, J. Pro Tern., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">. Russell's notice of appeal, filed on March 26, 1990, purports to appeal from the \"final judgment of conviction entered in the above entitled action on the 11th day of August, 1989, ..., the order revoking appellant\u2019s probation entered in the above entitled action on the 2nd day of March, 1990, and the order denying the Rule 35 motion of appellant dated the 13th day of March, 1990____\u2019\u2019 The latter two orders are within 42 days of the time that the notice of appeal was filed. However, the original final judgment of conviction was entered on August 11, 1989, and no appeal was filed within 42 days of that date. Under I.A.R. 17(e)(B) a notice of appeal may only be filed from those final judgments \"for which the time for appeal has not expired.\u201d Therefore, there is no jurisdiction to consider the original final judgment of conviction in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-19\">. The Court of Appeals also held that the district court properly dismissed Russell\u2019s Rule 35 motion challenging his probation revocation because the motion was not timely filed. The court rejected the other issues which Russell attempted to raise either because they had not been raised in the trial court or were not timely raised on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-6\">. Russell was released on parole on March 5, 1992, sifter the Court of Appeals opinion was released. Subsequently, the State filed a motion to dismiss this appeal, arguing that since Russell had been released on parole, his attack on his probation revocation had become moot. We disagree. As counsel for Russell argued before this Court during oral argument, if Russell had been released on probation rather than parole, and if he successfully completed his term of probation, he would have had the opportunity to reduce his conviction to a misdemeanor. Also, the penalties for violating a condition of probation can be less severe than that for a parole violation, which is generally an immediate return to jail. Accordingly, we conclude that this case is not moot and deny the State\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b535-7\">. At the probation revocation hearing, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">This Court believes that Mr. Russell is and could be a threat to society. I gave him every opportunity to prove himself ... and here he is right back in court in violation of another court order____</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b536-9\">BISTLINE, Justice,</author>\n<p id=\"AEc\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">After reviewing the State\u2019s petition requesting this Court to grant review, my vote was that we <em>not </em>do so. The Court of Appeals in a unanimous opinion, per Judge Silak, demonstrated that considerable time and effort had been devoted to arriving at a fair and reasonable conclusion, one that in my view should have suggested that this Court could have better expended its time and energy on some appellate controversy other than one which had been thoroughly considered and decided, thereafter leaving further proceedings up to the district judge who had presided in the State\u2019s prosecution against Russell. On that point, often have I ventured the thought that the best insight into any litigation will come from, first the participating attorneys, and second, the trial judge, and in this instance, third, the appellate court which labored with the controversy, coming up with the conclusion that the district court should be given the opportunity to reconsider its decision after receiving the benefit of the comprehensive collective recitation of three capable judges. My confidence in the particular trial judge is boundless; he is an excellent trial judge, and a person who one would expect to take another look backward at a criminal trial with interrelated overtures of domestic intranquility, all of which produced a degree of frustration not ordinarily encountered, concerning which more will be stated later herein when my review is documented and concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">The Court of Appeals, after appellate argument was fully presented, took the controversy under consideration and came to a conclusion to which I readily subscribe: \u201cWe agree that the condition [imposed by the district court] was unduly restrictive.\u201d <em>State v. Russell, </em>122 Idaho 515, 518, 835 P.2d 1326, 1329 (Ct.App.1991). In support of that conclusion, the Court of Appeals reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-13\">In the present case, the court imposed a probation condition requiring that Russell would \u201cnot contact [his] wife in any fashion.\u201d Russell\u2019s conviction was for altering the vehicle identification numbers on snowmobiles. <em>There is no evidence that Russell\u2019s contact with his wife bore even tangential relationship to his criminal- activity. </em>Communicating with a spouse is not itself a criminal activity. Thus, the probation condition prohibiting Russell from contacting his wife was unreasonable. Probation may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>not be revoked on the single ground that there was a violation of an improper provision of probation. For this reason, it was an abuse of discretion to revoke Russell\u2019s probation on the basis that he had a third party contact his wife. Because we have found the condition unduly restrictive, we do not reach the issue of whether it was ambiguous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AOO\">Russell, 122 Idaho at 519, 835 P.2d at 1330 (1991) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Probably the most dismayingly dismal judicial rationale anyone might ever expect in a criminal case surfaces in the final paragraph of this Supreme Court\u2019s majority opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">Finally, Russell argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant his motion to dismiss at the end of the State\u2019s case in chief at the second probation revocation hearing. He contends that there was inadequate proof that he requested his stepfather to phone his wife and thus the State failed to prove its case and the motion to dismiss should have been granted. However, Russell\u2019s estranged wife testified, without objection, for the State that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">\u2018He [Russell\u2019s stepfather] called, he said, \u201cRichard would like to talk to you.\u201d And I indicated to him at that time, I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he contact me or talk to me before they decided to break into my house yesterday?\u201d Tony said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d I said, \u201cThen I suggest you ask him about that.\u201d He said, \u201cAll he wants to talk to you about is your taxes.\u201d And I said, \u201cI suggest he call and talk to the attorneys about it, then,\u201d and I hung up.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">In this probation violation proceeding, that was sufficient evidence that the call was made at Russell\u2019s request to survive a motion to dismiss. Russell himself acknowledged in his testimony that he had in fact asked his stepfather to make the call. The trial court did not err in denying Russell\u2019s motion to dismiss the action to revoke his probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">The actual circumstances make it abundantly clear that most reasonable persons will conclude that the thrust of the case against Russell, violation of probation, should not have hinged on the question of whether he was guilty of asking his stepfather to call his wife by telephone. Clearly the important fact is that Russell <em>did not </em>call her. His stepfather did so at Russell\u2019s request relative to a wholly innocuous question regarding income taxes and insurance policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The Court, not much to its credit, takes little note of the lucid discussion presented in the brief which defense counsel, Steven G. Wood, presented to the Court on behalf of Mr. Russell:</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">\u201cThis appeal arose when Defendant\u2019s probation was revoked because he had his step-father telephone Defendant\u2019s wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">\u201cDefendant was originally charged with two counts of Grand Theft By Possession in violation of Idaho Code 18-2403(4) and 18-2407(1), one count of Selling or Disposing of Vehicle With Altered Serial Number in violation of Idaho Code 18-2410(2), one count of Conspiracy to Sell or Dispose of Vehicle With Altered Serial Number in violation of Idaho Code 2410(2) and 18-1701, one count of Insurance Fraud in violation of Idaho Code 41-1325(1), and one county of Obliterating, Removing or Stamping a Vehicle Identification Number in violation of Idaho Code 49-1128(3).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-13\">\u201cAt the preliminary hearing, the prosecution dismissed counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 of the complaint and amended Count 1 to a second charge of Obliterating, Removing or Stamping a Vehicle Identification Number in violation of Idaho Code 49-1128(3), a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-14\">\u201cPursuant to plea negotiations in exchange for the dismissals of the other counts, Defendant waived the preliminary hearing and was bound over to district court on the two counts of Obliterating a Vehicle Serial Number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-15\">\u201cIn District Court the Defendant pleaded Guilty to the charges, and a pre-sentence report was ordered, and a time set for sentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-16\">\u201cSentencing was held on September 12, 1988, at which time the issue arose con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>ceming restitution to victims of the crimes which had been dismissed. The court concluded <em>that it could not consider restitution on the dismissed charges, </em>and proceeded to order some restitution paid by Defendant and to sentence Defendant on Count I to a minimum term of two years plus an additional 3 year indeterminate period, and an identical sentence on Count II, to run concurrently. The Court retained jurisdiction for 180 days.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">\u201cDefense counsel then filed a motion pursuant to Rule 35 ICR, asking that the restitution ordered to Kruse Insurance be withdrawn, because it related to one of the dismissed counts, and asking that Defendant be allowed to serve his time in the Bannock County jail because of his physical (medical) condition. <em>The Court </em>denied the motion, and further <em>stated that as a term and condition of probation the Defendant must pay restitution to all victims the prosecution could prove were damaged by him, whether or not it related to the crimes to which Defendant pleaded guilty. </em>The Court retained jurisdiction for 120 days because of Defendant\u2019s medical condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">\u201cIn October 1988, the District Court held a hearing to consider suspending Defendant\u2019s prison sentence and allowing him to spend time in the Bannock County jail and receive the therapy he needed. <em>The prosecutor felt this might be appropriate on condition that Defendant would pay restitution to ALL victims.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u201cIn November 1988, the <em>Court released Defendant from jail upon his payment of $7,000 </em>[an accomplished fact] to go to all the victims' and a promise to pay whatever else might be determined to be necessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">\u201cIn December 1988, further proceedings were held relating to the terms of Defendant\u2019s probation and the restitution to be paid. Defendant\u2019s sentence was suspended and he was placed on 5 years probation, upon certain conditions, including payment of restitution. The Court indicated that the charges could be reduced to a misdemeanor if the Defendant paid the restitution and fulfilled his probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\u201cIn July of 1989, the Defendant was brought before the court on a probation violation charge for various violations. The Defendant admitted to the violations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">\u201cIn August 1989 the disposition hearing was held on the probation violation and the Court revoked the probation and, without advance notice, the court changed the Defendant\u2019s sentence to consecutive terms of three years fixed on Count I and three years indeterminate on Count II.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\"><em>\u201cDefendant fulfilled his 180 [day] rider, and was returned to District court with a recommendation of probation. </em>The District court granted probation to Defendant on February 27, 1990, and revoked the probation on March 2, 1990, because Defendant violated the court\u2019s verbal order relating to having no contact with his wife.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-11\">\u201cThis appeal followed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">\u201cA) FACTS RELATING TO THE ISSUE OF RESTITUTION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">\u201cDefendant was obligated to pay restitution to all victims ... even victims of charges which were dismissed ... before he would be granted probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">\u201cThe issue of restitution was raised by the prosecution before the District court in the initial Sentencing appearance of Defendant before it on August 22, 1988. <em>At that time the prosecuting attorney had no objection to the Court granting probation</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-15\">\u2018MR. ODDO: We would not oppose probation, Your Honor, if he\u2019s willing to further work with the State Police in clearing up everything and make restitution to Royal Insurance Company and Safeco, we would not oppose probation, Your Honor.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">\u201cIn the continued Sentencing hearing three weeks later, there was argument whether the Defendant must pay restitution to only the victims of the crimes to which he pleaded guilty, or also to the victims of the charges which had been dismissed and others that came to light as a result of his talks with the police. The District Court finally concluded that\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>. there was nothing on the record from the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office that the Court was to consider other criminal conduct with respect to restitution.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u201cAnd further,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">\u2018And the Court is not pleased at all with this case at all. In most criminal cases when the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s office dismisses charges against a defendant, the Court is asked to take into consideration the restitution to the victims in this community for criminal conduct by those being sentenced. Unfortunately that wasn\u2019t done in this case, and the Court has no power to order this defendant to pay restitution on charges that were dismissed by the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office ... <em>The Court is going to have to proceed in this case and order restitution only on the two matters that the defendant entered a plea of guilty to.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">\u201cNevertheless, the Court then <em>ordered the Defendant to pay Kruse Insurance for the alleged insurance fraud count which had been dismissed.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\u201cWhen defense counsel later brought a Rule 35 motion to modify the judgment to correct the restitution mistake, the Court denied the motion, and\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">\u2018The Court ruled that with regard to Kruse Insurance, in the event the defendant is ultimately placed on probation, the Court will hold a formal hearing at a later date to determine the exact amount owed to said Insurance Company. The Court further advised defendant that in the event the Recommendation Committee recommends the defendant be placed on probation, it will be a condition of his probation that he pay restitution to all victims who suffered monetary damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, or the court will relinquish jurisdiction in this matter.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">\u201cThe Court made it clear that no probation would be granted unless the Defendant paid the restitution. It said,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">T hope you make it up there, I hope they recommend probation for you. If they do, we\u2019ll certainly bring you back, and then we\u2019ll have another little session on this restitution. But between now and then and after the Prosecutor submits his report, if you don\u2019t <em>want </em>\u2014 if <em>you feel like you don\u2019t want to pay those sums off, just simply advise your attorney of that and I\u2019ll relinquish jurisdiction.'</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">\u201cMr. Russell later agreed to pay all victims in order to get probation.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-13\">\u2018The Court on its own motion, moved to release the defendant from custody at this time, if the defendant was willing to post a $7,000.00 bond with the Bannock County Auditor, to be held in trust to show good faith on behalf of the defendant, indicating he will pay the restitution owing to the victims in this matter, once the total is determined by the Bannock County Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">\u201cB) STATEMENT OF FACTS RELATING TO EVIDENTIARY ERRORS.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-15\">\u201cDefense counsel objected to the Court considering other criminal allegations which were dismissed or hearsay evidence relating to bad acts by the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-16\">\u201cNevertheless, <em>the prosecution presented, and the court considered, many bare allegations before and during sentencing. For example, the prosecutor questioned the Defendant about stolen guns and stolen snowmobiles. </em>Defense counsel objected to using the information the Defendant had given to a police officer under a cooperation agreement to prejudice him at sentencing. <em>The Court allowed such questions. </em>The prosecutor made hearsay/opinion statements without presenting evidence, such as:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-17\">\u2018And there\u2019s a lot of other snowmobiles that he\u2019s obliterated.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-18\">\u2018I think that the serial numbers were altered as a pattern of criminal activity of stolen snowmobiles.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-19\">\u2018... and it\u2019s my understanding that he admitted those facts [relating to insurance fraud] to Sergeant Bunderson on the 24th of August.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-20\">\u201cFurthermore, the Court evidently considered the objectional statements in deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>mining the sentence of Defendant, as evidenced by these statements:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">\u2018... it appears to the Court that this is a much more serious matter than the nature of the offenses to which the defendant pled guilty to. He\u2019s admitted to having five snow-machines that he knew were stolen with altered serial numbers in Blackfoot____ And it looks to me that the presentence investigation report also indicates that this isn\u2019t just a simple case of altering serial numbers on snowmachines. They indicated there\u2019s a very disturbing pattern here that emerges and involves a theft of snowmobiles which were subsequently sold after the serial numbers had been altered.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u2018... I want to emphasize again, there\u2019s much more, and the pre-sentence investigator indicates, there\u2019s much more than meets the eye here in this \u2019case, and people are entitled to have their property not taken from them, especially recreational property that does sit out and maybe it\u2019s more easy than other things to steal.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">\u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019ve entered pleas of guilty to certain criminal conduct. As far as I\u2019m concerned, you\u2019ve also been engaged in other criminal activity that you didn\u2019t plead guilty to.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-13\">\u201cQ STATEMENT OF FACTS RELATING TO REVOCATION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S PROBATION.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-14\">\u201cDefendant was placed on a 180 day rider, after which he was returned to the District Court.

Upon receipt of the report, the Judge issued a Bench Warrant for the arrest of Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u201cAfter his arrest, Defendant denied that he had violated his probation and a hearing was held on March 2, 1990.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">\u201cDefendant\u2019s estranged wife testified that Mr. Martinez [Russell\u2019s stepfather] telephoned her and said the Defendant would like to talk to her.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-14\">\u2018A.

She testified as follows:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3L\">\u2018Q. Have you spoken with Tony Martinez on previous occasions about various things concerning you and Richard?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u2018A.

Had you called Dorothy before on behalf of Richard?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-13\">\u2018A. Yeah, previously before, yes.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-14\">\u2018Q.

No, no, we have always talked, you know, we have been friends for 30 years, you know.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-16\">\u201cThe Defendant also testified:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-17\">\u2018A.

That was a direct order from this Court. The court finds by a preponderance of the evidence the fact that Mr. Martinez called the wife, the Court finds that he was simply a conduit of Mr. Russell, he did so at Mr. Russell\u2019s request.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-20\">\u201cD) STATEMENT OF FACTS RELATING TO THE COURT\u2019S CHANGE OF SENTENCE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-21\">\u201cOn September 12, 1988, the Defendant was sentenced to \u2018a minimum term without the possibility of parole or good time of two years, plus an additional term of three years indeterminate sentence\u2019 on Count I, and a like sentence on Count II, to run concurrently. The Court also ordered Defendant to pay restitution to Royal Insurance Company, Kruse Insurance Company, and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Alvin Knudsen, plus $20.00 to the State of Idaho Victim\u2019s Compensation Fund and $16.50 court costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-22\">\u201cOn December 19, 1988, the court required as a term of Defendant's probation for him to pay $750 to the Idaho State Police, $1,200 as costs of prosecution, plus the $20 Victim\u2019s Fund and $16.50 costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A8z\">\u201cOn August 11, 1989, without advance notice, the Court changed the sentence to three years fixed on Count I, and three years indeterminate on Count II, to run consecutively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-23\">\u201cThe basis for the change by the court was that the crimes committed by Defendant occurred prior to February 1, 1987, when the Unified Sentencing Law was adopted. NOTE, however, that the information was amended at the arraignment to allege that one of the crimes occurred on March 3, 1987. [NOTE FURTHER, that the Minute Entry and Order dated 20 June 1988 incorrectly has the date as March 7, 1988.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-24\">ISSUES</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-25\">1.

Did the trial court err in re-sentencing the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">4. Did the trial court err in revoking the probation of the Defendant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">ARGUMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">\u201c1. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REQUIRING DEFENDANT TO PAY RESTITUTION ON CRIMINAL CHARGES WHICH WERE DISMISSED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">\u201cIdaho Criminal Rule 33(d) prohibits as a condition of probation \u2018any requirements of the contribution of money or property to any charity or other non-governmental organization.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">\u201cThe District Court first determined that it could only order restitution on the two matters that the defendant pled guilty to. The Court specifically therein said '... <em>the Court has no power to order this defendant to pay restitution on charges that were dismissed by the Prosecuting Attorney\u2019s Office.\u2019 \u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-10\">\u201cNevertheless, the Court then promptly proceeded to order the Defendant to pay the disputed debt on a dismissed charge, that being the Kruse Insurance restitution. When this was brought to the Court\u2019s attention in a Rule 35 motion the Court refused to modify the sentence and sternly informed the Defendant that his potential probation would depend upon him paying \u2018restitution to all victims who suffered monetary damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct, or the court will relinquish jurisdiction in this matter.\u2019 (emphasis added)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-11\">\u201cThe defendant had pleaded not guilty to all charges brought against him. <em>The State dismissed all but two charges relating to obliterating vehicle serial numbers. </em>There was no plea bargain relating to restitution. If the Defendant had been required to go to trial on the charges which were dismissed, and had been found not guilty, he would not have had to pay restitution. Dismissal is akin to acquittal. It is therefore totally unjust to punish him for suspected but unproven (and dismissed) crimes. Defense counsel argued this point to the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-13\">\n<em>\u201cRestitution may be a valid issue in plea negotiations, but it is not proper to accept a defendant\u2019s plea after negotiation and then argue that he cannot have probation without paying restitution for every crime of which he is suspected.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">\u201cThe Defendant agreed to cooperate with the police as part of his plea agreement. Then when he revealed the information they sought, and admitted to some involvement in illegal activities, the prosecution sought to require restitution on those activities. That kind of action on the part of the prosecution does not provide much incentive to a Defendant to fully cooperate! The police officer with whom the Defendant spoke admitted that the information used against the defendant admitted that the in the sentencing came from conversations he had with the Defendant: \u2018Q. And did this conversation with Mr. Russell take place as part of an agreement whereby he would agree to clear up some matters concerning thefts and other criminal activities?\u2019 \u2018A. Yes.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">\u201cRestitution became a bitter issue in this case. The Defendant denied wrongdoing, for example, in the alleged insurance fraud. But the Court saw his reluctance to pay restitution as an indication of a bad attitude, and with the Defendant having a \u2018bad attitude,\u2019 the Court would not grant probation. <em>When the Defendant relented, and agreed to pay all \u2018victims,\u2019 the Court granted probation. </em>If in fact the Defendant was innocent of insurance fraud, the Court\u2019s action surely could do nothing but create a bad attitude in the Defendant toward the \u2018justice\u2019 he was having to swallow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-16\">\u201c2. THE COURT ERRED IN RECEIVING AND CONSIDERING IN THE SENTENCING OF THE DEFENDANT THE COMMENTS OF THE PROSECUTING ATTORNEY WHICH ARE UNSUPPORTED BY TESTIMONY OR OTHER EVIDENCE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-17\">\u201cThe Idaho Judges Sentencing Manual, at page 605, states:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>\u2018The evidence that may be received at a hearing in aggravation or mitigation is restricted by the provisions of Idaho Code \u00a7 19-2516. This section provides:\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVT\">\u2018The circumstances must be presented by the testimony of witnesses examined in open court, except that when a witness is so sick or infirm as to be unable to attend, his deposition may be taken by a magistrate of the county, out of court, upon such notice to the adverse party as the court may direct. No affidavit or testimony, or representation of any kind, verbal or written, can be offered to or received by the court, or a judge thereof, in aggravation or mitigation of the punishment, except as provided in this and the preceding section.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-4\">\u2018If either the prosecution or the defendant insist, the court may not receive any evidence in violation of this section of the code. That means that all evidence must be in the form of live testimony with an opportunity for cross examination, except non-oral testimony in the form of a written pre-sentence investigation report <em>(State v. Creech, </em>105 Idaho 362 [670 P.2d 463], 1983.)\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">\u201cSome of the adverse information used by the Judge in the sentencing of the Defendant was of course obtained from the pre-sentence investigation report. But the prosecuting attorney was wrongfully allowed to make opinion statements over the Defendant\u2019s objections.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">\u2018And there\u2019s a lot of other snowmobiles that he\u2019s obliterated ...\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">T would still like to ask about the five snowmobiles in Blackfoot because I think that these two things that he\u2019s pled guilty to have to be placed in a pattern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">I think the Court has to understand what the significance of his actions were to obliterate the numbers on those snowmobiles.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">\u201cThe prosecutor thereafter attempted to use against the Defendant the very information he gave the police pursuant to his cooperation agreement. The Defense objected,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-13\">\u2018MR WOOD: Excuse me, Your Honor. I\u2019m going to object to this line of questioning on the basis that he\u2019s not charged with things relating to this, this [sic\u2014 it\u2019s] part of his cooperation agreement that he has revealed these things, and I think it\u2019s improper for the prosecution at this point to try to prejudice the case against him by him doing what they have asked him to do.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-14\">\u201cThe court, however, allowed questioning on these things. The Defense again objected,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-15\">\u2018MR. WOOD: Your Honor, if there\u2019s going to be evidence presented here today, I want it to be presented and us have a chance to cross-examine on it. I don\u2019t want a conclusionary statement to be given by the prosecution about what he did or didn\u2019t do.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-16\">\u201cThe prosecutor thereafter continued to present hearsay/opinion statements:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-17\">\u2018MR. ODDO: ... Like I said, he met with one investigator and didn\u2019t tell him about the five snowmobiles and then met with Sergeant Bunderson the week after that and basically had to have it dragged out of him after Sergeant Bunderson already got information about those five snowmobiles from a different source. I don\u2019t know if that sounds to me like cooperation. Yeah, he agreed to show them the five snowmobiles, but after he was confronted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-18\">\u2018THE DEFENDANT: I object on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-19\">\u2018MR. WOOD: Likewise, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-20\">\u2018THE COURT: I\u2019m going to take a short recess ... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-21\">\u2018MR. ODDO: Just a couple of questions, Your Honor \u2014 well, I don\u2019t know if the Court ruled about whether or not I could ask him questions about the snowmobiles that he had in Blackfoot and whether or not the were \u2014 the serial numbers were obliterated on them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-22\">\u2018THE COURT: You may ask that question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-23\">\u2018MR. ODDO: ... His son-in-law, who was kind of cooperating with him in these ventures, did some time in the Ida<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>ho Department of Corrections, it was on a rider, and I think that this individual should get at least that much time.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">\u201c3. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN RE-SENTENCING THE DEFENDANT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">\u201cIt appears that one of the crimes to which the Defendant pleaded guilty occurred prior to February 1, 1987, and the other crime occurred after that date. This means that the unified sentencing act of Idaho applies to one crime but not to the other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">\u201cThe Court evidently overlooked the amendment to the complaint showing the date of the crime to be March 3, 1987.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">\u201cThe Idaho Judges Sentencing Manual, at page 717, says\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">\u2018Prior to the amendments and repeals of statutes effective February 1, 1987, I.C. Sec. 19-2513 and 19-2513A provided for the imposition of either an indeterminate sentence or an alternative fixed term sentence. Although these statutes are not in the current code volumes, they will still apply to offenses committed pri- or to February 1, 1987.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">\u201cAlthough it is not considered as a sentencing alternative, the court always has the jurisdiction to correct an illegal sentence. [Rule 35, I.C.R.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">\u201cHowever, the troubling thing about the District Court\u2019s action in resentencing the Defendant was that <em>the fixed term was increased from two years to three years, and the sentence went from concurrent to consecutive.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-11\">\u201cIn addition, the Court added $750 payable to the Idaho State Police, and $1,200 payable to the County as costs of prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-12\">\u201cIt sounded to the Defendant like <em>increased punishment for the violation of his probation, instead of merely imposing the previous sentence.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">\u201c4. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN REVOKING THE PROBATION OF THE DEFENDANT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">\u201cA sentence imposed within the discretion of the trial court will not be disturbed by the Idaho Supreme Court in the absence of abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Dunn, </em>91 Idaho 870, 876 [434 P.2d 88] (1967).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-16\">\u201cThe defendant has the burden of showing a clear abuse of discretion on appeal. <em>State v. Chapa, </em>98 Idaho 54 [558 P.2d 83] (1976); <em>State v. Rice, </em>99 Idaho 752 [588 P.2d 951] (1979).\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-17\">\u2018The terms and conditions of probation must be contained in a written order granting probation. <em>Ex parte Medley, </em>73 Idaho 474, 480 [253 P.2d 794] (1953). If the terms of probation are only stated orally, then there is a serious question as to whether they can be enforced.\u2019 (Idaho Judges Sentencing Manual, p. 815)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">\u201cThere was no written order granting probation in this case at the time the Defendant supposedly violated the Court order. Although the Order was dated February 26, 1990, that is most certainly an error, because the hearing was not held until February 27, 1990. It is possible that the Order was signed prior to the morning of February 28, 1990, when the alleged violation took place, but it is certain that neither Defendant or his counsel had a copy of it by that time. Thus, the Defendant was left to his own memory and impression as to what the Court had ordered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">\u201cLikewise, Probation and Parole had not signed him into their program and there were no written instructions for him to follow, nor a probation agreement.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-20\"><em>\u2018Conditions imposed by the court should be designed to assist the probationer in leading a law abiding life. They should be reasonably related to his rehabilitation and not unduly restrictive of his liberty or incompatible with his freedom of religion.

You will not go onto her premises or into her dwelling without exception.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">\u201cThe Court in it\u2019s mind evidently meant that the Defendant not only was to refrain himself from \u2018contacting\u2019 his wife, but he was also not to \u2018contact\u2019 her through any other person. This was not stated by the court, however. The court also did not explain that \u2018not more than merely physically staying out of her sight ... it contact your wife\u2019 meant staying away from her, or also meant to not telephone her through another person. The Defendant was evidently expected to understand that he could contact his wife through his attorney, but not through his step-father (who had been doing the telephoning between them for nine months). The Court may but the wording have meant it\u2019s order to be comprehensive, under the circumstances was ambiguous. The judge spoke one sentence of ten words, then went on to talk about not going to the premises of the wife, and then granted the Defendant permission to go to the premises on certain conditions. Even the judge was unclear on exactly what he had ordered. He revoked the probation the Defendant on the grounds \u2018that he was not to contact his wife or make any effort to contact his wife.\u2019 In fact, there was NO language in the order preventing the Defendant from \u2018making an effort\u2019 to contact his wife. The Prosecutor also evidently misunderstood what the Court had verbally ordered, and thought an ATTEMPT was enough for a violation, because that is how he couched his question to Defendant\u2019s wife ... \u2018Has he attempted to contact you in the past week?\u2019 Is it any wonder that the Defendant was unclear as to what had been said or meant? <em>The prosecutor admits that the Defendant probably did not understand.\u201d</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">T think Mr. Wood is correct when he calls this a technical violation. I think maybe Mr. Russell wasn\u2019t aware of what the court meant. Maybe he did forget the prior court order and maybe he didn\u2019t understand what Mark Branson meant when he told him no contact.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">\u201cThe judge said the following in the revocation hearing:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">\u2018When you fellows asked if he could go up and get some of his belongings, I said he could so long as he had another responsible adult. I assumed his wife would be home, I certainly didn\u2019t assume that he would break in.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\u201cDoesn\u2019t it strike one as a little inconsistent that it was OK with the Judge that the Defendant go with a third person to the home while the wife was there, but that it was not OK to have a third party merely call her to see if she would talk to the Defendant about legitimate questions? Would the Defendant have violated his probation if he had talked to his wife while at the home? Or if he had asked the third party to talk to her? Just what was the judge trying to accomplish with his order? Why was he so upset about the telephone call, when the wife herself was not? The Defendant could well have understood the comments of the Judge as ordering him not to harass his wife, and that he should use a third party to insure that that did not happen ... which is precisely what he did in having his step-father telephone her, as had been the practice for months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\u201cIn <em>CRIMINAL PROCEDURE, </em>Vol. 3, a Criminal Practice Series published by West Publishing Company in 1984, under the heading \u2018Revocation of Probation,\u2019 at page 154, is stated:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-10\">\u2018(a) Basis for Revocation.

Buder </em>[412 U.S. 430, 93 S.Ct. 2199, 37 L.Ed.2d 52 (1973) ], this is a requirement of due process.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoV\">\u201cThe book further states at page 156:\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-11\">\u2018Once it has been determined that an intentional or inexcusable violation of a probation condition has occurred prior to the conclusion of the probation period, there remains another important question to be resolved: \u201cWhat appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>action should be taken by the court in light of the violation.\u201d In particular, \u201cthe court must then consider whether reconfinement or some less drastic alternative is the best solution to both protect society and improve the defendant\u2019s chances of rehabilitation.\u201d * * * However, \u201crevocation should be used only as a last resort when treatment has failed.\u201d \u2019 (citations omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">\n<em>\u201cIt is Defendant\u2019s contention in this appeal that: First, the terms of the probation as ordered by the Court were not sufficiently explicit to give Defendant notice of what was required of him, and Second, even if he is guilty of violating the terms of probation, the sentence is too harsh under the circumstances.\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">\u201cThe Idaho Supreme Court has said that the primary consideration in determining whether probation should be granted is \u2018the good order and protection of society.

Nor was it because he disobeyed the verbal order of the probation officer (he had not yet been signed up by the probation and parole office.) <em>The sole basis for the revocation was that, in the mind of the District Judge, the Defendant had disobeyed a verbal order of the court not to contact his wife. </em>Nevertheless, it is clear from the record that not only the Defendant\u2019s wife and her divorce attorney were upset by, the \u2018break-in,\u2019 but so was the Judge. Defendant suspects [reasons] that the Judge\u2019s unusual upset over the innocent telephone call was actually based upon the \u2018break-in\u2019 issue. That, with the following enumerated items, tends to show the Judge\u2019s antipathy toward the Defendant and the basis for an abuse of discretion.

The Judge heard testimony that the Defendant had referred to him as \u201ca bigger fucking crook than I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">2. The judge had received hearsay evidence about other reported criminal activity of the Defendant, and talked as if all of it were true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">3.

The Judge had information from the jailers that the Defendant had threatened to sue the County and confronted Defendant about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-11\">5. The judge had commented previously about the \u201cBad Attitude\u201d of the Defendant, in a threatening way (until the Defendant agreed to pay restitution to ALL victims.):\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">\u2018What I\u2019m talking about is attitude as far as probation and rehabilitation.

The Court is somewhat chagrined where an individual who steals comes into court and complains that he\u2019s being asked to pay for things that may have been damaged and that the price wasn\u2019t right when they were resold. I haven\u2019t yet, Mr. Russell, decided to place you on probation. I think you have an attitude problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-18\">\u2018THE COURT: And I might add, Mr. Russell, since you\u2019ve had an apparent change of attitude or change of heart on paying these sums, I\u2019m going to reduce the other terms and conditions regarding monetary matters that I was kind of figuring on giving you before, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>so I want you to know by agreeing to do this, which I think you\u2019re doing the right thing, I\u2019m going to save you some money in other areas.

(After which the Judge changed Defendant\u2019s sentence to more years and from concurrent to consecutive.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u2018I\u2019ve told you earlier, you have the worst attitude of anybody I\u2019ve ever seen in a criminal case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u20186. The Judge received ex parte communication from the adverse divorce attorney about the \u2018break-in\u2019 incident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">7. Consequently, the Judge ordered an investigation based on the \u2018break-in\u2019 incident (instead of letting the civil court handle it). [Note that the investigation was ordered BEFORE any telephone call had been made.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">8. The Judge issued the bench warrant and instituted the probation violation proceedings himself. Probation and parole did not institute the action, and did not seek revocation, but rather that the Defendant be placed on the electronic monitoring device.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-10\">9. The Judge had granted Probation and Parole the right to incarcerate the Defendant up to 90 days in the county jail for minor violations. But the Judge did not allow this kind of action by Probation and Parole, preferring instead to take the matter from their hands and entirely revoke probation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\u201cThe District Court was unreasonable in revoking the probation of the Defendant under the circumstances, and possibly did so based not upon the so-called violation, but based upon the previous dealings, impressions, conclusions, and the attitude of the Judge toward the Defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">The relief sought by the Defendant is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-14\">1. Reversal of the Order to pay reimbursement to any person or entity but those directly affected by the crimes to which Defendant Pleaded guilty, and an Order requiring the Court or County to restore the appropriate funds to the Defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-15\">2. A re-sentencing in accordance with the appropriate laws, not to exceed that originally given to Defendant, to be served concurrently, and reversing the addition of $750 to the Idaho State Police and $1,200 to the county for costs of prosecution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-16\">3. Most importantly, reversal of the order revoking the Defendant\u2019s probation, and judgment Court to grant probation with conditions directing the as reasonably necessary to protect society and to allow rehabilitation of the Defendant, or for the Supreme Court to order modification of the sentence as appropriate under the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-17\">The State\u2019s responsive brief, filed in this Court, suggests that the court proceedings <em>were fraught with problems </em>relative to the State\u2019s confession of court error in sentencing Russell:</p>\n<p id=\"b550-18\">\n<em>F. The Unified Sentencing Act Should Have Been Applied to Count II and the Oral Sentence Varies From the Written Judgment; Thus, Russell Must Be Resentenced and/or the Clerical Error Corrected</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-19\">When Russell was first sentenced, the district court did so under the belief that the Unified Sentencing Act applied to both counts. The court imposed sentences with fixed and indeterminate por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>tions. Later, the court observed that the information alleged that the crimes occurred in 1986, before the effective date of the Unified Sentencing Act, and the court resentenced Russell under the pri- or law. For the first time on appeal, Russell points out that during the guilty plea, Count II of the information was deemed amended to allege a date of March 3, 1987. The Unified Sentencing Act thus applies to this count. Russell points out that his indeterminate three year sentence thus does not comply with the Act. Although this issue has not been raised in the trial court, the state agrees that Russell will have to be resentenced so that the sentence complies with the Unified Sentencing Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">It is possible that Russell would have to be resentenced on only Count II, but in imposing sentence in August, 1989, it is clear that the court structured the sentence based on the belief that the Unified Sentencing Act applied to neither count. Depending on how the court re-sentences Russell on Count II, it may desire to adjust Count I to maintain the desired structure of sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">The state further notes that in pronouncing sentence, the court stated that the sentence on each count would run consecutively. The written order, on the other hand, stated that the sentences run concurrently. This variance between the oral and the written sentences will also need to be corrected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-6\">The state will contact the prosecutor to determine whether these matters can be corrected during the pendency of this appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">In a larger sense, however, the better assessment would be that the entire proceeding from start to finish was <em>fraught with frustration, </em>suffered and endured primarily by the trial judge and the trial defendant. That is said upon an understanding readily gleaned from the briefs of respective counsel. The State is to be commended for conceding error in the one respect above mentioned, and likewise for its straight forward presentation. It carefully avoided bringing in any more controversy than there already was; yet, at the same time, it sought in moderation to uphold the rulings of the trial court. The State, of course, had no reason to be unduly excited, inasmuch as it had prevailed and was the respondent, generally a most favorable position. Understandably, the State, although it came to grips with the unalterable fact that the aforesaid error was permanently in the record, it advocated that remedial steps be taken in the district court, notwithstanding that the litigation wound its way to this Court for final determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">With the State at this late date conceding error, the cause, according to the majority opinion, nevertheless will not be remanded \u2014 which the State thinks to be the proper procedure, and the litigation thereby terminated. If that be proper procedure, which is much doubted, then I am reminded of a two-justice dissent which enhances that doubt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-10\">[T]he majority\u2019s decision today is only the conclusion of round one of appellant\u2019s case. Round two will be an action under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedures Act., I.C. \u00a7 19-4901 et seq. on the ground that appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were violated because of the due process argument and on the ground of competency of counsel for failure to assign as error the obvious defect in this ease. If round two proves unfruitful for the defendant, then round three will be a petition in the federal courts under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2254 to set aside the conviction. State courts often bemoan the intervention of the federal courts instate cases, but so long as highly prejudicial errors, such as the admission into evidence of the statement, allegedly made by appellant\u2019s husband, remain uncorrected in state courts it is probably a good thing that federal courts are available to correct such mistakes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-11\"><em>State v. Swenor, </em>96 Idaho 327, 334, 528 P.2d 671, 688 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-12\">EPILOGUE</p>\n<p id=\"b551-13\">It is possible to make a mountain out of a molehill. As a child, I thought otherwise, but today I have been to that mountain. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>is made of component parts, the first part of which appears near the close of the majority opinion where it acknowledges the defense contention \u201cthat there was inadequate proof that defendant requested his stepfather to phone his wife\u201d which contention was supposedly knocked asunder by relating the testimony of Dorothy Russell:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azd\">He [Russell\u2019s stepfather] called, he said, \u201cRichard would like to talk to you.\u201d And I indicated to him at that time, I said, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t he contact me or talk to me before they decided to break into my house yesterday?\u201d Tony said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that.\u201d I said, \u201cThen I suggest you ask him about that.\u201d He said, \u201cAll he wants to talk to you about is your taxes.\u201d And I said, \u201cI suggest he call and talk to the attorneys about it, then,\u201d and I hung up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">If it were possible, I would prevail upon former Justice Huntley to write a sequel to his \u201cThe Rape of the Sabine Woman,\u201d <em>Curl v. Curl, </em>115 Idaho 997, 1003-04, 772 P.2d 204, 210-11 (1989), if only I can suggest an eye-catching title and a delightful dialogue. One title comes readily to mind: \u201cMuch Ado About Nothing,\u201d and the script could be constructed around a knave so naive and oblivious that, although told by authority to not contact his wife obeyed that instruction, but asked an older gentleman, one who had always been on good terms with the wife, to make a telephone call to her, which would inquire of her as to the whereabouts of some insurance papers. The wife, despite the good relationship with the older gentleman, was brutally short with him, abruptly ended the telephone call with the click of the disconnect.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">What may appear as deplorable to other appellate practitioners is that not a scintilla of a scent surfaces in the majority opinion regarding the content of the excellent brief prepared by defense counsel. The majority\u2019s response thereto is to ignore it. Defense counsel is not the only attorney deserving of accolades; likewise, Mr. Hiedeman is commended for fearlessly agreeing with defense counsel relative to the latter\u2019s thorough portrayal of the events which occurred when client and counsel accepted the district court\u2019s grant of permission to go to \u201chis and Dorothy\u2019s residence\u201d in order to retrieve some personal items.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">In conclusion, it was unfortunate that matters developed as happened, much of which surely was attributable to no one in particular, and more likely to uncontrollable circumstances. None of us on the Court will ever know Mr. Russell, other than what can be pieced together by reading what surfaces in the appeal record. Clearly he had altered the numbers on two snowmobiles, and appears to have been suspected of aiding and abetting sales of such and similar items. Clearly, too, he was cooperative with the authorities, but that trait did not bode him well later on.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">Judge McDermott undoubtedly spent more time working on behalf of Russell than against him. It was only natural that he was frustrated in his efforts to successfully bring Russell to a turn-about. Likewise, Russell would likely be frustrated relative to all of the money which was extracted from him, after it seemed things were going better. That frustration felt by both persons, the judge and the accused, is self-evident. While I do not know Mr. Russell, I do know Judge McDermott. I feel that I know him as well as a brother knows a brother. I feel with him the frustration which he endured, because his nature is to help those who need help. I little doubt that when the cause returns to him, and upon his own reading of the record, he will recognize that his reaction to the frustration was unfortunate, and hopefully in future dealings with Mr. Russell a mutual complacency will be the order of the day. It is because of my belief in Judge McDermott\u2019s ability to administer justice that much has been written. Hopefully Mr. Russell can, upon reading my thoughts and whatever other encouragement is available to him, be persuaded to listen quietly and carefully when a caring judge attempts to administer guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">This Court\u2019s intervention by granting review has only resulted in delaying the remand to Judge McDermott, which the Court of Appeals ordered long, long ago. Granting review of the State\u2019s petition was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>an unfortunate mistake, but one that could have been redressed by simply conceding, as has been done before, that review was improvidently granted, which it most assuredly was.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b540-9\">. Mr. Wood, with the permission of the prosecutor and the district court, testified at Russell\u2019s probation violation hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">MR. WOOD: Your Honor, my contact with Richard Russell began, of course, Tuesday when \u2014 he had come back Monday on the bus from Boise and Tuesday when we had the hearing before you to see if he could be put on probation after a 180-day rider. On that day we did come before you, you placed Richard on probation, and you imposed certain terms and conditions upon Richard for his probation. And there was some limitations with him seeing his wife or contacting her, and you even mentioned going to her house. At that time we indicated that we would like to be able to go up there to get the vehicles and clothing and personal effects, and we asked if it would be all right if we did so, if Richard did so with another adult present or a police officer or somebody from Probation and Parole, and that was deemed to be acceptable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">At that time we did not tell the Court that there was a temporary restraining order or any other that prevented Richard from going to the house because, frankly, it didn\u2019t enter my mind at the time. I was aware, I guess, on the surface of my mind that there was a joint preliminary injunction that prevented him from harassing her in any way, but it did not enter my mind that there was another order that did, in fact, say that he should not go to the residence that was occupied by her. As a result, you ordered that Mr. Russell could go over to my office, from court directly to my office, and he was to go over to Probation and Parole immediately when I was done with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-19\">We went to my office, we did some discussions about the divorce trial that was set for the next day. While we were sitting there my secretary brought in an envelope and handed it to Richard and said, \u2018Tony said to give this to you.\u2019 I asked Richard, What\u2019s that?' Richard said, 'It\u2019s the keys to the house.\u2019 I thought he meant that it was the keys to his Mink Creek house, when, in fact, I later found out after all this took place it was the keys to Tony\u2019s house. Tony was going to work and wasn\u2019t going to be at the house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-20\">Richard didn't have any way to get to Probation and Parole and then home from there after they finished with him, so we called Randy Kline\u2019s office and he was out. They said he was at the courthouse, he would be back in a few minutes. I asked them to have him call me. We then did some more work on the divorce. We called Randy Kline's office again and he had not been back yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-21\">I then called Probation and Parole and talked to Mark Branson, discussed with him the possibility of us going up to the house and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>getting the car, and all during this time I thought there were keys to the house in Richard\u2019s custody, in his possession. We got the okay from Mark to go up, and so we left.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">I drove my car up and took him up there. We arrived at the residence, went up to the garage area, and there's a little box on the side of the garage with push buttons on it and number on it, and Richard tried a number of times to work those numbers. Evidently it was a combination type lock that would open the garage door if the right combination was used on it. While he was doing that and being unsuccessful, he said something to the effect that she must have changed the combination. He then reached just right next door, the little box was right here (indicating) and just to his left was the individual door to the garage, and he jiggled the door knob and leaned against it and hit it with his hip and it opened, and we saw that it had broken the doorjamb. And he said at that time, 'I didn\u2019t mean to do that.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">We went in, he pushed the garage door opener, and the big overhead doors came up. We were just looking at the broken doorjamb when Randy Kline showed up. Randy came out, and said something to the effect that there's a restraining order that prevents you from being up here. I told him what, well, I didn\u2019t read it that way, because, again, I was thinking of the preliminary injunction that only prevented the harassment of Mrs. Russell. He said, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you in court tomorrow for a contempt hearing,\u2019 and he got back in his car. I walked out to him and I said, \u2018Randy, I want to talk to you for a minute. AH we're up here to do is get the car, some clothing and things of that sort. We\u2019re not here to cause any trouble. We\u2019ve talked to the Judge and to Probation and Parole about being up here. If you want to come inside with us and go along with us and make sure we don't take anything, you\u2019re welcome to do that.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Randy got out of his car, went into the house with us. Richard had already gone into the house, he was upstairs in the kitchen. We went up into the kitchen and he was looking through the cupboards trying to find the key to the truck. He couldn\u2019t find it. He looked in various other places in the house that he thought they may be, making some comment about the fact that maybe his wife had hidden the keys.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">After unsuccessfully finding \u2014 not finding the keys, we asked Randy if he could call Dorothy and ask her where the keys were. He did call Dorothy and she told him where the keys were. And we went upstairs into the small bedroom and looked through many keys that she had taken from all around the house and placed on some cookie sheets in that room.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-9\">Richard picked up the keys to what he thought were the keys to the Thunderbird and the keys to the GMC truck and keys to the Island Park property, and we went downstairs and outside into the garage again where he attempted to open the Thunderbird, but it was evidently the wrong key. He was looking down at the oil under the Thunderbird. Evidently some transmission fluid had been leaking there. And Randy was making statements like, \u201cTo me this is breaking and entering. It\u2019s wrong, and you might have to answer criminally for this.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">Richard got up and called Randy a pimp. It was tense feelings between them for a minute. That was the worst he called him. I said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s go on.\u2019 We went back into the house and went back to where the keys were and tried to find the correct set to the Thunderbird and were unable to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-12\">Richard went into another bedroom, we followed him. He found his eyeglasses. He also took a card for his railroad annuity. And he picked up a small dictionary book that was about three inches by four inches.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">We then went back out and started up the GMC truck, went back into the house, got hammer and nails, came back out to the garage, repaired the doorjamb. Richard went back in, got a screw driver, came out and picked up the striker plate with the screws and he put the striker plate back into the doorjamb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\">I mentioned to Randy at the time, \u2018If you want to call your client to see if it\u2019s all right to take these other keys or this book and so forth, maybe you should.\u2019 He didn\u2019t want to, he didn\u2019t call her. So we locked the door, went outside, and Richard closed the garage door and it closed, and we drove off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\">That was the incident that took place up there. Randy was very angry. He attempted a second phone call right after he had called Dorothy to get her permission to get the keys, and I don\u2019t know when he tried to call, but evidently it rang and there was no answer and he hung up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-16\">I feel, Your Honor, some responsibility myself in the case. I think that if I had been more careful myself, I would have contacted Judge White before we went up to the house and either advised him or obtained his consent as long as Dorothy wasn\u2019t there to go get the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-17\">I also blame myself somewhat for not recalling the actual temporary restraining order and the specific terms of that, but it honestly never came to my mind that that was there or that was an impediment to doing something that we thought was an innocent action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-18\">I myself saw Richard write a note of apology to Dorothy and read it over his shoulder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-19\">We have felt all along that the attempts of plaintiffs counsel in the divorce case were to make Richard look as bad as possible, to do everything they could to cause problems for him. I do resent the fact that he ex parte called this Court and went into this item causing this problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Your Honor, it\u2019s my feeling that this more appropriately might have been handled through the Probation and Parole and their authority to impose up to 90 days jail time upon Mr. Russell for perhaps activities that they don\u2019t deem serious enough for actual probation violation hearings, because if there is a violation here at all today, it is an extremely technical violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">We\u2019re not here because Mr. Russell went up to his own house and went in there against the restraining order. That particular issue can be met and addressed by the divorce court. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in the orders that Mr. Russell was given either by this Court or by Probation and Parole that would have prevented that type of activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">I think what we\u2019re here on as the basis for the probation violations is the phone call that Mr. Martinez made to Mrs. Russell. Now, Mr. Russell did not contact her. Mr. Martinez did. That\u2019s perhaps being as technical one way as the State is being technical the other way. But, Your Honor, I feel it would be a travesty of justice in this man\u2019s life to revoke his probation for such an act and to send him back for five years imprisonment for having another person call somebody else and ask if she would like to speak to Richard. There is no harassment. There is a bona fide reason for it. It\u2019s true that it was thoughtless, but in his mind it was something that needed to be addressed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-10\">Your Honor, we would ask that the Court find him not in violation, that the Court grant to Probation and Parole the right, if they see necessary, to impose jail time upon him at their discretion, but that he not have his probation revoked.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">MR. HIEDEMAN: I think Mr. Wood is correct when he calls this a technical violation. I think maybe Mr. Russell wasn\u2019t aware of what the Court meant. Maybe he did forget the prior court order and maybe he didn\u2019t understand what Mark Branson meant when he told him no contact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-12\">The problem that the State has with the case is it\u2019s been fraught with problems. For almost two years now we\u2019ve been dealing with Mr. Russell, attempted probation at one time, wasn\u2019t successful, the Court ended up suspending the sentence \u2014 revoking the withheld judgment and suspending the sentence and sending him to Cottonwood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-16\">The problem that the State has, he gets back and the first day he's right back into problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-17\">I have talked with Probation and Parole about it. They\u2019re I think, also concerned, obviously, from Mr. Russell\u2019s past and the accusations he\u2019s made toward probation officers and conversations that he's had with Wally Peterson and Mr. Branson, I think they\u2019re concerned, also, whether or not he will be able to make probation. I will tell the Court that their recommendation is that he be placed on the electronic monitoring device. We do have one active in Bannock County now. It\u2019s a very recent development in the area of probation. Mr. Newman feels it's appropriate for Mr. Russell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-18\">MR. WOOD: Your Honor, I\u2019ll basically stand on what I argued previously to the Court. I would beg the Court not to revoke his probation. If, in fact, the Court sees fit to keep him here and allow him to continue on probation, then he should and will comply with any requirements of Probation and Parole, even it it\u2019s electronic monitoring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-19\">I think that there are many cases \u2014 well, many considerations that have gone into this case over and above his actual conviction. He was convicted of altering and obliterating serial numbers on two snowmachines. That\u2019s only part of what he\u2019s been punished for, of course, because he has admitted other wrongdoings and he has made reimbursement to the Court. He has spent over eight months in jail. He has come back now at this time, and I don\u2019t think that he intentionally was trying to violate any orders or that he was trying to disregard authority figures by having Tony Martinez call. If he was trying to intentionally violate those orders, he would have called Dorothy directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-20\">Tr. 293-306.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
