(R <em>&amp; </em>M) owns and operates petroleum-refining facilities in several states, including Oregon, Ohio. Sunoco purchases electric service for its Oregon facility from the Toledo Edison Company, intervening appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">{\u00b6 2} This case involves a contract between Sunoco and Toledo Edison for the sale of electricity. The contract is a \u201cspecial contract,\u201d approved by appellee Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (\u201cPUCO\u201d or \u201ccommission\u201d) pursuant to R.C. 4905.31, which permits \u201creasonable arrangement^]\u201d between public utilities and their customers. Generally, such contracts include arrangements that differ from the standard rate schedules and are often tailored to a specific customer\u2019s service.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">{\u00b6 3} The case also concerns a contract between BP Oil Company and Toledo Edison for the sale of electricity. BP owns and operates a competing refinery located adjacent to Sunoco\u2019s refinery. Both the Sunoco and BP contracts contain clauses generally called \u201cmost favored nation\u201d clauses. These clauses \u2014 titled \u201cComparable Facility Price Protection\u201d \u2014 allow Sunoco and BP to utilize any \u201carrangement, rates or charges\u201d for their facilities that Toledo Edison has given to the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">{\u00b6 4} The sole issue in this case is whether Sunoco could invoke the most-favored-nation clause to extend the duration of its contract with Toledo Edison to match the duration of BP\u2019s contract with Toledo Edison. If the clause can be used to extend the contract, then Sunoco would pay the same rate that BP paid for electric service from February 2008 until December 31, 2008. If the contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>is not extended, Sunoco would be obligated to pay Toledo Edison over $13 million in higher electric bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">{\u00b6 5} The commission found that the plain language of the most-favored-nation clause did not allow Sunoco to extend the duration of its contract to match the duration of BP\u2019s contract. We find that the commission committed several errors in construing the language of the most-favored-nation clause. As a result, we reverse the decision of the commission and render judgment in favor of Sunoco.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 6} Sunoco, Inc. (R &amp; M) filed a complaint in 2007 against Toledo Edison in the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. In proceedings before the commission, the parties filed joint stipulations of facts, which include the following information.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 7} In 1996, Toledo Edison entered into an electric-service contract with Sunoco. Also in 1996, Toledo Edison entered into a similar contract with BP, hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe BP Agreement\u201d or \u201cthe 1996 Agreement.\u201d The BP Agreement provided that it would remain in effect until June 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 8} On May 17, 1999, Sunoco and Toledo Edison entered into an electric-service agreement (the \u201cSunoco Agreement\u201d or \u201cthe 1999 Agreement\u201d), which replaced the 1996 Sunoco-Toledo Edison contract. The Sunoco Agreement is a special contract authorized by the PUCO pursuant to R.C. 4905.31. Under the terms of the special contract, Sunoco was entitled to pricing for electric service that was below standard tariff rates. The Sunoco Agreement provided that it would remain in effect through June 2006 \u2014 the same date as the BP Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 9} The Sunoco Agreement and the BP Agreement contained identical most-favored-nation clauses. Generally, Sunoco and BP could utilize the clause to obtain a benefit \u2014 in the form of an \u201carrangement, rates or charges\u201d \u2014 that Toledo Edison had given the other. In each of these agreements, the clause was titled \u201cComparable Facility Price Protection.\u201d No one disputes that Sunoco and BP are comparable facilities as that term is defined in the most-favored-nation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">{\u00b6 10} In late 1999, the General Assembly enacted legislation that restructured Ohio\u2019s electric-utility industry to allow retail customers to buy electricity from someone other than their local electric company. See Am.Sub.S.B. No. 3, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 7962. Codified as R.C. Chapter 4928, the legislation was commonly known as \u201cS.B. 3.\u201d What followed was a series of cases at the PUCO involving Toledo Edison and other electric utilities in which the PUCO attempted to ease the transition from a regulated rate structure to a market-rate structure. See the electric-transition-plan (\u201cETP\u201d) case, <em>In re Application of Ohio Edison Co. </em>(July 19, 2000), PUCO No. 09-1212-EL-ETP; and the rate-stabilization-plan (\u201cRSP\u201d) case, <em>In re Application of Ohio Edison Co. </em>(Oct. 28, 2003), PUCO No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>03-2144-EL-ATA, in which the PUCO allowed Toledo Edison and its large customers to extend the terms of their pre-S.B. 3 service contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">{\u00b6 11} The first extension was proposed through a joint stipulation filed by Toledo Edison and other parties to Toledo Edison\u2019s ETP case. The electric-transition-plan stipulation provided that each electric-service customer that had entered into a special contract with Toledo Edison would be given a one-time opportunity to continue, cancel, or extend the terms of its special contracts, provided that those customers gave Toledo Edison timely notice. As was required by the electric-transition-plan stipulation and the commission\u2019s order approving that stipulation, Toledo Edison gave notice to each special-contract customer of the option to extend the duration of its contract. Sunoco elected to extend the terms of its 1999 Agreement with Toledo Edison. Likewise, BP elected to extend the terms of its 1996 Agreement with Toledo Edison.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">{\u00b6 12} The next opportunity to extend occurred in Toledo Edison\u2019s RSP case. In that case, the commission again approved a joint stipulation filed by Toledo Edison and other parties allowing Toledo Edison\u2019s customers to extend the term of any special contract \u201cupon the request of the customer, or its agent, received within 30 days of the Commission\u2019s order in this case.\u201d However, unlike in the ETP case, the stipulation and the PUCO\u2019s order in the RSP case did not require Toledo Edison to notify its contract customers of the opportunity to extend, and Toledo Edison did not directly communicate with Sunoco, BP, or any other contract customer regarding this option. Nevertheless, within that 30-day window, BP requested that Toledo Edison extend the 1996 BP Agreement, which Toledo Edison agreed to do. Sunoco did not submit a request to Toledo Edison to extend the Sunoco Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 13} A final stipulated contract extension was approved in Toledo Edison\u2019s rate-eertainty-plan (\u201cRCP\u201d) case, <em>In re Application of Ohio Edison Co., </em>PUCO No. 05-1125-EL-ETA, a case that is still open. The stipulation in the RCP case provided that the special contracts that were extended under the RSP case \u2014 such as the BP Agreement \u2014 would continue in effect until December 31, 2008. The stipulation further provided that special contracts extended under the ETP case, but not extended under the RSP case \u2014 such as the Sunoco Agreement \u2014 would continue in effect only until February 2008. Thus, Sunoco\u2019s agreement was scheduled to expire ten months before BP\u2019s agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">{\u00b6 14} On or about May 16, 2007, Toledo Edison informed Sunoco that the Sunoco Agreement would terminate in February 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>{\u00b6 15} On November 13, 2007, Sunoco sent a letter to Toledo Edison stating that Sunoco \u201cis exercising its right under the [Sunoco] Agreement to utilize the BP Oil Company arrangement including, in particular, the term of that arrangement which has been extended until December 31, 2008\u201d and disputing Toledo Edison\u2019s right to terminate the Sunoco Agreement in February 2008. Sunoco invoked the most-favored-nation clause in its 1999 Agreement with Toledo Edison as evidence that the duration of Sunoco\u2019s agreement must match the duration of the BP Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 16} On November 16, 2007, Toledo Edison responded with a letter to Sunoco stating that it has \u201ca different interpretation of the impact of the provision of the contract,\u201d disputing that Sunoco had the right to extend the term of the Sunoco Agreement until December 31, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 17} On December 6, 2007, Sunoco filed a complaint with the commission against Toledo Edison under R.C. 4905.26. Sunoco challenged Toledo Edison\u2019s refusal to extend the duration of the Sunoco Agreement to December 31, 2008. The complaint alleged that if the agreement was terminated in February 2008, as Toledo Edison intended, Sunoco\u2019s electric bills would be \u201cmillions of dollars higher,\u201d and Sunoco would \u201coperate at a competitive disadvantage to the adjacent BP facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 18} On February 20, 2008, Sunoco agreed to pay into an escrow account the difference between what Sunoco and Toledo Edison alleged should be the cost of Sunoco\u2019s electric service between its February 2008 billing date and December 31, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 19} On February 19, 2009, the commission issued its order denying Sunoco\u2019s complaint. The commission found that the most-favored-nation clause was a price-protection provision that was limited in its application to rates and charges for electi-ical service. Accordingly, the commission held that Sunoco had not provided sufficient evidence to show that the most-favored-nation clause allowed Sunoco to extend the duration of its contract to December 31, 2008, to match the termination date of the BP agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">{\u00b6 20} Sunoco filed a timely application for rehearing. The commission denied Sunoco\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-10\">{\u00b6 21} Sunoco appealed to this court, raising four propositions of law. For the reasons discussed below, we sustain propositions of law Nos. 1, 3, and 4 and reverse the commission\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b542-12\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cR.C. 4903.13 provides that a PUCO order shall be reversed, vacated, or modified by this court only when, upon consideration of the record, the court finds the order to be unlawful or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>v.

We will not \u201c \u2018reverse or modify a PUCO decision as to questions of fact where the record contains sufficient probative evidence to show [that] the PUCO\u2019s determination is not manifestly against the weight of the evidence and is not so clearly unsupported by the record as to show misapprehension, mistake, or willful disregard of duty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Monongahela Poiver Co. v.

Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 466, 469, 678 N.E.2d 922, we have explained that we may rely on the expertise of a state agency in interpreting a law where \u201chighly specialized issues\u201d are involved and \u201cwhere agency expertise would, therefore, be of assistance in discerning the presumed intent of our General Assembly.\u201d <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 108, 110, 12 O.O.3d 115, 388 N.E.2d 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\n<em>A. Sunoco\u2019s Proposition of Law No. 1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 24} In its first proposition of law, Sunoco contends that the commission erred when it found that the plain language of the most-favored-nation clause in the Sunoco Agreement did not allow Sunoco to extend the duration of its contract to make it identical to the BP Agreement. We agree. The commission\u2019s interpretation of the most-favored-nation clause was unlawful and unreasonable for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">1. The PUCO erred in considering the title of the clause</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">{\u00b6 25} Sunoco first contends that the PUCO wrongfully relied on the heading of the clause in interpreting the scope and intent of the clause. In its order, the commission noted that the most-favored-nation clause is titled \u201cComparable Facility Price Protection.\u201d The commission then stated that \u201c[t]he first indication of the scope of the most favored nation clause is the title of the clause itself, which plainly indicates that the clause is intended to provide price protection between comparable facilities and is not intended to deal with the termination date of the contract.\u201d Sunoco maintains that the PUCO erred in this regard because the 1999 Sunoco Agreement prohibits using clause headings to interpret the scope and intent of any clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Sunoco is correct. Section 10.6 of the Sunoco Agreement, titled \u201cClause Heading,\u201d provides, \u201cThe clause headings appearing in this Agreement have been inserted for the purpose of convenience and ready reference. They do not purport to and shall not be deemed to define, limit or extend the scope or intent of the clauses to which they pertain.\u201d Thus, the commission erred in relying on the clause heading.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 27} The PUCO and Toledo Edison both counter that Sunoco did not preserve this issue for appeal by raising it in its application for rehearing at the commission or in its notice of appeal to this court. See R.C. 4903.10 and 4903.13. We find that this issue is properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 28} Sunoco\u2019s rehearing application and notice of appeal both contained the following identical language: \u201cThe Order is unjust and unlawful in that it finds that the \u2018Comparable Facility Price Protection\u2019 (hereinafter \u2018MFN clause\u2019) of the 1999 Agreement * * * only allowed Sunoco to invoke the provision to obtain a price for power from Toledo Edison identical to that in the Agreement between BP Oil Company * * * and Toledo Edison, and did not allow it to invoke the MFN clause to extend the duration of the contract to make it identical to the BP Agreement.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) The commission found that the title of the most-favored-nation clause \u201cplainly indicates that the clause is intended to provide price protection between comparable facilities and is not intended to deal with the termination date of the contract.\u201d Sunoco\u2019s rehearing application and notice of appeal specifically referred to the commission\u2019s finding that the title heading (\u201cComparable Facility Price Protection\u201d) was intended only to provide price protection between comparable facilities (\u201conly allowed Sunoco to invoke the provision to obtain a price for power from Toledo Edison identical to that in the Agreement between BP Oil Company and Toledo Edison\u201d). We conclude that this language was sufficient to preserve this issue for our review. See <em>Discount Cellular, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 360, 2007-Ohio-53, 859 N.E.2d 957, \u00b6 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">2. The PUCO misconstrued the plain language of the most-favored-nation clause</p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">{\u00b6 29} Section 9.2, the most-favored-nation clause in the 1999 Sunoco Agreement, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cIf the Company provides an arrangement, rates or charges which is or may be in effect at any time during the term of this Agreement, to a Comparable Facility within its certified territory, then the Customer will have the right to utilize that arrangement, rates or charges for its Facility. The Customer must comply with all other terms and conditions of the arrangement including firm and interruptible load characteristics/conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>{\u00b6 31} The commission found that the plain language of this clause did not allow Sunoco\u2019s termination date in its 1999 Agreement with Toledo Edison to match the termination date of BP\u2019s 1996 Agreement with Toledo Edison. Specifically, the commission rejected Sunoco\u2019s \u201cattempts to interpret the word \u2018arrangement,\u2019 as used in this provision, to infer a relationship with the duration of the contract.\u201d The commission reasoned that \u201cwithin the context of the comparable facility price provision, the duration or \u2018term\u2019 of the contract is referred to separately from the \u2018terms and conditions of the arrangement.\u2019 Clearly, the language \u2018during the term of this agreement,\u2019 which is contained in the most favored nation clause, makes that clause applicable to provisions of the contract other than the duration of the contract. Thus, we can not [sic] find that the most favored nation clause enables Sunoco to adopt the duration or \u2018term\u2019 of BP\u2019s contract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">{\u00b6 32} Sunoco contends that the commission\u2019s interpretation is not supported by a plain reading of the most-favored-nation clause. We agree with Sunoco and find that the commission\u2019s interpretation- \u2014 -specifically its reading of the first sentence of the most-favored-nation clause \u2014 is not a reasonable interpretation of the plain language of the clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">{\u00b6 33} In construing the plain language of the clause, the commission based its finding solely on the fact that the duration or <em>\u201cterm </em>of this Agreement\u201d \u2014 set forth in the first sentence of the most-favored-nation clause \u2014 is referred to separately from the \u201cterms and conditions of the arrangement\u201d in the second sentence of the clause. According to the commission, the phrase \u201cduring the term of this Agreement\u201d made the most-favored-nation clause applicable to all other provisions of the contract except the contract\u2019s duration. The commission\u2019s reasoning appears to be that because these phrases are separated in the most-favored-nation clause and used in different contexts, Sunoco and Toledo Edison intended the words \u201carrangement\u201d and \u201cterm\u201d (meaning duration) to have different meanings. Presumably based on this reasoning, the commission concluded that the duration of the contract was outside the scope of an \u201carrangement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 34} This was error. The first sentence of the most-favored-nation clause reads as follows: \u201cIf the Company provides an arrangement, rates or charges which is or may be in effect at any time during the term of this Agreement, to a Comparable Facility within its certified territory, then the Customer will have the right to utilize that arrangement, rates or charges for its Facility.\u201d This language is limiting, but not in the manner the commission found. The language of this provision, when construed in its proper context, merely means that Sunoco can invoke the most-favored-nation clause only \u201cduring the term of this Agreement.\u201d Stated another way, the first sentence limits Toledo Edison\u2019s obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>under the most-favored-nation clause to the \u201cterm of this Agreement,\u201d meaning that Sunoco has no right to invoke the clause after the agreement has expired. Because Sunoco invoked the clause before the contract expired, the \u201cduring the term of this Agreement\u201d provision is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">3. The meaning of the word \u201carrangement\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 35} By focusing its attention on the phrases \u201cduring the term of this Agreement\u201d and \u201cterms and conditions of the arrangement,\u201d the commission overlooked the dispositive question in this case: the meaning of the word \u201carrangement.\u201d Section 9.2 of the most-favored-nation clause provides that \u201cthe Customer (here Sunoco) will have the right to utilize [any] arrangement, rates or charges for its Facility\u201d that Toledo Edison provides to BP. Thus, the crux of the issue before us is whether the duration of the BP contract was an \u201carrangement\u201d provided by Toledo Edison that Sunoco could utilize for its facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">{\u00b6 36} Sunoco asserts that the word \u201carrangement\u201d in the most-favored-nation clause allows Sunoco to utilize all terms and conditions of the BP Agreement for its facility, including contract duration. Sunoco\u2019s primary argument is that the word \u201carrangement\u201d means the \u201centire contract\u201d or \u201centire agreement.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We need not decide whether the parties intended that the word \u201carrangement\u201d be interpreted to mean \u201centire contract or agreement.\u201d Rather, we need determine only whether \u201carrangement,\u201d as used in the most-favored-nation clause, encompasses the duration of a competitor\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">{\u00b6 37} When confronted with an issue of contract interpretation, our role is to give effect to the intent of the parties. We will examine the contract as a whole and presume that the intent of the parties is reflected in the language of the contract. In addition, we will look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the language used in the contract unless another meaning is clearly apparent from the contents of the agreement. When the language of a written contract is clear, a court may look no further than the writing itself to find the intent of the parties. \u201cAs a matter of law, a contract is unambiguous if it can be given a definite legal meaning.\u201d <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 38} The most-favored-nation clause states that if Toledo Edison \u201cprovides an <em>arrangement, </em>rates or charges which is or may be in effect at any time during the term of this Agreement, to a Comparable Facility within its certified territory, then the Customer will have the right to utilize that <em>arrangement, </em>rates or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>charges for its Facility.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The word \u201carrangement\u201d is not defined in the Sunoco Agreement. Common, undefined words appearing in a contract \u201cwill be given their ordinary meaning unless manifest absurdity results, or unless some other meaning is clearly evidenced from the face or overall contents\u201d of the agreement. <em>Alexander v. Buckeye Pipe Line Co. </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 241, 7 O.O.3d 403, 374 N.E.2d 146, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 39} We then must look to the ordinary meaning of the word \u201carrangement.\u201d While there are several dictionary definitions of \u201carrangement,\u201d even the narrower definitions fit within the context of the most-favored-nation clause, such as \u201cadjustment,\u201d \u201cmutual agreement,\u201d and \u201cunderstanding.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 120 (definitions 6(a) and (b)(1)). Each of these definitions would fit within the context of the clause and would not result in \u201cmanifest absurdity.\u201d By implication then, any adjustment, agreement, or understanding that Toledo Edison provides to a comparable facility within its certified territory is an arrangement that Sunoco has the right to utilize for its facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 40} Moreover, although the words \u201carrangement, rates or charges\u201d are used together in the same phrase, it is apparent from the face of the clause that \u201carrangement\u201d means something other than \u201crates or charges.\u201d Rates and charges are clearly price terms of the contract. Thus, it is reasonable to construe \u201carrangement\u201d to encompass other, nonprice terms of the contract. In sum, when the word \u201carrangement\u201d is interpreted according to its common usage and in context, the most-favored-nation clause allows Sunoco to utilize all nonprice terms of a competitor\u2019s contract. Because contract duration is a nonprice term, an \u201carrangement\u201d would include the duration of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 41} This interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the most-favored-nation clause. The parties agree that the purpose of the most-favored-nation clause is to \u201clevel the playing field\u201d between two competitors served by the same electric utility so that neither Sunoco nor BP has a competitive advantage over the other. Sunoco and BP would not be on equal footing if BP could obtain discount pricing for the entire duration of its contract, but Sunoco \u2014 because it was denied its right to match BP\u2019s contract duration \u2014 could not obtain the same discount for the same length of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">4. Counterarguments to Sunoco\u2019s Proposition of Law of No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"AEub\">{\u00b6 42} Both Toledo Edison and the PUCO raise several counterarguments. None have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">\n<em>a. Toledo Edison\u2019s Counterarguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">i. Interpreting \u201carrangement\u201d to include duration does not violate the doctrine of noscitur a sociis</p>\n<p id=\"AI5\">{\u00b6 43} Toledo Edison argues that Sunoco\u2019s interpretation of the word \u201carrangement\u201d in the most-favored-nation clause violates the maxim noscitur a sociis, \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>known from its associates.\u201d <em>Ashland Chem. Co. v. Jones </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 234, 236, 749 N.E.2d 744. Under the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, the meaning of an unclear word may be derived from the meaning of accompanying words. Id. at 236-237.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">{\u00b6 44} Toledo Edison concedes that \u201carrangement\u201d refers to'nonprice terms of the contract, but it maintains that such nonprice terms include only <em>\u201csimilar </em>non-price terms, such as the choice between interruptible and firm power that was so important to Sunoco.\u201d Yet Toledo Edison offers no compelling argument why \u201carrangement\u201d must be construed so narrowly. Had Toledo Edison wanted the most-favored-nation clause to apply only to specific terms of the contract such as the type of power supplied, using a broad term like \u201carrangement\u201d is an odd way to limit the reach of that clause. The word \u201carrangement,\u201d because of its breadth, would seemingly cover most, if not all, nonprice terms and provisions of a competitor\u2019s contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">ii. <em>Eveleth </em>is not persuasive</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 45} Toledo Edison asserts that several courts in other jurisdictions have reviewed similar most-favored-nation clauses in electric-utility-supply contracts and rejected the very arguments that Sunoco makes here. Toledo Edison states that the commission had the benefit of several of these court decisions, but Toledo Edison cites only one: <em>Eveleth Taconite Co. v. Minnesota Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1974), 301 Minn. 20, 221 N.W.2d 157.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Eveleth, </em>however, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 46} First, <em>Eveleth </em>is distinguishable because the most-favored-nation clause in that case does not contain the language of the clause in this case. Specifically, the clause in <em>Eveleth </em>does not contain the word \u201carrangement.\u201d Thus, Eveleth\u2019s interpretation of a similar most-favored-nation clause has no bearing on determining the meaning of the clause at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 47} Second, Toledo Edison\u2019s reliance on <em>Eveleth </em>is misplaced because the court went beyond the four corners of the contract and relied on extrinsic evidence of precontract negotiations between the customer and the utility to determine the intent of the parties. See <em>Eveleth, </em>301 Minn, at 27. In contrast, extrinsic evidence cannot be considered in this case because the outcome turns solely on the plain language of the most-favored-nation clause. See <em>Shifrin v. Forest City Ents., Inc. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 635, 597 N.E.2d 499, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"ANz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>iii. <em>Baker Car &amp; Truck Rental </em>and <em>Waterloo Furniture </em>are distinguishable</p>\n<p id=\"Ak3\">{\u00b6 48} Toledo Edison also contends that courts in other jurisdictions \u201cconsistently have found that contracts with most favored nation clauses end on the termination date specified in the contract unless the contract itself contains specific language authorizing an extension of the contract\u2019s term.\u201d Toledo Edison refers the court to <em>Baker Car &amp; Truck Rental, Inc. v. Little Rock </em>(1996), 325 Ark. 357, 925 S.W.2d 780, and <em>Waterloo Furniture Components, Ltd. v. Haworth, Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 2006), 467 F.3d 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">{\u00b6 49} Both <em>Baker Car </em>and <em>Waterloo Furniture </em>turned on the fact that neither plaintiff had attempted to invoke the most-favored-nation clauses of its contract until <em>after </em>the contract had already expired. See <em>Baker Car, </em>325 Ark. at 359, 363; <em>Waterloo Furniture, </em>467 F.3d at 645-646. In contrast to this case, there is no dispute that Sunoco invoked the most-favored-nation clause <em>before </em>its 1999 contract with Toledo Edison had expired. As a result, we reject Toledo Edison\u2019s invitation to rely on these cases as persuasive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">\n<em>b. The Commission\u2019s Counterarguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">i. The PUCO\u2019s fear of perpetual contracts is unwarranted</p>\n<p id=\"APK\">{\u00b6 50} The PUCO first counters that if Sunoco\u2019s interpretation of the most-favored-nation clause prevails, the consequences would be \u201cunintended and irrational.\u201d Specifically, the PUCO claims that Sunoco would be able to extend its contract with Toledo Edison indefinitely should Toledo Edison continue to enter into special contracts with other oil refineries\u2019 operating facilities comparable to Sunoco\u2019s facility. The PUCO\u2019s argument is speculative and without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">{\u00b6 51} There is no evidence in the record of any other special contracts involving Toledo Edison and BP, or any other oil refinery for that matter. Indeed, the record is silent as to whether refineries beyond those operated by Sunoco and BP even exist in Toledo Edison\u2019s service territory. This case concerns only the 1999 Sunoco Agreement and Sunoco\u2019s request to extend that agreement to match the expiration date of the 1996 BP Agreement. Based on the stipulated facts of this case, BP\u2019s contract expired on December 31, 2008. Thus, the Sunoco Agreement will be extended to December 31, 2008, and no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">ii. Requirements set forth in the RSP case are not \u201cterms and conditions of the arrangement\u201d under the most-favored-nation clause</p>\n<p id=\"Ant\">{\u00b6 52} The most-favored-nation clause provides that for a customer to utilize an \u201carrangement,\u201d that customer \u201cmust comply with all other terms and conditions of the arrangement including firm and interruptible load characteristics/conditions.\u201d The PUCO states that assuming that an \u201carrangement\u201d encompasses a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>contract extension, the arrangement allowing BP to extend its contract to December 31, 2008, was made pursuant to the RSP case. The PUCO notes that the stipulation in that case offered all of Toledo Edison\u2019s special-contract customers \u2014 including BP and Sunoco \u2014 a one-time opportunity to extend their agreements, provided that they notify Toledo Edison of their decision to extend their contracts within 30 days of the commission\u2019s order approving the stipulation. The PUCO maintains that Sunoco was offered the same arrangement as BP; BP complied with the notification requirement, but Sunoco did not. According to the PUCO, Sunoco cannot utilize the arrangement offered to BP because Sunoco failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 53} What the PUCO overlooks here is that if Sunoco had accepted Toledo Edison\u2019s offer in the RSP case, there would be no need to resort to the most-favored-nation clause as a means of extending its contract with Toledo Edison. Acceptance of the offer, by itself, would have extended the Sunoco Agreement through December 2008. The whole aim of the most-favored-nation clause is to allow its beneficiary to avail itself of a contractual arrangement based merely on the fact that another Toledo Edison customer enjoys that arrangement. That aim is defeated if <em>\u201cterms and conditions </em>of the arrangement\u201d includes a prerequisite that precludes Sunoco from invoking the clause in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">{\u00b6 54} In interpreting a contract, we are required, if possible, to give effect to every provision of the contract. \u201c \u2018[I]f one construction of a doubtful condition written in a contract\u2019 \u201d would render a clause meaningless and it is possible that another construction would give that same clause meaning and purpose, then the latter construction must prevail. <em>Foster Wheeler Enviresponse, Inc. v. Franklin Cty. Convention Facilities Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 353, 362, 678 N.E.2d 519, quoting <em>Farmers Natl. Bank v. Delaware Ins. Co. </em>(1911), 83 Ohio St. 309, 94 N.E. 834, paragraph six of the syllabus. We find that the notice requirement of the RSP stipulation is not a term or condition of an \u201carrangement.\u201d Simply stated, the PUCO\u2019s construction here would render the phrase \u201call other terms and conditions of the arrangement\u201d a nullity and defeat the purpose of the most-favored-nation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">5. Conclusion to Proposition of Law No. 1</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">{\u00b6 55} Sunoco\u2019s first proposition of law is well taken. The most-favored-nation clause is not strictly a price-protection provision. Instead, the clause allows Sunoco to utilize any more favorable \u201carrangement, rates or charges\u201d that Toledo Edison offers to a competitor of Sunoco. Under the plain language of the clause, the word \u201carrangement\u201d encompasses all nonprice terms of a competitor\u2019s contract. Duration is a nonprice term of a contract and, consequently, is subject to the clause. Moreover, this interpretation is consistent with the agreed purpose of the clause, which is to ensure that neither Sunoco nor BP obtains a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>competitive advantage over the other. Toledo Edison\u2019s refusal to allow Sunoco to invoke the clause to extend its contract to match BP\u2019s contract placed Sunoco at a competitive disadvantage. Therefore, we hold that the most-favored-nation clause allows Sunoco to extend the termination date of its 1999 Agreement to match the termination date of the 1996 BP Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">\n<em>B. Sunoco\u2019s Propositions of Law Nos. 3 and 4</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A2n\">{\u00b6 56} In proposition of law No. 3, Sunoco faults the commission for relying on \u201cequitable considerations\u201d and other factors that were outside the plain language of the contract in ruling against Sunoco in this case. In proposition of law No. 4, Sunoco asserts that the commission erred when it found that Sunoco was attempting to \u201ccollaterally attack\u201d the commission\u2019s decisions in the RSP and RCP cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 57} Sunoco\u2019s third and fourth propositions of law are well taken for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">1. The commission\u2019s reliance on extrinsic evidence was unlawful</p>\n<p id=\"ASW\">{\u00b6 58} First, Sunoco claims that the commission\u2019s order is unlawful because it found that Sunoco, as \u201ca sophisticated energy consumer,\u201d should have extended its contract in the RSP case, just as BP did. Because the commission found that the plain language of the most-favored-nation clause was dispositive in resolving the issues before it, we find that it was unlawful for the commission to rely on matters outside the written agreement of the parties. See <em>Shifrin v. Forest City Ents., Inc., </em>64 Ohio St.3d 635, 597 N.E.2d 499, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 59} Second, even if extrinsic evidence could be considered in this case, relying on this specific evidence was unreasonable and unlawful. Any discussion about what Sunoco did or did not do in the S.B. 3 cases is irrelevant to determining the intent of Sunoco and Toledo Edison in this case, because the Sunoco Agreement was executed on May 17, 1999, <em>before </em>S.B. 3 was enacted. When circumstances surrounding the agreement invest the language of the contract with a special meaning, extrinsic evidence can be considered in an effort to give effect to the parties\u2019 intention. <em>Shifrin, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 635, 597 N.E.2d 499, syllabus. But here, the commission relied on circumstances occurring after the parties had formed their contract in 1999. This was error. The commission should not have relied on the S.B. 3 cases as a basis for denying Sunoco\u2019s complaint when there was no evidence in the record that the parties had contemplated the effects of electric deregulation when the contract was formed.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">2. Sunoco did not collaterally attack the PUCO\u2019s prior orders</p>\n<p id=\"ACD\">{\u00b6 60} The commission also found that Sunoco\u2019s complaint was a \u201ccollateral ] attack [on the commission\u2019s] decisions\u201d in the RSP and RCP cases, and that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>allow this attack to occur \u201cat this late date\u201d could provide \u201cSunoco with an unfair advantage over BP which apparently followed the cases and took the risk to extend its contract at a time when today\u2019s market rates were not known to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 61} The commission\u2019s references to \u201ccollateral ] attacks\u201d and \u201cthis late date\u201d misrepresent the record in this case. The Sunoco Agreement was set to expire in February 2008. On November 13, 2007, Sunoco attempted to invoke the most-favored-nation clause to extend its contract. When Toledo Edison rejected Sunoco\u2019s attempts to invoke the clause, Sunoco filed a complaint with the commission on December 5, 2007, to enforce its _ rights under the contract. Sunoco\u2019s complaint before the commission was grounded solely on its rights under the most-favored-nation clause of its contract with Toledo Edison. Sunoco referred to the RSP and RCP cases in its complaint only as the means by which BP was able to have its agreement with Toledo Edison extended. Rather than attacking these cases, Sunoco relied on these cases to show how BP was able to extend the duration of its contract. In sum, no evidence exists in the record to support the finding that Sunoco sat on its rights in order to obtain an unfair advantage over BP. See <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 306, 312, 513 N.E.2d 337 (PUCO order may be reversed when the commission made \u201csummary rulings and conclusions without developing the supporting rationale or record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 62} Moreover, even if Sunoco did gain an \u201cunfair advantage over BP\u201d based on when it invoked the most-favored-nation clause, the commission erred in rejecting Sunoco\u2019s complaint on that basis. See <em>Aultman Hosp. Assn. v. Community Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 51, 54-55, 544 N.E.2d 920 (when the terms of a contract are plain and unambiguous, a contract cannot be given a meaning different from the one reflected by its plain language in order to provide a more equitable result). Because the commission had previously found that the contract was plain and unambiguous, the commission was bound to give effect to the contract\u2019s express terms and was prohibited from rewriting the contract to remedy any unfairness to BP.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 63} Toledo Edison counters that the commission had the authority under R.C. 4905.31 to determine that Sunoco was making an untimely \u201ccollateral attack\u201d on the decisions in the RSP and RCP cases that, if allowed, would disadvantage BP in the current competitive electric market.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 64} There is no dispute that the commission has authority under R.C. 4905.31 to regulate, supervise, and modify special contracts. But how far the commission\u2019s authority under this statute extends need not be decided here, because nowhere in the commission\u2019s orders in this case did the commission claim to be using its authority under R.C. 4905.31. R.C. 4903.09 requires the PUCO in all cases to file \u201cfindings of fact and written opinions setting forth the reasons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>prompting the decisions arrived at, based upon said findings of fact.\u201d We cannot find that the commission properly exercised its authority under R.C. 4905.31 when the commission never relied upon that statute in making its decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">\n<em>C. Sunoco\u2019s Proposition of Law No. 2</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 65} In its second proposition of law, Sunoco maintains that the commission erred when it refused to consider the history of the contractual relationship between Sunoco and Toledo Edison in interpreting the Sunoco Agreement. Sunoco also claims that the commission erred when it failed to consider certain internal memoranda of David Blank, the manager of the Rate Department for Toledo Edison\u2019s parent corporation, FirstEnergy.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 66} The commission did not err in declining to consider this evidence. As discussed in the preceding sections, extrinsic evidence cannot be considered to give effect to the contracting parties\u2019 intentions when the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous. <em>Shifrin, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 635, 597 N.E.2d 499, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 67} We find Sunoco\u2019s first, third, and fourth propositions of law are well taken. Therefore, we reverse the order of the commission on those issues and enter judgment in favor of Sunoco. Sunoco\u2019s second proposition of law is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">Order reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b553-11\">O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\">.

In its reply brief, Sunoco argues for the first time that the word \u201carrangement,\u201d as set forth in G.C. 614-17, the predecessor to R.C. 4905.31, means \u201ccontract.\u201d See <em>Lake Erie Power &amp; Light Co. v. Telling-Belle Vernon Co. </em>(1937), 57 Ohio App. 467, 11 O.O. 234, 14 N.E.2d 947, paragraph one of the syllabus. Sunoco is forbidden to raise new arguments in its reply brief. <em>State ex rel.

(R &amp; M), took advantage of a contract extension with Toledo Edison Company. Although Sunoco had the same opportunity to do so, it did not seek an extension. Nevertheless, the majority holds that the most-favored-nation clause within Sunoco\u2019s contract guarantees Sunoco the benefit of BP\u2019s extended term. In part, the majority justifies its holding as enforcing the intent of the parties. Although Sunoco asserts that this result was intended, Toledo Edison vigorously disputes it and contends that Sunoco is not entitled to extend the duration of its contract to match BP\u2019s because the contract duration is not included within the meaning of \u201carrangement.\u201d I agree and therefore dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>{\u00b6 69} The contract between Sunoco and Toledo Edison is an electric-service agreement (\u201cESA\u201d) approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (\u201cPUCO\u201d or \u201ccommission\u201d) under R.C. 4905.31. This statute authorizes the PUCO to supervise a special discounted arrangement between an electric utility and one of its customers. \u201cEvery such <em>schedule or reasonable arrangement </em>shall be under the supervision and regulation of the commission, and is subject to change, alteration, or modification by the commission.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 4905.31(E). As part of its regulatory authority, the commission approved a stipulation that special contracts extended under the electric-transition-plan case <em>{In re Application of Ohio Edison Co. </em>(July 19, 2000), PUCO No. 09-1212-EL-ETP) but not extended under the rate-stabilization-plan case <em>(In re Application of Ohio Edison Co. </em>(Oct. 28, 2003), PUCO No. 03-2144-EL-ATA) would continue only until February 2008. <em>In re Application of Ohio Edison Co., </em>PUCO No. 05-1125-EL-ETA. The commission held that the most-favored-nation clause did not entitle Sunoco to the ten-month extension that BP had negotiated with Toledo Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b6 70} Sunoco bears a heavy burden in challenging PUCO orders by showing \u201cthat the commission\u2019s decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence or is clearly unsupported by the record.\u201d <em>Monongahela Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 571, 2004-Ohio-6896, 820 N.E.2d 921, \u00b6 29, citing <em>AT &amp; T Communications of Ohio, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 549, 555, 728 N.E.2d 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 71} The majority opinion contends that in determining the end date of Sunoco\u2019s ESA, the PUCO (1) improperly relied on the title of the most-favored-nation clause, (2) misread the first sentence of the disputed clause, and (3) erred in finding that the word \u201carrangement\u201d does not include the duration of the contract. Although the commission\u2019s position differs from the majority\u2019s view, the PUCO orders are neither unsupported by evidence in the record nor against the manifest weight of the evidence. I would uphold them against the three points discussed by the majority as well because of court holdings in other jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Reference to Heading of Contract Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 72} I would hold that Sunoco waived the argument that the commission improperly relied on the title of the disputed clause by failing to include this point in its application for rehearing and in its notice of appeal. Nevertheless, even if Sunoco is held not to have waived the point, the commission\u2019s reference is supportable. Section 10.6 of Sunoco\u2019s ESA explains that clause headings are \u201cfor the purpose of convenience and ready reference\u201d and \u201cshall not be deemed to define, limit or extend the scope or intent of the clauses to which they pertain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>{\u00b6 73} The commission in its order does refer at several places to the ESA section titled \u201cComparable Facility Price Protection,\u201d and the majority makes much of the commission\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cprice protection provision.\u201d But both parties also use the words \u201cmost-favored-nation clause\u201d in referring to and in discussing the meaning of Section 9, although neither phrase is found within the disputed section, which reads in full:</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">{\u00b6 74} \u201c9.1 A Comparable Facility shall be defined as an operating oil refinery and located within the certified service territory of the Toledo Edison Company, as such service territory is defined on January 1, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">{\u00b6 75} \u201c9.2 If the Company provides an arrangement, rates or charges which is or may be in effect at any time during the term of this Agreement, to a Comparable Facility within its certified territory, then the Customer will have the right to utilize that arrangement, rates or charges for its Facility. The Customer must comply with all other terms and conditions of the arrangement including firm and interruptible load characteristics/conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">{\u00b6 76} The commission determined that this section did not specifically discuss the duration of the contract. Nothing mentions- the length of time that the contract is in effect. Section 9 of Sunoco\u2019s ESA does refer to \u201can arrangement, rates or charges,\u201d which, if offered to a comparable facility, will be available to the customer. Section 9.1 defines a comparable facility, and Section 9.2 offers a \u201cright to utilize\u201d a similar arrangement, i.e., provides price protection between comparable facilities during the term of the ESA. As the commission correctly noted, neither paragraph of Section 9 deals with the termination date of the ESA. The title \u201cComparable Facility Price Protection\u201d for this clause simply describes the language of this \u201cmost-favored-nation clause,\u201d and the title does not limit or extend its scope or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Reading of First Sentence of Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b555-9\">{\u00b6 77} The second alleged error relates to the commission\u2019s reading of the first sentence of Section 9.2. \u201cIf the Company provides an arrangement, rates or charges which is or may be in effect at any time during the term of this Agreement, to a Comparable Facility within its certified territory, then the Customer will have the right to utilize that arrangement, rates or charges for its Facility.\u201d Instead of seeing this sentence as guaranteeing a customer an opportunity to obtain treatment similar to that of a comparable facility during the ESA\u2019s term, the majority states that it \u201cmerely means that Sunoco can invoke the most-favored-nation clause only \u2018during the term of this Agreement.\u2019 Stated another way, the first sentence limits Toledo Edison\u2019s obligations under the most-favored-nation clause to the \u2018term of this Agreement,\u2019 meaning that Sunoco has no right to invoke the clause after the agreement has expired.\u201d This seems to me to rewrite the language.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>{\u00b6 78} More importantly, the commission has been reasonable in observing that the duration or \u201cterm\u201d of the contract is referred to separately in Sunoco\u2019s ESA from the \u201cterms and conditions of the arrangement.\u201d The distinction is also seen in the second sentence of Section 9.2, which gives the customer a reciprocal obligation: \u201cThe Customer must comply with <em>all other terms and conditions of the arrangement </em>including firm and interruptible load charaeteristics/conditions.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">{\u00b6 79} Thus, if the company provides an \u201carrangement, rates or charges\u201d while the agreement is in effect, i.e., at any time during the term, to a comparable facility (a competitor of the customer), the customer will then have the right to utilize that arrangement, rates or charges for its own facility. There is no need to reword the clause \u2014 -an arrangement that benefits the competitor within the meaning of this section gives the customer the opportunity to make the same arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The Meaning of \u201cArrangement\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">{\u00b6 80} The majority interprets the term \u201carrangement\u201d through a complicated method while ignoring a fundamental point. Although the word \u201carrangement\u201d is undefined within the contract, the term has a specific meaning set forth in R.C. 4905.31. R.C. 4905.31, which governs an ESA, states that a public utility is not prohibited from \u201cfiling a <em>schedule </em>or establishing or entering into <em>any reasonable arrangement with </em>another public utility or with one or more of <em>its customers, </em>consumers, or employees * * * <em>providing for any of the following :</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">{\u00b6 81} \u201c(A) The division or distribution of its surplus profits;</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">{\u00b6 82} \u201c(B) A sliding scale of charges, including variations in rates based upon stipulated variations in cost as provided in the schedule or arrangement^]</p>\n<p id=\"b556-10\">{\u00b6 83} \u201c(C) A minimum charge for service to be rendered unless such minimum charge is made or prohibited by the terms of the franchise, grant, or ordinance under which such public utility is operated;</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">{\u00b6 84} \u201c(D) A classification of service based upon the quantity used, the time when used, the purpose for which used, the duration of use, and any other reasonable consideration;</p>\n<p id=\"b556-12\">{\u00b6 85} \u201c(E) Any other financial device that may be practicable or advantageous to the parties interested.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">{\u00b6 86} Significantly the term \u201carrangement\u201d does <em>not </em>include duration of the contract or the contract term. The statute establishes the obligation of the utility to file the \u201cschedule or arrangement\u201d with the PUCO, and the section concludes, \u201cEvery such <em>schedule or reasonable arrangement </em>shall be under the supervision and regulation of the commission, and is subject to change, alteration, or modification by the commission.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The ESA thus relates to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>special pricing, and \u201carrangement\u201d refers to the types of \u201cfinancial devices\u201d that are listed in R.C. 4905.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Other Jurisdictions</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">{\u00b6 87} Courts \u201cconsistently have found that contracts with most favored nation clauses end on the termination date specified in the contract unless the contract itself contains specific language authorizing an extension of the contract\u2019s term.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 48. See <em>Baker Car &amp; Truck Rental, Inc. v. Little Rock </em>(1996), 325 Ark. 357, 362, 925 S.W.2d 780. See also <em>Waterloo Furniture Components, Ltd. v. Haworth, Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 2006), 467 F.3d 641, 646 (a most-favored-nation clause \u201conly provides insight into the parties [sic] obligations during the term of the contract. It does not extend the Agreement past its express termination date\u201d). The fact that the contracts in these cases were attempted to be extended after their expiration, while Sunoco tried to extend the express termination date before the ESA expired, is not significant \u2014 the point is that the most-favored-nation clause does not function to extend the ESA\u2019s duration unless authority to do so exists within the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">{\u00b6 88} As an example of the type of extension authority expressed within a contract, the most-favored-nation clause at issue in <em>Saikhon, Inc. v. United Farm Workers of Am., AFL-CIO </em>(1980), 104 Cal.App.3d 1, 163 Cal.Rptr. 488, 489, specifically authorized a contracting party to extend its contract to a \u201ctermination date\u201d negotiated by the union with another produce company \u201cduring the term\u201d of the agreement. This type of language is noticeably absent from Sunoco\u2019s ESA.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">{\u00b6 89} The Minnesota Supreme Court held that a purchaser of electricity could not, under the most-favored-nation clause, extend the duration of its contract based upon the electric utility\u2019s contract with another customer. <em>Eveleth Taconite Co. v. Minnesota Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1974), 301 Minn. 20, 221 N.W.2d 157. The court stated that the phrase \u201cterms or conditions,\u201d as used in the most-favored-nation clause, \u201cwas intended by the parties to mean the covenants and provisions\u201d of the agreement \u201cother than its duration and that the word \u2018term\u2019 * * * has a distinct meaning signifying the period of duration of the contract during which more favorable terms and conditions could, upon the election of plaintiff, be substituted into the agreement.\u201d Id. at syllabus. <em>Eveleth </em>relied upon a Colorado decision that also distinguished a contract\u2019s \u201cterm\u201d or duration from the contract\u2019s \u201cterms,\u201d which are the \u201c \u2018conditions, limitations and propositions which comprise and govern the acts which the contracting parties agree expressly or impliedly to do or not to do.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 161, quoting <em>Hurd v. Whitsett </em>(1878), 4 Colo. 77, 84. As <em>Eveleth </em>explained, the use of two separate phrases in the most-favored-nation clause, that is, \u201cterm\u201d and \u201cterms or conditions\u201d in different parts of the clause and in different contexts, was further evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>the parties had intended those words to have different meanings. Id. Although the majority attempts to distinguish <em>Eveleth </em>on the ground that it uses the phrase \u201carrangement, rates and changes\u201d in place of \u201cterms or conditions,\u201d this is a distinction without a difference. There is no authority within the ESA for Sunoco to extend its own contract term simply because BP took advantage of an opportunity to lengthen its ESA with Toledo Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">{\u00b6 90} I cannot agree with the majority opinion that a most-favored-nation clause is a tool for extending a contract term beyond its termination date. Nothing in Sunoco\u2019s ESA gives it that authority. Section 8 language relates to the \u201cterm and effective date\u201d of the contract, while Section 9 includes the \u201carrangements, rates and charges\u201d that are to be offered to a competitor during a contract term. Had Sunoco wished to obtain a longer ESA, it could have negotiated such an agreement by including specific language authorizing a longer or extended term, or it could have opted to extend its contract duration in the summer of 2004 as authorized by the commission\u2019s RSP order. Because it did neither, the commission did not err in denying Sunoco the relief it requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">{\u00b6 91} I respectfully dissent and would hold that the PUCO acted reasonably in determining that Sunoco\u2019s contract ended in February, rather than December, 2008. I would affirm the PUCO orders in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b558-8\">Cupp, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AVG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">{\u00b6 92} I remain unconvinced that the term \u201carrangement,\u201d as used in the Sunoco, Inc. (R <em>&amp; </em>M) \u2014 Toledo Edison Company electric-service agreement, includes within its meaning the duration of the contract such that Sunoco may utilize the longer duration of the BP Oil Company \u2014 Toledo Edison contract to extend the duration of its own special contract over the objection of Toledo Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">{\u00b6 93} The language employed in the Sunoco-Toledo Edison special contract uses the terminology \u201carrangement, rates or charges\u201d to describe what provisions in Toledo Edison special contracts with other customers Sunoco may take advantage of.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">{\u00b6 94} R.C. 4905.31, which permits such special contracts between public utilities and their customers upon approval of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (\u201cPUCO\u201d), includes an illustrative list of such \u201carrangement^].\u201d None of them involve the duration of a special contract. Rather, it is clear that they involve conditions of service, as well as rates and charges. Because the Sunoco<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Toledo Edison contract already separately uses the terminology \u201crates and charges,\u201d it is reasonable to conclude that the plain meaning of the word \u201carrangement,\u201d as used in the special Sunoco-Toledo Edison contract, necessarily means something akin to conditions of service and similar matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">{\u00b6 95} Moreover, the PUCO, which must approve these special contracts, has also construed the term \u201carrangement\u201d to mean something other than duration of the contract. Because of the oversight that the statute grants the PUCO over these contracts, and because the PUCO must approve the special contracts before they can become effective, it is evident that the PUCO has special expertise in this matter. I would defer to the PUCO\u2019s determination, in which it has used its special expertise, that the term \u201carrangement\u201d does not include the duration of the special contract such that Sunoco may extend the length of its own contract with Toledo Edison based upon the length of BP\u2019s special contract with Toledo Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">{\u00b6 96} Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b559-8\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
