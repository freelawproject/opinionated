Created in 1955, the handicap reimbursement program encourages employers to hire persons with certain mental or physical conditions that could hinder employment. R.C. 4123.343(A)(1) through (25). Am.Sub.H.B. No. 642, 126 Ohio Laws 947. The program does so by charging to the state surplus fund all or part of the cost arising from an industrial injury sustained by an employee who has one of the statute\u2019s enumerated \u201cdiseases or conditions\u201d if the disease or condition either caused or aggravated the industrial injury leading to death or disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">{\u00b6 2} Edward Carpenter Jr., a Fairfield employee, has had hypertension since at least 1995. In 2002, he injured his back while at work. Carpenter\u2019s back injury has resulted in a considerable amount of disability compensation \u2014 first temporary total and now permanent total. In 2008, Fairfield requested handicap reimbursement from the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation for at least part of the disability payments made to Carpenter. Fairfield\u2019s application alleged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Carpenter\u2019s preexisting hypertension is a cardiac disease, one of the conditions listed in R.C. 4123.343(A)(3), that delayed his recovery from back surgery, contributing to prolonged disability payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 3} Fairfield submitted the April 5, 2008 report of Dr. Paul T. Hogya, who had reviewed Carpenter\u2019s medical records. The report stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b64} \u201cThe claimant does have history of hypertension with complicating cardiac arrhythmia in 1995. His hypertension has been managed with Lisinopril. * * * The hypertension would reasonably contribute to a handicap assessment with respect to his multiple lumbar surgeries * * *. Chronic hypertension plays a role in delaying healing from these surgeries, exacerbated by his chronic smoking. Hypertension results in stiffer arteries, which limits healing, particularly involving the fusion surgeries. Excellent blood flow is required to consolidate the bony fusion. In this case, there was a failed back surgery with nonunion. This led to the two-stage surgery on 12/2/03 and 1/24/04. Consequently, there was substantial delay in recovery, resulting in the need for a second procedure, which involved two stages over two months. Therefore, a reasonable handicap assessment attributed to the cardiac disease (hypertension) would be 50%.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 5} The bureau rejected Dr. Hogya\u2019s report as \u201cinsufficient to establish cardiac disease as a pre-existing condition that delayed recovery.\u201d It described the report as \u201cspeculative and tenuous\u201d and stated that the report did not show that Carpenter\u2019s injury was affected by hypertension but instead merely explained that in general, injuries are affected by hypertension. It accordingly denied reimbursement, and Fairfield appealed to appellee, the Industrial Commission of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 6} A commission district hearing officer denied reimbursement, and on July 29, 2008, a staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) affirmed that decision for three reasons: (1) hypertension is not an R.C. 4123.343(A) enumerated condition, (2) Fairfield did not establish that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension constituted a cardiac disease, and (3) there was insufficient evidence to establish that Carpenter\u2019s high blood pressure contributed to the cost of his workers\u2019 compensation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 7} Fairfield appealed to the commission and submitted an August 12, 2008 report from Dr. Hogya in which he explained why hypertension should be considered a cardiac disease. The commission, however, refused further appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 8} Fairfield filed a complaint in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, challenging the denial of reimbursement. Fairfield relied heavily on a newly submitted piece of evidence \u2014 a one-page Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation document entitled \u201cHandicap Reimbursement Guidelines.\u201d This document stated that \u201c[e]vidence of high blood pressure/hypertension, without more explanation, does <em>not </em>constitute evidence of cardiac disease.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Fairfield argued that it had satisfied the guidelines through Dr. Hogya\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>reports that explained why Carpenter\u2019s hypertension should be considered a cardiac disease. Fairfield urged the court to find that the commission had .abused its discretion in rejecting that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 9} The court of appeals denied the writ. It stressed that the guidelines on which Fairfield relied were not commission guidelines, but bureau guidelines that had not been promulgated in accordance with R.C. 4123.343(A) and 119.03. Describing them as internal guidelines, the court of appeals noted that Fairfield cited no authority that bound one state agency to the internal guidelines of another. The court also held that the commission\u2019s exclusive authority to weigh the evidence permitted it to find that Dr. Hogya\u2019s reports were insufficient evidence. Emphasizing the commission\u2019s substantial expertise in the area of handicap reimbursement, the court of appeals held that the commission did not abuse its discretion in finding that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension was not a cardiac disease for handicap-reimbursement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 10} Fairfield now appeals to this court as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 11} For handicap reimbursement to issue, an employer must first establish that its employee had one of the enumerated conditions under R.C. 4123.343(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The condition currently at issue \u2014 hypertension\u2014is not a designated condition. Cardiac disease is listed in R.C. 4123.343(A)(3), although the term is not defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>{\u00b6 12} Fairfield argues that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension should be classified as a cardiac disease and advances two propositions: one relies on dictionary definitions and would make hypertension a cardiac disease per se; the other relies on Dr. Hogya\u2019s reports and would qualify Carpenter\u2019s hypertension as a cardiac disease. The commission contends that hypertension should not be considered a cardiac disease per se and argues that the evidence in this case did not support a finding that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension qualifies as a cardiac disease. For the following reasons, we hold in the commission\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 13} Fairfield initially argues that because R.C. Chapter 4123 does not define \u201ccardiac disease,\u201d it must be \u201caccorded its plain, everyday meaning.\u201d <em>Sharp v. Union Carbide Corp. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 69, 70, 525 N.E.2d 1386. In asserting that Carpenter\u2019s high blood pressure should be classified as a cardiac disease, Fairfield relies on extrapolation: because the term \u201ccardiac\u201d means relating to the heart and hypertension affects the blood vessels that supply the heart, hypertension is a cardiac disease. We reject this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 14} If the mere fact of blood circulation were sufficient to transform a chronic condition into a cardiac disease, then ostensibly leukemia and anemia would also be cardiac diseases because they, too, affect the blood. Fairfield\u2019s reasoning could permit employer reimbursement for many conditions never anticipated by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 15} Second, Fairfield\u2019s logic would permit handicap reimbursement in situations where a person\u2019s hypertension has never manifested itself with the symptomatology of a cardiac disease. High blood pressure can certainly lead to very serious heart problems, but many people \u2014 including Carpenter \u2014 control their hypertension and suffer no heart-related effects. Dr. Hogya reported that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension has been effectively managed with medication, and he did not conclude that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension has had any cardiac implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 16} Third, the \u201cprimary goal in construing a statute is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Cordray v. Midway Motor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number><em>Sales, Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 234, 2009-Ohio-2610, 910 N.E.2d 432, \u00b6 15. In this case, the interpretation that Fairfield advocates is not consistent with the General Assembly\u2019s purpose in creating the handicap reimbursement program.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 17} The stated purpose of R.C. 4123.343 is to encourage employers to hire and retain handicapped employees with the conditions that are listed. To an employer, any of the conditions may raise concerns about an employee\u2019s productivity or the employer\u2019s ability to respond in the event of an emergency. Without an incentive to hire those suffering from these conditions, an employer might be less inclined to employ them.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 18} According to the American Heart Association, however, one in three adults has hypertension,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> so no incentive is needed to hire these persons into the workforce \u2014 they are already there. Equally important, high blood pressure, unlike many of the enumerated conditions, can be controlled, so it is far less likely to disrupt workplace productivity or safety. Simply put, hypertension is not the impediment to employment that the enumerated conditions might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 19} This is not to say that hypertension can never be classified as an R.C. 4123.343(A)(3) cardiac disease. The commission, however, found that the evidence submitted by Fairfield did not establish that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension constituted a cardiac disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 20} The commission is exclusively responsible for evaluating evidentiary weight and credibility. <em>State ex rel. Burley v. Coil Packing, Inc. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 18, 20-21, 31 OBR 70, 508 N.E.2d 936. Dr. Hogya\u2019s April 5, 2008 report stated that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension had been successfully managed with medication, and he did not attribute any cardiac symptoms to that condition. From this, the commission concluded that Carpenter\u2019s hypertension was not a cardiac disease. Fairfield argues that any shortcomings in that report were remedied by Dr. Hogya\u2019s August 12, 2008 narrative. That report, however, was submitted <em>after </em>the SHO hearing, so it is not relevant to discussion of the SHO\u2019s order. <em>State ex rel. Cordray v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 54 Ohio St.3d 99, 561 N.E.2d 917.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">{\u00b6 21} We accordingly affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment holding that the commission did not abuse its discretion in denying Fairfield\u2019s application for handicap reimbursement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b458-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"A8T\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>Coolidge Wall Co., L.P.A., David C.
