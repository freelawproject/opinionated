The writ of mandamus directed Judge Russo to vacate the portion of her order striking the notice of appellee and cross-appellant, Fifth Third Mortgage Company, voluntarily dismissing its foreclosure action without prejudice. The writ of prohibition ordered Judge Russo not to proceed on Fifth Third\u2019s dismissed claim. In addition, Fifth Third cross-appealed from the portion of the judgment denying a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Russo from conducting a contempt proceeding in the dismissed case. Because the court of appeals ruled properly in the underlying writ case, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\n<em>Fifth Third Mtge. Co. v. Markus, Cuyahoga C.P. No. CV 09 704576</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWc\">{\u00b6 2} Fifth Third operates and does business as a mortgage company and provides residential and commercial loans throughout Ohio. In September 2009, Fifth Third filed a foreclosure action against Steven Markus in the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas. Judge Russo issued an order that provided:</p>\n<p id=\"AyV\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cIf a forbearance agreement or payment plan is in effect in this case, the court hereby orders [Fifth Third] to notify the court within seven days of said agreement or plan. Failure to comply will result in a show cause hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">{\u00b6 4} The parties in the foreclosure case then negotiated a loan-modification agreement in which the original mortgage amount was increased from $87,550 to $102,590.47 and other terms of the loan were changed. In the agreement, Markus acknowledged that the agreement did not release his obligations under the parties\u2019 original note and security instrument:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cNothing in this Agreement shall be understood or construed to be a satisfaction or release in whole or in part of the Note or Security Instrument. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, the Note and Security Instrument will remain in full force and effect and unchanged, and Borrower(s) and Lender will be bound by, and comply with, all of the terms and provisions thereof, as amended by this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 6} On March 2, 2010, Fifth Third filed a notice pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A) voluntarily dismissing its complaint, without prejudice, in the foreclosure case. No counterclaims had been asserted, and no trial had been scheduled in the case. The next day, Markus filed notice of the parties\u2019 loan-modification agreement with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">{\u00b6 7} On March 4, 2010, Judge Russo issued an entry striking Fifth Third\u2019s notice of dismissal because \u201c[Civ.R.] 41(A) voluntary dismissal is not appropriate when the parties have reached a settlement.\u201d In the same entry, Judge Russo ordered a hearing for Fifth Third and its attorney to \u201cshow cause why they should not be held in contempt for filing a notice of dismissal when the case in actuality was settled via loan modification.\u201d Judge Russo later issued an entry clarifying her order by stating that \u201c[u]sing Civ.R. 41(A) to reserve the right to refile the case on the original mortgage is improper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">\n<em>Writ Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">{\u00b6 8} On March 15, 2010, Fifth Third filed complaints in the Court of Appeals for Cuyahoga County for writs of mandamus and prohibition and for an expedited alternative writ. Fifth Third requested a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Russo to vacate her March 4, 2010 order striking Fifth Third\u2019s notice of voluntary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>dismissal without prejudice, a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Russo from proceeding in the foreclosure case, including the show-cause contempt hearing, and an expedited alternative writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Russo from proceeding. The court of appeals consolidated the cases and granted an alternative writ staying further proceedings in the foreclosure case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 9} Judge Russo filed motions for summary judgment and to dissolve the alternative writ, and Fifth Third filed a response. The court of appeals subsequently granted a writ of mandamus to compel Judge Russo to vacate the portion of the March 4, 2010 entry striking Fifth Third\u2019s notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice. <em>State ex rel. Fifth Third Mtge. Co. v. Russo, </em>Cuyahoga App. Nos. 94816, 94817, and 94818, 2010-Ohio-3734, 2010 WL 3171460. The court of appeals also granted a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Russo from proceeding on the claim asserted by Fifth Third in the foreclosure case but denied a writ of prohibition to prevent the judge from proceeding on the show-cause contempt matter. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 10} This cause is now before the court upon Judge Russo\u2019s appeal as of right and Fifth Third\u2019s cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">\n<em>Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">{\u00b6 11} In her appeal as of right, Judge Russo asserts that the court of appeals erred in granting writs of mandamus and prohibition to compel her to vacate her order striking Fifth Third\u2019s notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice in the foreclosure action and to prevent her from proceeding on Fifth Third\u2019s claim in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-10\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIf a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition and mandamus will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12; <em>State ex rel. Powell v. Markus, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 219, 2007-Ohio-4793, 874 N.E.2d 775, \u00b6 7. \u201c[I]n general, when a trial court unconditionally dismisses a case or a case has been voluntarily dismissed under Civ.R. 41(A)(1), the trial court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed, and a writ * * * will issue to prevent the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Hummel v. Sadler, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 84, 2002-Ohio-3605, 771 N.E.2d 853, \u00b6 22; <em>State ex rel. Benbow v. Runyan, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 410, 2003-Ohio-4127, 792 N.E.2d 1124, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">{\u00b6 13} There are exceptions to this general rule, most notably that despite a voluntary dismissal, a trial court may consider collateral issues not related to the merits of the action, e.g., sanctions under Fed.R.Civ.P. 11, R.C. 2323.51, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>Civ.R. 45(E), and criminal contempt. See <em>Hummel </em>at \u00b6 23-24, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">{\u00b6 14} The portion of the foreclosure case at issue in Judge Russo\u2019s appeal, however, directly relates to the merits of the foreclosure claim. That is, Judge Russo held that Fifth Third\u2019s Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) notice voluntarily dismissing without prejudice the foreclosure case was improper because the claim had been effectively extinguished by the parties\u2019 loan-modification agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">{\u00b6 15} Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a) provides that, subject to certain provisions that are inapplicable here, \u201ca plaintiff, without order of court, may dismiss all claims asserted by that plaintiff against a defendant by * * * filing a notice of dismissal at any time before the commencement of trial unless a counterclaim which cannot remain pending for independent adjudication by the court has been served by that defendant.\u201d \u201cUnless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal or stipulation, the dismissal is without prejudice, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits of any claim that the plaintiff has once dismissed in any court.\u201d Civ.R. 41(A)(1). There was no counterclaim filed in the foreclosure case, and no trial had commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cTo interpret court rules, this court applies general principles of statutory construction. * * * Therefore, we must read undefined words or phrases in context and then construe them according to rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Law Office of Montgomery Cty. Public Defender v. Rosencrans, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 338, 2006-Ohio-5793, 856 N.E.2d 250, \u00b6 23. \u201cIf a court rule is unambiguous, we apply it as written.\u201d <em>Erwin v. Bryan, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 519, 2010-Ohio-2202, 929 N.E.2d 1019, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 17} The plain import of Civ.R. 41(A)(1) is that once a plaintiff voluntarily dismisses all claims against a defendant, the court is divested of jurisdiction over those claims. \u201cIt is axiomatic that such dismissal deprives the trial court of jurisdiction over the matter dismissed. After its voluntary dismissal, an action is treated as if it had never been commenced.\u201d <em>Zimmie v. Zimmie </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.3d 94, 95, 11 OBR 396, 464 N.E.2d 142. The notice of voluntary dismissal is self-executing and completely terminates the possibility of further action on the merits of the case upon its mere filing, without the necessity of court intervention. See, e.g., <em>Selker &amp; Furber v. Brightman </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 710, 714, 742 N.E.2d 203; <em>Payton v. Rehberg </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 183, 191-192, 694 N.E.2d 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 18} And under the unambiguous text of the rule, the dismissal is without prejudice \u201c[u]nless otherwise stated in the notice of dismissal * * *, except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits of any claim that the plaintiff has once dismissed in any court.\u201d Civ.R. 41(A)(1). Because the notice filed by Fifth Third in the underlying foreclosure case stated that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>dismissal was without prejudice, and Fifth Third had not previously dismissed the same foreclosure claim in any previous action, the dismissal without prejudice was effective once it was filed. No further court action was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 19} Judge Russo, however, argues that the parties\u2019 loan-modification agreement represented a settlement of Fifth Third\u2019s original foreclosure claim, which barred its right to recover on that claim. Yet the judge ignores the explicit language of the parties\u2019 agreement that it did not constitute a satisfaction or release of the note and security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 20} Moreover, even were the judge correct, Civ.R. 41(A)(1) does not recognize any exception for purportedly settled claims that have not been formally dismissed before the plaintiff files a notice of dismissal pursuant to the rule. Notably, Judge Russo cites no case that so holds. Instead, she cites cases in which the court held that settlement barred subsequent litigation based on the same claim, see <em>Maitland v. Ford Motor Co., </em>103 Ohio St.3d 463, 2004-Ohio-5717, 816 N.E.2d 1061, \u00b6 20, and that a third foreclosure action following the lender\u2019s voluntary dismissal of two previous foreclosure actions based on the same promissory note and mortgage was barred by the double-dismissal rule of Civ.R. 41(A)(1)(a). <em>U.S. Bank Natl. Assn. v. Gullotta, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 399, 2008-Ohio-6268, 899 N.E.2d 987, \u00b6 25-28. Neither case controls the circumstances here, which involve Fifth Third\u2019s absolute right under Civ.R. 41(A)(1) to dismiss its foreclosure action once without prejudice. Thus, Fifth Third properly dismissed its case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cWhen a case has been properly dismissed pursuant to Civ.R. 41(A)(1), the court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed and a writ of prohibition will issue to prevent the exercise of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Fogle v. Steiner </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 158, 161, 656 N.E.2d 1288; <em>State ex rel. Hunt v. Thompson </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 182, 183, 586 N.E.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">{\u00b6 22} Therefore, the court of appeals properly granted the requested extraordinary relief in mandamus and prohibition to compel Judge Russo to vacate that portion of the March 4, 2010 entry striking Fifth Third\u2019s notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice of its foreclosure case and to prevent Fifth Third from proceeding on its foreclosure claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">\n<em>Cross-Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">{\u00b6 23} In its cross-appeal, Fifth Third asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying the writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Russo from proceeding to determine whether Fifth Third should be held in contempt for filing a notice of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">{\u00b6 24} As noted previously, \u201c[tjrial courts may consider collateral issues like criminal contempt * * * despite a dismissal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ahmed v. Costine, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>100 Ohio St.3d 36, 2003-Ohio-4776, 795 N.E.2d 672, \u00b6 5. The mere fact that the contempt issue was raised after Fifth Third voluntarily dismissed its foreclosure claim does not necessitate a finding that the trial court patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction to raise that issue. Insofar as Fifth Third might be found in contempt in those ongoing proceedings, it has an adequate remedy by appeal following any such order. <em>State ex rel. Mason v. Burnside, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 1, 2007-Ohio-6754, 881 N.E.2d 224, \u00b6 15; <em>State ex rel Mancino v. Campbell </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 217, 220, 611 N.E.2d 319 (\u201cappealing a contempt order is an adequate remedy at law which will result in denial of the writ\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 25} Consequently, the court of appeals correctly denied the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition to prevent the contempt proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 26} Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not err in its judgment. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b397-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b397-10\">Lundberg Stratton and McGee Brown, JJ., concur in part and dissent in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b397-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQu\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">{\u00b6 27} I concur in the decision to grant writs of mandamus and prohibition to compel Judge Russo to vacate the March 4, 2010 entry striking Fifth Third\u2019s notice of voluntary dismissal without prejudice and to prevent Fifth Third from proceeding on its foreclosure case. I respectfully dissent from the decision denying Fifth Third relief in prohibition to prevent Judge Russo from conducting the contempt proceeding. I believe that Judge Russo patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to conduct the contempt proceeding and that an appeal is not an adequate remedy at law for Fifth Third.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">{\u00b6 28} Fifth Third was not in contempt of a court order in the underlying case when Judge Russo issued a show-cause order on March 4, 2010. The underlying case had already been dismissed and no longer existed. As the majority opinion states, \u201cthe dismissal without prejudice was effective once it was filed. No further court action was required.\u201d Thus, it follows that the judge patently and unambiguously lacked jurisdiction following dismissal to issue the show-cause order. The parties had settled the matter, and Fifth Third had filed a Civ.R. 41(A) voluntary dismissal on March 2, 2010. Judge Russo does not allege that Fifth Third disobeyed a court order, but instead, she alleged that Fifth Third was in contempt for filing a notice of dismissal following settlement. Although a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>may consider a collateral issue of criminal contempt after the underlying action is no longer pending, see <em>State ex rel. Com v. Russo </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 551, 556, 740 N.E.2d 265, the criminal contempt allegations here did not arise prior to dismissal. Judge Russo\u2019s allegations relate to the actual notice of dismissal and to the merits of the underlying action \u2014 they are not collateral issues. Consequently, I believe that Judge Russo lacked jurisdiction to proceed following Fifth Third\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQq\">Graydon, Head &amp; Ritchey, L.L.P., John C. Greiner, Harry W. Cappel, and Katherine M. Lasher, for appellee and cross-appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ajl\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, and Charles E. Hannan, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant and cross-appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 29} Fifth Third\u2019s remedy by appeal, in the unlikely event it is found in contempt, is not adequate. An adequate legal remedy must be practical and efficient and promptly administer justice. <em>Mid-America Tire, Inc. v. PTZ Trading Ltd., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 367, 2002-Ohio-2427, 768 N.E.2d 619, \u00b6 81. It is illogical to require Fifth Third to appear and defend in a contempt action under these circumstances, as well as time-consuming and costly to Fifth Third and the judicial system. In the unlikely event that Fifth Third does not prevail in the contempt proceeding, an appeal is not as efficient as a writ of prohibition would be if we granted it now. Thus, I believe that an appeal is an inefficient and inadequate remedy, and I would grant a writ of prohibition to prohibit Judge Russo from proceeding on the contempt hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">{\u00b6 30} I respectfully dissent from the resolution of the cross-appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b398-7\">McGee Brown, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
