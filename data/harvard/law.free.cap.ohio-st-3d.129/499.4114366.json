Based upon this misconduct, the board recommends that we publicly reprimand respondent. Finding that the record contains insufficient evidence to clearly and convincingly prove that respondent made false statements to a tribunal, however, the board recommends that we dismiss count two of relator\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">{\u00b6 4} Relator objects to the board\u2019s recommended sanction. Citing respondent\u2019s multiple fraudulent notarizations, the presence of several aggravating factors, and the absence of substantial mitigating evidence, relator asks that we suspend respondent from the practice of law for six months. We sustain relator\u2019s objection and suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio for six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">\n<em>Count One</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b642-12\">{\u00b6 5} The board found that in 1999, one of respondent\u2019s clients began to lend money to another man (\u201cborrower\u201d) to use in his catering business. In 2000, the client engaged respondent to prepare documents to protect his investment, and respondent prepared a promissory note, secured by a mortgage on property that the borrower and his wife owned in Columbia Station, Ohio, as well as a quitclaim deed on that property to be held in escrow.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-13\">{\u00b6 6} On January 26, 2000, the promissory note, in the principal amount of $35,000, was purportedly executed by the borrower and his wife and then witnessed and notarized by respondent. On January 31, 2000, the borrower and his wife purportedly executed, and respondent notarized, the mortgage and quitclaim deeds. The mortgage deed was filed with the Lorain County recorder on February 10, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>{\u00b6 7} Although it does not appear that the borrower was making any payments on the loans, the client continued to lend him additional funds. On January 30, 2001, the borrower and his wife purportedly executed a land contract for the Columbia Station property, identifying themselves as purchasers and the client as the vendor. Respondent notarized the signatures and then forwarded the land contract and quitclaim deed to the Lorain County Recorder for filing, but the instruments were returned due to pending litigation against the real property. The quitclaim deed was eventually recorded on August 28, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">{\u00b6 8} At the hearing, the panel heard conflicting testimony regarding the execution of the promissory note, mortgage deed, quitclaim deed, and land contract prepared by respondent. Both the borrower and his wife, who had divorced in 2003, testified that the wife had not signed any of the documents prepared and notarized by respondent. The borrower testified that he had signed his wife\u2019s name to those instruments, although he had previously executed an affidavit in another legal proceeding stating that both he and his wife had signed the quitclaim deed and the mortgage. Respondent testified that the borrower\u2019s wife had signed the instruments in his presence. Another client of respondent\u2019s, who was also the husband of the first client\u2019s niece, testified that he had been present when the borrower and his wife signed the instruments. Although respondent\u2019s secretary purportedly witnessed the signing of the documents, she did not testify at the disciplinary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">{\u00b6 9} Rebecca Barrett, a forensic document examiner for the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation, testified that the signatures purporting to be that of the borrower\u2019s wife on the instruments in question were not, in fact, her signatures. Based upon her analysis of the documents, she testified that there is \u201ca high degree of certainty\u201d that the signatures are in the borrower\u2019s hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">{\u00b6 10} On these facts, the board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(4) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation) and 1-102(A)(6) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). We adopt these findings of fact and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">\n<em>Count Two</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">{\u00b6 11} As a third-party defendant in an action brought by his client against the borrower, respondent was deposed in 2007. At that time, he testified that the instruments in question had been signed in his presence by someone purporting to be the borrower\u2019s wife and that he had not requested identification from the woman, because his client, the husband of his client\u2019s niece, and the borrower had indicated that she was the borrower\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>{\u00b6 12} The board acknowledged that respondent\u2019s 2007 deposition testimony \u201cmay not have been shown to be true based upon the forensic evidence\u201d that the borrower\u2019s wife had not signed the instruments. But the board found that given the passage of time and considerable variation in the witness testimony regarding the execution of the instruments in question, \u201c[rjespondent may well have believed that the events transpired as he related them when he gave his deposition testimony in 2007.\u201d Therefore, the board recommends that we dismiss count two based upon the absence of clear and convincing evidence that respondent committed the alleged violations. Neither party objects to this recommendation. We agree that the record does not contain clear and convincing evidence to support the misconduct charged in count two of relator\u2019s complaint and therefore dismiss that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">{\u00b6 13} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">{\u00b6 14} As aggravating factors, the board found that respondent had engaged in a pattern of misconduct involving multiple offenses, as he notarized the purported signature of the borrower\u2019s wife on three separate occasions. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). Also, although respondent agreed to settle the borrower\u2019s third-party claims against him for $5,000, he paid only $400 and then refused to pay anything more. Respondent also refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, insisting that he had properly notarized the documents. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(g). As mitigating factors, the board found that respondent did not have a prior disciplinary record and had submitted evidence of his good character, including letters from attorneys Carol Shockley and Brian M. Richter, as well as the testimony of Medina County Common Pleas Judge James L. Kimbler and Medina County Prosecuting Attorney Dean Holman, attesting to his integrity, excellent character, and good reputation. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (e).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">{\u00b6 15} Relator sought a one-year suspension for respondent\u2019s misconduct. Respondent sought dismissal of both counts of relator\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">{\u00b6 16} Generally, misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law. See, e.g., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number><em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Kraemer, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-3300, 931 N.E.2d 571, \u00b6 13; and <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Fowerbaugh </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 187, 658 N.E.2d 237, syllabus. However, citing <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Dougherty, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 307, 2005-Ohio-1825, 825 N.E.2d 1094, and <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Russell, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 171, 2007-Ohio-3603, 870 N.E.2d 1164, the board recommends that we publicly reprimand respondent. Relator objects to this recommendation, arguing that the cases cited by the board are factually distinguishable from the facts of this case and that a six-month suspension is commensurate with respondent\u2019s misconduct and our precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Dougherty, </em>an attorney violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6) by notarizing a purported affiant\u2019s signature on a single document without having actually witnessed the signature. <em>Dougherty </em>at \u00b6 4. Although the attorney\u2019s conduct involved dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, we rejected relator\u2019s argument that an 18-month suspension with 12 months stayed was the appropriate sanction. Id. at \u00b6 10,17. Instead, citing the absence of any evidence that the attorney had engaged in a course of conduct designed to deceive and the presence of mitigating evidence that included the attorney\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record, her acknowledgment of her misconduct, her sincere apology, and her cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, we issued a public reprimand. Id. at \u00b6 11, 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">{\u00b6 18} Similarly, in <em>Russell, </em>an attorney notarized the signatures on two deeds transferring real property to his client without having actually witnessed the grantors\u2019 signatures. <em>Russell </em>at \u00b6 7, 9. In imposing the recommended sanction of a public reprimand, we observed that Russell (1) had committed the same misconduct as Dougherty, (2) had no prior disciplinary offenses in more than 40 years of practice, (3) had been cooperative and contrite throughout the disciplinary process, (4) had paid to rectify the consequences of his misconduct, and (5) had established his good character and reputation apart from this single lapse of judgment. Id. at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">{\u00b6 19} In contrast to Dougherty and Russell, who engaged in single acts of misconduct by improperly notarizing one or two documents on a single occasion, respondent improperly notarized documents on three separate occasions. He also steadfastly refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct, maintaining throughout the disciplinary proceeding that the borrower\u2019s wife had appeared before him and signed the documents \u2014 even when confronted with forensic evidence that the wife did not sign the documents and that there was a high degree of certainty that the borrower had forged his wife\u2019s signature. In light of these aggravating factors, which were not present in <em>Dougherty </em>or <em>Russell, </em>we decline to depart from the general rule that offenses involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation require an actual suspension from the practice of law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AaWW\">Jonathan E.
