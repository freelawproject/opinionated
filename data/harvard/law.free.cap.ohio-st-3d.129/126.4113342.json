Hillman, for a writ of procedendo to compel appellee, Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Michael J. Holbrook, to rule on certain motions in <em>Hillman v. Edwards, </em>Franklin C.P. No. 09CVA09-13707. Judge Holbrook ruled on the motions on September 9, 2010. His performance of the acts requested by Hillman rendered the procedendo claim moot. See <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Show, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 423, 2004-Ohio-3652, 811 N.E.2d 1128, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-17\">{\u00b6 2} Moreover, the court of appeals did not err in denying Hillman\u2019s motion for an order for its magistrate to show cause why she should not be held in contempt of court for granting Judge Holbrook\u2019s motion for leave to immediately file his answer to Hillman\u2019s complaint in procedendo. There is no evidence that</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ao-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Robert L. Hillman, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">the magistrate violated any court order in her ruling. And even had the court of appeals determined that the judge did not submit a timely response to the complaint, a default judgment in Hillman\u2019s favor on his procedendo claim would not have been appropriate. See <em>State ex rel. Winnick v. Gansheimer, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 149, 2006-Ohio-6521, 858 N.E.2d 409, \u00b6 7; Civ.R. 55(D) (a default judgment may be entered against the state only if the \u201cclaimant establishes his claim or right to relief by evidence satisfactory to the court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">{\u00b6 3} We deny Hillman\u2019s motion to proceed to judgment pursuant to S.Ct. Prac.R. 6.7, because although appellee failed to file a timely merit brief, reversal of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment is not warranted because Hillman\u2019s brief does not \u201creasonably appear[] to sustain reversal.\u201d See <em>State ex rel.

McMonagle, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 61, 2005-Ohio-3669, 831 N.E.2d 433, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b269-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
