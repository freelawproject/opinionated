Folwell of Marietta, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0056055, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1991. On September 23, 2010, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, filed a seven-count amended complaint charging respondent with professional misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>{\u00b6 2} Prior to the disciplinary hearing on October 15, 2010, before a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline, the parties stipulated to the entire case \u2014 i.e., the facts, mitigating and aggravating factors, and rule violations. Relator dismissed the charges that were not stipulated. The parties also jointly recommended a two-year license suspension with the second year conditionally stayed. The panel adopted the parties\u2019 stipulated findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended sanction, adding that respondent\u2019s practice should be monitored for one year pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(9)(A) during the stayed suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">{\u00b6 3} Based on the panel\u2019s report, the board accepted the panel\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and recommends that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for two years, with the second year stayed on the conditions that he cooperate with a monitor appointed by relator during the stay and commit no further misconduct. We adopt this sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 4} The relator and respondent stipulated to the following facts and misconduct, which the panel and board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\n<em>Count 1 (Ruble/Phelps)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 5} Yolanda Ruble and Cash Phelps shared custody of their minor son. Ruble hired respondent to represent her son against Allstate Insurance Company regarding injuries that her son had sustained in a car accident. Respondent had Ruble execute a contingent-fee agreement on her son\u2019s behalf, which provided that respondent would receive one-third of any recovery from Allstate. Respondent had not represented a minor in a personal-injury action before and did not know that an attorney for a minor cannot settle a minor\u2019s claim without probate court approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 6} In the fall of 2008, respondent settled the case with Allstate for $20,000, and Ruble signed a waiver releasing her son\u2019s claim. However, respondent did not include Phelps in negotiating the settlement, nor did he get Phelps\u2019s permission to settle his son\u2019s claim. The check was payable to respondent and the minor. Respondent visited the minor at a juvenile facility, where he was incarcerated, in order to have him endorse the settlement check. On December 9, 2008, respondent deposited the check in his client trust account and withdrew $6,600 as his fee, leaving $13,400 belonging to the minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">{\u00b6 7} Probate Judge Timothy Williams oversaw the juvenile facility in which the minor was being held and learned the next day that the minor had endorsed a settlement check. Judge Williams immediately informed respondent that he could not settle a minor\u2019s claim without approval of the probate court and that proceeds from a settlement could not be distributed until the settlement has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>approved. Judge Williams told respondent that the forms for approving settlements could be acquired at the clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">{\u00b6 8} However, approximately five months later, the minor had turned 18, yet respondent had not filed an application with the probate court to approve the settlement. On April 29, 2009, Judge Williams again advised respondent that he needed to get the court to approve the minor\u2019s settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 9} On July 10, 2009, respondent filed an application with the probate court to approve the settlement. Because the settlement proceeds had been deposited and Ruble had released Allstate from liability months before, Judge Williams reluctantly approved the settlement, ordering the distribution of the $20,000 as follows: $13,659.14 to the minor, $5,340.86 to Medicaid, and $1,000 to respondent for attorney fees. Thus, respondent was required to return $5,600 of the fees that he had collected from the settlement proceeds. On July 31, 2009, respondent disbursed $13,659.14 to the minor from respondent\u2019s client trust account.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 10} Respondent admitted that at least $13,400 of the client\u2019s funds in his trust account between December 12, 2009, and July 31, 2009, had belonged to the minor. However, for most months between January 5, 2009, and July 30, 2009, the balance in this account was below $13,400, sometimes by as much as $6,232.34. Thus, respondent used some of the minor\u2019s funds for other purposes, including making a payment to another client. Further, from February 1, 2007, to mid-December 2009, respondent neither maintained client ledgers as prescribed by Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(2)\u00ae through (iv) nor reconciled his client trust account on a monthly basis pursuant to Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 11} The parties stipulated that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.1 (failing to provide competent representation), 1.3 (failing to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client), 1.15(a)(2) (failing to maintain separate client ledgers for the funds in a trust account), 1.15(a)(5) (failing to perform and retain a monthly reconciliation of the funds in his trust account), 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), and 8.4(h) (engaging in other conduct that adversely reflects on his fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">\n<em>Count 2 (Crawford)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 12} In August 2006, Darrell Crawford, a real estate agent, hired respondent to recover the balance of a commission from real estate broker, Harry Welch. Having been paid $60, on August 6, 2006, respondent sent a demand letter to Welch, but Welch refused to give Crawford any further payment. Consequently, Crawford paid respondent a flat fee of $1,650 to file a lawsuit against Welch. Respondent never filed a complaint, however, and on December 2, 2006, Welch died.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>(\u00b6 13} Later that month, Crawford called respondent to discuss how he could recover the balance of the commission. Respondent advised that once Welch\u2019s estate was opened, he could file a lawsuit against Welch\u2019s estate. In August 2007, Crawford informed respondent that Welch\u2019s estate had been opened. Crawford had understood from his discussions with respondent that respondent would be filing a claim against Welch\u2019s estate. In July 2008, however, Crawford called the probate court and the county recorder of deeds and learned both that respondent had not filed suit against Welch\u2019s estate and that Welch\u2019s property had been transferred seven months earlier. Crawford then contacted respondent and asked that his attorney fees be refunded. Two years later, respondent refunded Crawford\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">{\u00b6 14} The parties stipulated that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 1.16(e) (failing to promptly refund any unearned fee upon withdrawal of representation), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\n<em>Count 3 (Hoover)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">{\u00b6 15} On May 28, 2007, respondent consulted with William Hoover about respondent\u2019s assisting Hoover in obtaining grandparent visitation. Hoover paid respondent $187 for the consultation and for respondent to send a letter to .the attorney for Hoover\u2019s daughter. There was no response from Hoover\u2019s daughter\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">{\u00b6 16} In November 2007, Hoover asked respondent to file a lawsuit. Respondent told Hoover that he would first need to pay respondent a flat fee of $750. On November 21, 2007, Hoover paid respondent $750.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">{\u00b6 17} On November 27, 2007, Hoover left a message with respondent\u2019s secretary that respondent should not proceed. After confirming that respondent received the message, Hoover asked respondent to return the $750 fee. Respondent promised to return a portion of the fee, but failed to do so. Over the next several months, Hoover repeatedly asked respondent to refund his fees. Each time, respondent promised a refund, but never followed through. Finally, on July 14, 2010, respondent refunded Hoover $400 in attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">{\u00b6 18} The parties stipulated that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(e) and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\"><em>Count </em>J <em>(Yates Estate)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">{\u00b6 19} In June 2008, Bessie Yates hired respondent to probate her deceased husband\u2019s estate. Respondent charged her $1,200, which was to be paid at the completion of the case. A year passed without respondent\u2019s filing the probate case. In June 2009, Yates met with respondent to sign the final paperwork and provide the $300 filing fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>{\u00b6 20} On July 13, 2009, Yates\u2019s son, Phillip, contacted the Washington County Probate Court and verified that no estate had been opened. Two weeks later, respondent finally filed the probate case. Respondent admitted that he could have opened the estate sooner.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">{\u00b6 21} The parties stipulated that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\n<em>Count 5 (Washington)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b622} On April 4, 2008, Diana Washington hired respondent to pursue a postdecree matter in Ohio instead of Philadelphia, where the divorce had been granted. Washington paid respondent a $2,500 flat fee to handle the case. Subsequently, respondent informed Washington that he could not help her and told her that he would refund most of her attorney fees. However, as of December 2008, respondent had yet to return any of Washington\u2019s attorney fees. {\u00b6 23} Washington filed a grievance against respondent for failure to return the unearned fees. In December 2008, relator notified respondent that an investigation had begun. On March 5, 2009, respondent returned $840 of his fee to Washington pursuant to a check from his client trust account. On July 14, 2010, respondent refunded the remaining unearned portion of Washington\u2019s attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">{\u00b6 24} The parties stipulated that respondent\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.16(e) and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\n<em>Count 6 (Martin Estate)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">{\u00b6 25} On January 15, 2009, Thomas Martin hired respondent to transfer title to certain vehicles. Subsequently, Martin hired respondent to handle the probate case for his deceased father\u2019s estate. Martin paid a total of $500 for the representation. On February 26, 2009, Martin met with respondent and provided respondent additional information for handling the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">{\u00b6 26} In April 2009, respondent reassured Martin that the probate case \u201cwas being taken care of.\u201d Consequently, Martin believed that the probate case had been filed. In fact, respondent had done nothing on the case since he had met with Martin two months earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">{\u00b6 27} In May 2009, while speaking to Martin, respondent realized that Martin believed that respondent had filed the probate case. However, respondent did not correct Martin\u2019s impression. In fact, respondent never filed the probate case, and in August 2009, Martin hired new counsel, who filed the probate case within a week. Respondent then refunded $500 to Martin.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">{\u00b6 28} The parties stipulated that respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3, 8.4(c), and 8.4(h).</p>\n<p id=\"Atv\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>\n<em>Count 7 (Burdette)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">{\u00b6 29} Between 2006 and 2010, Jennifer Burdette was employed as respondent\u2019s secretary. She greeted visitors, answered the phone, scheduled respondent\u2019s appointments, and typed documents. Burdette was not an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 30} During Burdette\u2019s employment, Oliver Sprouse hired respondent to represent him in a civil matter on a contingent fee. Respondent agreed to pay Burdette ten percent of that fee. After receiving the fee from Sprouse, respondent paid ten percent ($200) to Burdette.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 31} The parties stipulated that respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 5.4(a) (a lawyer shall not share legal fees with a nonlawyer).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 32} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider all relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\n<em>Aggravating and Mitigating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">{\u00b6 33} The parties stipulated to the following mitigating factors: respondent had no prior disciplinary record, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a), and respondent cooperated with the disciplinary proceedings, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). The parties also stipulated to the following aggravating factors: respondent had engaged in a pattern of misconduct, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c), and respondent had committed multiple offenses, BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(d). The board also found that the additional aggravating factor of a dishonest or selfish motive was proven by clear and convincing evidence. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">\n<em>Recommended Sanction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">{\u00b6 34} The parties jointly recommended that respondent receive a two-year suspension from the practice of law with the second year stayed on the condition that respondent commit no further misconduct, and the panel added the recommendation that respondent accept a monitor to oversee his practice during the stayed portion of the suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-13\">{\u00b6 35} The panel and board found that the jointly recommended sanction was consistent with the sanctions that this court had imposed in <em>Disciplinary Counsel </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>v. Claflin, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 31, 2005-Ohio-5827, 836 N.E.2d 564, and <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Mishler, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 109, 2008-Ohio-1810, 886 N.E.2d 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 36} In <em>Claflin, </em>the respondent failed to deliver insurance proceeds to his client for more than 32 months while using the funds for expenses and to operate his law office. Id. at \u00b6 6. Claflin had no disciplinary record and cooperated with the disciplinary process, but his actions harmed his clients. Id. at \u00b6 11, 12. The court noted that disbarment was the presumptive sanction for such misappropriation, but that sanction can be tempered when misconduct is an isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished career and not a course of misconduct. Id. at \u00b6 14-15, quoting <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Kramer </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 321, 323, 731 N.E.2d 643. Thus, the court suspended Claflin\u2019s license for two years, with one year stayed on the condition that the respondent reimburse the client and pay interest on the funds improperly withheld. Id. at \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 37} In <em>Mishler, </em>the respondent settled cases without his client\u2019s consent, obtained settlement proceeds with forged client endorsements, charged excessive fees, and failed to account for client funds. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Mishler, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 109, 2008-Ohio-1810, 886 N.E.2d 818, \u00b62. The respondent had no disciplinary record. Id. at \u00b6 41. The court imposed a two-year license suspension, with the second year stayed on the conditions that respondent not commit further ethical violations, fully account for and refund client fees with interest, and upon reinstatement, complete a probation period of one year and establish an office accounting system to track receipts and disbursements of his clients\u2019 funds. Id. at \u00b6 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 38} After reviewing these eases, the panel and board agreed with the parties\u2019 recommended sanction of a two-year suspension with the second year stayed on conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 39} Having reviewed the record, the stipulations, and the board\u2019s findings, conclusions, and recommendations, we agree that respondent committed the stipulated misconduct and that the board\u2019s recommended sanction is supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 40} Consequently, we suspend respondent\u2019s license to practice law for two years, with the second year stayed on the conditions that respondent commit no further misconduct and that he complete one year of probation and be monitored by an attorney appointed by relator in accordance with Gov.Bar R. V(9)(B). If respondent fails to comply with these conditions, the stay will be lifted, and he will serve the full two-year suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b445-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Atl\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Jonathan E.
