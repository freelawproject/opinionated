Industrial Energy Users-Ohio (\u201cIEU\u201d) opposed AEP\u2019s application and now appeals. IEU fails to demonstrate reversible error, however, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">{\u00b6 2} As previously ordered by the commission, AEP had been providing service to a pair of manufacturing customers at discounted rates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he difference between what AEP would have collected from [these customers] under its tariffs and what it actually collected, given the discount,\u201d is called \u201cdelta revenue.\u201d <em>In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 271, 2011-Ohio-2638, 951 N.E.2d 751, \u00b6 3. AEP had been keeping track of this delta revenue and intending to collect it through a rate mechanism called \u201cthe economic development cost recovery rider.\u201d We will simply call it \u201cthe rider.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b710-12\">{\u00b6 3} In the case below, AEP filed an application seeking permission to collect its delta revenue through the rider. This was actually the second time that AEP had filed such an application; its first request had been granted only a month earlier. These quickly successive applications reflected the requirement that AEP \u201cupdate[] and reconcile[]\u201d the rider every six months. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:l-38-08(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-13\">{\u00b6 4} IEU opposed both requests, raising the same objections each time. In the first proceeding, the commission rejected IEU\u2019s arguments. IEU appealed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>that decision to this court, and the case was briefed; we never ruled on the dispute, however, because IEU dismissed its appeal before oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">{\u00b6 5} In the second proceeding (which is the case now on review), the commission again rejected IEU\u2019s arguments, this time on the basis that it had already ruled against IEU in the first proceeding. IEU again appealed. It did not dismiss this appeal, but did choose to submit the case on the briefs, without oral argument. AEP has intervened as an appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">{\u00b6 6} IEU initially raised four propositions of law but has since dismissed the first two. For reasons discussed below, the remaining propositions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">\n<em>A. IEU Has Not Shonm that the Commission Erred in Modifying the Phase-in of AEP\u2019s Rates</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">{\u00b6 7} In its third proposition of law, IEU argues that the order unlawfully exempted the rider from the maximum increases permitted in AEP\u2019s electric-security-plan case. IEU is referring to the commission\u2019s decision in an earlier case to limit, how much AEP could annually increase its customers\u2019 bills; the commission acted under R.C. 4928.144, which permits the commission to \u201cauthorize any just and reasonable phase-in\u201d of certain electric rates. IEU attacks the decision to exempt the rider from the rate-increase limits on two grounds: procedurally, it asserts that the commission departed from precedent; substantively, it argues that the commission unreasonably increased rates. Neither argument is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">{\u00b6 8} As to the procedural argument, the order below did not violate the earlier, electric-security-plan order. It is true, as IEU argues, that the earlier order did not exempt the rider from the rate-increase limits. But the commission did not rule out further exemptions, and as a general rule, the commission has discretion to revisit earlier regulatory decisions and modify them prospectively. See, e.g., <em>Utility Serv. Partners, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>124 Ohio St.3d 284, 2009-Ohio-6764, 921 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 18 (\u201cModifying a regulatory scheme is not problematic in itself. Agencies undoubtedly may change course, provided that the new regulatory course is permissible\u201d); <em>In re Application of Columbus S. Power Co., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-1788, 947 N.E.2d 655, \u00b6 52. IEU does not explain why the general rule should not apply here. We fail to see any procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">{\u00b6 9} That leads to IEU\u2019s substantive argument, namely, that the commission erred by allowing current rates to become too high. This argument also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>{\u00b6 10} The decision that IEU attacks is a discretionary one. As noted, the commission\u2019s power to limit annual rate increases, and thus phase-in AEP\u2019s rates, comes from R.C. 4928.144. That law allows the commission to \u201cauthorize any just and reasonable phase-in\u201d of electric-security-plan rates <em>\u201cas the commission considers necessary </em>to ensure rate or price stability for consumers.\u201d (Emphasis added.) While the end product must be \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d the emphasized language entrusts the details of any phase-in \u2014 how much should be collected now, how much later \u2014 to the commission\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">{\u00b6 11} Discretionary decisions receive deferential review, <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 289, 2008-Ohio-860, 883 N.E.2d 1025, \u00b6 10, and IEU has not shown an abuse of discretion. Its complaint concerns a pure matter of timing \u2014 should customers pay the rider now or later? If later, the law requires that carrying charges (a kind of financing charge) be added to the deferred rates. R.C. 4928.144. IEU points to no legislative command that addresses the specifics of such a timing question, and the absence of statutory criteria leaves us ill-equipped to second-guess the commission\u2019s discretionary determinations. IEU\u2019s sense that current rates are high enough and its preference to pay the rider (plus carrying charges) later are not enough to upset the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">{\u00b6 12} For the foregoing reasons, we reject IEU\u2019s third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">\n<em>B. IEU Has Not Shown that the Commission Erred in Calculating AEP\u2019s Carrying Charges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">{\u00b6 13} In its fourth proposition of law, IEU argues that the commission erred in allowing AEP to use a long-term debt rate (as opposed to a short-term rate) to calculate certain carrying charges. Again, however, IEU has not demonstrated reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-9\">{\u00b6 14} IEU has preserved for appeal only a'single argument concerning the calculation of AEP\u2019s carrying charges. In its application for rehearing, IEU alleged that the commission had \u201crepeatedly] fail[ed] to at least <em>inquire </em>as to whether a lower carrying cost rate could be utilized.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201cCustomers,\u201d IEU asserted, \u201cdeserve at least some analysis or other review\u201d of the carrying-cost issue. IEU raised no other argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">{\u00b6 15} So far as IEU\u2019s rehearing application explained, the commission would have fully satisfied IEU\u2019s concerns if it had \u201cinquired\u201d or provided \u201csome analysis or other review\u201d of the carrying-cost issue. But the commission did \u201cinquire\u201d and provide \u201csome analysis\u201d of that issue: it had reviewed that issue in the <em>preceding </em>rider case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And in the order below, the commission explained that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>very fact in response to IEU\u2019s objection. IEU did not reply with any additional challenges. In short, IEU argued only that the commission needed to make an inquiry, and the commission pointed out where it had made that inquiry. The commission fully answered IEU\u2019s concern.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AHs\">McNees, Wallace <em>&amp; </em>Nurick, L.L.C., Samuel C. Randazzo, and Joseph E. Oliker, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AdN\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and William L. Wright, Thomas W. McNamee, Thomas G. Lindgren, and Werner L. Margard III, Assistant Attorneys General, for appellee, Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Avd\">Steven T. Nourse and Matthew J. Satterwhite, for intervening appellees, Columbus Southern Power Company and Ohio Power Company.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">{\u00b6 16} IEU\u2019s remaining argument \u2014 that the commission failed to explain the reasons for its decision \u2014 is forfeited. We have jurisdiction only over arguments raised on rehearing. <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-4276, 872 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 40. IEU did not argue on rehearing that the commission had failed to explain itself, so we cannot consider the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">{\u00b6 17} IEU\u2019s fourth proposition of law is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">{\u00b6 18} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-14\">.
