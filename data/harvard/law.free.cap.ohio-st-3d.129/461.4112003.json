We hold that the statute establishes strict liability as to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the age of the victim and a mens rea of purpose in regard to the sexual contact between the defendant and the victim. Further, in regard to defendant-appellant\u2019s sex-offender classification, we remand this case to the trial court for an application of this court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 2} After a jury trial, defendant-appellant, Thomas Dunlap, was convicted of two counts of gross sexual imposition involving victims under the age of 13, in violation of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), and one count of disseminating obscene matter to juveniles, in violation of R.C. 2307.31(A)(1). The court sentenced Dunlap to a total of two years in prison: two years on each count of gross sexual imposition and 16 months on the obscenity count, to be served concurrently. The court also found Dunlap to be a Tier III sex offender. Dunlap appealed the R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) convictions and his sex-offender classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 3} The court of appeals affirmed Dunlap\u2019s convictions, rejecting his arguments that R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) requires a mens rea element of recklessness and that the application of R.C. Chapter 2950, 2007 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 10 (\u201cS.B. 10\u201d), to offenses committed before its effective date violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the federal Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">\n<em>Sex-Offender Classification</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 4} Dunlap had been indicted on July 26, 2007, on the charges upon which he eventually was convicted. He was sentenced under S.B. 10 on March 4, 2008. Dunlap argues that the application of S.B. 10 to offenders whose crimes occurred before its effective date of January 1, 2008, violates the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution and the Retroactivity Clause of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">{\u00b6 5} In regard to Dunlap\u2019s sex-offender classification, this case was originally held for a decision in <em>State v. Bodyke, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-2424, 933 N.E.2d 753. However, having determined that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bodyke </em>did not resolve the classification issue in Dunlap\u2019s case, we subsequently held this case for a decision in <em>State v. Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108. In our recent decision in <em>Williams, </em>we held that S.B. 10, \u201cas applied to defendants who committed sex offenses prior to its enactment, violates Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, which prohibits the General Assembly from passing retroactive laws.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">{\u00b6 6} We therefore reverse that portion of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that upheld the application of S.B. 10 to Dunlap and remand this case to the trial court for an application of <em>Williams.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">\n<em>R.C. 2907.05 Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aso\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cNo person shall have sexual contact with another, not the spouse of the offender; cause another, not the spouse of the offender, to have sexual contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>with the offender; or cause two or more other persons to have sexual contact when any of the following applies:</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(4) The other person, or one of the other persons, is less than thirteen years of age, whether or not the offender knows the age of that person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">{\u00b6 11} Dunlap claims that the indictment failed to set forth the mens rea for the R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) charges, specifically regarding the element of sexual contact. The indictment for the R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) violation in Count 1 stated that the defendant \u201chad sexual contact with Jane Doe I, not his spouse, whose age at the time of the said sexual contact was under 13 years, whether or not the offender know [sic, knew] the age of Jane Doe I.\u201d The indictment used similar language in Count 3 for the alleged sexual contact with the other victim, Jane Doe II.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-9\">{\u00b6 12} In the jury instructions regarding gross sexual imposition, the trial court instructed the jury as to the element of \u201csexual contact,\u201d as defined in R.C. 2907.01(B):</p>\n<p id=\"b605-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cSexual contact. Sexual contact means any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">{\u00b6 14} Dunlap concedes that R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) does not require the state to prove any mens rea with regard to the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the age of the victim, i.e., that a defendant is strictly liable as to that element of a violation. However, as to the element of sexual contact, Dunlap argues that the indictment should have set forth the mens rea of recklessness. He contends that the indictment\u2019s failure to include that mens rea coupled with the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the culpable mens rea of recklessness constituted structural error requiring reversal pursuant to <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917 <em>(\u201cColon I </em>\u201d), and <em>State v. Colon, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 204, 2008-Ohio-3749, 893 N.E.2d 169 <em>(\u201cColon II</em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">{\u00b6 15} Dunlap appealed his convictions to the Eighth District Court of Appeals, which rejected his mens rea argument, holding that gross sexual imposition involving a child under the age of 13 \u201cis a strict liability offense and requires no precise culpable state of mind. All that is required is a showing of the proscribed sexual contact.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">{\u00b6 16} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">{\u00b6 17} During the pendency of Dunlap\u2019s appeal, this court overruled <em>Colon I </em>and overruled <em>Colon II </em>in part, holding that \u201cwhen an indictment fails to charge a mens rea element of the crime, but tracks the language of the criminal statute describing the offense, the indictment provides the defendant with adequate notice of the charges against him and is, therefore, not defective.\u201d <em>State v. Homer, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, \u00b645. Dunlap\u2019s indictment tracked the language of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), so, pursuant to <em>Homer, </em>even if the indictment failed to charge a mens rea, it was not defective. However, <em>Homer </em>is not dispositive here, because Dunlap further alleges that the jury instructions in this case should have included a mens rea of recklessness. We thus address the applicable mens rea of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 18} There is no question that the victim\u2019s age is a strict-liability element of an R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) violation. The statute prohibits sexual contact with a person less than 13 years of age \u201cwhether or not the offender knows the age of that person.\u201d But the fact that defendants are held strictly liable for that element of a violation does not mean that R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) lacks a mens rea requirement as to all of its elements. The state concedes that the appellate court erred in finding that R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) requires no culpable state of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 19} The parties agree that the \u201csexual contact\u201d element of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) has a mens rea separate from the rest of the statute. \u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined in R.C. 2907.01(B):</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c \u2018Sexual contact\u2019 means any touching of an erogenous zone of another, including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if the person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 21} Dunlap argues that there is no stated mens rea for the \u201cany touching\u201d language in the first phrase of R.C. 2907.01(B) and that the default mens rea should therefore be recklessness, pursuant to R.C. 2901.21(B), which states that \u201c[wjhen the section [defining an offense] neither specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.\u201d Thus, Dunlap would have this court interpret R.C. 2907.01(B) as defining sexual contact as \u201cany <em>reckless </em>touching of an erogenous zone of another * * * for the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Dunlap argues that the phrase \u201cfor the purpose of sexually arousing either person\u201d refers to the motive behind the touching rather than the mens rea behind the act of touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 22} The state, on the other hand, argues that R.C. 2907.01(B) does contain an expressly stated mens rea, i.e., purpose. The state asserts that R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>2907.01(B) provides the mental state by defining \u201csexual contact\u201d as touching \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of sexual arousal.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-4\">{\u00b6 23} We agree with the state that the mens rea of purpose applies to the whole of R.C. 2907.01(B), and thus to the sexual-contact element of R.C. 2907.05(A)(4). R.C. 2901.22(A) defines the mens rea of purpose:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 25} Through the definition of sexual contact in R.C. 2907.01(B), gross sexual imposition as described in R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) requires proof of touching \u201cfor the <em>purpose </em>of sexually arousing or gratifying either person.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The statute requires a specific intent behind the touching \u2014 the touching must be intended to achieve sexual arousal or gratification. Since there is a specific intent motivating the touching, it follows that the act of touching must be intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b6 26} Grammatically, the phrase \u201cfor the purpose of sexually arousing or gratifying either person\u201d modifies \u201cany touching of an erogenous zone of another.\u201d R.C. 2907.01(B) consists of one simple sentence with no subordinate clauses. Thus, we need not apply the holding from <em>Homer </em>that \u201c[w]hen the General Assembly includes a mens rea element in one discrete clause, subsection, or division of a statute but not in another discrete clause, subsection, or division of that statute, courts must apply the analysis in <em>State v. Wac </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 84, 22 O.O.3d 299, 428 N.E.2d 428, and <em>State v. Maxwell, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 254, 2002-Ohio-2121, 767 N.E.2d 242, to determine the mental state where none is specified.\u201d <em>Homer, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, at paragraph two of the syllabus. Here, there is only one clause containing one mens rea. We thus conclude that the applicable mens rea of sexual contact, as defined in R.C. 2907.01(B), is purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 27} The indictment here tracked the language of the charged offenses as set forth in R.C. 2907.05(A)(4), and the trial court properly instructed the jury on the element of sexual contact as set forth in R.C. 2907.01(B). Thus, the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">{\u00b6 28} Although the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court, it erred in finding that R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) \u201crequires no precise culpable state of mind.\u201d We hold instead that the element of sexual contact in an R.C. 2907.05(A)(4) violation requires a mens rea of purpose. However, since we conclude that the indictment and jury instructions in this case sufficiently set forth the required mens rea, we affirm that portion of the court of appeals\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>judgment. We reverse that part of the judgment that applied S.B. 10 to Dunlap and remand the case to the trial court for reclassification of Dunlap\u2019s sex-offender status in light of our decision in <em>Williams, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 344, 2011-Ohio-3374, 952 N.E.2d 1108.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0YJ\">William D.
