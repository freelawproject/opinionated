On June 14, 2010, relator, Cincinnati Bar Association, charged respondent with a single violation of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). The complaint alleged that respondent had notarized two unsigned documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 2} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline considered the cause on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement, filed pursuant to Section 11 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The panel accepted the agreement and made corresponding findings of misconduct and a recommendation, which the board adopted. We adopt that recommendation and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 3} The stipulated facts of this case show that in August 2009, respondent\u2019s former law partner brought him a number of documents to notarize. Respondent entered the month, day, and year into the jurats and notarized two documents that his former partner had signed.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">{\u00b6 4} Among the documents were two forms for removal of a name from a Kentucky liquor license. Respondent\u2019s former partner had prepared those documents for the signature of a business associate with whom he had been engaged in a legal dispute. If signed, the affidavits would have divested the business partner of his interest in two liquor licenses. Respondent did not enter the date on the jurats, but he notarized the unsigned documents in contravention of the jurat, which stated, \u201cI, the undersigned, a Notary Public in and for the State and County aforesaid, do hereby certify that _ personally appeared before me and acknowledged the above to be their free act and deed.\u201d Respondent\u2019s former partner later entered the name of his business associate and presented the prenotarized documents to him for his signature, but his associate did not sign either document.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-11\">{\u00b6 5} Based upon these stipulated facts, the board found, and we agree, that respondent violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">{\u00b6 6} In recommending a sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc.Reg. 10. The board found no aggravating factors, and in mitigation found that respondent does not have a prior disciplinary record, that he fully and freely self-reported his misconduct to relator, that he cooperated in these disciplinary proceedings, and that he has presented evidence of his good character and reputation.

McAdams Jr., for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A6q\">George D. Jonson, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">{\u00b6 7} Citing <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Dougherty, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 307, 2005-Ohio-1825, 825 N.E.2d 1094, the panel and board recommend that we adopt the parties\u2019 stipulated sanction of a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Dougherty, </em>we publicly reprimanded an attorney who violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and (6) by notarizing a purported affiant\u2019s signature without having actually witnessed the signature. Id. at \u00b6 4,17. Although we acknowledged that misconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation generally warrants an actual suspension from the practice of law, we concluded that Dougherty\u2019s conduct was not as egregious as that of other attorneys who had received actual suspensions, given that there was no evidence establishing that she had engaged in a course of conduct designed to deceive. Therefore, we rejected relator\u2019s recommended sanction of an 18-month suspension with 12 months stayed. Id. at \u00b6 10,16-17. Observing that Dougherty\u2019s misconduct arose from a single, isolated incident and citing mitigating evidence that included her lack of a prior disciplinary record, her acknowledgment of her misconduct, her sincere apology, and her cooperation in the disciplinary proceedings, we imposed a public reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 9} In this case, the parties have entered into a consent to discipline and agree that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction for respondent\u2019s misconduct. In light of the mitigating factors in this case, we agree. Accordingly, respondent is publicly reprimanded for his violations of Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c). Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b271-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
