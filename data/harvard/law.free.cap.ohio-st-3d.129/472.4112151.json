Because we hold that the language employed by the trial court while addressing the defendant was a reasonable explanation of the defendant\u2019s right to compulsory process and because we hold that other portions of the record may be referenced in resolving an alleged ambiguity during the oral colloquy, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">{\u00b6 2} On January 7, 2009, Christopher Barker, defendant-appellee, was indicted on five counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor in violation of R.C. 2907.04(A) and (B)(3), third-degree felonies. Barker initially entered a plea of not guilty, but he later withdrew that plea and entered a plea of no contest to the first three counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">{\u00b6 3} At his plea hearing, Barker stated that he was 28 years old and could read, write, and understand English. The court explained to Barker the level of felony to which he was pleading, the possible prison term and fine, and the Tier II sex-offender-registration and postrelease-control requirements and the consequences of their violation. Moreover, the trial court inquired whether Barker was satisfied with his \u201cattorney\u2019s advice, counsel, and competence,\u201d whether Barker was under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or other substances that would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>make it difficult for him to understand' what was going on, and whether any threats or promises had been made to influence Barker\u2019s plea. The judge also explained that the state was planning to dismiss counts four and five. In addition, among other things, the court explained that Barker would have the right to testify at trial, the right to have the state prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and the right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">{\u00b6 4} Central to the analysis today, the court made the following statement: \u201cI do have to ask you, do you understand when you\u2019re entering a plea you\u2019re giving up your right to a jury trial or bench trial, also <em>giving up your right to call witnesses to speak on your behalf </em>or question witnesses that are speaking against you. Do you understand that?\u201d (Emphasis added.) Barker replied, \u201cYes, Your Honor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 5} Barker\u2019s signed no-contest plea states: \u201cI understand by entering this plea I give up my right to a jury trial or court trial, where I could see and have my attorney question witnesses against me, <em>and where I could use the power of the court to call witnesses to testify for me.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 6} After a review of the evidence, the court referred to Barker\u2019s signed plea form and asked him whether he had had the opportunity to review it with his attorney, and he said he had. The court asked him whether he had any questions, and he said he did not. Consequently, the court found that the defendant had been advised of his constitutional rights and had an understanding of the nature of the charge, the effect of his plea, and the maximum penalty involved. The court also found that Barker had made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of his rights pursuant to Crim.R. 11 (\u201cPleas, rights upon plea\u201d). The court accepted the plea and found him guilty of the three counts to which he had entered a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 7} On appeal, Barker argued that the entry of his no-contest plea was not voluntary, intelligent, and knowing because the trial judge had failed to fully comply with the requirements of Crim.R. 11(C). The court of appeals agreed, holding that the trial court\u2019s admonition to Barker that by entering a plea he was giving up the \u201cright to call witnesses to speak on [his] behalf\u2019 was insufficient to satisfy the constitutional mandate to compulsory process. <em>State v. Barker, </em>Lucas App. No. L-09-1139, 2010-Ohio-3067, 2010 WL 2638515, \u00b6 11, 13. Accordingly, the court of appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court. Id. at \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">{\u00b6 8} The case is now before this court upon our acceptance of a discretionary appeal. <em>State v. Barker, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 1448, 2010-Ohio-5762, 937 N.E.2d 1035.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">\n<em>A. Sufficiency of phrase \u201cright to call witnesses to speak on your behalf\u2019</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b616-11\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cWhen a defendant enters a plea in a criminal case, the plea must be made knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. Failure on any of those points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>renders enforcement of the plea unconstitutional under both the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution.\u201d <em>State v. Engle </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 525, 527, 660 N.E.2d 450. Crim.R. 11 was adopted in 1973 to give detailed instructions to trial courts on the procedures to follow before accepting pleas of guilty or no contest. <em>State v. Veney, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">{\u00b6 10} Crim.R. 11(C) requires a trial judge to determine whether that criminal defendant is fully informed of his or her rights and understands the consequences of his or her guilty plea. Of particular relevance to the case at bar is Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cIn felony cases the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or a plea of no contest, and shall not accept a plea of guilty or no contest without first addressing the defendant personally and doing all of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cInforming the defendant and determining that the defendant understands that by the plea the defendant is waiving the rights to jury trial, to confront witnesses against him or her, <em>to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in the defendant\u2019s favor, </em>and to require the state to prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at a trial at which the defendant cannot be compelled to testify against himself or herself.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">{\u00b6 14} This court has held that the preferred method of informing a criminal defendant of his or her constitutional rights during the plea colloquy is to use the language contained in Crim.R. 11(C). <em>Veney, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 18; <em>State v. Ballard </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 479, 20 O.O.3d 397, 423 N.E.2d 115. However, a trial court\u2019s failure to literally comply with Crim.R. 11(C) does not invalidate a plea agreement if the record demonstrates that the trial court explained the constitutional right \u201c <em>\u2018in a manner reasonably intelligible to that defendant.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added in <em>Veney) Veney </em>at \u00b6 27, quoting <em>Ballard </em>at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Veney, </em>we reaffirmed that strict, or literal, compliance with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c) is required when advising the defendant of the constitutional rights he is waiving by pleading guilty or no contest. Id. at \u00b6 18. Included in the list of constitutional rights is \u201cthe right to compulsory process to obtain witnesses.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19, citing <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274, and <em>Ballard, </em>paragraph one of the syllabus. The right to compulsory process of witnesses is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 10, Article I, Ohio Constitution. However, we reaffirmed that the \u201c \u2018failure to [literally comply] will not necessarily invalidate a plea. The underlying purpose, from the defendant\u2019s perspective, of Crim.R. 11(C) is to convey to the defendant certain information so that he can make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>voluntary and intelligent decision whether to plead guilty.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Ballard </em>at 479-480. This is because \u201ca trial court can still convey the requisite information on constitutional rights to the defendant even when the court does not provide a word-for-word recitation of the criminal rule, so long as the trial court actually explains the rights to the defendant.\u201d <em>Veney </em>at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">{\u00b6 16} In the case at bar, the trial court described Barker\u2019s constitutional right to compulsory process as the \u201cright to call witnesses to speak on your behalf.\u201d The court of appeals held that although a court does not necessarily have to employ the term \u201ccompulsory process\u201d during the Crim.R. 11 oral colloquy, \u201cit must use some equivalent term such as the defendant has the \u2018power to force,\u2019 \u2018subpoena,\u2019 use the \u2018power of the court to force,\u2019 or \u2018compel\u2019 a witness to appear and testify on a defendant\u2019s behalf.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>2010-Ohio-3067, 2010 WL 2638515, at \u00b6 13. The court held that the explanation that the defendant had the \u201cability \u2018to call witnesses\u2019 simply does not satisfy the constitutional mandate.\u201d Id. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 17} A review of legal and standard dictionaries reveals that \u201cto call\u201d commonly means \u201cto summon.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 232 defines \u201ccall\u201d as \u201c[t]o summon.\u201d So does Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 318. The Oxford English Dictionary (2d Ed.1989) 786 defines \u201ccall\u201d as to \u201csummon with a shout, or by a call; <em>hence </em>to summon, cite; to command or request the attendance of.\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed.1987) 297 defines \u201ccall\u201d as \u201cto command or request to come; summon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 18} Using \u201ccall\u201d to mean \u201cto compel someone\u2019s appearance\u201d is a commonly understood term in everyday parlance. For example, citizens may be \u201ccalled\u201d for jury duty. Members of the military reserves may be \u201ccalled up\u201d for active duty. Professionals may be \u201con call\u201d with respect to their jobs. The word \u201ccall\u201d in everyday usage clearly conveys the idea that one is required to appear or to perform.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 19} The dissent in <em>State v. Cummings, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 1206, 2005-Ohio-6506, 839 N.E.2d 27, \u00b6 14, highlighted this issue: \u201c[T]o \u2018call\u2019 means to \u2018summon.\u2019 Garner, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed. 2004) 217. * * * I believe that the trial court\u2019s words conveyed an even clearer message than does a recitation of the right to \u2018have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.\u2019 Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c). The words \u2018compulsory process,\u2019 \u2018subpoena,\u2019 and \u2018compel witnesses\u2019 have legal significance and implications that a defendant may not know or understand.\u201d (Lundberg Stratton, J., dissenting from the decision to dismiss the case as having been improvidently accepted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>{\u00b6 20} The use of common, everyday words, including \u201ccall,\u201d instead of a rote recitation of legal terminology, can assist the defendant in understanding the rights forfeited by entry of a plea. Thus, we hold that the language employed by the trial court in informing the defendant that he had the \u201cright to call witnesses to speak on [his] behalf\u2019 was a reasonably intelligible explanation to the defendant of his constitutional right to compulsory process and allowed the defendant to make a voluntary and intelligent decision whether to plead no contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">\n<em>B. Consequences of failure to strictly comply with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 21} Barker\u2019s change-of-plea form states: \u201cI understand by entering this plea I give up my right to a jury trial or court trial, where I could see and have my attorney question witnesses against me, and where I could use the power of the court to call witnesses to testify for me.\u201d During the plea colloquy, the trial court asked Barker whether he had reviewed the change-of-plea form with his attorney, and Barker stated that he had. The court then asked: \u201cDo you have any questions of the Court before I proceed?\u201d Barker stated that he did not have any questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 22} In addition to invalidating Barker\u2019s plea based on the alleged insufficiency of the language employed to describe the right to compulsory process, the court of appeals cited <em>Veney, </em>which states that \u201c \u2018the court cannot simply rely on other sources to convey these rights\u2019 \u201d to the defendant. <em>Barker, </em>2010-Ohio-3067, 2010 WL 2638515, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>Veney, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 176, 2008-Ohio-5200, 897 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 29. The court held that the plea agreement was another source and therefore could not be employed to satisfy the constitutional mandate in Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 23} In <em>Veney, </em>this court held, \u201cAlthough the trial court may vary slightly from the literal wording of the rule in the colloquy, the court cannot simply rely on other sources to convey those rights to the defendant.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29. However, <em>Veney </em>can be distinguished on its facts. The court noted that in Veney\u2019s case, \u201cit [was] undisputed that the trial court plainly failed to orally inform Veney of his constitutional right to require the state to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 30. Therefore, because the trial court had completely \u201cfailed to orally inform\u201d the defendant of the right in question, under the facts of <em>Veney, </em>the court could not \u201csimply rely on other sources to convey these rights.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">{\u00b6 24} In <em>Ballard, </em>as here, the trial court did not \u201csimply\u201d rely on the written plea. Rather, the trial court engaged in a full plea colloquy with the defendant and addressed the right of compulsory process of witnesses. Thus, when a trial court addresses all the constitutional rights in the oral colloquy, a reviewing court should be permitted to consider additional record evidence to reconcile any alleged ambiguity in it. We further note that this interpretation comports with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>federal law, which does not require automatic vacation of a plea when a judge fails to inform a defendant of a <em>Boyldn </em>right. <em>Boykin, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274. See <em>United States v. Vonn </em>(2002), 535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">{\u00b6 25} We hold that <em>Veney </em>did not reject the <em>Ballard </em>approach of considering the totality of the circumstances, but instead is limited to the situation where a trial court omits any discussion of a constitutional right in the oral colloquy. Thus, we hold that an alleged ambiguity during a Crim.R. 11 oral plea colloquy may be clarified by reference to other portions of the record, including the written plea, in determining whether the defendant was fully informed of the right in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b626} Following the totality-of-the-circumstances test of <em>Ballard, </em>we find it clear that Barker knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to compulsory process, and his plea should not have been invalidated. Barker was adequately informed of his right to compulsory process via the language employed. In addition, Barker was represented by counsel, and he signed a written change-of-plea form stating that he understood that he was giving up the right to use the power of the court to call witnesses to testify for him.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 27} We hold that a trial court complies with Crim.R. 11(C)(2)(c) when its explanation of the constitutional right to compulsory process of witnesses is described to the defendant during the plea colloquy as the \u201cright to call witnesses to speak on your behalf.\u201d We further hold that an alleged ambiguity during the plea colloquy may be clarified by reference to other portions of the record, including the written plea. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Judgment reversed and trial court judgment reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b620-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
