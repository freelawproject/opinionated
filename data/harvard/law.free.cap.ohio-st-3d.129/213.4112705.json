Durkin and the common pleas court, to enter a sentencing entry that complies with Crim.R. 32(C) and properly imposes postrelease control. Judge Durkin\u2019s February 27, 2007 sentencing entry fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C) by including his guilty plea, the sentence, the judge\u2019s signature, and the time stamp indicating the entry upon the journal by the clerk of court. The entry also included sufficient language that postrelease control was part of his sentence so as to give appellant sufficient notice to raise any claimed errors on appeal rather than by extraordinary writ.
