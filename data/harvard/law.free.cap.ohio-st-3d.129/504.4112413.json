McClellan, </em>Allen App. No. 1-09-21, 2010-Ohio-314, 2010 WL 338205. Thus, res judicata bars raising it here. <em>Smith </em>at \u00b6 11. And the mere fact that he has already unsuccessfully invoked his appellate remedy does not thereby entitle him to the requested extraordinary relief in habeas corpus. <em>Everett v.
