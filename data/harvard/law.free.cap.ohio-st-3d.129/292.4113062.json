(\u201cUnited\u201d). United seeks coverage under the policy for its defense in a substantial-certainty intentional tort<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> lawsuit filed by a United employee. Gulf has denied that it has a duty to defend United because the intentional-tort claims in the underlying complaint are outside the coverage of the policy. The trial court held in favor of United, and the court of appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>{\u00b6 2} For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Gulf Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 3} Gulf issued a commercial general liability policy (\u201cCGL policy\u201d) to United with an endorsement for employer\u2019s liability coverage, known as a stop-gap endorsement. Under Section I of the CGL policy, Gulf agreed to pay \u201cthose sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance applies\u201d and \u201cto defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages.\u201d However, under that same section of the policy, Gulf had \u201cno duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages for \u2018bodily injury\u2019 or \u2018property damage\u2019 to which this insurance does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">{\u00b6 4} The CGL policy excluded coverage for injuries \u201cexpected or intended from the standpoint of the insured,\u201d bodily injury to an employee arising in the course of employment, and injury to the family of an employee as a consequence of the employee\u2019s injury, as well as for contribution claims and claims alleging liability under the dual-capacity doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">Stop-Gap Endorsement</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 5} The stop-gap endorsement modified the CGL policy by deleting the exclusions in Section I of the CGL policy \u201cwith respect to \u2018bodily injury\u2019 included within the \u2018employer\u2019s liability hazard\u2019 \u201d and replacing them with the exclusions listed in the stop-gap endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">{\u00b6 6} The following exclusion in the stop-gap endorsement is the subject of this dispute:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThis insurance does not apply to:</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b435-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201ce. \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 intentionally caused or aggravated by you, or \u2018bodily injury\u2019 resulting from an act which is determined to have been committed by you with the belief that an injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b435-14\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b435-15\">{\u00b6 10} David Ward (\u201cWard\u201d) and his wife filed a complaint against Ward\u2019s employer, United, alleging claims for employer intentional tort and seeking compensatory and punitive damages and damages for loss of consortium. While the case was pending, United filed an action against its insurance agency and broker for failure to obtain the coverage that United had requested and against Gulf for a declaration that Gulf had a duty to defend and indemnify United for the claims asserted by Ward. The cases were eventually consolidated. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>court concluded that if the stop-gap endorsement excluded coverage for substantial-certainty intentional torts, then the Gulf policy was illusory. The court granted summary judgment to United on the issue of Gulfs duty to provide a defense in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">{\u00b6 11} The Fifth District Court of Appeals reversed. The appellate court determined that the claims alleged in the underlying complaint were not within the coverage provided in the policy; thus, Gulf had no duty to defend or indemnify United. The court rejected United\u2019s argument that it is entitled to a defense because the underlying tort claim had not yet been \u201c \u2018determined to have been committed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ward v. United Foundries, Inc., </em>Stark App. No. 09CA-019, 2010-Ohio-6694, 2010 WL 6923354, \u00b6 83, quoting United\u2019s brief. Instead, the court concluded that because the underlying claim was neither potentially nor arguably covered under the terms of the policy, Gulf had no duty to defend or indemnify United. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 12} The Fifth District certified that its decision was in conflict with the decision of the Third District Court of Appeals in <em>Cooper Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. </em>(Apr. 23, 2007), Hancock App. No. 5-06-40, 2007-Ohio-1905, 2007 WL 1175183. And we determined that a conflict exists. 126 Ohio St.3d 1579, 2010-Ohio-4542, 934 N.E.2d 352.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">(\u00b6 13} This cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists (case No. 2010-1275) and pursuant to the acceptance of a discretionary appeal (case No. 2010-1049), 126 Ohio St.3d 1581, 2010-Ohio-4542, 934 N.E.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Certified Conflict</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">{\u00b6 14} We ordered the parties to brief the issue that is stated as follows in the court of appeals\u2019 entry certifying the conflict:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cWhether an exclusion in a commercial general liability insurance policy and/or stop/gap endorsement form, stating the insurance does not apply to \u2018bodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated by you, or bodily injury resulting from an act which is determined to have been committed by you with the belief that an injury is substantially certain to occur\u2019 requires a final determination made by either a judge or a jury before the defense of a claim for a substantial certainty employer intentional tort can be denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">{\u00b6 16} The parties agree that the stop-gap endorsement excludes coverage for a substantial-certainty intentional tort and that if United is liable to Ward in the underlying action, Gulf has no duty to indemnify United. We need determine only whether the policy obligates Gulf to defend United in the underlying action.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">{\u00b6 17} United contends that the phrase \u201can act which is determined to have been committed by you with the belief that an injury is substantially certain to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>occur\u201d in the Gulf policy requires Gulf to defend United against any complaint alleging a substantial-certainty intentional tort until a fact-finding judge or jury has \u201cdetermined\u201d whether or not United is liable for an intentional tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">General Insurance Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 18} An insurance policy is a contract between the insurer and the insured. <em>Pilkington N. Am., Inc. v. Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 482, 2006-Ohio-6551, 861 N.E.2d 121, \u00b6 23. If we must interpret a provision in the policy, we look to the policy language and rely on the plain and ordinary meaning of the words used to ascertain the intent of the parties to the contract. <em>Penn Traffic Co. v. AIU Ins. Co., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 227, 2003-Ohio-3373, 790 N.E.2d 1199, \u00b6 9; <em>Cincinnati Ins. Co. v. CPS Holdings, Inc., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 306, 2007-Ohio-4917, 875 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 7. We examine the contract as a whole, which means that an endorsement is read as though it is within the policy. <em>Penn Traffic, </em>\u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 19} We have held that the duty to defend is broader than and distinct from the duty to indemnify. <em>Ohio Govt. Risk Mgt. Plan v. Harrison, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 241, 2007-Ohio-4948, 874 N.E.2d 1155, \u00b6 19. The duty to defend is determined by the scope of the allegations in the complaint. Id. If the allegations state a claim that potentially or arguably falls within the liability insurance coverage, then the insurer must defend the insured in the action. Id., \u00b6 19. But if all the claims are clearly and indisputably outside the contracted coverage, the insurer need not defend the insured. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Analysis of Exclusion Language</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 20} The plain language of the exclusion at issue precludes coverage for substantial-certainty intentional torts. The allegations within Ward\u2019s complaint fall within this exclusion. United agrees that if it is liable in the underlying case, Gulf has no duty to indemnify United. Thus, as the court of appeals below concluded, because all the claims are clearly and indisputably outside the contracted coverage, Gulf is not required to defend United under the terms of the policy. <em>Ward, </em>2010-Ohio-6694, \u00b6 82; <em>Ohio Govt. Risk Mgt., </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 21} Nevertheless, in the conflict case, the Third District Court of Appeals interpreted the identical language in a policy issued by a different company and concluded that the exclusion was ambiguous because it did not specify how or by whom the act or failure to act is to be determined. <em>Cooper Tire, </em>2007-Ohio-1905, 2007 WL 1175183, \u00b6 6. The Third District acknowledged that the policy specifically excluded liability for substantial-certainty intentional torts, but it reasoned that the language implied that there must be a determination by either a judge or jury for the exclusion to be enforceable. \u201cSince no judicial determination can be made prior to the conclusion of the case, [the insurer] may still have a duty to defend without the subsequent liability.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>{\u00b6 22} We do not agree with that reasoning. There is no language in the exclusion that implies that a determination by a fact-finder is required before the exclusion can be enforced. Furthermore, even if the phrase were ambiguous, the ambiguity would have no legal significance. There is no set of facts under which United would be covered under the CGL policy because all potential claims fall with the exclusion. Furthermore, the CGL policy provides that Gulf has \u201cno duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking damages * * * to which this insurance does not apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">{\u00b6 23} United argues that since the exclusion language uses the past tense\u2014 \u201can act which is <em>determined </em>to have been committed by you with the belief that an injury is substantially certain to occur\u201d \u2014 Gulf must provide a defense until it has been determined that the employer committed a tort that would be excluded by the policy language. We do not find this interpretation, which was accepted by the Third District in the conflict case, convincing.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 24} United contends that it intended to purchase insurance for substantial-certainty intentional torts and that if the stop-gap endorsement does not provide a defense or indemnification for substantial-certainty intentional torts, then the Gulf policy is illusory and unenforceable. Although the stop-gap endorsement may not have added the coverage that United intended, it did add coverage for \u201cemployer\u2019s liability hazards\u201d that were expressly excluded in the CGL policy: coverage for consequential bodily injury (claims by relatives of an employee for their injuries resulting as a consequence of the employee\u2019s injury), claims alleging liability under the dual-capacity doctrine (liability both as employer and in another capacity), and contribution or indemnification claims of third parties resulting from workplace injuries. When there is some benefit to the insured from the face of the endorsement, it is not an illusory contract. <em>State Auto. Ins. Co. v. Golden </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 674, 678, 709 N.E.2d 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 25} United contends that this was not the coverage it intended to purchase. But this is an argument for United to assert against the insurance agency and broker who procured the policy, not against the insurer. For purposes of this action, the plain language of the stop-gap endorsement that United purchased is plain, unambiguous, and not misleading, and the policy is not illusory.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 26} We answer the certified-eonflict question in the negative. An exclusion in a commercial general liability insurance policy or stop-gap endorsement stating that the insurance does not apply to bodily injury intentionally caused or aggravated by an insured, or bodily injury resulting from an act that is determined to have been committed by an insured with the belief that an injury is substantially certain to occur does not require a final determination by either a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>judge or a jury before the insurer can refuse to defend a claim alleging a substantial-certainty employer intentional tort.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASx\">Pelini, Campbell, Williams <em>&amp; </em>Traub, L.L.C., Craig G.
