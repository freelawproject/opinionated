Collier, to hold a de novo resentencing hearing to correct an error in a sentencing entry that allegedly violated Crim.R. 32(C). \u201c \u2018[T]he remedy for a failure to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) is a revised sentencing entry rather than a new hearing.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Scheck v. Collier, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 316, 2011-Ohio-233, 943 N.E.2d 1022, \u00b6 1, quoting <em>State ex rel. Alicea v. Krichbaum, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 194, 2010-Ohio-3234, 931 N.E.2d 1079, \u00b6 2. In addition, any error regarding the failure to hold a sentencing hearing before issuing a nunc pro tunc entry correcting the term of postrelease control could have been raised on appeal. <em>Scheck </em>at \u00b6 1. Finally, although Mack claims on appeal that he is entitled to a revised sentencing entry setting forth the manner of his conviction, his prayer for relief in his complaint was limited to a resentencing hearing. Mack thus waived this claim. See <em>State ex rel. Repository </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>v.
