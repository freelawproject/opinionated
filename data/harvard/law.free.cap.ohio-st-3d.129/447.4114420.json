S.Ct.Prac.R. 13.1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-11\">{\u00b6 2} Relator\u2019s legal claims lack merit, and the secretary of state\u2019s construction of the applicable statutory provisions is reasonable and is entitled to deference. See <em>State ex rel. Lucas Cty. Republican Party Exec. Commt. v. Brunner, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 427, 2010-Ohio-1873, 928 N.E.2d 1072, \u00b6 23. Part-petitions of compensated circulators are not improperly verified and subject to invalidation simply because the circulators, who might actually be independent contractors, listed the entity or individual engaging or paying them to circulate the petition as \u201cthe person employing\u201d them. See R.C. 3501.38(E)(1), 3519.05, and 3519.06.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AFI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>McTigue &amp; McGinnis, L.L.C., Donald J. McTigue, Mark A.

R.C. 3501.381(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, even if his challenge had substantive validity, Rothenberg\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that the part-petitions do not have enough signatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">{\u00b6 5} Based on the foregoing, we deny relator\u2019s challenge to the petition and the signatures contained therein. By so holding, we recognize, as we did in a previous case involving the proposed amendment, that \u201c[t]his result is consistent with our duty to liberally construe the citizens\u2019 right of initiative in favor of their exercise of this important right.\u201d See <em>State ex rel.
