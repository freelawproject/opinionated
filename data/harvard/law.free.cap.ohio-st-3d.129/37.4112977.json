Dehler, however, now resides at the Mansfield Correctional Institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">{\u00b6 2} The court of appeals concluded that allowing Dehler to personally inspect the requested records from his new location would be \u201cclose to impossible.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Collins, </em>Franklin App. No. 09AP-703, 2010-Ohio-5436, 2010 WL 4521997, \u00b6 10. Furthermore, providing Dehler with the requested records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>would have created security issues, unreasonably interfered with the officials\u2019 discharge of their duties, and violated prison rules. See id. at \u00b6 11-13; see also <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Spatny, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 312, 2010-Ohio-5711, 939 N.E.2d 831, \u00b6 5, and <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Kelly, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 309, 2010-Ohio-5724, 939 N.E.2d 828, \u00b6 3, citing <em>Briscoe v.

Rutherford, Assistant Attorney General, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">{\u00b6 3} Finally, Dehler was not entitled to copies of the requested records pursuant to the Public Records Act because he refused to submit prepayment for their cost. R.C. 149.43(B)(1) \u201cauthorizes a public office to require the prepayment of costs before providing copies of public records.\u201d <em>Spatny </em>at \u00b6 4; <em>Kelly </em>at \u00b6 2; <em>State ex rel.
