Boles, for a writ of habeas corpus. \u201cThe requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory, and failure to comply with them subjects an inmate\u2019s action to dismissal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. White v. Bechtel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 11, 2003-Ohio-2262, 788 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 5; <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. McDonnell, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 511, 2010-Ohio-4726, 935 N.E.2d 830, \u00b6 1. Boles\u2019s petition included an affidavit of indigency and sought waiver of prepayment of the court\u2019s filing fees, but failed to include in his affidavit of indigency a statement setting forth the balance in his inmate account for each of the preceding six months, as certified by the institutional cashier, in violation of R.C. 2969.25(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">{\u00b6 2} Boles instead sought leave to file a delayed R.C. 2969.25(C) statement, but delayed statements are not permitted by the statute. R.C. 2969.25(C); see also <em>Fuqua v. Williams, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 211, 2003-Ohio-5533, 797 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">{\u00b6 3} Boles asserts that this requirement is unconstitutional, but he fails to rebut the presumed constitutionality of R.C. 2969.25. See <em>Cleveland v. State, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 135, 2010-Ohio-6318, 942 N.E.2d 370, \u00b6 6 (statutes are presumed constitutional and will not be invalidated unless the challenger establishes that the legislation is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">{\u00b6 4} Boles further claims that an internal prison policy<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that has been in effect for over ten years prevented him from complying with the requirement of R.C. 2969.25(C) when he filed his habeas corpus petition. But Boles could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>forwarded his petition and other documents to be filed with the affidavit of indigency and cashier\u2019s certification to the cashier so that the cashier could have mailed all of the pertinent documents to the clerk of the Ross County Court of Appeals. The policy did not prevent Boles\u2019s compliance with the requirement.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxU\">Shawn R. Boles, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ah7\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Elizabeth A. Matune, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 5} Therefore, the court of appeals did not err in dismissing Boles\u2019s petition for failure to comply with R.C. 2969.25.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-14\">. According to Boles, the policy requires inmates to forward all in forma pauperis and indigency forms to the prison cashier along with an envelope addressed to the applicable court so that the cashier can sign the forms and the six-month certification of the inmate account and mail them directly to the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b365-19\">. We deny appellant\u2019s motion to strike appellee\u2019s merit brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
