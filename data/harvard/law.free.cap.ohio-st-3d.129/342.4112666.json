See <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. McDonnell, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 511, 2010-Ohio-4726, 935 N.E.2d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">{\u00b6 3} Moreover, Castro \u201chad an adequate remedy by way of direct appeal from his sentence to raise his claim that he did not receive proper notification about postrelease control at his sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Briseno v. Cook, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 38, 2009-Ohio-308, 901 N.E.2d 798, \u00b6 1. And Castro\u2019s sentencing entry \u201csufficiently included language that postrelease control was part of his sentence so as to afford him sufficient notice to raise any claimed error on appeal rather than by extraordinary writ.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Pruitt v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 402, 2010-Ohio-1808, 928 N.E.2d 722, \u00b6 4. Castro\u2019s sentencing entry constituted a final, appealable order, and he had an adequate remedy by way of appeal to raise his claims. <em>State ex rel. Tucker v.
