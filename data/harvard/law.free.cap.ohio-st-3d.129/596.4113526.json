R.C. 1751.60(A) states that every provider that contracts with a health-insuring corporation to provide health-care services to an insured shall seek payment solely from the corporation. Separately, we also are asked to decide whether R.C. 1751.60(A) conflicts with Ohio\u2019s law regarding the coordination of insurance benefits. We hold that R.C. 1751.60(A) applies only when a health-care provider seeks payment from an insured. We also hold, therefore, that R.C. 1751.60(A) does not conflict with Ohio\u2019s law on the coordination of insurance benefits. The coordination of multiple health-care-insurance payors is covered under R.C. 3902.11 et seq. and the rules promulgated pursuant to those statutes. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Sixth District Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee, Virginia King, was injured in an automobile accident on December 1, 2007, and was treated for her injuries at the Toledo Hospital. King informed the hospital admitting staff that she was covered by Aetna Health, Inc. and provided her health-insurance information to them. It is undisputed that appellants billed King\u2019s automobile insurer, Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois, for the services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In her complaint, King alleged personal damages and sought a class-action suit pursuant to Civ.R. 23 on behalf of all enrollees or subscribers<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> treated within the ProMedica Health System who were covered by a health-insuring corporation. King raised four causes of action: breach of contract, violation of public policy, violation of various sections of R.C. Chapter 1345 (the Consumer Sales Practices Act), and conversion. Each of these causes of action is based on the claim that the appellants violated R.C. 1751.60(A) by billing the automobile insurer instead of the health-insuring corporation. Appellants filed a motion to dismiss King\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court granted appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss. The court noted that King had not alleged that appellants sought compensation directly from her, the insured. The trial court found that King\u2019s claims, which were all based on a violation of R.C. 1751.60(A), failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">{\u00b6 6} King appealed, and the Sixth District Court of Appeals reversed. <em>King v. ProMedica Health Sys., Inc., </em>6th Dist. No. L-09-1282, 2010-Ohio-2578, 2010 WL 2299124. The court held that health-care providers that execute preferred-provider agreements with health-insuring corporations can bill only the health-insuring corporation subject to the agreement for covered services furnished to their insured and cannot bill any other potential payors. Id. at \u00b6 13. Appellants appealed the decision to this court. We granted discretionary jurisdiction to review appellants\u2019 second proposition of law. 126 Ohio St.3d 1597, 2010-Ohio-4928, 935 N.E.2d 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">{\u00b6 7} We are asked to determine the applicability of R.C. 1751.60(A). Appellants argue that the sole purpose of R.C. 1751.60(A) is to protect an insured patient from being billed for medical services when the health-care provider has contracted with the patient\u2019s health-insuring corporation to provide services to the corporation\u2019s insured. Appellants contend that the Sixth District misapplied R.C. 1751.60(A) when that court concluded that the statute prohibited appellants from seeking compensation from Safeco, which provided medical benefits as King\u2019s automobile insurer. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">{\u00b6 8} R.C. 1751.60(A) states, \u201cExcept as provided for in divisions (E) and (F) of this section, every provider or health care facility that contracts with a health insuring corporation to provide health care services to the health insuring corporation\u2019s enrollees or subscribers shall seek compensation for covered services solely from the health insuring corporation and not, under any circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>stances, from the enrollees or subscribers, except for approved-copayments and deductibles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">{\u00b6 9} By its express terms, R.C. 1751.60(A) governs providers or health-care facilities, health-insuring corporations, and a health-insuring corporation\u2019s insured. The statute is applicable only when there is a contract between a provider and a health-insuring corporation, and the provider seeks compensation for services rendered. The legislature expressed its intent that the provider must seek compensation solely from the health-insuring corporation and not from the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 10} It is undisputed that appellants never sought compensation from King. But King argues that her Safeco medical-benefit payments are an asset that belongs to her and that by seeking, medical-benefit payments available under the automobile policy, appellants essentially sought compensation from her. King\u2019s argument is unpersuasive. Under R.C. 1751.01(G), \u201c \u2018[cjompensation\u2019 means remuneration for the provision of health care services, determined on other than a fee-for-service or discounted-fee-for-service basis.\u201d Compensation by Safeco did not equate to compensation by King: by making the payment, Safeco fulfilled its contractual obligation to King to cover her medical costs in the event of an accident. When appellants received payment, they received it from Safeco. Because King was not asked to make any payment for the services she received, appellants did not violate R.C. 1751.60(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">{\u00b6 11} King also argues that appellants violated R.C. 1751.60(A) because they sought compensation from Safeco and not Aetna. King contends that the statutory language \u201cshall seek compensation for covered services solely from the health insuring corporation and not, under any circumstances, from the enrollees or subscribers\u201d means that all providers that contract with a health-insuring corporation relinquish their ability to seek compensation from any other parties and can collect payment from only the health-insuring corporation. The Sixth District agreed, finding that providers that execute preferred-provider agreements with health-insuring corporations can bill only the health-insuring corporation subject to the agreement for services furnished to an insured to the exclusion of any and all other potential payors. The Sixth District\u2019s reasoning relied on its construction of the word \u201csolely,\u201d defining it to mean \u201cto the exclusion of others.\u201d 2010-Ohio-2578, 2010 WL 2299124, at \u00b6 12. This interpretation, however, cannot be reconciled with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 12} R.C. 1751.60(A) has limited application. The statute addresses the contract between a provider and a health-insuring corporation. No other entities are mentioned in the statute. The statutory language allowing a provider to recover \u201csolely from the health insuring corporation and not, under any circumstances, from the enrollees or subscribers\u201d relates only to this contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>relationship. Here, the term \u201csolely\u201d does not have the meaning given to it by the Sixth District. Reading the word in this manner would impermissibly render the phrase \u201cand not, under any circumstances, from the enrollees or subscribers\u201d superfluous. Rather, the word \u201csolely\u201d is part of a phrase that defines the context of the statute; it means, in this context, to the exclusion of a health-insuring corporation\u2019s insured. This reading gives full meaning to every word of the statute. Read in context, the statute\u2019s language allowing a provider to seek compensation from the health-insuring corporation and not the insured is limited to the situation in which a health-care services contract is in place between a provider and a health-insuring corporation. Therefore, we hold that R.C. 1751.60(A) applies only when a provider seeks payment from a health-insuring corporation\u2019s insured with which the provider has entered into a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">{\u00b6 13} King\u2019s argument that appellants were not entitled to seek the medical-benefit payments is appropriately covered under R.C. 3902.11 et seq. and the rules promulgated pursuant to those statutes. Ohio\u2019s coordination-of-benefits laws apply when a provider seeks compensation from multiple insurers who are obligated to pay for health-care services rendered to an insured. R.C. 1751.60(A) concerns only a health-care provider\u2019s ability to seek compensation from a health-insuring corporation\u2019s insured, where the health-insuring corporation has a contract with the provider, and therefore does not apply to coordination of benefits and does not conflict with R.C. 3902.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 14} Appellants did not seek compensation from King. Thus, King fails to show that appellants violated R.C. 1751.60(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 15} Because King failed to show that appellants sought compensation from her, she failed to establish a violation of R.C. 1751.60(A). Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order dismissing King\u2019s complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b741-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and Cupp, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b741-10\">Pfeifer, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b739-10\">.

It does not mean \u201cunless you can get paid closer to your top rate through an injured patient\u2019s automobile-insurance policy.\u201d Applying the usual meaning to the word \u201csolely\u201d does not, as the majority states, render the phrase \u201cand not, under any circumstances, from the enrollees or subscribers\u201d superfluous. This is because of still another phrase, \u201cexcept for approved copayments and deductibles.\u201d Read as a whole, R.C. 1751.60(A) requires providers that have contracted with a health-insurance corporation to seek payment from only the health-insurance corporation, except for copayments and deductibles, which may be billed to enrollees or subscribers.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 18} When a patient\u2019s other insurance is not dissipated through direct billing by health-care providers, the patient can use that other insurance to pay copayments, deductibles, or for treatment options excluded from the health-insurance corporation\u2019s coverage. An automobile-insurance policy that includes medical coverage is an asset of the patient \u2014 when a provider seeks compensation from that policy, it seeks compensation from the patient in violation of R.C. 1751.60(A).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
