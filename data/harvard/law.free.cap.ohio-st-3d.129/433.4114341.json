Although he was served with the complaint, he did not file an answer or otherwise respond to it. A master commissioner appointed by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline granted relator\u2019s motion for default, making findings of fact and misconduct and recommending that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for one year with one year of probation following reinstatement, including the appointment of a monitor in accordance with Gov.Bar R. V(9)(B). The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law but recommended a two-year suspension with the second year stayed for monitored probation. This court issued an order to show cause why the recommendation of the board should not be accepted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>{\u00b6 3} Respondent responded to the show-cause order, seeking leave to introduce mitigating evidence that he sustained a traumatic brain injury while serving in the Navy Reserve Judge Advocate General\u2019s Corps and that he suffered from posttraumatic-stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d) as a result of his active military service. He also objected to the board\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 4} After oral argument, we remanded the matter to the board to receive and consider evidence regarding respondent\u2019s health conditions, and the board appointed a panel to comply with our order. As a result of those proceedings, the board issued a revised recommendation that respondent be suspended for two years with 18 months stayed on conditions, and respondent has once again filed objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 5} We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct because the record clearly and convincingly demonstrates that respondent (1) failed to notify his client that he did not carry malpractice insurance, (2) neglected that client\u2019s legal matter, (3) failed to communicate with the client regarding the status of her case, and (4) led the client to believe that her case was still pending after it had been dismissed for failure to prosecute. Because we accord greater weight to respondent\u2019s mitigating mental-health issues, however, we suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year but stay the entire suspension on conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 6} During its investigation, relator deposed respondent and the grievant. The deposition testimony demonstrates that in April 2006, respondent filed a complaint on the grievant\u2019s behalf in the Butler County Court of Common Pleas. Although respondent received notice of and participated in a mediation session and unsuccessfully opposed defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw as counsel, he failed to submit a pretrial statement or appear at the scheduled pretrial on August 30, 2007. And in September 2007, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 7} When respondent learned of the dismissal, he advised the grievant that she did not need to appear for trial, without explaining that her case had been dismissed. From September to December 2007, when-the grievant called respondent to discuss her case, he told her that he would send her something in the mail, but he never did. In December 2007, the grievant received a statement of court costs due and learned for the first time that her complaint had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 8} Respondent admitted that he had failed to advise the grievant that he did not carry malpractice insurance but advanced various excuses for his neglect, including the misdirection of his mail by the court, an office move, and an illness. He offered no documentary evidence to corroborate his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>{\u00b6 9} In its December 18, 2009 report granting relator\u2019s motion for default and in its December 9, 2010 report on remand, the board found that respondent had violated DR 1-104 and Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(c) (both requiring a lawyer to inform the client if the lawyer does not maintain professional-liability insurance), DR 6-101(A)(3) and Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 (both requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client), Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to keep the client reasonably informed about the status of a matter), Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(a)(4) (requiring a lawyer to comply as soon as practicable with reasonable requests for information from the client), and DR 1-102(A)(4) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (both prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation). We adopt these findings of fact and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 10} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">{\u00b6 11} As aggravating factors, the board found that respondent had committed multiple ethical violations, had harmed his client, and had failed to cooperate in the disciplinary proceedings and that his failure to notify his client that her case had been dismissed was deceitful. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(d), (e), and (h). Although respondent testified that he suffered from depression, he did not substantiate his testimony with any medical records or testimony from his treating professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 12} On remand, the panel appointed to receive and consider evidence regarding respondent\u2019s health conditions conducted a hearing, at which it heard respondent\u2019s testimony regarding his traumatic brain injury and PTSD, but neither party introduced any medical evidence regarding those conditions. Consequently, the board ordered respondent to submit to an independent psychiatric examination to determine if he suffered from mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 13} Citing the report of the independent psychiatric evaluator, Douglas Beech, M.D., the panel reluctantly found that respondent\u2019s diagnosed mental-health condition qualified as a mitigating factor pursuant to BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g), observing that \u201chis attitude seemed to be \u2018to deny all wrongdoing, but if you don\u2019t believe me, then I suffer from a mental disability that accounts for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>my actions.\u2019 \u201d While the board again recommended a two-year suspension from the practice of law, it concluded that 18 months of that suspension (rather than the 12 months it had previously recommended) be stayed on conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 14} Respondent objects to the board\u2019s report and, citing Dr. Beech\u2019s conclusion that he did not timely defend himself due to his mental-health conditions, seeks an opportunity to address the merits of the underlying grievance. Specifically, respondent argues that his client\u2019s case was reinstated by the trial court based upon certain falsehoods committed by the defendant to the action and that his client later obtained a default judgment in her favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 15} We have stated that we grant remands to supplement the record \u201conly under the most exceptional circumstances.\u201d See <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. Stephan, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 327, 2006-Ohio-1063, 843 N.E.2d 771, \u00b65. We have already remanded this matter once to permit respondent to submit mitigating evidence of his mental disability. As a result of that remand, the record now contains evidence that his mental-health conditions played a significant role in his failure to timely respond to relator\u2019s complaint. The alleged misdeeds of the defendant in the underlying civil case cannot excuse respondent\u2019s deceit, failure to keep his client informed about the status of her case, failure to respond to her reasonable requests for information, and failure to timely seek relief from the judgment dismissing her case, all of which have been proven by clear and convincing evidence. Nor can they excuse his admitted failure to inform the client that he did not carry malpractice insurance. Because respondent has not demonstrated any exceptional circumstances warranting a second remand, we overrule this objection and adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 16} In the alternative, respondent seeks a fully stayed suspension based upon the successful and ongoing treatment of his PTSD, depression, and traumatic brain injury, combined with the measures he has taken to safeguard his practice and the appointment of a practice monitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 17} After reading the record in this case, reviewing respondent\u2019s medical records, and interviewing and examining respondent, Dr. Beech submitted a report to the panel. In that report, he found:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c[Respondent] began receiving treatment in 2002 following an incident of trauma while working overseas in the Navy reserves. The helicopter he was a passenger in made a crash landing on a naval vessel and he suffered a head injury and loss of consciousness as a result. Preceding the crash was a period of intense anxiety as a realistic threat of death existed as a result of the tenuous circumstances. He subsequently experienced a depressive episode and substantial anxiety. Over ensuing months he developed classic symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (traumatic re-experiencing [\u2018flashbacks\u2019], phobic avoidance, night terrors, insomnia, and generalized anxiety). He was initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>prescribed the antidepressant Celexa which was helpful for depressive symptoms and anxiety. He subsequently underwent individual psychotherapy for PTSD symptoms which was very helpful to him as well. Though the symptoms of depression and PTSD have fluctuated and still persist, his symptoms have been generally well-managed, exacerbated in times of increased external stress. His depression has been moderately worse in the past year, as the recent revelations about additional injuries and impairments have led him to feel more depressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAdditionally [respondent] was evaluated last year at the [Veterans Health Administration] medical center and diagnosed as having residual cognitive deficits attributable to a traumatic brain injury. He has been engaged in treatment and rehabilitation there to better define his cognitive deficits and maximize his strengths.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 20} Dr. Beech found that respondent\u2019s PTSD and depression played a significant role in his failure to timely respond to relator\u2019s complaint and, to a lesser extent, contributed to his underlying misconduct. He concluded that by combining outpatient treatment and pharmacological management with a reduced caseload and the appointment of a practice monitor, respondent could continue to practice law in a safe and responsible manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 21} We are ever mindful that the primary purpose of the disciplinary process is not to punish the offender but to protect the public from lawyers who are unworthy of the trust and confidence essential to the attorney-client relationship. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Agopian, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 103, 2006-Ohio-6510, 858 N.E.2d 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 22} Since respondent was first diagnosed with depression, PTSD, and traumatic brain injury, he has received substantial treatment. He has taken a prescribed antidepressant, participated in individual psychotherapy, and participated in various forms of rehabilitation, including speech therapy and mental exercises to improve his memory. Recognizing the seriousness of his conditions, respondent has also taken significant measures to ensure that his cognitive deficits will not have any negative effect on his clients. He has reduced the number of clients that he represents, uses a recorder, takes notes, and communicates with his clients by e-mail as much as possible. He has also limited the scope of his practice to domestic relations, general litigation, and labor law.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 23} This is the first disciplinary action that respondent has faced in his more than 30 years of practice, and it involves respondent\u2019s conduct with respect to a single client matter. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) (providing that absence of a prior disciplinary record is a factor that may be considered in favor of a lesser sanction). And having observed respondent\u2019s reasoned and articulate presentation at oral argument, we find his expressions of remorse and contrition to be genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>{\u00b6 24} Taking into account respondent\u2019s diagnoses, his treatment, and his remedial actions, we do not believe that an actual suspension is necessary to protect the public from future harm. Moreover, at oral argument, both of the parties agreed that a two-year suspension, all stayed on conditions, would adequately protect the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 25} In <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Lowden, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 377, 2005-Ohio-2162, 826 N.E.2d 836, \u00b6 4, 7, we disciplined an attorney who had neglected two separate client matters, failed to carry out his contract of professional employment in those matters, and failed to cooperate in the resulting disciplinary investigations. He had also falsely signed a client\u2019s name on four support schedules, notarized them as genuine, and filed them with the domestic relations court. Id. at \u00b6 2. Although we recognized that a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) generally requires an actual suspension from the practice of law for the public\u2019s protection, we observed that \u201cBCGD Proe.Reg. 10(B)(2)(g) permits us to temper the sanction we impose for a lawyer\u2019s dishonesty to a client and court upon proof that mental disability caused the misconduct, under some circumstances.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 19. Citing as a mitigating factor the attorney\u2019s documented bipolar disorder and his willingness to commit to treatment, we imposed a two-year, fully stayed suspension on the condition that he continue his mental-health treatment and provide quarterly reports to relator during the stay. Id. at \u00b6 20-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 26} Unlike <em>Lowden, </em>which involved two separate client matters, this is a case of a respondent\u2019s first disciplinary action in an otherwise unblemished 30-year legal career, and it involves a single client matter. Moreover, as noted previously, respondent\u2019s conduct was born of his extensive mental-health problems, and his reasoned and articulate presentation at oral argument persuaded this court that his expressions of remorse and contrition are genuine.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, we adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct but suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio for one year, with the entire suspension stayed on the conditions that he (1) serve one year of probation to be supervised by a monitor appointed by relator in accordance with Gov.Bar R. V(9), (2) limit his practice to domestic relations,, general litigation, and labor law (a condition imposed at his own request), (3) continue to follow the recommendations of his treating professionals, including ongoing pharmacological management by his treating physician, and (4) commit no further misconduct. If respondent fails to comply with these conditions, the stay will be lifted, and respondent will serve the entire one-year suspension. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-9\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b581-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b581-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger and Cupp, JJ., would order a two-year suspension from the practice of law, all stayed on conditions.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b575-13\">.

Relator charged respondent with misconduct under applicable rales for acts occurring before and after February 1, 2007, the effective date of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which supersede the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Although both the former and current rules are cited for the same acts, the allegations comprise a single continuing ethical violation. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v.

This case is symbolic of the problem many veterans face as they return from war with TBI/PTSD. Too often, the medical community fails to recognize how TBI differs from PTSD, to distinguish between the physical and psychological symptoms of TBI, and to appreciate that although TBI has psychological symptoms, it is a medical condition with real consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 29} American service members have sacrificed greatly, most recently in the battles in Afghanistan and Iraq. More than 1.6 million American service members have deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom, and over 565,000 have deployed more than once. National Council on Disability, Invisible Wounds: Serving Service Members and Veterans with PTSD and TBI (Mar. 4, 2009) 1, 8, available at http://www.ncd.gov/ newsroom/publications/2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">{\u00b6 30} Many of our veterans who have returned are still fighting the psychological effects of war. Id. An estimated 25 to 40 percent of returning veterans have psychological and neurological injuries associated with PTSD or TBI, which have been called the \u201csignature injuries\u201d of the Iraq war. Christopher Munsey, A Long Road Back (June 2007), 38 Monitor on Psychology 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cIt is common to make a distinction between visible injuries such as orthopedic injuries, burns, and shrapnel wounds and less visible injuries such as PTSD. The distinction often is characterized as \u2018physical\u2019 versus \u2018mental\u2019 injuries. These terms imply that PTSD somehow is not physical. However, this is an artificial distinction. PTSD and other \u2018mental illnesses\u2019 are characterized by measurable changes in the brain and in the hormonal and immune systems.\u201d Invisible Wounds at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-11\">Definition of PTSD/TBI</p>\n<p id=\"b581-12\">\n<em>Posttrcmmatic-Stress Disorder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-13\">{\u00b6 32} The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th Ed.2000), the publication that defines the criteria used in diagnosing mental disorders, classifies PTSD as an anxiety disorder that arises from \u201cexposure to an extreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>traumatic stressor involving direct personal experience of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one\u2019s physical integrity; or witnessing an event that involves death, injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of another person.\u201d Id., 463, Section 309.81. According to current estimates, between 10 and 30 percent of service members will develop PTSD within a year of leaving combat. When depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and substance abuse are considered, the number increases to between 16 and 49 percent. Invisible Wounds at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\n<em>Traumatic Brain Injury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 33} TBI, which is a medical diagnosis rather than a psychological diagnosis, is a \u201ctraumatically-induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: (1) Any period of loss, or a decreased level, of consciousness. (2) Any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury. (3) Any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.). , (4) Neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient.

A Long Road Back, 38 Monitor on Psychology 34. However, in respondent\u2019s case, the injuries were caused when the helicopter he was in crashed into a naval vessel while attempting to land on the vessel in the Indian Ocean.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cSome surveys indicate that between 10 and 20 percent of soldiers returning from deployments might have suffered a mild TBI.\u201d Id. The military estimates that one-fifth of the troops with these mild injuries will have prolonged \u2014 even lifelong \u2014 symptoms requiring continuing care. They may have cognitive issues such as difficulty in thinking, memory problems, attention deficit, mood swings, frustrations, headaches, fatigue, or many other symptoms.

Respondent described the trauma in this way in his response to our January 2010 show-cause order:</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cIn early February 2002 I transited from USS Bainbridge to USS Peterson in the Indian Ocean off Somalia at maximum range with no reciprocal fuel supply. The seas and winds were very bad and the Captain at first would not allow us to try to land. We circled the ship for over an hour to exhaust our fuel to minimize the possibility of fire. I was terrified by the prospect of crashing into the sea if we could not land on the ship.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cWhen we finally tried to land the wind caused us to come out of line and the ship came up and hit the helicopter. It was at a minimum a very rough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>landing in which I struck my head, losing consciousness. Afterward I fell down in my quarters and vomited. Once we got to the Seychelles I got a hotel room so I could recover. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cI have been troubled by night terrors from the middle of February 2002 until the present, although they are less frequent. Whenever I was home from overseas assignment my family noticed serious problems I was having sleeping, working and adjusting in general. I finally sought psychological counseling * * * [and was diagnosed with] Post Traumatic Stress disorder following a depression diagnosis by my primary care physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cSince discovering these conditions I have altered my practice by hiring my daughter as a paralegal to aid me in staying organized and managing my time. I also underwent speech therapy. The YA doctor also identified nerve damage to the left side of my body and face, caused by the helicopter accident. Further, I am currently in the eighth week of a twelve-week cognitive therapy regimen at the PTSD clinic in Ft. Thomas, Kentucky. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cAll of these recent revelations have been very depressing. I know I should have been engaged in addressing the issues before the Grievance Commission, but I felt overwhelmed and was unable to deal with it. The PTSD therapy is helping me to cope with these personal matters. I am truly sorry that I did not do all that I should have done in responding to the committee. If given the chance I will cooperate fully and submit to any physical or psychological testing requested of me. I will provide whatever medical records not [sic] already provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cI apologize to both the Commissioners and this Court for my condition leading to my recent lack of responsiveness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-9\">{\u00b6 48} In addition to respondent\u2019s description, according to a case-management and biopsychosocial assessment, after respondent\u2019s accident, he reported that he had lost consciousness for a few minutes and was dazed, confused, and disoriented after he regained consciousness. Further, respondent reportedly experienced the onset of headaches after he resumed consciousness, and he noticed a knot of tissue at the right rear side of his scalp. Respondent was evacuated from the helicopter, briefly evaluated, and given some Tylenol. He experienced ringing in his ears after the impact and later experienced difficulty reading and using computers.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-10\">{\u00b6 49} Respondent\u2019s medical records indicate that he had recently screened positive for postconcussion syndrome due to TBI, secondary to an incident involving a helicopter and a ship at sea to which he had been deployed to conduct a Navy investigation. Respondent also had reported that he had noticed difficul<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>ty reading and difficulty using computers after he sustained the concussion. In addition, respondent reported that he noticed new-onset difficulty remembering written testimony during that investigation at sea. He further reported problems in remembering appointments, performing \u201cto-do\u201d items, remembering people he speaks with, and remembering the content of his reading. He also reported headaches, including symptoms entirely new after the helicopter incident at sea.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">{\u00b6 50} In October 2009, respondent reported that in the preceding month, he had experienced disturbing memories, thoughts, or images of his stressful experience, disturbing dreams of the stressful experience, feeling upset when something reminded him of the stressful experience, having physical reactions when something reminded him of the stressful experience, avoiding thinking about or talking about the stressful experience, avoiding activities or situations that reminded him of the stressful experience, loss of interest in activities he used to enjoy, feeling distant or cut off from other people, trouble falling or staying asleep, difficulty concentrating, feeling jumpy or easily startled, and being \u201csuperalert\u201d or watchful or on guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Remand for Consideration of Evidence Regarding Respondent\u2019s Health Conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">{\u00b6 51} As noted by the majority opinion, in March 2010, this court ordered that this matter be remanded to the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline for consideration of evidence to be submitted by the parties regarding respondent\u2019s health conditions. On remand, the examining psychiatrist, Douglas Beech, M.D., issued a four-and-a-half-page report based on his one-hour-and-forty-five-minute interview with and examination of respondent. Based on available data and on a current psychiatric evaluation, as stated in his November 8, 2010 report, Dr. Beech diagnosed respondent with major depressive disorder, recurrent, in remission, and PTSD, chronic, in partial remission. In addition, Dr. Beech diagnosed TBI and trauma-related neuropathy.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">{\u00b6 52} Although Dr. Beech noted in his report that he had been retained to evaluate respondent\u2019s mental health, he devoted very little of his report to addressing respondent\u2019s TBI. In fact, in the four-and-a-half-page report, he acknowledged TBI in only three sentences, including the following: \u201cAdditionally, Mr. Minamyer was evaluated last year at the YA medical center and diagnosed as having some residual cognitive deficits attributable to a traumatic brain injury. He has been engaged in treatment and rehabilitation there to better define his cognitive deficits and maximize his strengths.\u201d Dr. Beech performed no meaningful analysis of the effects of TBI on respondent\u2019s practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 53} In fact, Dr. Beech concluded: \u201c[Although Mr. Minamyer does have two significant mental disorders, his mental health difficulties likely played only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>modest role in the alleged misconduct in his handling of the [client] matter. To whatever degree he was neglectful of his duties in the case, his conditions likely played a contributory, but not a primary role. The most significant role played by his conditions was his avoidance of responding to the complaint in a timely manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">{\u00b6 54} Correspondingly, it appears that respondent\u2019s lack of response to the complaint in a timely manner was much of the focus of the June 28, 2010 hearing before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline. Rather than addressing how respondent\u2019s health and mental-health diagnoses affected his practice of law, the hearing seemed to focus more on the consternation of the panel and the relator regarding respondent\u2019s initial lack of participation in the disciplinary process.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 55} Relator\u2019s counsel asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t it fair to say also that you, through your behavior, have obstructed our Bar Association from investigating these very facts by failing to cooperate in the initial litigation and in the litigation after the remand?\u201d When respondent noted that he was not trying to hide that he had engaged in irresponsible behavior, but that the reason for that behavior was the TBI and the PTSD, relator\u2019s counsel asked: \u201cAnd would you agree that the consequences of that behavior was our inability to investigate the very things that you\u2019re talking about here today?\u201d Respondent answered, \u201cWell, that\u2019s true, but that\u2019s kind of circular. Because the mental condition, itself, is the cause of the problem being able to investigate the mental condition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 56} The transcript records the ensuing exchange:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">{\u00b6 57} \u201cQ [relator\u2019s counsel]. * * * Would you agree with me that your failure to participate in the initial litigation in the Supreme Court prevented us from investigating the very things that you\u2019re talking about here today?</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cA [respondent]. No, because I offered to give you a release at our last meeting, and you never asked for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cQ. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cA. And I gave you all the medical records that I had up till that point. So even if, you know, you had everything that was available at the time, and I had offered to give you access to everything I\u2019ve \u2014 every medical record I\u2019ve ever had.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cQ. So says you. But, again, you\u2019re a lawyer, so you know we have an adversarial system, right?</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">\u2022 {\u00b6 62} \u201cA. Are you denying it, that I said that to you in the Supreme Court room?</p>\n<p id=\"b586-13\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cQ. I\u2019m asking questions, and I\u2019m asking for your answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-14\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cA. Well, but you\u2019re asking a question that assumes something that\u2019s not really true, and you know it.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>{\u00b6 65} \u201cQ. You provided us stuff, but have we been able to dig in and do our own investigation? Have we been able to do that?</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cA. You could have.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cQ. Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 68} The panel\u2019s and board\u2019s further irritation with respondent\u2019s lack of involvement with the disciplinary process is indicated by relator\u2019s response to respondent\u2019s response to the show-cause order: \u201cHe minimizes his conduct and refuses to take responsibility for his actions. The language in the December 18, 2009 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Recommendation by the hearing panel is on target: \u2018The panel found Respondent unwilling to take responsibility for his conduct. Respondent had an excuse for everything, and his attitude seemed to be \u201cto deny all wrongdoing, but if you don\u2019t believe me, then I suffer from a mental disability that accounts for my actions.\u201d \u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b587-8\">{\u00b6 69} In my view, respondent\u2019s mental-health issues were not fully and thoroughly considered initially or on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">{\u00b6 70} In the words of an injured veteran, \u201c \u2018The war is done for me now. The days of standing in the hot desert sun, setting up ambushes on the sides of mountains and washing the blood from my friend\u2019s gear are over. The battles with bombs, bullets, and blood are a thing of the past. I still constantly fight a battle that rages inside my head.\u2019 Brian McGough, a 32-year-old Army staff sergeant whose convoy was attacked with IEDs in 2006. From his blog \u2018Inside My Broken Skull.\u2019 \u201d Invisible Wounds at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">{\u00b6 71} The intent of this court in remanding this case was for consideration of evidence to be submitted by the parties regarding respondent\u2019s health conditions. Dr. Beech\u2019s scant treatment of the issue in his letter to the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline is not helpful to our decision-making but is illustrative of what is often the medical community\u2019s inadequate treatment of these issues. The psychiatrist\u2019s report and the findings of the board show a clear lack of understanding and appreciation of the effects of PTSD/TBI on respondent\u2019s behavior. Indeed, his failure to deal with the charges is interpreted as deliberate, when in fact it is one of the very symptoms of his injuries. I write in the hopes of bringing a greater understanding to the judicial system of these relatively new issues that we will continue to confront as more veterans return from war with these injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-12\">{\u00b6 72} I believe that the examining psychiatrist failed in his duty to adequately address the effects of respondent\u2019s PTSD/TBI on his fitness to practice law and that the board failed to understand and appreciate the effects of PTSD and TBI on respondent\u2019s behavior and his ability to cope.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>{\u00b6 73} Respondent has taken action, to treat his injuries. He has been undergoing treatment through the Department of Veterans Affairs for his visible and nonvisible injuries. He has been working on his gait. He has been working with a speech therapist at the VA. In addition, because he had been having difficulty putting sentences together, he went back to school to rehabilitate his mental processes. In his law office, he has cut back on the time he spends at his practice, has not taken on new clients, and has his daughter assist him in law-office management.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 74} Because the human brain is so complicated, it is extremely difficult to predict the long-term effects of any TBI. Most cases of mild TBI will resolve over time with minimal problems. In the case of more serious TBIs, a person can experience any number of changes over the course of months and years. http://www.brainline.org/content/2008/08/frequently-asked-questions.html.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cA number of factors, including Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score, age, pupillary response and size, hypoxia, hyperthermia, and high intracranial pressure, may play an important role in predicting the outcome of traumatic brain injury. Eight hundred forty-six cases of severe traumatic brain injury (GCS \u00bf8) were analyzed retrospectively to clarify the effects of multiple factors on the prognosis of patients. At 1 year after injury, the outcomes in these cases were as follows: good recovery, 31.56%; moderate disability, 14.07%; severe disability 24.35%; vegetative status, 0.59%; and death, 29.43%.\u201d Ji-Yao Jiang, Guo-Yi Gao, Wei-Ping Li, Ming-Kun Yu, and Cheng Zhu, Early Indicators of Prognosis in 846 Cases of Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (July 2002), 19 Journal of Neurotrauma 869, abstract available at http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10. 1089/08977150260190456.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 76} With proper treatment, such as that which respondent has been seeking, people with PTSD/TBI can improve the way their brain functions, and they can often reclaim the portions of their lives that were affected by their injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 77} This is respondent\u2019s first disciplinary action in an otherwise unblemished 30-year legal career. Based on the facts of this case, the single incident of misconduct and the extensive mental-health mitigation, I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year with the entire suspension stayed on conditions. Further, because respondent has been actively engaged in treatment and because we can monitor his progress through a stayed suspension, I concur in the monitored-probation portion of the sanction but would hope that the monitoring of his compliance is done with a full appreciation and understanding of his wounds of war.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AcMc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Bennett A.
