(\u201cWCI\u201d) appeals from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), which dismissed WCI\u2019s appeal on the authority of <em>Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Levin, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212. The BTA held that when judged under the standards articulated in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>WCI\u2019s notice of appeal to the BTA failed to specify any error and thereby failed to vest jurisdiction in the BTA to consider the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On appeal, WCI argues that the BTA misconstrued <em>Ohio Bell. </em>WCI argues that it sufficiently specified error and that it was entitled to present, for the first time at the BTA hearing, an appraisal prepared by AccuVal Associates, Inc. as part of its claim for reduced valuation of its manufacturing machinery and equipment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">{\u00b6 3} First, we follow our precedents holding that a notice of appeal from an assessment in which the tax commissioner has determined the value of personal property invokes the jurisdiction of the BTA to review that determination if the notice (1) states the appellant\u2019s objection to the commissioner\u2019s actions in valuing the property and (2) identifies the treatment that the commissioner should have applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">{\u00b6 4} Moreover, the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction in the appeal permitted it to consider the appraisal report and testimony that WCI presented for the first time at the BTA hearing. Our precedents establish that the BTA is statutorily authorized to receive evidence in addition to that considered by the tax commissioner, and we hold that such evidence may include different valuation approaches from those presented to the tax commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 5} In this regard, we hold that our decision in <em>Ohio Bell </em>is inapposite. The different approaches to the valuation of personal property set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-10(B) are not \u201calternate valuation methods\u201d as that term is used in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>and accordingly, the notice of appeal need not specify that the appellant will present a different valuation approach to the Board of Tax Appeals than it presented in the proceedings before the tax commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 6} Because the BTA applied <em>Ohio Bell </em>to a situation in which it should not have been applied, we reverse and remand with the instruction that the BTA decide this case on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 7} WCI Steel, Inc. is a steelmaker in northeast Ohio. For tax year 2001, WCI reported that its manufacturing machinery and equipment (\u201cM &amp; E\u201d) had a value (in accordance with the tax commissioner\u2019s prescribed valuation method) of $84 million. For tax year 2002, the reported value of the M &amp; E was just under $90 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">{\u00b6 8} Testimony at the BTA hearing indicated that 2001 was a terrible year financially for the steel industry generally and was WCI\u2019s worst financial year: WCI lost $100 million. In 2002, WCI lost $37 million. In September 2003, WCI filed for bankruptcy reorganization.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">{\u00b6 9} In connection with its business troubles, WCI decided to seek a lower valuation of its business property \u2014 in particular, the M <em>&amp; </em>E used in steel manufacturing. In May 2003, a WCI representative made a presentation to tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>department representatives. WCI presented a study apparently predicated primarily on comparable sales, although the study did discuss obsolescence. According to the commissioner\u2019s agent, the study compared the valuation of WCI\u2019s assets per ton of production capacity with that of five other steel producers and recommended \u2014 based on the comparison \u2014 that a lower value be assigned to WCI\u2019s own M &amp; E. The report recommended a total value of all WCI\u2019s property at $85 million for 2003, with retrospective valuation adjustments for 2002 and 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 10} In accordance with the study, WCI valued its M &amp; E for tax year 2003 at just under $30 million. WCI filed applications for final assessment pursuant to R.C. 5711.26 to obtain similar lower valuation for 2001 and 2002. The tax commissioner ultimately rejected the study based primarily on the conclusion of the tax commissioner\u2019s agent that the sales were not comparable, because WCI was more of a special-job steelmaker than a general steelmaker.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 11} During the proceedings before the commissioner, WCI\u2019s claim for reduction of the value of M &amp; E was reviewed and analyzed as a claim for an impairment of asset value \u2014 indeed, the audit remarks characterized WCI\u2019s claim as a claim for asset impairment. Correspondence filed on behalf of WCI during the proceedings before the commissioner acknowledged the commissioner\u2019s interest in whether WCI ought to recognize an impairment on its books for its M <em>&amp; </em>E, given the reduced valuation it sought from the commissioner. Ah earlier audit by the accounting firm KPMG had indicated that accounting standards did not require WCI to record an impairment for fiscal year 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">{\u00b6 12} After WCI\u2019s bankruptcy filing, WCI commissioned an appraisal of its assets from Nationwide Consulting Company, Inc. As a result of that appraisal, WCI did record an impairment. The tax commissioner\u2019s agent reviewed a portion of that appraisal, and the tax commissioner\u2019s witness at the BTA hearing stated, \u201c[W]e saw parts of it and then did not agree with the method.\u201d The tax agent apparently asked for, but was denied, access to a portion of the analysis supporting the claim of impairment. On the other hand, the commissioner\u2019s agent did note in an addendum to the audit that the Nationwide Consulting appraisal of \u201cfair market value in continued use\u201d did consider a combination of cost approach, market-comparison approach, and income approach \u2014 with emphasis on the market-comparison approach \u201cwhen sufficient data was available\u201d \u2014 to arrive at a value of $83,316,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 13} Although the commissioner suggests that the Nationwide Consulting appraisal relied exclusively on a sales-comparison approach and that the appraisal found income and cost approaches inapplicable, the page that the commissioner cites appears to address the value of the realty, not the M <em>&amp; </em>E.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 14} The present case involves not one but three tax years: 2001, 2002, and 2003. WCI was a fiscal-year taxpayer: it listed its personal property value as of the last day of its preceding fiscal year, which is October 31, rather than as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year. See R.C. 5711.03 and 5711.101; Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-04. Thus, WCI\u2019s personal property was valued as of October 31, 2000, for tax year 2001; as of October 31, 2001, for tax year 2002; and as of October 31, 2002, for tax year 2003. Procedurally, the 2001 and 2002 tax years were placed at issue when WCI filed an application for final assessment. For tax year 2003, WCI filed its return using a lower valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 15} The commissioner denied the relief WCI sought for 2001, 2002, and 2003. In doing so, the commissioner issued final-assessment certificates pursuant to R.C. 5711.26 but did not formally articulate the grounds for his decision in a final determination. WCI appealed the final assessment to the BTA. In the second assignment of error in its notice of appeal to the BTA, WCI did the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 16} (1) identified the categories of personal property at issue,</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 17} (2) reiterated that the value previously asserted by the taxpayer was correct,</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 18} (3) stated that the commissioner\u2019s determination \u201creflects property being valued as a percentage of its original cost using the Tax Commissioner\u2019s composite annual allowance procedure\u201d and contended that the true value of its property did not exceed the values requested by WCI, and</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">{\u00b6 19} (4) cited the pertinent statutes and administrative rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">{\u00b6 20} WCI presented testimony and exhibits at an evidentiary hearing before the BTA. Most prominently, WCI presented the appraisal prepared by AccuVal Associates, Inc., which the commissioner has characterized as primarily a \u201creplacement cost new\u201d study.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">{\u00b6 21} The AccuVal appraisal expressed an opinion of the value of WCI\u2019s M &amp; E for 2003, 2002, and 2001 by determining its replacement cost and then making adjustments to that figure. First, AccuVal computed and subtracted depreciation by both physical deterioration and functional obsolescence. Second, AccuVal subtracted a large amount for economic obsolescence based on a computation of business-enterprise value. Third, AccuVal made an adjustment derived from a sales-comparison approach and thereby arrived at its estimate of true value. The primary focus was the 2003 tax year (value as of October 31, 2002), and the study then trended backward to determine values for the previous two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">{\u00b6 22} After this court issued its decision in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>the BTA solicited briefs from the parties on the issue whether the decision affected the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>in the present case. Ultimately, the BTA determined that WCI\u2019s appeal must be dismissed on the authority of <em>Ohio Bell </em>because its notice of appeal failed to specify error. WCI timely appealed to this court. We now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 23} Because the \u201claw of Ohio requires that personal property used in business be taxed at its true value,\u201d and because \u201cit is impractical for the Department of Taxation to personally value all such personal property in the state,\u201d we have held that it is reasonable and lawful for the commissioner to develop a method of \u201cdepreciating the cost of the personal property in accordance with its useful life.\u201d <em>W.L. Harper Co. v. Peck </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 300, 303, 53 O.O. 178, 118 N.E.2d 643. The commissioner\u2019s method, known as the \u201c302 computation,\u201d consists of industry-specific composite annual allowances by which categories of business assets are depreciated from cost, and this court has approved the 302 computation \u201cas a practical, reasonable and lawful method and device to achieve uniform valuation of plant equipment in Ohio by prescribing annual depreciation rates in lieu of book depreciation for Ohio personal property tax purposes.\u201d <em>PPG Industries, Inc. v. Kosydar </em>(1981), 65 Ohio St.2d 80, 83, 19 O.O.3d 268, 417 N.E.2d 1385; see Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-11 (prescribing use of the 302 computation in valuing personal property used in business).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 24} WCI sought a drastic reduction in the value of its M &amp; E for tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003 from the value determined under the 302 computation. Before the tax commissioner, WCI placed primary reliance on a study of sales of comparable plants. Before the BTA, WCI presented the AccuVal appraisal. But the BTA dismissed WCI\u2019s appeal on the authority of <em>Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Levin, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">\n<em>The BTA misread the holding of Ohio Bell</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 25} When a notice of appeal fails to set forth <em>any </em>error with the required specificity, an appeal may properly be dismissed \u2014 the action that the BTA took in the present case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Brown v. Levin, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, \u00b6 17. Alternatively, if the notice does specify one or more errors, the BTA may be called upon to rule that <em>a particular claim was not among those errors specified </em>and therefore lies outside the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction. Id. <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, exemplifies the latter principle: the court held that the notice of appeal did not permit the introduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>of a newly commissioned \u201cunit appraisal\u201d at the BTA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But in the present case, the BTA relied on <em>Ohio Bell </em>to hold that the notice of appeal in this case failed to specify any error at all. That is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b626} In <em>Ohio Bell, </em>the notice of appeal contained two claims of error that were pertinent to the court\u2019s analysis. First, the notice stated that the commissioner\u2019s determination \u201coverstates both costs and service lives\u201d of Ohio Bell\u2019s property; second, the notice stated that the assessment \u201cutilizes a method that does not reasonably reflect true value.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 20. The court considered whether either of these assertions conferred jurisdiction on the BTA to grant Ohio Bell relief <em>based on a unit appraisal, </em>given that Ohio Bell had not presented such an appraisal below but had presented only a valuation study that called for different cost figures and depreciation rates. Id. at \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 27} As for the statement that the commissioner \u201coverstates costs and service lives,\u201d that phrase referred to the type of valuation study Ohio Bell had previously presented to the commissioner, and it did not relate to a unit appraisal. We next considered whether the assertion that the assessment \u201cutilizes a method that does not reasonably reflect true value\u201d extended jurisdiction to encompass a unit appraisal. We decided that it did not, because, while it purported to open the door to an alternative method, it \u201cdid not <em>narrow </em>the issues in this case in any way.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 27. In this context, the court observed that \u201c[s]uch a \u2018specification\u2019 is so broad that it specifies nothing at all.\u201d Id. But because we did not address whether the notice of appeal failed to specify any error, that statement is obiter dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">{\u00b6 28} Moreover, reading <em>Ohio Bell </em>as foreclosing the jurisdiction of the BTA in this case contravenes the principles we have applied in other cases. We have held that a notice of appeal is sufficient to give notice of a particular error when it has \u201cspecified the commissioner\u2019s action that it questioned, cited the statute under which it objected, and asserted the treatment that it believed the commissioner should have applied.\u201d <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Wilkins, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 33, 2004-Ohio-1869, 806 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 75, citing <em>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Limbach </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 381, 383, 575 N.E.2d 146, citing <em>Abex Corp. v. Kosydar </em>(1973), 35 Ohio St.2d 13, 64 O.O.2d 8, 298 N.E.2d 584. <em>Abex Corp. </em>is particularly significant in this regard because it involved a decision by the BTA to dismiss a challenge to the valuation of personal property. Like the notice of appeal in <em>Abex Corp., </em>WCI\u2019s second assignment of error meets the criteria by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>identifying the property, identifying the commissioner\u2019s action that it did not agree with, and identifying the treatment that the commissioner should have accorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">{\u00b6 29} Therefore, consistent with <em>Abex Corp., </em>35 Ohio St.2d at 17, we hold that the jurisdiction of the BTA is invoked to review an assessment in which the tax commissioner has determined the value of personal property if the notice of appeal from that determination (1) states the appellant\u2019s objection to the commissioner\u2019s actions in valuing the property and (2) identifies the treatment that the commissioner should have applied. Because WCI\u2019s notice of appeal complied with these criteria, it invoked the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">{\u00b6 30} For all these reasons, the BTA erred by reading <em>Ohio Bell </em>as establishing that the notice of appeal in the present case fails to invoke any jurisdiction in the BTA. Indeed, we left no doubt of the narrow compass of our holding when we stated that the \u201cjurisdictional issue * * * stems from Ohio Bell\u2019s failure to present a case based on a unit appraisal to the commissioner, not from an unfortunate choice of words [in the notice of appeal].\u201d 124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, at \u00b6 32. The holding of <em>Ohio Bell </em>does not, therefore, dictate that a notice of appeal must set forth valuation theories with particularity. Instead, the case merely prevents the presentation of an \u201calternate valuation method\u201d that has not previously been presented to the tax commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">\n<em>By explicitly challenging the commissioner\u2019s valuation, a notice of appeal preserves the claim for reduced value and allows new evidence at the BTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">{\u00b6 31} Determining that <em>Ohio Bell </em>does not support the BTA\u2019s dismissal of this case does not end our inquiry. That is so because the BTA\u2019s error is jurisdictional in nature, and we must determine whether the BTA will have jurisdiction to entertain WCI\u2019s claim for reduced value on remand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">{\u00b6 32} Even if a notice of appeal does specify one or more errors, the BTA may be called upon to rule that <em>a particular claim was not among those errors specified </em>and therefore lies outside the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, at \u00b6 17. As noted, our decision in <em>Ohio Bell </em>exemplifies that principle: the court held that the notice of appeal did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>permit the introduction of a newly commissioned \u201cunit appraisal\u201d at the BTA. <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, at \u00b6 32-33.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 33} In the present case, the tax commissioner does not confine himself to defending the BTA\u2019s determination that WCI\u2019s notice failed to specify any error at all; the commissioner also contends that in this case, \u201cjust like in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>the language used by WCI in its notice of appeal to the BTA provides no notice to the Commissioner or the BTA of the particular valuation methodology(ies), analysis, assumptions, and evidence that WCI would present at the BTA.\u201d We therefore consider whether WCI\u2019s notice of appeal encompassed the AccuVal appraisal that WCT presented for the first time at the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 34} For two reasons, we hold that the BTA did possess jurisdiction to consider the AccuVal appraisal. First, the commissioner\u2019s argument cannot be reconciled with the statutes and the case law concerning the BTA\u2019s authority to hear evidence. R.C. 5717.02 specifically provides that \u201cupon the application of any interested party the board shall order the hearing of additional evidence, and it may make such investigation concerning the appeal as it considers proper.\u201d The proposition that the notice of appeal must specify the nature of the evidence that the appellant will present at the BTA hearing cannot be reconciled with the specific mandate that \u201cadditional evidence\u201d be taken on application of a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">{\u00b6 35} Moreover, we have held that the \u201cBTA hearing is <em>de novo </em>\u201d and that the board is \u201cstatutorily authorized to conduct full administrative appeals in which the parties are entitled to produce evidence in addition to that considered by the Tax Commissioner.\u201d <em>Key Servs. Corp. v. Zaino </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 11, 16, 764 N.E.2d 1015, citing <em>Higbee Co. v. Evatt </em>(1942), 140 Ohio St. 325, 332, 23 O.O. 543, 43 N.E.2d 273; <em>Bloch v. Glander </em>(1949), 151 Ohio St. 381, 387, 39 O.O. 216, 86 N.E.2d 318. Imposing the jurisdictional prerequisite of specifying evidence would severely limit if not overrule our precedent concerning the scope of the BTA\u2019s authority in this regard \u2014 indeed, in <em>Ohio Bell </em>itself, we expressly acknowledged that a party \u201cneed not specify the evidence on which it intends to rely [at the BTA].\u201d <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, at \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">{\u00b6 36} Second, our decisions have not judged the sufficiency of assignments of error in a notice of appeal merely by their form of words. Instead, the words of the notice of appeal must be read in the context of the particular case in which those words are used. An assertion in a notice of appeal should therefore be read in light of the objections and evidence that were presented to the commissioner, with the result that a taxpayer\u2019s explicit objection to the commissioner\u2019s valuation of personal property will usually suffice to permit the taxpayer to preserve its valuation challenge and present new evidence to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">{\u00b6 37} One of the most dramatic illustrations of the importance of context is <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35. In <em>Brown, </em>the notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>of appeal stated that the appeal was \u201cbeing taken because the assessment is not supported by a proper application of Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 5747.02 and other applicable laws.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 5. The \u201cclaim of error might indeed have been raised in any <em>income tax </em>case in Ohio.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. at \u00b6 22. (R.C. 5747.02 imposes the income tax.) Thus, the statement \u201carguably specifies no error at all.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 38} But we did not hold that the BTA should have dismissed the appeal. Instead, we looked at the context as infusing the notice of appeal with a particular meaning: because the commissioner\u2019s determination relied on the BTA\u2019s decision in <em>Knust v. Wilkins </em>(Oct. 14, 2005), BTA No. 2004-M-533, 2005 WL 2699284, affirmed, 111 Ohio St.3d 331, 2006-Ohio-5791, 856 N.E.2d 243, and because the <em>Knust </em>appeal was pending before this court at the time the tax commissioner issued his final determination, we held: \u201c[T]he BTA could have construed the Browns\u2019 notice of appeal as a request that if this court reversed the BTA\u2019s decision in <em>Knust, </em>the Browns should enjoy the benefit of that legal ruling. Indeed, to construe the notice of appeal in that way would comport with the fact that this case is one of a large number of cases that were pending before the BTA in anticipation of our decision in the <em>Knust </em>appeal.\u201d <em>Brown </em>at \u00b6 14. Our ultimate disposition in <em>Brown </em>reflects the reading of the notice of appeal in context: we did not find that the BTA lacked jurisdiction, but instead affirmed the BTA\u2019s summary affirmance of the commissioner\u2019s determination based on the court\u2019s decision in <em>Knust.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">{\u00b6 39} Additionally, reading the notice of appeal in context comports with the basic purpose of the specification requirement: notice. See <em>Gen. Mills, Inc. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 273, 275, 586 N.E.2d 1074 (\u201cR.C. 5717.02 merely requires that the error be presented with sufficient specificity to apprise the BTA of the nature and extent of the alleged error\u201d), citing <em>Abex Corp., </em>35 Ohio St.2d 13, 64 O.O.2d 8, 298 N.E.2d 584; <em>Castle Aviation, Inc. v. Wilkins, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 290, 2006-Ohio-2420, 847 N.E.2d 420, \u00b6 39 (\u201cThe purpose of specifying error at the BTA, be the error constitutional or nonconstitutional, is to put the Tax Commissioner on notice as to the issues that will be contested\u201d). Simply put, reiterating a claim raised before the commissioner, even without exposition, gives adequate notice that the taxpayer will reassert that claim to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 40} In the present case, WCI\u2019s notice invokes the BTA\u2019s jurisdiction to consider a claim for reduced value, at least to the extent of the evidence, arguments, and considerations that formed a part of the tax commissioner\u2019s review of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">\n<em>The AccuVal appraisal presented at the BTA did not exceed the scope of the claim for reduced value specified in the notice of appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">{\u00b6 41} The commissioner emphasizes that WCI presented a comparable-sales study to the commissioner and placed primary reliance on that study, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>distinguishes between a comparable-sales approach and a replacement-cost approach, which predominated in the AccuVal appraisal that WCI presented at the BTA. Citing <em>Ohio Bell, </em>the commissioner analogizes this distinction to the \u201calternate valuation methods\u201d at issue in <em>Ohio Bell. </em>Under this theory, the AccuVal appraisal, like the unit appraisal in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>lay outside the jurisdiction created by the notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 42} The commissioner\u2019s theory is mistaken for two reasons. First, unlike the utility tax at issue in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>the general personal property tax is subject to administrative rules that address the valuation of personal property. Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-11 generally calls for the use of the commissioner\u2019s 302 computation and establishes the prima facie validity of that method.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 43} When a taxpayer challenges the valuation in accordance with the 302 computation, Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-10(B) provides that the 302 valuation may be \u201crebutted by probative evidence of higher or lower valuation\u201d and then enumerates several types of evidence: an arm\u2019s-length sale of the assets, a comparable-sales study, or more accurate annual allowances for depreciation and obsolescence. Contrary to the commissioner\u2019s argument, this language makes clear that a comparable-sales study and a cost-less-depreciation study do not constitute different claims for relief, but merely different types of \u201cprobative evidence of higher or lower valuation\u201d by which the prima facie validity of the 302 computation may be rebutted. Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-10(B). Because an appellant at the BTA \u201cneed not specify the evidence on which it intends to rely,\u201d <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, at \u00b6 30, it follows that WCI did not need to specify the approaches to valuing property that it intended to rely on before the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 44} Second, the concept of an \u201calternate valuation method\u201d found in <em>Ohio Bell </em>is specific to the utility tax and usually does not apply to the general personal property tax. <em>Ohio Bell </em>was itself a utility-tax case in which the tax commissioner valued Ohio Bell\u2019s property by applying \u201ccomposite annual allowances\u201d for depreciation and obsolescence to the historical cost of the utility\u2019s operating assets. See R.C. 5727.11. Before the commissioner, Ohio Bell began by offering a valuation to reduce costs and accelerate depreciation, but for the first time at the BTA, Ohio Bell resorted to a \u201cunit appraisal.\u201d The term \u201calternate valuation method\u201d is derived from a previous utility-tax case and refers to the distinction between these two approaches to valuing the operating assets of a utility. <em>Ohio Boll </em>at \u00b6 23, citing <em>Texas E. Transm. Corp. v. Tracy </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 83, 86-87, 676 N.E.2d 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 45} Unit-appraisal valuation is different \u2014 in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>we referred to its \u201cfundamental dissimilarity\u201d to the cost-less-depreciation approach \u2014 because a unit appraisal is an \u201c \u2018appraisal of an integrated property as a whole, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>reference to the value of its component parts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ohio Bell Tel. Co. v. Wilkins </em>(Aug. 31, 2007), BTA No. 2005-K-202, at 12, quoting the unit appraisal presented to the BTA, reversed on other grounds, <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212; accord <em>Stone v. Limbach </em>(June 30, 1988), BTA No. 85-C-931, at 23 (Ohio formerly taxed utility property under \u201cunit\u201d valuation, meaning that \u201c[a]ll taxable property of a public utility is valued as one \u2018piece\u2019 or \u2018unit\u2019 of property,\u201d with the result that the property is \u201cvalued as a \u2018whole\u2019 instead of on an \u2018item by item\u2019 basis\u201d). And unit-appraisal valuation plays a role in the history of utility taxation that is different from the general personal property tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 46} Namely, the unit appraisal became an alternate valuation method in the utility tax after the enactment of R.C. 5727.11 in 1989. Am.Sub.S.B. No. 156, 143 Ohio Laws, Part I, 891, 909-911. Under the public utility personal property tax <em>as amended, </em>the statute requires the commissioner to determine the value of personal property by \u201cusing cost as capitalized on the public utility\u2019s books and records less composite annual allowances as prescribed by the commissioner.\u201d R.C. 5727.11(A), formerly (B). Before that amendment, the valuation of utility property by means of a \u201cunit appraisal\u201d was a widely acknowledged and accepted approach. See <em>Texas E. Transm. Corp., </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 83, 676 N.E.2d 523 (\u201cPrior to 1990, TET\u2019s property was assessed by \u2018unit appraisal,\u2019 \u201d pursuant to which \u201cthe value of the entire operating system is determined and then an amount is allocated to those components located within the various states\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because of this background, we characterized the unit appraisal offered in <em>Texas Eastern </em>as an \u201calternate valuation method\u201d from the statutory method and held that such an appraisal could be offered as a basis for departing from the costless-deprecation approach without any showing of special and unusual circumstances. Id. at 86. Next, in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>we echoed the discussion in <em>Texas E. Transm. Corp. </em>of the unit appraisal as an \u201calternate valuation method\u201d and emphasized the \u201cfundamental dissimilarity between the valuation theory presented to the commissioner (which was focused on revising the cost and depreciation variables) and the [unit appraisal] presented to the BTA (which was focused on an expert appraiser\u2019s professional opinion of the <em>market </em>value of Ohio Bell\u2019s operating properties).\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 47} By contrast with <em>Ohio Bell, </em>the present case presents no such \u201cfundamental dissimilarity\u201d because the AccuYal appraisal that WCI presented at the BTA integrates a mix of approaches into a replacement-cost study, and such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>appraisal does not qualify as an \u201calternate valuation method\u201d from what was considered by the tax commissioner. Moreover, the concept of alternate valuation method simply does not apply outside the utility-tax context. For these reasons, <em>Ohio Bell </em>is not apposite, and the BTA had jurisdiction to consider the AccuVal appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\n<em>WCI was not obligated to present the AccuVal appraisal to the commissioner in order to be permitted to present it to the BTA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACIQ\">{\u00b6 48} The commissioner also argues that the BTA lacked jurisdiction because WCI did not present the AccuVal appraisal to the commissioner first. This argument relies on the asserted rule that \u201ca failure to <em>present </em>an issue to the commissioner precludes the BTA from taking jurisdiction over that issue \u2014 even if the issue is <em>specified </em>in the notice of appeal.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, at \u00b6 33, citing <em>CNG Dev. Co. v. Limbach </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 28, 32, 584 N.E.2d 1180, and <em>DeWeese v. Zaino, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 324, 2003-Ohio-6502, 800 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 19-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 49} The commissioner cites no specific statutory authority to support his second and third propositions of law. That is odd because the language of the statutes is almost certainly relevant to whether a taxpayer is or is not obligated to set forth its objections and arguments before the commissioner. See <em>CNG, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 31, 584 N.E.2d 1180, quoting R.C. 5739.13 (sales-tax provision authorizing a challenge to the tax commissioner\u2019s assessment expressly required that the petition for reassessment \u201c \u2018set[ ] forth with particularity the items of the assessment objected to, together with the reasons for such objections\u2019 \u201d); <em>DeWeese, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 324, 2003-Ohio-6502, 800 N.E.2d 1, at \u00b6 10 (because R.C. 5711.31 requires a petition for reassessment in a property-tax case to \u201cindicate the objections of the party assessed, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received prior to the date shown on the final determination by the commissioner,\u201d the \u201cissues that the taxpayer wants reviewed must be presented to the Tax Commissioner in writing,\u201d and \u201cthe only issues before him for determination are those that have been presented in writing by the taxpayer\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 50} Despite the commissioner\u2019s lack of reference to a specific statute, for purposes of our analysis we will assume without deciding that the requirement that objections be raised before the commissioner applies to all three tax years at issue in this case. By asserting that requirement as he does in the present case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>however, the commissioner pits it squarely against the settled principle (previously discussed) that new evidence may be presented at the BTA in support of a claim for reduced value.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 51} The preceding discussion establishes that the commissioner\u2019s argument must fail. Under Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-10(B), the comparable-sales approach and the cost-less-depreciation approach are two evidentiary approaches, not different claims for relief.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the \u201cBTA hearing is <em>de novo </em>\u201d and the \u201cparties are entitled to produce evidence [at the BTA] in addition to that considered by the Tax Commissioner,\u201d <em>Key Servs. Corp., </em>95 Ohio St.3d at 16, 764 N.E.2d 1015, the presentation of evidence using one approach to value before the commissioner does not bar the presentation of evidence to the BTA using another approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 52} Consistent with the reasoning of <em>Key Servs. Corp., </em>we hold that in an appeal from an assessment in which the tax commissioner has determined the value of personal property, the BTA is statutorily authorized to receive evidence in addition to that considered by the tax commissioner and that evidence may include valuation approaches different from those presented to the tax commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">{\u00b6 53} As for the commissioner\u2019s citation of <em>Hatchadorian v. Lindley </em>(1986), 21 Ohio St.3d 66, 21 OBR 365, 488 N.E.2d 145, that case does state that the commissioner\u2019s findings are \u201cpresumptively valid, absent a demonstration that those findings are clearly unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. But the BTA\u2019s standard of review in an appeal from a determination of the tax commissioner is not before us, and we do not think it is relevant to the jurisdictional issue we do confront.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">{\u00b6 54} The commissioner additionally claims that he possesses the exclusive power to value and assess property and argues on that basis that the BTA cannot consider an appraisal that was not first presented to the commissioner. Although our case law at one point acknowledged the commissioner\u2019s \u201cexclusive power\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>concerning property valuation, it did so only in the context of the public utility property tax, see <em>Toledo Edison Co. v. Galvin </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St.2d 210, 212, 67 O.O.2d 230, 311 N.E.2d 897 (former public utility property-tax statutes reserved \u201cexclusive power to value and assess public utility property to the Tax Commissioner\u201d), cited by <em>Hatchadorian </em>at 71. <em>Hatchadorian </em>was a utility-tax case as well, and whatever continuing force that pronouncement may have is confined to the utility context.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AG1\">Buckingham, Doolittle &amp; Burroughs, L.L.P., David W.

Woggon, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Chamber of Commerce.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 55} For all the foregoing reasons, we distinguish our decision in <em>Ohio Bell </em>and hold that the different approaches to valuing personal property set forth in Ohio Adm.Code 5703-3-10(B) are not \u201calternate valuation methods\u201d and accordingly that the notice of appeal need not specify that the appellant will present a different valuation approach to the BTA than it presented in the proceedings before the tax commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 56} The analysis of <em>Ohio Bell </em>is inapplicable to the situation of this case. The BTA acted unlawfully when it dismissed WCI\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We therefore reverse and remand for a determination of WCI\u2019s appeal on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Decision reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b412-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-11\">. The BTA\u2019s decision noted that two assignments of error in the notice of appeal had been abandoned, and it therefore did not consider the sufficiency of those assignments. <em>WCI Steel, Inc. v. Wilkins </em>(May 18, 2010), BTA No. 2005-V-1565, at 5. The BTA then proceeded to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that the remaining assignments of error were \u201cso broad and vague as to be insufficient to invoke [the] board\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\">. Because the taxpayer in <em>Ohio Bell </em>had abandoned the use of its study of costs and service lives in favor of exclusive reliance on a unit appraisal, the court did not remand but instead ordered that the commissioner\u2019s determination be reinstated. <em>Ohio Bell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 211, 2009-Ohio-6189, 921 N.E.2d 212, at \u00b6 34. Significantly, there was no dismissal of the BTA appeal in <em>Ohio Bell, </em>because there was no holding that the notice of appeal completely failed to specify any error at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-9\">. Ordinarily, our jurisdiction to consider a claim that the BTA has erred is confined to specifications of error advanced either in a notice of appeal or in a cross-appeal. See <em>Polaris Amphitheater Concerts, Inc. v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 330, 2008-Ohio-2454, 889 N.E.2d 103, \u00b6 13-15; <em>Northeast Ohio Psych. Inst. v. Levin, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 292, 2009-Ohio-583, 903 N.E.2d 1188, \u00b6 23. But when, as in the present case, an issue concerns the jurisdiction of the BTA and thereby, derivatively, our own jurisdiction on appeal, we may consider the issue without regard to the specification requirement of R.C. 5717.04. See <em>Brown, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 335, 2008-Ohio-4081, 894 N.E.2d 35, at \u00b6 23, fn. 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\">. See <em>Condee v.

It is worth noting that the present case involves the issuance of final-assessment certificates by the tax commissioner pursuant to R.C. 5711.26 and does <em>not </em>involve a final determination of a petition for reassessment pursuant to R.C. 5711.31. That is potentially significant to the commissioner\u2019s argument because R.C. 5711.31 explicitly requires the taxpayer to \u201cindicate the objections\u201d to the assessment, while R.C. 5711.26 does not expressly create a duty to state objections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\">. In this regard, the distinctions between various evidentiary approaches to valuation differ markedly from the distinctions between discrete legal claims at issue in the cases that the commissioner relies upon. See <em>Am. Fiber Sys., Inc. v. Levin, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 374, 2010-Ohio-1468, 928 N.E.2d 695, \u00b6 17-22 (collateral-estoppel theory constituted a claim or argument that had to be affirmatively specified in the objections to the commissioner\u2019s assessment); <em>CNG, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 32, 584 N.E.2d 1180 (where petition for reassessment stated two grounds for relief from assessment but made no reference to the exemption from sales and use tax for items used directly in the rendition of a utility service, the taxpayer could not assert the latter claim at the BTA); <em>DeWeese, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 324, 2003-Ohio-6502, 800 N.E.2d 1 (where county auditors appealed to the BTA from the tax commissioner\u2019s final determination of a property-tax assessment and raised exemption issues in that appeal that were not the subject of the taxpayer\u2019s petition for reassessment, the court held that those issues were therefore jurisdictionally barred).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
