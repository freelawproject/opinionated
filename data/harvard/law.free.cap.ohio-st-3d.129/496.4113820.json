Bender, to resentence him in accordance with the court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Hazel </em>(Mar. 31, 2010), Franklin App. Nos. 09AP-1132, 09AP-1156, 09AP-1133, and 09AP-1157. Judge Bender has resentenced Hazel. The judge\u2019s performance of the requested act rendered Hazel\u2019s procedendo claim moot. <em>State ex rel. Howard v. Show, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 423, 2004-Ohio-3652, 811 N.E.2d 1128, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-11\">{\u00b6 2} Hazel\u2019s claim on appeal that he was entitled to a writ of procedendo to compel his immediate release from prison because Judge Bender had unnecessarily delayed resentencing him lacks merit because no unnecessary delay occurred. Moreover, habeas corpus, rather than procedendo, is the proper action to seek release from prison. See generally <em>State ex rel. Nelson v. Griffin, </em>103 Ohio St.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>167, 2004-Ohio-4754, 814 N.E.2d 866, \u00b6 5 (\u201chabeas corpus, rather than mandamus or prohibition, is the proper action to seek\u201d release from prison).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6g\">Corey Hazel, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b639-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-12\">.
