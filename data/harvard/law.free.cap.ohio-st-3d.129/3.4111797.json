In <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 27, 2009-Ohio-5932, 918 N.E.2d 972 <em>(\u201cWorthington I </em>\u201d), the property owner challenged the BTA\u2019s use of the sale price as an indicator of value on the basis that \u201cmarket changes and other factors make the sale price unreliable.\u201d The BTA rejected that challenge and adopted the sale price as the value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">{\u00b6 2} On appeal, we held that the BTA had failed to give full consideration to whether the sale was \u201crecent,\u201d one of the criteria that must be satisfied before a sale price may be used as a value for tax purposes. Id. at \u00b6 34. Instead, the BTA disposed of the issue of recency by relying solely on the temporal proximity of the sale to the tax-lien dates. Because proximity is not the sole factor affecting recency and because the property owner argued that other factors made the sale price an unreliable indicator of value, we vacated the BTA\u2019s decision and remanded for a proper determination of recency based on the entire record. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">{\u00b6 3} On April 20, 2010, the BTA issued its decision on remand. The BTA analyzed the record and concluded that the evidence did not show a change in the market between May 2003 and the tax-lien dates at issue, January 1, 2004, and January 1, 2005. As a result, the BTA once again adopted the sale price as the value of the property based on the conclusion that the presumption of recency had not been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The property owner has appealed, asserting that the BTA \u201ccompletely ignored the instructions of this court\u201d in <em>Worthington I, </em>that the BTA \u201cignored its own findings of fact and those of the Court,\u201d and that the BTA erred in imposing the burden of proof. We disagree, and we therefore affirm the decision of the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 5} In <em>Worthington I, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 27, 2009-Ohio-5932, 918 N.E.2d 972, we extensively discussed the evidence presented to the Franklin County Board of Revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) in this case. We will not repeat that entire discussion here, but refer instead to the most important evidence considered on remand: the testimony of Sally Marrell, one of the principals of the property owner, Bob-O-Link Golf Course Ltd., n.k.a. Weber Sisters Enterprises, Ltd. (\u201cWeber Sisters\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 6} Weber Sisters purchased the property in May 2003 for $4,175,000, by exchanging a golf course worth $2.4 million and by tendering the remainder of the purchase price in cash. Marrell testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u2022 Weber Sisters\u2019 purchase was predicated on the seller\u2019s leasing most of the space in the two buildings, each of which comprised 7,500 square feet of commercial space.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u2022 The price paid by Weber Sisters \u201cwas for totally occupied units,\u201d meaning in this case that the sale would occur with leases in place for 11,740 of the 15,000 total square feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u2022 Immediately after the May 2003 sale it became clear that two tenants slated to occupy the largest portions of the buildings \u2014 Boston Market and Fiesta Fresh \u2014 would not take possession. The former initially honored rent obligations; the latter did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u2022 During 2004, tenant Cold Stone Creamery began paying less and less and ultimately vacated its leased premises during 2005 and defaulted on its lease obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u2022 Another tenant, Mark Pi\u2019s, experienced financial difficulty and negotiated a rent reduction of approximately one-third. An Indian restaurant stopped paying rent as of November 2005. Another tenant, Robeck\u2019s Juice, subleased to Quizno\u2019s at a reduced rent while itself continuing to pay full rent. Only one tenant, a Starbucks, retained possession at the stated rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u2022 As of the February 2006 hearing date, Weber Sisters was \u201coperating at a total loss.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">{\u00b6 13} In 2005, Weber Sisters undertook an ultimately abortive attempt to sell the property at issue. It received an offer of $3.9 million, but after the purchaser\u2019s appraisal indicated a value of only $3 to $3.2 million, the purchaser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>backed out of the deal. At that point, Weber Sisters obtained a written appraisal from Koenig and Associates that opined a value of $3,200,000 as of September 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">{\u00b6 14} When the school board filed its complaint for tax year 2004 seeking an increase from the auditor\u2019s valuation of $2,680,000 to the May 2003 sale price of $4,175,000, the BOR held a hearing at which Marrell\u2019s testimony and other evidence was presented. The BOR rejected the use of the sale price, stating that the principals of Weber Sisters were \u201cnot necessarily knowledgeable buyers\u201d and \u201cnot familiar with the Franklin County commercial market.\u201d Additionally, the BOR noted a \u201csignificant loss of tenants in calendar year 2003\u201d and the owner\u2019s subsequent inability to sell the property. Based on these findings, the BOR embraced the value of $2,680,000 that had been assigned by the auditor rather than using the sale price to value the property for tax years 2004 and 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 15} The BTA, acting largely on the basis of the record developed before the BOR, found that Weber Sisters had \u201cpresented no competent or probative evidence challenging the arm\u2019s-length nature of the May 2003 sale.\u201d <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Nov. 12, 2008), BTA No. 2006-H-381, 2008 WL 4917852, at * 3; <em>Worthington I </em>at \u00b6 14. As for the recency of the sale, the BTA confined itself to stating in a footnote that the sale eight months before the 2004 tax-lien date qualified as recent. Id. at *4, fn. 3. Accordingly, the BTA adopted the $4,175,000 sale price as the value of the property. Id. at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">{\u00b6 16} Weber Sisters appealed to this court. In <em>Worthington I, </em>we found that Weber Sisters had demonstrated no error in the BTA\u2019s determination with regard to its finding that the May 2003 sale was at arm\u2019s length. <em>Worthington I, </em>\u00b6 30. But we held that under the circumstances, the BTA\u2019s discussion of the issue of recency was inadequate, and we remanded for an evaluation and determination whether the May 2003 sale was recent in light of the entire record. Id. at \u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 17} On April 20, 2010, the BTA issued its decision on remand upholding the use of the sale price as the value of the property. Weber Sisters has appealed, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c \u2018The fair market value of property for tax purposes is a question of fact, the determination of which is primarily within the province of the taxing authorities, and this court will not disturb a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals with respect to such valuation unless it affirmatively appears from the record that such decision is unreasonable or unlawful.\u2019 \u201d <em>EOP-BP Tower, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 1, 2005-Ohio-3096, 829 N.E.2d 686, \u00b6 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>quoting <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision v. Fodor </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 52, 44 O.O.2d 30, 239 N.E.2d 25, syllabus. The BTA\u2019s findings of fact are to be affirmed if supported by reliable and probative evidence, and the BTA\u2019s determination of the credibility of witnesses and its weighing of the evidence are subject to a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion review on appeal. <em>Olentangy Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 103, 2010-Ohio-1040, 926 N.E.2d 302, \u00b6 15; <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14, citing <em>Am. Natl. Can Co. v. Tracy </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 150, 152, 648 N.E.2d 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 19} Moreover, \u201c \u2018the uniform rule [in real property taxation] is that property should be valued in accordance with an actual sale price where the criteria of the recency and the arm\u2019s-length character of the sale are satisfied.\u2019 \u201d <em>Woda Ivy Glen Ltd. Partnership v. Fayette Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 175, 2009-Ohio-762, 902 N.E.2d 984, \u00b621, quoting <em>Cummins Property Seros., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 20} At the outset, we address Weber Sisters\u2019 contentions regarding the burden of proof. As we stated in <em>Worthington I, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 27, 2009-Ohio-5932, 918 N.E.2d 972, the \u201ctroika of deed, conveyance-fee statement, and purchase agreement formed an adequate basis for the BTA to find a recent arm\u2019s-length sale, subject to rebuttal by the Weber Sisters.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 28. As a result, on remand it was Weber Sisters\u2019 burden to prove that the May 2003 sale did not qualify as a recent one with respect to the 2004 and 2005 tax-lien dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 21} In <em>Worthington I, </em>we stated that <em>\u201cif </em>the evidence that Weber Sisters presented to the BOR did tend to negate recency, then the school board acquired the burden of rebutting the probative force of that evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at \u00b6 33. On remand, the BTA found no such evidence. Specifically, the BTA stated that the record contained no evidence of any change in the market between the May 2003 purchase and the January 1, 2004 tax-lien date. <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Apr. 20, 2010), BTA No. 2006-V-381, at 9. Given that the burden lay on Weber Sisters to show the existence of market change (or other factor negating recency of the sale), the absence of evidence means that Weber Sisters has failed to prove the sale was not recent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>{\u00b6 22} As evidence of market change, Weber Sisters points to the tenancy problems that plagued the property through 2003, 2004, and 2005, and to the difficulty selling the property in 2005. In a proper case, a loss of tenants that results in reduced occupancy could constitute evidence of a declining market for commercial space that would reduce the value of the property. But the mere fact that tenants depart and are not replaced does not establish a change in market conditions, because increased vacancies may result from a number of factors, including the current owner\u2019s management practices.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Olentangy Local Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Delaware Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Jan. 13, 2009), BTA No. 2006-H-1361, 2009 WL 110177, at *4 (\u201cWhile the subject may have experienced increased vacancies during 2004, the information before us is inadequate to tie any occupancy rate to a change in the market, since other factors, such as management practices, may also impact a vacancy rate\u201d), affirmed, 125 Ohio St.3d 103, 2010-Ohio-1040, 926 N.E.2d 302; accord <em>Higbee Co. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 325, 2006-Ohio-2, 839 N.E.2d 385, \u00b6 44 (failure to meet sales targets does not necessarily justify reducing the value of retail property given that \u201cthe merchant\u2019s business practices may also influence sales\u201d). Moreover, as for the 2005 appraisal, the BTA found that because the appraisal report \u201cfails to express an opinion of value for any tax lien date at issue and its author was not present at hearing before the BOR to testify as to his expert opinion,\u201d the BTA was \u201cunable to rely upon the appraiser\u2019s conclusions.\u201d 2010 WL 1652970, at *5. Given the record, the BTA could reasonably and lawfully conclude that Weber Sisters failed to show a change in the market between May 2003 and the tax-lien dates for 2004 and 2005.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AX\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Rich &amp; Gillis Law Group, L.L.C., Mark A.

Petkovic, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">{\u00b6 23} Weber Sisters argues that the BTA \u201ccompletely ignored the instructions of this court\u201d and \u201cignored its own findings of fact and those of the Court.\u201d Even a cursory reading of the 12-page BTA decision shows that neither is true. To the contrary: the BTA discussed the evidence, quoted Weber Sisters\u2019 brief on the subject of recency, and made its finding based on what Weber Sisters had argued. It thereby fulfilled the instruction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 24} For the reasons set forth, the decision of the BTA is reasonable and lawful. We therefore affirm it.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Decision affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b150-9\">Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\">. In its BTA brief in <em>Worthington I, </em>Weber Sisters mentioned not only change in market, but \u201cchange in the property\u201d as a reason to find that a sale price should not be used. Such changes include improvements that may increase the property\u2019s value or casualty that may decrease the property\u2019s value, as well as changes in zoning or other regulatory restrictions. See <em>Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 35. But aside from the completion of construction during 2003 discussed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Worthington I </em>at \u00b6 20, the record shows no change in the property, and Weber Sisters has never argued that the completion of construction made the sale price an unreliable indicator of value.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b149-6\">. As for the relevance of a loss of tenants to the arm\u2019s-length character of the sale, the BTA\u2019s earlier decision stated that Weber Sisters\u2019 \u201clack of knowledge of the local market,\u201d its \u201cinability to resell the [property] based on the September 2005 appraised value,\u201d and \u201cthe [property\u2019s] loss of tenants after the 2008 purchase\u201d did \u201cnot rebut the arm\u2019s-length nature of the sale.\u201d <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(Nov. 12, 2008), BTA No. 2006-H-381, 2008 WL 4917852, at *3. On appeal, we noted that \u201cWeber Sisters has not pointed to any distinctly legal error in the BTA\u2019s discussion of the arm\u2019s-length character\u201d of the transaction. <em>Worthington I, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 27, 2009-Ohio-5932, 918 N.E.2d 972, \u00b6 30. In particular, Weber Sisters has never specifically argued to the BTA or to the court that the buyer\u2019s lack of knowledge is relevant to the arm\u2019s-length character of the transaction. See Appraisal Institute, The Appraisal of Beal Estate (13th Ed.2008), 23 (\u201cmarket value\u201d usually predicated on buyer and seller acting \u201cknowledgably\u201d); Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-05(A)(1) and (2) (defining \u201ctrue value\u201d in terms of various factors, including the parties\u2019 \u201chaving a knowledge of all the relevant facts\u201d). Jurisdictional and prudential grounds typically prevent us from addressing substantive arguments that the appellant has not advanced and, in any event, we regard any consideration of the arm\u2019s-length character of the sale as foreclosed at this juncture by the law-of-the-case doctrine. <em>Colonial Village Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975. 915 N.E.2d 1196. \u00b6 12-13.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b150-10\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AGt\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-11\">{\u00b6 25} The court in this case places undue reliance on a speculative possibility while ignoring a harsh economic reality. The court is unduly impressed with the possibility that the difficulties encountered by Weber Sisters may be its \u201cmanagement practices.\u201d At the same time, the court accords little value to evidence that \u201c[immediately after the May 2003 sale it became clear that two tenants slated to occupy the largest portions of the building \u2014 Boston Market and Fiesta Fresh\u2014 would not take possession.\u201d I am willing to believe that this problem had more to do with market weakness than with Weber Sisters\u2019 management practices. Weber Sisters has presented enough evidence for us to conclude that there has been a change in the market. The property is virtually empty; it doesn\u2019t make sense to value it as if it were fully leased. I would reverse the decision of the BTA and reinstate the sound conclusion of the BOR. I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b150-12\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
