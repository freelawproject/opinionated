Brown, a child-support obligor, for writs of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>mandamus to compel appellees, Hancock County Department of Job and Family Services Director Judith A. Wauford and Seneca County Department of Job and Family Services Director Kathy Oliver, to provide access to and copies of certain child-support records under R.C. 3125.16, Ohio Adm.Code 5101:12-1-20.1, the United States Constitution, and other provisions. Because these appeals raise similar issues, we consolidate them for purposes of decision.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AC\">Frank C. Brown Jr., pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A3Z\">Mark C. Miller, Hancock County Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee Judith A. Wauford.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AbS\">Derek W. DeVine, Seneca County Prosecuting Attorney, and David J. Claus, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee Kathy Oliver.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 2} As the courts of appeals correctly concluded, Brown having previously unsuccessfully raised these claims in both counties by motions filed in juvenile courts and appeal, see, e.g., <em>In re Brown, </em>Seneca C.P. No. 20720086, and <em>Hageman v. Brown, </em>Hancock App. Nos. 5-09-20 and 5-09-21, 2009-Ohio-5432, 2009 WL 3259110, res judicata bars all subsequent actions, including Brown\u2019s mandamus claims, based upon any claim arising out of the transactions or occurrences that were the subject matter of the previous actions. See <em>State ex rel. Trafalgar Corp. v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-6406, 819 N.E.2d 1040, \u00b6 22. \u201cMandamus is not a substitute for an unsuccessful appeal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Marshall v. Glavas, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 297, 2003-Ohio-857, 784 N.E.2d 97, \u00b6 6.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b160-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">. We deny the motion by Oliver in case No. 2011-0138 for an order striking Brown\u2019s merit brief and for an order dismissing his appeal. Although we agree that Brown\u2019s brief does not comply with some of the mechanical requirements of S.Ct.Prac.R. 8.4(A), \u201c[i]n order to promote justice, the court exercises a certain liberality in enforcing a strict attention to its rules, especially as to mere technical infractions.\u201d <em>Drake v. Bucher </em>(1966), 5 Ohio St.2d 37, 40, 34 O.O.2d 53, 213 N.E.2d 182; <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. New Lexington, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 33, 2006-Ohio-6365, 857 N.E.2d 1208, \u00b6 22. This is consistent with \u201cthe fundamental tenet of judicial review in Ohio * * * that courts should decide cases on them merits.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Becker v. Eastlake </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 502, 505, 756 N.E.2d 1228.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
