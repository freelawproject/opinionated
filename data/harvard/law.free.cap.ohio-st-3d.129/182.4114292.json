In that underlying action, Patton sought a writ directing Dusty Rhodes, Hamilton County Auditor, to provide him with access to the county\u2019s financial reports for 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008 pursuant to R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act. The court of appeals dismissed Patton\u2019s mandamus action as moot, in that Patton received the access he sought by virtue of the posting of the requested records on the county auditor\u2019s website. The appellate court also denied Patton\u2019s request for statutory damages and attorney fees. Because the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying Patton\u2019s request for damages and fees, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">{\u00b6 2} On March 5, 2010, Patton hand-delivered the following written request to the Hamilton County Auditor\u2019s Office:</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>{\u00b6 3} \u201cPursuant to the Ohio Public Records Act, I request a copy of the financial reports of Hamilton County prepared by the county auditor for the fiscal years of 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008. The information may be either released to me personally or put on the county auditor\u2019s website. If the latter, then please contact me when the information has been added.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">{\u00b6 4} When the request was made, the annual financial statements already audited by the state auditor had been posted on the county auditor\u2019s website. The financial statements for 2004, 2005, and 2006 had not been posted, because the state auditor had not completed those audits. The process had been impeded by certain claims by the United States and Ohio about expenditures and accounting procedures of the Hamilton County Department of Job and Family Services in those years. Because of the complex issues causing these financial statements to remain unaudited, subsequent audits were more complicated, and the audit of the 2008 financial statement had not been completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 5} On March 15, 2010, the county auditor\u2019s office asked the state auditor\u2019s office for its opinion concerning Patton\u2019s request for the unaudited financial reports. That same day, the state auditor\u2019s office responded that providing those reports to Patton was appropriate, but cautioned that the reports should be clearly labeled \u201cunaudited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 6} On March 31, the county auditor\u2019s office asked the state auditor\u2019s office about the propriety of posting the requested unaudited financial reports on its website. The state auditor\u2019s office warned the county auditor to make sure that the reports \u201care clearly marked unaudited, and possibly indicate that they are not the final\u201d reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 7} On April 16, 2010, after receiving no response from the county auditor to his March 5 request, Patton filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Hamilton County for a writ of mandamus to compel the county auditor to make the requested financial reports available for inspection and copying in accordance with the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, and for an award of statutory damages and attorney fees under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">{\u00b6 8} On April 20, the county auditor\u2019s office asked the state auditor\u2019s office whether the following cautionary language would suffice should the county auditor post the unaudited financial reports on its website: \u201cPlease note that these financial reports are draft statements only. They are unaudited and should not be considered to be the County\u2019s final financial statements for the period indicated.\u201d The state auditor\u2019s office approved the proposed cautionary language that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">{\u00b6 9} On April 30, 2010, the county auditor notified Patton that the requested financial statements had been posted on the auditor\u2019s website on or shortly before that date. Because the requested financial statements were not stored in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>electronic format, they had to be scanned and formatted so that they could be posted on the website.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 10} The county auditor submitted an answer to Patton\u2019s mandamus complaint, and the parties submitt\u00e9d stipulated evidence. Patton subsequently conceded that by posting the requested financial records online, the county auditor had satisfied his request. Patton filed a motion for an award of statutory damages, attorney fees, and costs. The county auditor filed a motion for summary judgment. On January 21, 2011, the court of appeals dismissed Patton\u2019s mandamus action as moot and denied his motion for an award of statutory damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 11} This cause is now before the court upon Patton\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">{\u00b6 12} Patton asserts that the court of appeals erred in denying his request for statutory damages and attorney fees. In this appeal, we review whether the court of appeals abused its discretion in denying the request. See <em>State ex rel. Doe v. Smith, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 44, 2009-Ohio-4149, 914 N.E.2d 159, \u00b6 1, 47 (holding that a court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in its award of statutory damages and attorney fees in a public-records mandamus case).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 13} Patton bases his entitlement to the requested damages and fees on provisions of R.C. 149.43, the Public Records Act. R.C. 149.43(C)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIf a person allegedly is aggrieved by the failure of a public office or the person responsible for public records to promptly prepare a public record and to make it available to the person for inspection in accordance with division (B) of this section or by any other failure of a public office or the person responsible for public records to comply with an obligation in accordance with division (B) of this section, <em>the person allegedly aggrieved may commence a mandamus action to obtain a judgment that orders the public office or the person responsible for the public record to comply with division (B) of this section, </em>that awards court costs and reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the person that instituted the mandamus action, and, if applicable, that includes an order fixing statutory damages under division (C)(1) of this section.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">{\u00b6 15} Although Patton cited the Public Records Act in both his March 5, 2010 request for the county\u2019s financial reports and in his complaint in mandamus, part of the relief he requested \u2014 the placement of the requested records on the county auditor\u2019s website \u2014 is not the relief that is authorized by R.C. 149.43. That statute specifies two primary means of providing access to public records: (1) making the records \u201cavailable for inspection to any person at all reasonable times during regular business hours\u201d and (2) making \u201ccopies of the requested public record[s] available at cost and within a reasonable period of time.\u201d R.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>149.43(B)(1). The statute does not require a public office or person responsible for public records to post these records online on the office\u2019s website.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 16} R.C. 149.43(C)(1) authorizes a mandamus action to obtain a \u201cjudgment that orders the public office or the person responsible for the public record to comply with division (B)\u201d of the statute. Division (B) does not require the posting of public records online. The county auditor was not obliged to comply with Patton\u2019s request that the records be posted on the county auditor\u2019s website. Thus, to the extent that Patton sought the online posting of the requested documents, his request was not authorized by R.C. 149.43(B), and he may not be awarded attorney fees and statutory damages under R.C. 149.43(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cIt is axiomatic that in mandamus proceedings, the creation of the legal duty that a relator seeks to enforce is the distinct function of the legislative branch of government, and courts are not authorized to create the legal duty enforceable in mandamus.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 18; see also <em>State ex rel. Bardwell v. Cleveland, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 195, 2010-Ohio-3267, 931 N.E.2d 1080 (court of appeals was not authorized to create duty on the part of city and its police chief to require pawnbrokers to submit certain reports on regular paper rather than on index cards when there was no such requirement under R.C. 149.43(B)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 18} Therefore, based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion by denying Patton\u2019s request for an award of statutory damages and attorney fees for his mandamus claim. The possibility that the court of appeals\u2019 rationale for ruling this way may have been erroneous does not warrant a reversal of its correct judgment denying the damages and fees. See <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Kelly, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 309, 2010-Ohio-5724, 939 N.E.2d 828, \u00b6 2 (applying this axiom in a public-records mandamus case).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 19} Additionally, the court of appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying his request for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">{\u00b6 20} First, the court of appeals correctly held that the county auditor satisfied Patton\u2019s request for copies of the financial reports \u2014 by posting them online \u2014 within the \u201creasonable period of time\u201d specified in R.C. 149.43(B)(1). This determination is dependent \u201cupon all of the pertinent facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Morgan v. Strickland, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 600, 2009-Ohio-1901, 906 N.E.2d 1105, \u00b6 10. The pertinent facts and circumstances are that audits of the financial reports by the state auditor had not been completed, potential claims by the federal and state governments prevented the completion of the audit, and possible harm to persons relying on the unaudited statements justified the county auditor\u2019s cautious approach in seeking the advice of the state auditor before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>agreeing to post the unaudited reports on his website with a warning approved by the state auditor.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Amu\">The Law Firm of Curt C. Hartman and Curt C. Hartman, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AC9\">Joseph Deters, Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney, and Christian J. Schaefer and Roger E. Friedman, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">{\u00b6 21} Second, because Patton failed to establish that the county auditor \u201cfailed to comply with an obligation in accordance with\u201d R.C. 149.43(B), he was also not entitled to an award of statutory damages. R.C. 149.43(C)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 22} Thus, Patton cannot prove that the court of appeals erred in denying his request for statutory damages and attorney fees, and we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b328-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
