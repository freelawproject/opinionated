Chapter 3115. The specific issue is whether the domestic relations division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over an interstate support order when the order is unrelated to a divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or annulment. We hold that the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court does have subject-matter jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant Ruby K. Pula is a resident of Hawaii and the custodian and maternal grandmother of K.G.P., a minor child born out of wedlock. K.G.P. resides \"with Pula; appellee, Adrienne Haunani Pula-Branch, KG.P.\u2019s birth mother, lives in Cleveland. On November 18, 2008, on Pula\u2019s behalf, appellant Cuyahoga Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cCSEA\u201d) filed in the domestic relations court a petition for child support and medical coverage against Pula-Branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">{\u00b6 3} On May 15, 2009, the trial court issued a child-support order, but CSEA timely appealed to the Eighth District Court of Appeals, challenging the trial court\u2019s calculation of child-support obligations. On January 20, 2010, the appellate court sua sponte raised the issue of the domestic court\u2019s jurisdiction over the underlying action and ordered briefing. The court ultimately concluded that the domestic relations court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the petition. The court held that the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court\u2019s jurisdiction was limited by R.C. 2301.03(L)(1) to matters involving \u201ca divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or annulment\u201d and reasoned that since this case involved none of the actions set forth in R.C. 2301.01(L)(1), the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court had no jurisdiction to address a UIFSA support order. <em>Pula v. Pula-Branch, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 93460, 2010-Ohio-912, 2010 WL 866154, \u00b6 8. The court noted that the case would be properly brought in juvenile court pursuant to R.C. 2151.23(B)(3), which states that the juvenile court has original jurisdiction under the UIFSA. Id. at \u00b6 14, fn. 4. The appellate court ordered the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court to vacate its order for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Pula </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>{\u00b6 4} CSEA appealed. The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal. <em>Pula v. Pula-Branch </em>126 Ohio St.3d 1581, 2010-Ohio-4542, 934 N.E.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 5} The UIFSA is codified in Ohio in R.C. Chapter 3115. Pursuant to R.C. 3115.16(B)(1), a \u201cresponding tribunal\u201d that receives a complaint from an initiating state may issue or enforce a support order \u201cto the extent otherwise authorized by law.\u201d R.C. 3115.01(R) defines \u201c[Responding tribunal\u201d as \u201cthe authorized tribunal in a responding state\u201d; the definition of \u201c[t]ribunal\u201d in R.C. 3115.01(X) includes \u201cany trial court of record of this state.\u201d There is no dispute that the domestic relations court is a tribunal under the statute. The central issue of this case is whether that court is \u201cauthorized\u201d; the appellate court held that the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court is authorized to hear and decide only cases that relate to a divorce, dissolution, legal separation, or annulment of a marriage. <em>Pula, </em>2010-Ohio-912, 2010 WL 866154, \u00b6 14. We disagree with the determination that the court\u2019s jurisdiction is so limited and therefore reverse the judgment of court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 6} The General Assembly defines the jurisdiction of the courts of common pleas and their respective divisions. Sections 4(A) and (B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution. R.C. 2301.03 establishes the jurisdiction of the state\u2019s domestic relations courts in separate subsections; their jurisdiction can vary by county. R.C. 2301.03(L)(1) applies specifically to the judges of Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court. That statute sets forth that the judges of that domestic relations court \u201cshall * * * exercise the same powers and jurisdiction * * * as other judges of the court of common pleas of Cuyahoga county and shall be elected and designated as judges of the court of common pleas, division of domestic relations. They shall have all the powers relating to all divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation, and annulment cases, except in cases that are assigned to some other judge of the court of common pleas for some special reason.\u201d R.C. 2301.03(L)(1) grants all the power in marriage-related cases to the domestic relations division, thus limiting the ability of other common pleas judges to preside over those cases. Conversely, there is no limiting language preventing domestic relations judges from having jurisdiction over other cases \u2014 they retain \u201cthe same powers and jurisdiction * * * as other judges of the court of common pleas.\u201d Thus, R.C. 2301.03(L)(1) is not a limiting provision, but rather a specific grant of authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 7} The appellate court held that Pula\u2019s petition should have been filed in juvenile court. <em>Pula, </em>2010-Ohio-912, 2010 WL 866154, \u00b6 14, fn. 4. R.C. 2151.23(B), which deals with the original jurisdiction of juvenile courts, states that juvenile courts have original jurisdiction \u201c[u]nder the uniform interstate family support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>act in Chapter 3115. of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 2151.23(B)(3). But that jurisdiction is not exclusive. R.C. 2151.23(A) sets forth the exclusive original jurisdiction of juvenile courts, and UIFSA cases are not listed among the matters over which juvenile courts have exclusive jurisdiction. This court has held that the distinction between exclusive original jurisdiction and nonexclusive original jurisdiction is crucial. In <em>Brookbank v. Gray </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 279, 658 N.E.2d 724, paragraph three of the syllabus, this court held that the issue of an illegitimate child\u2019s paternity may be litigated in a wrongful-death case in the court of common pleas. We held that although the \u201cjuvenile court has been given \u2018original jurisdiction\u2019 to determine the paternity of children born out of wedlock[,] * * *[t]his is in contrast to the \u2018exclusive original jurisdiction\u2019 given to the juvenile court over other matters.\u201d <em>Brookbank, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 293, 658 N.E.2d 724, quoting R.C. 2151.23(A) and (B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 8} Indeed, cases brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3115 are explicitly excluded from the juvenile court\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. R.C. 2151.23(A)(11) grants exclusive jurisdiction to juvenile courts to \u201chear and determine a request for an order for the support of any child if the request is not ancillary to an action for divorce, dissolution of marriage, annulment, or legal separation, <em>* * * or an action for support brought under Chapter \u00a7115. of the Revised Code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, if the sought-after support order arises in a domestic relations case or an R.C. Chapter 3115 case, the juvenile court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over support orders. Since juvenile courts do not have exclusive jurisdiction under R.C. Chapter 3115 claims, other courts may hear those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 9} The UIFSA is remedial legislation and as such, pursuant to R.C. 1.11, must be \u201cliberally construed in order to promote [its] object and assist the parties in obtaining justice.\u201d The facilitation of interstate support orders would not be promoted by foreclosing the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court from considering UIFSA cases that do not arise from a marriage. The Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court is a trial court of record in Ohio, one attuned to crafting support orders. The jurisdiction of the domestic relations division of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court is not limited by statute to cases involving marriage, divorce, separation, or annulment; those judges \u201cexercise the same powers and jurisdiction * * * as other judges of the court of common pleas of Cuyahoga county.\u201d R.C. 2301.03(L)(1). Finally, jurisdiction over an action for support brought under R.C. Chapter 3115 is not exclusive to juvenile courts. R.C. 2151.23(A)(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">{\u00b6 10} Therefore, we hold that the Cuyahoga County Domestic Relations Court does have jurisdiction over an action for support brought pursuant to R.C. Chapter 3115, even if the action does not arise from a divorce, dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or annulment. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>of the court of appeals and remand the case to the appellate court for further determination consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5a-\">William D.
