CCDCFS placed C.B. with foster parents. After more than a year, CCDCFS sought to be awarded permanent custody of the child and termination of the rights of the natural parents, thereby allowing the agency to place the child for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 2} The juvenile court denied CCDCFS\u2019s motion and terminated CCDCFS\u2019s temporary custody of the child. The court also ordered that the child be placed with the father. Accordingly, it granted the father legal custody of the child but continued CCDCFS\u2019s protective supervision of the child so that progressive in-home and overnight visitation with the father could be implemented. According to the court\u2019s order, the temporary-custody order was to terminate within the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 3} Two days later, CCDCFS filed a motion to modify the dispositional order. CCDCFS requested a two-month extension of temporary custody to complete the progressive visitation schedule. In the motion, CCDCFS asserted that the goal of gradual, increased visitation could not be achieved without the additional time. The court stayed the order that terminated CCDCFS\u2019s temporary custody, pending a hearing on CCDCFS\u2019s motion. The child\u2019s mother then appealed the order granting custody to the father, and the child\u2019s guardian ad litem filed a cross-appeal on behalf of the child, challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of CCDCFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody and the award of legal custody to the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 4} The Court of Appeals of Cuyahoga County dismissed the appeal on the authority of <em>In re Adams, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 86, 2007-Ohio-4840, 873 N.E.2d 886. The child\u2019s guardian ad litem sought discretionary review by this court, asking whether an award of legal custody by a trial court in a neglect or dependency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>proceeding is a final order from which an appeal may be taken by the minor child who is the subject of the order, whether an order granting legal custody is a final, appealable order, and whether a minor child in a permanent-custody case is entitled to counsel. We accepted jurisdiction. 125 Ohio St.3d 1461, 2010-Ohio-2753, 928 N.E.2d 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 5} For an order to be final and appealable, it must meet the requirements of R.C. 2505.02(B). R.C. 2505.02(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>In re Adams, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 86, 2007-Ohio-4840, 873 N.E.2d 886, a trial court denied a children-serviees agency\u2019s motion to modify an order granting it temporary custody to an order of permanent custody. The appellate court dismissed the agency\u2019s appeal of the denial for lack of a final, appealable order. This court affirmed and held, \u201cA trial court order denying the motion of a children-serviees agency to modify temporary custody to permanent custody and continuing temporary custody is not a final, appealable order under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) or (2).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">{\u00b6 10} The rationale for our conclusion in <em>Adams </em>was that the order denying permanent custody of the child to the children-serviees agency did not determine the action or prevent a judgment under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). <em>Adams </em>at \u00b6 36-37. Rather, the parties were subject to further court orders because the temporary-custody order remained in place and the status quo was thus maintained. Id. at \u00b6 36. Moreover, the children-serviees agency was not foreclosed from seeking a different dispositional order, such as returning the child to a parent, placing the child in the legal custody of a relative, or renewing a request for permanent custody. Id. at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">{\u00b6 11} We also concluded in <em>Adams </em>that a children-serviees agency does not have a substantial right in the permanent custody of a child based on the fact that the agency has temporary custody of the child. Id. at \u00b6 42. See R.C. 2505.02(B)(2). In contrast, a parent does have a substantial right in the custody of his or her child. Id. at \u00b6 43. This substantial right was a basis of the holdings of <em>In re Murray </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 155, 556 N.E.2d 1169, and <em>In re H.F., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 499, 2008-Ohio-6810, 900 N.E.2d 607. In <em>Murray, </em>this court held that \u201c[a]n adjudication by a juvenile court that a child is \u2018neglected\u2019 or \u2018dependent\u2019 as defined in R.C. Chapter 2151 followed by a disposition awarding temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>custody to a public children services agency pursuant to R.C. 2151.353(A)(2) constitutes a \u2018final order\u2019 within the meaning of R.C. 2505.02 and is appealable to the courts of appeals pursuant to R.C. 2501.02.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Murray, </em>syllabus. However, the principles supporting this conclusion were that parents who are suitable persons have a permanent right to the custody of their minor children, id. at 157, and that parents of children who have been adjudicated neglected or dependent, and who have been deprived of the custody of their children, have a right to immediate appellate review \u201cto determine if such deprivation meets the requirements justifying such deprivation,\u201d id. at 159. This holding was applied in <em>In re H.F., </em>120 Ohio St.3d 499, 2008-Ohio-6810, 900 N.E.2d 607, \u00b6 9, in which this court determined that an order adjudicating a child abused, neglected, and dependent, and awarding temporary custody of the child to a children-services agency, was a final order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, that had to be appealed by the child\u2019s parent within 30 days of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 12} The underlying principles decided in <em>Adams, Murray, </em>and <em>H.F. </em>guide our analysis in this case. We have previously held that custody hearings are special proceedings. R.C. 2505.02(B)(2); <em>Adams, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 86, 2007-Ohio-4840, 873 N.E.2d 886, \u00b6 43. And in this custody hearing, the juvenile court did not simply deny CCDCFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody of the child while continuing the placement of temporary custody with the agency. Rather, the juvenile court terminated CCDCFS\u2019s temporary custody and granted legal custody to the child\u2019s father. The juvenile court\u2019s disposition of legal custody was permanent and ended the existing proceeding with respect to the child. R.C. 2151.42.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the juvenile court\u2019s order determined the action and prevented any further judgment. R.C. 2505.02(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2505.02(A)(1) defines \u201csubstantial right\u201d as a \u201cright that the United States Constitution, the Ohio Constitution, a statute, the common law, or a rule of procedure entitles a person to enforce or protect.\u201d A substantial right is a legal right enforced and protected by law. State <em>ex rel. White v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 543, 545, 684 N.E.2d 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>{\u00b6 14} In this case, when the juvenile court considered CCDCFS\u2019s motion to modify temporary custody to permanent custody, the court was required by statute to consider whether that modification was in the best interests of the child. R.C. 2151.42(A). See also R.C. 2151.414(D) (the best-interest factors a court is to consider at a permanent-custody hearing); <em>In re Cunningham </em>(1979), 59 Ohio St.2d 100, 13 O.O.3d 78, 391 N.E.2d 1034 (the best-interest standard is the primary consideration in permanent-custody eases). In that same proceeding, however, the juvenile court was also required by statute to appoint a guardian ad litem, whose purpose is to protect the interest of the child and \u201cassist a court in its determination of a child\u2019s best interest.\u201d R.C. 2151.281(B); Sup.R. 48(B)(1). In this regard, the guardian\u2019s role is to \u201cperform whatever functions are necessary to protect the best interest of the child, including, but not limited to * * * monitoring the services provided the child by the public children services agency * * * [and filing] any motions and other court papers that are in the best interest of the child.\u201d R.C. 2151.281(1). See also Sup.R. 48(D)(1) (\u201cA guardian ad litem shall represent the best interest of the child for whom the guardian is appointed\u201d); Sup.R. 48(D)(7) (\u201cWhen a court appoints an attorney to serve as both the guardian ad litem and attorney for a child, the attorney shall advocate for the child\u2019s best interest and the child\u2019s wishes in accord with the Rules of Professional Conduct\u201d). Because of the unique role the guardian ad litem has in a permanent-custody proceeding with respect to ensuring that the best interests of a child are considered before custody modifications are made, the guardian ad litem has a statutory right to ensure that the best interests of the child are enforced and protected in the permanent-custody proceeding. Thus, we also conclude that the juvenile court\u2019s order affects a substantial right.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 15} Therefore, we hold that when a trial court denies a children-services agency\u2019s motion to modify temporary custody to permanent custody, terminates the placement of temporary custody with the agency, and awards legal custody to a parent, the order is final and appealable under R.C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 16} Appellants presented a third proposition of law that purports to raise a question whether a child who is a party in a permanent-custody case is entitled to legal counsel separate from that of the guardian ad litem who is also an attorney. In <em>In re Williams, </em>we held that \u201ca child who is the subject of a juvenile court proceeding to terminate parental rights is a party to that proceeding and, therefore, is entitled to independent counsel in certain circumstances.\u201d 101 Ohio St.3d 398, 2004-Ohio-1500, 805 N.E.2d 1110, syllabus. Appellants assert that the juvenile court abused its discretion in failing to appoint separate legal counsel to protect the child\u2019s wishes because of the conflict between the child\u2019s wishes and the father\u2019s interests. We are unable to agree with that assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In the juvenile court\u2019s 2008 entry appointing the guardian ad litem, there was no statement that the child\u2019s wishes conflicted with the father\u2019s interests. Neither did the guardian discover any conflict suggesting that appointment of independent counsel would be appropriate. Although the guardian ad litem in the trial court was acting only as to the child\u2019s best interest and not additionally in the capacity as the child\u2019s attorney, there is no indication that the guardian did not faithfully discharge his duties or that there was any reasonable basis for the juvenile court to have appointed independent counsel for the child. R.C. 2151.281(B)(1) and (D).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the \u201ccertain circumstances\u201d contemplated in <em>Williams </em>for the appointment of independent counsel to represent a child who is the subject of a proceeding to terminate parental rights are not currently presented in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">{\u00b6 18} In our independent review of the record before us, we are also unable to find any motion made to the trial court requesting that independent counsel be appointed for the child, and the trial court never had occasion to rule on this issue. Consequently, in addition to the record\u2019s not supporting the claim that the child required independent counsel in this case, the issue is not properly before this court, and we decline to consider this matter in the first instance. This proposition of law is therefore dismissed as having been improvidently accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 19} Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the appellate court for further proceedings consistent with our decision, in accordance with the expedited appeals provision of App.R. 11.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b378-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, Lanzinger, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b378-9\">O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b378-10\">Pfeifer J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-7\">.

See also R.C. 2151.353(A)(3)(a) (legal custody is a dispositional option following an initial adjudication of dependency, neglect, or abuse, provided the person to whom legal custody is awarded signs a statement that, among other things, states that \u201cthe person understands that legal custody of the child in question is intended to be permanent in nature and that the person will be responsible as the custodian for the child until <em>the </em>child reaches <em>the </em>age of majority\u201d); R.C. 2151.415(A)(3) (a children-services agency that has been awarded temporary custody may request that the child be placed in the legal custody of a relative or other interested individual).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\">. In March 2009, Sup.R. 48, which addresses guardians ad litem, became effective. In an attempt to provide guidance beyond that provided in R.C. 2151.281 for guardian ad litem situations, this rule clearly and specifically sets forth rules applicable to the appointment and responsibilities of a guardian ad litem. The rule requires that an order of appointment include a \u201cstatement regarding whether a person is being appointed as a guardian ad litem only or as a guardian ad litem and attorney for the child.\u201d Sup.R. 48(C)(1)(a). The rule also details the procedures for circumstances where a conflict of interest arises between the child\u2019s best interests and the child\u2019s wishes. Sup.R. 48(D)(1), (7), (8), and (10). Because this rule provides much needed guidance for situations involving guardians ad litem, future concerns with respect to the nature of a guardian\u2019s possible dual role as both guardian and counsel for the child should be alleviated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b379-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>McGee Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Af3\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 20} I concur in the judgment but write separately to express concern about how the legal system has handled C.B.\u2019s case. In 1997, Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act (\u201cASFA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 105-89, 111 Stat. 2115. A key aim of this act is to prevent children from languishing in the foster-care system. Ohio\u2019s codification of the ASFA provides that any child who is in temporary custody for 12 out of 22 months (with limited exceptions) shall have a prompt permanency determination. R.C. 2151.413(D)(1) and 2151.414(A)(1) and (A)(2). Yet five years after C.B. became a dependent child, she does not have permanency, the adults responsible for her continue to argue over legal issues, and she is slowly losing her ability to have a stable childhood with a permanent family.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 21} A parent\u2019s right to his or her children generally trumps the rights of all others, but not when there is clear and convincing evidence of abuse or neglect. <em>In re K.H., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 538, 2008-Ohio-4825, 895 N.E.2d 809, at \u00b6 40-42. In the event that a court removes a child from a parent because of abuse or neglect, the parent faces court orders to remedy the conditions causing the child\u2019s removal. If a parent fails within 12 months to remedy these problems or to make substantial progress toward their remediation, the child is entitled to a permanency determination. R.C. 2151.413(D)(1) and 2151.414(A)(1), (A)(2), and (E)(1). It is paramount that juvenile courts stick to these time frames for the best interest of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, the legal system has done harm to this child. No child should spend five years in foster care. It is unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 23} We are required to remand this case for determinations consistent with our decision. In so doing, I urge the courts to comply with the rules requiring the speedy resolution of abuse and neglect cases and to expeditiously move C.B.\u2019s case to finality. App.R. 11.2(C) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 24} When children must be removed from their parents, juvenile courts are required to resolve their cases within statutory time frames. We do no work that is more important than protecting children and giving them a right to a childhood free from abuse and neglect with a permanent family. In the best of circumstances, the birth family will be the permanent family, but when it cannot be, we owe it to these children to give them their best opportunity to be adopted into a loving, safe family. Unfortunately, the ability to be adopted diminishes as a child ages in the foster-care system. For this reason, Congress and Ohio enacted the provisions of the ASFA, and our courts must resolve these cases as quickly as possible.</p>\n<judges id=\"b379-11\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AqW\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">{\u00b6 25} I dissent. I would affirm the holding of the court of appeals that there is no final, appealable order in this case. I base this conclusion on the state of the record. The order committing the child to the temporary custody of the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services (\u201cCCDCFS\u201d) was never terminated. The court of appeals\u2019 entry denying a motion to reconsider its denial of an en banc consideration of the case tells the story:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cOnce again, the denial of a state\u2019s motion for permanent custody is not a final appealable order. Child is in protective custody of the county. Issues remain pending in the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 27} In an entry signed February 1, 2009, the juvenile court judge originally terminated CCDCFS\u2019s temporary custody, effective February 5, 2009; then, in response to a CCDCFS motion, in an order signed on February 3, 2009, the judge stayed the termination of temporary custody pending a February 27, 2009 hearing. Before that hearing was held, C.B.\u2019s mother appealed to the court of appeals. I would hold that there was no final order in place for the mother to have appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 28} The case unfolded like this. In the judgment entry signed February 1, 2009, the juvenile court judge decreed:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe order heretofore made committing the child to the temporary custody of the Cuyahoga County Department of Children and Family Services is terminated effective February 5, 2009. The child is committed to the protective supervision of CCDCFS with the legal custody of the father, Anthony Wylie</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cAmended case plan to be filed with the following modifications: reinstatement of unsupervised visitation; progressive implementation for in-home visitation, bi-weekly extended visitation, and overnight weekend visitation; referral for family preservation to assist child and parent with transition needs and services including appropriate day care, medical care, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThis matter is continued to February 27, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. for a custody review hearing pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 2151.417(C), for preliminary hearing upon the [child support enforcement agency\u2019s] motion to establish support filed April 18, 2006 and Attorney Witt\u2019s motion for attorney fees filed 4-28-08.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cParties are advised that they have thirty (30) days from the date of this entry to file an appeal with the Court of Appeals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-12\">{\u00b6 33} Despite the fact that the entry bears the date of February 1, 2009, under the judge\u2019s signature, a statement below that date reads, \u201cFiled with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>clerk and journalized by Cuyahoga Juvenile Court Clerks [sic] Office, Volume 10, Page 2556, February 5, 2009, cjdmh.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Asa\">R.

The agency asked that its temporary custody be extended to April 16, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 35} In response, the judge released another order:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cThis matter came on for consideration this 3rd day of February, 2009 before the Honorable Judge Alison L. Floyd upon the [sic] with prayer for as [sic] to the Child heretofore judged to be dependent.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cWhereupon the Court finds that CCDCFS through counsel has entered a written notice for modification of dispositional order. The Court, upon its own motion, shall stay its order terminating the agency temporary custody of the child pending hearing on February 27, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cIt is therefore ordered that the Court\u2019s prior order terminating the temporary custody of CCDCFS effective February 5, 2009 is stayed from execution pending review hearing on February 27, 2009 at 9:30 a.m. and for preliminary hearing upon the agency\u2019s motion for modification of the dispositional order of February 1, 2009.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 39} This order was dated February 3, 2009, beneath the judge\u2019s signature line. Again, a separate statement below that date states that the order was filed on February 5, 2009: \u201cFiled with the clerk and journalized by Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Clerks [sic] Office, Volume 10, Page 2138, February 5, 2009, cjds3.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">{\u00b6 40} C.B.\u2019s mother filed a notice of appeal on February 5, 2009. Nothing in the record indicates that the February 27, 2009 hearing that may have modified the court\u2019s decision ever occurred. There was no final order to form the basis of an appeal. This case was not over at the juvenile court level. Although the juvenile court\u2019s handling of this case until this point inspires little confidence, the correct disposition here is to affirm the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the case to the juvenile court for a resolution.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A30\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Katherine Hunt Federle, urging reversal for amicus curiae Justice for Children Project.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
