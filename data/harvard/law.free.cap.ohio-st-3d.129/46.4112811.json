The plan, developed in consultation with a wide array of interested parties, contains a variety of programs that are designed to increase energy efficiency and reduce peak demands on AEP\u2019s system. Such programs are required by law. R.C. 4928.66(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">{\u00b6 2} Industrial Energy Users-Ohio (\u201cIEU\u201d) appeals from the commission\u2019s approval of the plan on four grounds. None of its arguments compels reversal, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">{\u00b6 3} Under R.C. 4928.66, electric-distribution utilities must implement programs to increase energy efficiency and to reduce peak demand. R.C. 4928.66(A)(1)(a) and (b). Energy-efficiency measures reduce the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>energy required to perform tasks. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:l-39-01(L). \u201cPeak demand\u201d refers to the measure of electricity usage at the time when the most energy is being consumed simultaneously. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:l-39-01(R). Reducing peak demand, other things being equal, lowers the price of power and forestalls the need to add new generation plants. See, e.g., <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. Herrington </em>(C.A.D.C.1985), 768 F.2d 1355, 1414 (discussing benefits of peak-demand reductions). The statute imposes annual goals in both categories, R.C. 4928.66(A)(1)(a) and (b), and if an electric-distribution utility does not meet the goals, the law authorizes forfeitures, R.C. 4928.66(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">{\u00b6 4} The statute also allows the commission to approve \u201ca revenue-decoupling mechanism.\u201d R.C. 4928.66(D). Such mechanisms separate (or \u201cdecouple\u201d) the recovery of fixed distribution costs from the volume of sales. Before it can approve a proposed revenue-decoupling mechanism, the commission must determine two things: first, that the mechanism \u201cprovides for the recovery of revenue that otherwise may be foregone by the utility as a result of or in connection with the implementation by the electric distribution utility of any energy efficiency or energy conservation programs,\u201d and second, that the mechanism \u201creasonably aligns the interests of the utility and of its customers in favor of those programs.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 5} On November 12, 2009, the AEP operating companies, Columbus Southern Power (\u201cCSP\u201d) and Ohio Power Company, filed an application seeking approval of a \u201cThree-Year Program Portfolio Plan,\u201d which presented a three-year approach to meeting the companies\u2019 energy-efficiency and peak-demand-reduction goals. The plan had been developed in consultation -with a group of interested parties, and along with the plan, the companies filed a stipulation to help resolve various issues. Among other things, the stipulation provided AEP with a revenue-decoupling mechanism, which the parties expected to run for three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 6} IEU opposed the stipulation. It intervened, lodged objections to the portfolio plan, and sponsored testimony in support of its objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 7} The commission held a hearing on the stipulation on February 25, 2010, and on May 13, it issued an order modifying and approving the stipulation. One of the modifications pertained to the proposed decoupling mechanism. Instead of allowing the mechanism to run for three years (and thus end sometime in 2013), the commission prescribed an end date of January 1, 2011. This limitation on the period in which AEP could recover forgone revenue reflected the commission\u2019s concern whether the companies\u2019 distribution rates \u2014 which had last been reviewed in 1991 (CSP) and 1994 (Ohio Power Company) \u2014 accurately reflected their costs. The commission \u201cencouraged\u201d the companies \u201cto propose a mechanism to answer the Commission\u2019s concern regarding quantification of fixed costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>{\u00b6 8} IEU filed an application for rehearing, which the commission denied on July 14. This appeal followed. Apparently due to a filing error before the commission, IEU appealed the order only as it pertained to CSP and not to its sister company, Ohio Power Company. CSP has intervened as an appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">{\u00b6 9} IEU raises four propositions of law. All lack merit, and accordingly we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\n<em>A. IEU has not shown that the commission erred in modifying and approving the revenue-decoupling mechanism</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">{\u00b6 10} In its first proposition of law, IEU challenges the commission\u2019s approval of CSP\u2019s requested decoupling mechanism. The commission actually agreed with IEU\u2019s contention that \u201cthe record fails to establish what revenue is necessary to provide AEP-Ohio with the opportunity to recover its costs and to earn a fair and reasonable return.\u201d But rather than disapprove the decoupling mechanism altogether, the commission shortened its lifespan from three years to about seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">{\u00b6 11} We agree with IEU that the commission\u2019s reasoning had a serious flaw \u2014 which we address below \u2014 but at the same time, we do not see that the flaw warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">1. The outcome of the order was reasonable and lawful</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">{\u00b6 12} IEU\u2019s argument assumes that CSP was required to prove \u201c \u2018what revenue is necessary to provide [it] with the opportunity to recover its costs and to earn a fair and reasonable return.\u2019 \u201d According to IEU, this cost-of-service evidence is required by R.C. 4928.66(D) and Ohio Adm.Code 4901:l-39-07(A). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">{\u00b6 13} We can quickly dispense with the administrative-rule argument made by IEU. Ohio Adm.Code 4901:l-39-07(A) contains no requirement that utilities demonstrate their cost of service. It simply allows \u201cappropriate lost distribution revenues.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">{\u00b6 14} As for the statute, R.C. 4928.66(D) contains two requirements that an application for a revenue-decoupling mechanism must meet before the commission may approve it, but IEU does not explain which one it alleges was not met, and we fail to see any statutory violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">{\u00b6 15} The first requirement is that the decoupling mechanism provide only for \u201cthe recovery of revenue that otherwise may be foregone by the utility as a result of or in connection with the implementation by the electric distribution utility of any energy efficiency or energy conservation programs.\u201d This clause does not require the commission to find that the recovery of the lost revenue is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>to recover costs and to ensure a fair rate of return. In fact, the word \u201crevenue\u201d means the opposite: it means \u201c[gr]ross income or receipts.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1344. If CSP loses sales, it loses gross income, regardless of its costs, so the first part of subsection (D) does not prohibit recovery.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">{\u00b6 16} The second part of R.C. 4928.66(D) requires the commission to find that the decoupling mechanism \u201creasonably aligns the interests of the utility and of its customers in favor of [energy-efficiency and energy-conservation] programs.\u201d This part of the statute also does not require what IEU says was needed: evidence of the utility\u2019s cost of service.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">{\u00b6 17} Thus, none of the authorities cited by IEU require evidence of the utility\u2019s cost of service. Nevertheless, the commission plainly took the lack of cost evidence into account. Sharing IEU\u2019s concern that CSP\u2019s distribution rates might be too high, the commission sharply limited the period in which CSP could recoup lost revenue. If anyone was harmed by that decision, it was CSP, but CSP did not appeal. We therefore need not decide whether R.C. 4928.66 entitled the commission to do what it did: reduce the recovery of lost revenue based on concerns regarding the utility\u2019s cost of service. But the statute plainly does not do what IEU wants it to: absolutely prohibit recovery if the utility\u2019s cost of service is unknown. For these reasons, we affirm this part of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">2. Although the commission erred in its reasoning, that error does not warrant remand</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 18} Although we affirm the commission\u2019s order regarding decoupling, we are troubled by some of the reasoning in the commission\u2019s order. The commission appeared to believe that the requirement that its findings be based on record evidence is somehow lessened when the commission is reviewing a stipulation. For example, the commission stated in its entry on rehearing that \u201cin a litigated case,\u201d it \u201cwould have required more information to find that AEP-Ohio had met its burden of proof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">{\u00b6 19} Contrary to the commission\u2019s statement, this <em>was </em>\u201ca litigated case\u201d\u2014 IEU contested the stipulation. When the commission reviews a contested stipulation, the requirement of evidentiary support remains operative. While the commission \u201cmay place substantial weight on the terms of a stipulation,\u201d it \u201cmust determine, <em>from the evidence, </em>what is just and reasonable.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 123, 126, 592 N.E.2d 1370. Numerous cases, including several in the last ten years, confirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the point. See, e.g., <em>Duff v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 367, 379, 10 O.O.3d 493, 384 N.E.2d 264 (\u201cThe commission may take the stipulation into consideration, but must determine what is just and reasonable from the evidence presented at the hearing\u201d); <em>Elyria Foundry Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 305, 2007-Ohio-4164, 871 N.E.2d 1176, \u00b6 38; <em>Constellation NewEnergy, Inc. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 530, 2004-Ohio-6767, 820 N.E.2d 885, \u00b6 49; <em>AK Steel Corp. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 81, 83, 765 N.E.2d 862. Indeed, the very case cited by the commission concerning the approval of stipulations made precisely this point: \u201cstipulations are considered merely as recommendations to the commission and, while entitled to substantial weight, they must be supported by the evidence of record to withstand [appellate] scrutiny.\u201d <em>Indus. Energy Consumers of Ohio Power Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 559, 563, 629 N.E.2d 423. The agreement of <em>some </em>parties is no substitute for the many procedural protections reinforced by the evidentiarysupport requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">{\u00b6 20} Here, however, no one challenges the legality of the commission\u2019s specific decision to cut short CSP\u2019s decoupling mechanism. And IEU has not shown that the law required the commission to go any further. While the commission may have erred in its reasoning, that error is harmless. For that reason, we reject IEU\u2019s first proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\n<em>B. Contrary to IEU\u2019s assertions, the commission considered price impact</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 21} In its second proposition of law, IEU argues that the commission failed to \u201cconsider}] the overall rate impacts on Ohio customers.\u201d This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">{\u00b6 22} The commission expressly considered the impact of rate increases. The order contained a section entitled \u201cConsideration of Rate Increases.\u201d In that section, the commission discussed IEU\u2019s argument that \u201capproval of the Stipulation will result in a rate increase for customers\u201d and that the commission should not view the increase in isolation \u201cbut must consider other recent rate increases approved by the Commission.\u201d The entry on rehearing stated, \u201cThe Commission is mindful of the rate impact of this case on AEP-Ohio\u2019s customers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">{\u00b6 23} The commission considered overall effects of rates, and we reject IEU\u2019s second proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\n<em>C. IEU has not shown that CSP\u2019s plan for reducing peak demand was unlawful</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">{\u00b6 24} In its third proposition of law, IEU raises two challenges to CSP\u2019s plan for reducing peak demand. One challenge was forfeited, and the other is flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>{\u00b6 25} IEU\u2019s first argument is that CSP\u2019s peak-reduction program is \u201cnot designed to achieve\u201d the statutory mandates of R.C. 4928.66. This argument was not raised before the commission on rehearing, so we lack jurisdiction to consider it. See, e.g., <em>Ohio Partners for Affordable Energy v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 208, 2007-Ohio-4790, 874 N.E.2d 764, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">{\u00b6 26} IEU did raise its second argument below, but it lacks merit. The commission did not adopt IEU\u2019s preferred way of reducing peak demand \u2014 details on that method need not be discussed to dispose of IEU\u2019s argument. Pertinent here, IEU asserts that its preferred method \u201ccould lower the overall cost of AEP-Ohio\u2019s Portfolio Plan by approximately $7 million.\u201d IEU then argues, \u201cIgnoring known lower cost options that reduce the overall cost of AEP-Ohio\u2019s Portfolio Plan does not benefit ratepayers and is not in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">{\u00b6 27} IEU is attacking a discretionary decision, so our standard of review is deferential. The statute creates a goal (peak-demand reduction), but does not tell the commission how to get there. See R.C. 4928.66(A)(1)(b). This gives the commission discretion to find its way. See, e.g., <em>Payphone Assn. v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>109 Ohio St.3d 453, 2006-Ohio-2988, 849 N.E.2d 4, \u00b6 25 (\u201cWhen a statute does not prescribe a particular formula, the PUCO is vested with broad discretion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">{\u00b6 28} IEU has not shown an abuse of discretion. We will assume for the sake of argument that IEU\u2019s preferred method is in fact less expensive than the one proposed by CSP. Even so, the mere fact that one program is less expensive than another is not grounds for selecting it. The applicable statute does not require use of the \u201cleast cost\u201d method. See R.C. 4928.66(A)(1)(b); cf. R.C. 4928.142(C) (requiring selection of the \u201cleast-cost bid\u201d). And as a matter of common sense, one must evaluate costs <em>and </em>benefits, but IEU adduces no evidence showing the relative benefits of the competing plans. CSP\u2019s peak-demand-reduction plan covers multiple years and numerous industries and rate classes to address a highly complex problem, and there are many concerns (beyond simple cost) that CSP and the commission must account for in structuring these plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">{\u00b6 29} While cost is surely a relevant concern to be balanced in evaluating peak-demand-reduction plans, it is not the only concern, and the commission is entitled to consider more. IEU\u2019s third proposition of law is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\n<em>D. IEU has not shown that the commission erred when it rejected a cost-saving program designed for mercantile customers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">{\u00b6 30} In its fourth proposition of law, IEU argues that the commission erred by \u201cprohibiting * * * mercantile customers from relying on the \u2018benchmark comparison method\u2019 for agreements reached after December 10, 2009.\u201d R.C. 4928.66(A)(2)(c) permits the commission to \u201cexempt mercantile customers\u201d from paying energy-efficiency and peak-demand-reduction charges if those customers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>\u201ccommit their demand-response or other customer-sited capabilities\u201d toward the utility\u2019s energy-reduction goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">{\u00b6 31} The stipulation proposed two methods allowing mercantile customers to seek this rate exemption. The commission rejected one of them (the \u201cbenchmark-comparison method\u201d) because it had already decided against using this method in the related rulemaking case. This method had been favored by IEU.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">{\u00b6 32} On appeal, IEU lists several aspects of this decision that it disagrees with, but none of its complaints demonstrates reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">{\u00b6 33} IEU emphasizes that \u201c[t]he PUCO unilaterally modified the only universally supported provision\u201d of the stipulation. But the commission \u201cis not bound to accept the terms of any stipulation,\u201d <em>Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>114 Ohio St.3d 340, 2007-Ohio-4276, 872 N.E.2d 269, \u00b6 16, so this does not provide grounds to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">{\u00b6 34} IEU also states that the commission\u2019s rules do not address \u201cwhat criteria must be met in order for a mercantile customer to qualify for an exemption from the rider.\u201d But the commission addressed this issue in its entry on rehearing. It explained that it was in the process of developing an application and filing instructions to enable mercantile customers to request the exemption. IEU gives us no reason to think that the commission needed to develop these specific standards <em>before </em>it approved the wide-ranging portfolio plan \u2014 of which mercantile-exemption applications are but a part. At its heart, then, IEU\u2019s attack is against a docket-management decision. We generally defer to the commission on such decisions, <em>Toledo Coalition for Safe Energy v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 559, 560, 23 O.O.3d 474, 433 N.E.2d 212, and do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">{\u00b6 35} Finally, IEU states, \u201cThe [commission] failed to articulate why the benchmark compliance methodology * * * is not an appropriate methodology or does not meet the settlement review criteria.\u201d That is not true \u2014 the commission did articulate why IEU\u2019s preferred method was not an appropriate method. As already noted, the commission had rejected use of that method in a separate rulemaking case. This was a reasonable basis on which to act: \u201can administrative agency cannot ignore its own rules.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kroger Co. v. Morehouse </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 129, 133, 656 N.E.2d 936. Like its other arguments, IEU\u2019s last complaint does not support reversal. We reject its fourth proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b194-11\">{\u00b6 36} For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-12\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-13\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AS8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>McNees, Wallace &amp; Nurick, L.L.C., Samuel C.
