Because the court of appeals did not err in so holding, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-13\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">{\u00b6 2} On December 4, 2008, appellant, Raleigh M. Striker, went to the office of appellee, Daniel F. Smith, the clerk of the Mansfield Municipal Court. Striker orally requested access to records filed with the clerk in <em>Calhoun, Kademenos &amp; Childress Co., L.P.A. v. Shepherd, </em>Mansfield M.C. No. 2006 CVH-3913. The clerk advised Striker that the clerk\u2019s case file for the <em>Shepherd </em>case was in the custody of Judge Jeff Payton and that the records in the file would not be accessible to the public until the case file, which had been in the possession of Judge Payton since February 2008, was returned to the clerk\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-15\">{\u00b6 3} Striker then requested that the Mansfield law director, as the clerk\u2019s counsel, provide access to the records, but he was informed that his request could not be satisfied for the reason expressed by the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>{\u00b6 4} On December 29, 2008, Striker presented a written request to the clerk for \u201ccopies of Mansfield Municipal Court Civil Docket case number for the dates of:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c12/20/2006 remand</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c1/02/07 remand SC</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c1/31/07 memorandum</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c4/30/07 je\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 9} The request corresponded to the following notations on the clerk\u2019s docket for the <em>Shepherd </em>case:</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c12/20/2006 Case to Judge Payton for remand</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c01/02/2007 Case remand to Mag.

The clerk made the following notation on Striker\u2019s written request: \u2018Waiting on Judge Payton, Dan Smith, 12-29-08.\u201d The clerk did not ask Striker to leave a copy of his written request \"with the clerk\u2019s office, and Striker left the office with his request. The case file was returned to the clerk\u2019s office late that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-17\">{\u00b6 17} The next day, December 30, 2008, Striker filed a pro se complaint in the Court of Appeals for Richland County for a writ of mandamus to compel the clerk to provide access to the requested court records in <em>Shepherd </em>and to award statutory damages and expenses. Attached to Striker\u2019s complaint was a copy of a January 1, 2007 entry in <em>Shepherd </em>in which Judge Payton noted that the case had come before him on December 20, 2006, and ordered that the case be remanded to the court magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-18\">{\u00b6 18} On January 20, 2009, the clerk provided copies of three of the four requested court records from the <em>Shepherd </em>case to Striker. These were the only existing records that satisfied Striker\u2019s records request. Striker subsequently secured counsel, and the parties filed an agreed statement of facts and briefs. Striker also filed a motion for an award of statutory damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>{\u00b6 19} In February 2010, the court of appeals denied the writ of mandamus<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to compel the clerk to provide the requested court records to Striker because the claim was moot insofar as Striker admitted that the clerk had provided three of the four requested records and \u201cthe parties agree the fourth item was not a public record.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Striker v. Smith, </em>Richland App. No. 2008-CA-0336, 2010-Ohio-457, 2010 WL 466051, \u00b6 4. The court of appeals also denied Striker\u2019s request for statutory damages and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 20} This cause is now before the court upon Striker\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cMandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6; R.C. 149.43(C)(1). Court records are generally public records subject to disclosure under the Public Records Act. See <em>State ex rel. Cincinnati Enquirer v. Winkler, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 382, 2004-Ohio-1581, 805 N.E.2d 1094, \u00b6 5 (\u201ccourt records fall within the broad definition of a \u2018public record\u2019 in R.C. 149.43(A)(1)\u201d); <em>State ex rel. WBNS TV, Inc. v. Dues, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 406, 2004-Ohio-1497, 805 N.E.2d 1116, \u00b6 27 (\u201cany record used by a court to render a decision is a record subject to R.C. 149.43\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is no dispute here that the <em>Shepherd </em>case records requested by Striker constituted public records, which are generally subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">{\u00b6 22} The court of appeals denied Striker\u2019s request for a writ of mandamus to compel the clerk to provide access to the requested records. The court of appeals correctly ruled that for three of the four court records from the <em>Shepherd </em>case requested by Striker, the clerk\u2019s provision of them to Striker rendered that portion of his mandamus claim moot. \u201cIn general, providing the requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>records to the relator in a public-records mandamus case renders the mandamus claim moot.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Toledo Blade Co. v. Toledo-Lucas Cty. Port Auth., </em>121 Ohio St.3d 537, 2009-Ohio-1767, 905 N.E.2d 1221, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 23} For the remaining requested court record, Striker argues and the clerk concedes that the court of appeals erred in stating in its opinion that the parties agreed that the record corresponding to the \u201c12/20/2006 remand\u201d notation did not exist; there was no such agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 24} Striker claims that the clerk\u2019s assertion that the requested record does not exist is false because, <em>after this appeal was filed, </em>he discovered a copy of Judge Payton\u2019s journal entry date-stamped \u201cJanuary 1, 2007,\u201d which refers to a December 20, 2006 date, remanding the case to a court magistrate. But this journal entry was attached to Striker\u2019s mandamus complaint, which he filed in the court of appeals, so he already had obtained a copy of it, thus rendering his claim moot. <em>Toledo Blade Co. </em>at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 25} And the clerk introduced evidence that there was no December 20, 2006 remand order. The clerk had \u201cno duty to create or provide access to nonexistent records.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Lanham v. Smith, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 527, 2007-Ohio-609, 861 N.E.2d 530, \u00b6 15. In fact, the remand order stamped \u201cJanuary 1, 2007\u201d appears to correspond to Striker\u2019s second requested <em>Shepherd </em>record, i.e., a \u201c1/02/07 remand,\u201d because it is doubtful that the clerk\u2019s office was open for filing entries on January 1; the parties agreed in the proceeding below, however, that the clerk had provided the record relating to that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 26} Therefore, the court of appeals did not err in denying Striker\u2019s public-records mandamus claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\n<em>Statutory Damages and Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">{\u00b6 27} Striker argues that notwithstanding the clerk\u2019s provision of three of the four <em>Shepherd </em>records following his initiation of the mandamus action, the court of appeals erred in denying his request for statutory damages and attorney fees regarding his moot claim. Striker claims that the clerk failed to comply with the R.C. 149.43(B)(1) requirement that copies of requested public records be made available \u201cwithin a reasonable period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">{\u00b6 28} At both times that Striker requested the public records, however, the clerk did not have possession of them. Instead, the judge had possession of the requested records. The clerk did not have any duty to provide Striker with copies of records that he did not possess. See <em>State ex rel. Vitoratos v. Gross </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 22, 23, 53 O.O.2d 12, 262 N.E.2d 864; <em>State ex rel. Bradley v. Shannon </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St.2d 115, 116, 53 O.O.2d 307, 265 N.E.2d 260 (\u201cThere can be no clear legal duty on one to furnish records which are not in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>possession or control\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Marshall v. Fuerst </em>(Feb. 20, 1997), Cuyahoga App. No. 78609, 1997 WL 72134.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-2f\">Lori A. McGinnis, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A45O\">David L. Remy, Mansfield Law Director, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">{\u00b6 29} Based on the foregoing, because Striker\u2019s public-records mandamus claims lacked merit, the court of appeals did not err in denying his request for statutory damages and attorney fees. See <em>State ex rel. Mahajan v. State Med. Bd. of Ohio, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 497, 2010-Ohio-5995, 940 N.E.2d 1280, \u00b6 64 (denying request for statutory damages and attorney fees for reasons including that most of the public-records claims lacked merit).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 30} The court of appeals did not err in denying Striker\u2019s public-records mandamus claim for access to the requested court records or in denying his request for statutory damages and attorney fees. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b314-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-10\">. . The court of appeals also granted a writ of mandamus to compel the clerk to post a copy of his office\u2019s public-records policy in the clerk\u2019s office, but this appeal does not concern that portion of the court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b312-11\">. {\u00b6 a} Sup.R. 45(A) provides that \u201c[cjourt records are presumed open to public access.\u201d Sup.R. 47(A)(1) states: \u201cThe provisions of Sup.R. 44 through 47 <em>requiring </em>redaction or omission of information in case documents or restricting public access to case documents shall apply only to case documents in actions commenced on or after the effective date of this rule. Access to ease documents in actions commenced prior to the effective date of Sup.R. 44 through 47 shall be governed by federal and state law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">{\u00b6 b} This case, which challenges the alleged refusal of a municipal court clerk to timely provide copies of case documents, involves a 2008 request for records from a case that was commenced in 2006. Sup.R. 44 through 47 became effective on July 1, 2009. Therefore, under Sup.R. 47(A)(1), the court\u2019s public-access superintendence rules are inapplicable to Striker\u2019s records request.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
