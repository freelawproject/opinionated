He appeals his sentences, contending (1) that the district court, in determining his offense levels under the Sentencing Guidelines, failed to apply the safety-valve provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(6), and (2) that the court should have departed downward from the guideline range in imposing his sentences. He therefore asks that his sentences be vacated and the case remanded for resen-tencing. We begin with appellant\u2019s second point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>Appellant contends that he is entitled to a downward departure because the Immigration and Naturalization Service has notified him that he will be deported upon his release from prison, and a downward departure would save taxpayers\u2019 money. We do not review a district court\u2019s refusal to make a downward departure unless the court, in entertaining a defendant\u2019s request for a departure, indicates that it lacks the authority to depart. Nothing in this record indicates that the court thought that it lacked such authority; hence, appellant\u2019s second point is merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-4\">Appellant\u2019s first issue, however, is another matter. The guidelines direct the district court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two levels if the offense level is greater than 26 and the defendant meets the criteria set forth in \u00a7 5C1.2. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 (b)(6). Section 5C1.2 applies if (1) the defendant does not have more than one \u201ccriminal history point,\u201d (2) \u201cthe defendant did not use violence or credible threats of violence or possess a firearm or other dangerous weapon (or induce another participant to do so) in connection with the offense,\u201d (3) \u201cthe offense did not result in the death of or serious bodily injury to any person,\u201d (4) \u201cthe defendant was not an organizer, leader, manager or supervisor of others in the offense, as determined under the sentencing guidelines[,] and was not engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise, as defined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848,\u201d and (5) \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.... [T]he fact that the defendant has no relevant or useful other information to provide or that the Government is already aware of the information shall not preclude a determination by the court that the defendant has complied with this requirement.\u201d The burden is on the defendant, of course, to establish these criteria. <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-5\">We cannot engage in meaningful appellate review of a sentence unless the district court sets out the facts underpinning the guidelines it applied in fashioning the defendant\u2019s sentence or the record plainly establishes such facts. In deciding not to apply \u00a7 5C1.2 in this case, the district court, without hearing argument of counsel on the issue, stated only that it did \u201cnot feel the safety-valve applies in this case.\u201d Other than this brief comment, nothing in the record tells us why the court concluded that the appellant did not qualify for a \u00a7 5C1.2 reduction. Furthermore, the evidence in the record does not clearly establish that he did not qualify. For example, the appellant has but one criminal history point; there is no indication that he made threats of violence or used a firearm in committing the offenses (although a firearm was found during the search of appellant\u2019s apartment); there is no indication that anyone was injured as a result of the offenses; and the Government did not establish that appellant was a leader or organizer of. the criminal activity. Finally, in acknowledging that appellant had provided information to the authorities, the court did not determine whether he provided all of the information that he possessed concerning the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-7\">In sum, the lack of findings \u2014 explicit or implicit \u2014 on these issues precludes meaningful appellate review of the safety-valve issue. We therefore vacate appellant\u2019s sentences and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1452-8\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
