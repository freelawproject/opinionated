Hicks, </em>798 F.2d 446, 451 (11th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1035, 107 S.Ct. 886, 93 L.Ed.2d 839 (1987). This court reviews the district court\u2019s drug-quantity determination for clear error. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>115 F.3d 843, 845 (11th Cir.1997). However, if a party fails to raise objections to an issue before the district court, this court should review this issue only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Chisholm, </em>73 F.3d 304, 307 (11th Cir.1996). This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guidelines to the facts. <em>United States v. Barakat, </em>130 F.3d 1448, 1452 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-17\">Upon review of the trial and sentencing transcripts and the presentenee investigation report, and upon consideration of the arguments of the parties, we find no reversible error as to admission of extrinsic-offense evidence under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b) with regard to both defendants. However, we find reversible error as to the district court\u2019s \u201crounding-up\u201d drug-quantity conversions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1441-18\">\n<em>Admission of Extrinsic Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Akm\">Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1441-19\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident, provided that upon request by the accused the prosecution in a criminal case shall provide reasonable notice in advance of trial, ... of the general nature of any such evidence it intends to introduce at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1441-20\">The principles governing \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is the same whether the conduct occurs before or after the offenses charged. <em>United States v. Delgado, </em>56 F.3d 1357, 1365 (11th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>516 U.S. 1049, 116 S.Ct. 713, 133 L.Ed.2d 667 (1996). The \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence is evaluated under a three-part test: (1) the evidence must be relevant to an issue other than the defendant\u2019s character; (2) the act must be established by sufficient proof to permit a jury finding that the defendant committed the extrinsic act; and (3) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by its undue prejudice, and the evidence must meet the requirements of Rule 403. <em>United States v. Miller, </em>959 F.2d 1535, 1538 (11th Cir.) (en <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1358\">*1358</page-number>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 942, 113 S.Ct. 382, 121 L.Ed.2d 292 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-4\">A defendant who enters a not guilty plea makes intent a material issue which imposes a substantial burden on the government to prove intent, which it may prove by qualifying Rule 404(b) evidence absent affirmative steps by the defendant to remove intent as an issue. <em>Delgado, </em>56 F.3d at 1365. The relevance of other crimes evidence to intent is determined by comparing the defendant\u2019s state of mind in committing both the extrinsic and charged offenses. <em>Id. </em>Where the state of mind required for both offenses is the same, the extrinsic crime is relevant to the charged offense. <em>Id. </em>As to the second prong of the three-part test, other crimes evidence has a relatively high incremental value and is not easily excludable where the government does not have overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s predisposition to commit the crime or of knowledge of such matters. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>764 F.2d 1514, 1523 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub. nom Crespo-Diaz v. United States, </em>474 U.S. 952, 106 S.Ct. 320, 88 L.Ed.2d 303 (1985). Extrinsic evidence which is \u201cvery similar\u201d to the charged offense as to their \u201coverall purposes\u201d may be highly probative. <em>Delgado, </em>56 F.3d at 1366. Although the period of time separating the extrinsic conviction and the charged offense may lessen the probative value of the extrinsic evidence, this court has held that a subsequent conviction fifteen months after the charged offense was properly admitted. <em>United States v. Terebecki, </em>692 F.2d 1345, 1349 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-5\">The extrinsic evidence introduced against Zapata and Ocampo was documents showing their convictions, and thus satisfying the second prong of the three-part test. Both Zapata and Ocampo pled not guilty, making intent a material issue. Neither of their attorneys took affirmative steps before the trial to indicate that the government would be relieved of proving intent. Their convictions involved the same state of mind at issue in the charged offenses. Therefore, the other crimes evidence was plainly relevant to the issue of intent, and the first prong is met. As to the third prong, the government did not have overwhelming evidence of either Zapata\u2019s or Ocampo\u2019s intent to conspire and to distribute marijuana because all parties and the court agreed that the testimony of Castillo and Ovido was not credible. Without that testimony, the government could only rely on the testimony of Norma Castillo and the testimony of Agents James Duff and Maurine Murphy. Norma Castillo testified that she saw Zapata come to her house to visit her husband, Rolando Castillo, and she also saw Ocampo in the van on the day of her husband\u2019s arrest. The agents testified that they saw Ocampo in a crime-suspected area under surveillance. In addition, both Zapata\u2019s and Ocampo\u2019s extrinsic offenses were sufficiently similar to the charged offense because the overall purpose for each offense was trafficking in marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-7\">Finally, neither Zapata nor Ocampo can show undue prejudice. Ocampo\u2019s extrinsic conviction, which was fourteen months from the date of the charged offense, was not so remote as to be probative. Their extrinsic convictions were not heinous acts which would have produced an irrational response from the jury nor were likely to mislead or confuse the jury. <em>Richardson, </em>764 F.2d at 1523. At the time of the admission of the extrinsic evidence and in the final jury instructions, the district judge diminished the prejudicial impact of the evidence by properly instructing the jury for what limited purpose the extrinsic evidence was to be used.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-8\">\n<em>Attributable Drug Quantities</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-9\">At sentencing, the district court determined that the quantity of marijuana attributable to both Zapata and Ocampo individually was 44 pounds which would yield a base offense level of 18 based on between 20 to 40 kilograms of marijuana. Although during Ocampo\u2019s sentencing the probation officer remarked that 44 pounds of marijuana actually converted to 19.9584 kilograms of marijuana, resulting in a base offense level of 16, the district court \u201crounded up\u201d the drug quantity to twenty kilograms. Zapata failed to object to the drug quantity conversion at sentencing; Ocampo objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1442-10\">As the probation officer correctly noted, the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 drug quantity table is clear and unambiguous that the conversion of 44 pounds of marijuana equals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>19.9584 kilograms. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 10) (measurement conversion table) (\u201c1 lb = .04536 kg\u201d). The language of the Sentencing Guidelines is to be given its plain and ordinary meaning, unless to do so would produce \u201can absurd result contrary to the drafters\u2019 manifest intent.\u201d <em>United States v. Tham, </em>118 F.3d 1501, 1506-1507 (11th Cir.1997). An offense level of 16 is specified if the defendant was attributed with \u201c[a]t least 10 KG but less than 20 KG of Marihuana.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(12). Because Zapata and Ocampo were each attributed with 44 pounds, which converts to 19.9584 kilograms of marijuana, the plain meaning of \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(12) directs a base offense level of 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-4\">Although sentencing may be based on fair, accurate, and conservative estimates of the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant, sentencing cannot be based on calculations of drug quantities that are merely speculative. <em>United States v. Brazel, </em>102 F.3d 1120, 1159 n. 32 and 33 (averaging the quantity of drugs by \u201crounding down\u201d), 1160, 1161 n .34 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 118 S.Ct. 79, 139 L.Ed.2d 37, 139 L.Ed.2d 37 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-7\">The district court\u2019s \u201crounding up\u201d of the drug quantity calculation was not based on any legal or factual support as there was no finding that either defendant was involved in relevant conduct that would prove that they were involved with \u201cat least\u201d 20 kilograms of marijuana. In fact, the district court rejected the government\u2019s argument that 110 pounds of marijuana was attributable to Ocampo as relevant conduct, and specifically found that Ocampo was responsible for only 44 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-8\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting extrinsic-offense evidence to prove Zapata and Ocam-po\u2019s intent. However, we conclude that the district court clearly erred in \u201crounding-up\u201d Ocampo\u2019s drug-quantity conversion, and committed plain error when it \u201crounded-up\u201d Zapata\u2019s drug-quantity conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1443-9\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM Zapata\u2019s and Ocampo\u2019s convictions, but VACATE their sentences, and REMAND for resentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
