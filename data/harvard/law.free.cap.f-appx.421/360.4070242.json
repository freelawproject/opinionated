More-land argues that his 24-month sentence, which was outside of the recommended guidelines range, was unreasonable. Moreland did not object to his sentence. Accordingly, we review his appeal for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-21\">Because the 24-month sentence More-land received on revocation was less than the term authorized by statute, it is \u201cclearly legal.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1997). Moreover, this court has \u201croutinely upheld release revocation sentences in excess of the advisory range but within the statutory maximum\u201d as satisfying both the plainly unreasonable and unreasonableness standards. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 343, 344 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>see United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>States v.
