The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissed his appeal of the denial of relief by the Immigration Judge (IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Chen makes no argument challenging the determination that he was not eligible for protection under the CAT. He has thus waived any such argument. <em>See Calderon-Ontiveros v. I.N.S., </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">We review questions of law de novo and review factual findings \u201cunder the substantial evidence test, reversing only when the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the petitioner statutorily eligible for relief.\u201d <em>Arif v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 677, 679-80 (5th Cir.2007) (footnote, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (\u201c[T]he administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d). The determinations that an alien is not eligible for asylum or for withholding of removal are factual findings reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Chen contends that the BIA erred as a matter of law in concluding that his credible testimony was insufficient to meet his burden of proving that he had a well-founded fear of persecution. An alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient to sustain his burden if it is credible, is persuasive, <em>and, </em>contains sufficient specific facts to prove he is a refugee. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a). Accordingly, the BIA did not err as a matter of law by finding that Chen\u2019s credible testimony failed to meet his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Chen argues that the BIA and IJ erred by determining that (1) he did not show past persecution, (2) he failed to establish past persecution on account of his imputed affiliation and membership in Falun Gong, and (3) he failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution based on a protected ground. The evidence in this case is not \u201cso compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the petitioner statutorily eligible for relief.\u201d <em>Arif, </em>509 F.3d at 679-80. Thus, the determinations that Chen was not eligible for asylum or for withholding of removal will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">Chen\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b489-39\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
