Rodriguez claims that his 63-month prison sentence, which was the bottom of the properly calculated guidelines range, is unreasonable and that he should have been sentenced below the guidelines range as he requested. Rodriguez asserts that the district court abused its discretion by considering factors that did not comport -with the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and by failing to consider factors that did.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-23\">Reasonableness review is bifurcated; if a review of the sentence for procedural error reveals none, the appellate court then determines whether the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If error has been preserved, an appellate court reviewing for reasonableness \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A court commits procedural error if it \u201cfail[s] to calculate (or improperly calculates]) the Guidelines range [or] fail[s] to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586. Substantive reasonableness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>is determined in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id. </em>at 49-50,128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">Rodriguez contends that the district court improperly focused on two concerns that were \u201coutside the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d in considering Rodriguez\u2019s request for a downward variance. First, Rodriguez contends that the court discounted his request for a variance because it found that the request was not \u201cunusual\u201d since Rodriguez\u2019s attorney had \u201cargued for a variance in every case\u201d that day, and that another assistant federal public defender \u201cha[d] done the same thing.\u201d Second, Rodriguez contends that the district court refused to consider a downward variance because the Government had declined to move for an additional downward departure for acceptance of responsibility and thus, \u201cto vary [would] intrude in the Government\u2019s decision-making process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Rodriguez\u2019s contentions raise concerns about whether the district court\u2019s sentence took into account improper factors. While \u201cthis court applies a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness to a properly calculated, within-guidelines sentence such as\u201d Rodriguez\u2019s, <em>see United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009), even where the sentence was based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, <em>see United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, 564 F.3d </em>357, 366-67 (5th Cir.2009), that presumption may be rebutted \u201cupon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. However, Rodriguez has not shown that the district court gave \u201csignificant weight\u201d to improper factors. <em>See id. </em>Rather, the district court made clear that it rejected Rodriguez\u2019s request for a downward variance because of Rodriguez\u2019s personal characteristics and criminal history, and it was not improper for the district court to consider Rodriguez\u2019s prior felony drug conviction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2; <em>United States v. Duhon, </em>541 F.3d 391, 397 (5th Cir.2008), Further, the court stated that it understood that it was \u201cnot bound by the guidelines\u201d and could vary as it saw fit, regardless of the absence of a motion by the Government for a downward departure for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Rodriguez has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness of his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186. Accordingly, Rodriguez has failed to offer sufficient reason for disturbing the district court\u2019s sentence selection. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b503-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
