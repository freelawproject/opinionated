Conceding that motion was filed outside the 90-day limitation period, Zhang contends the BIA abused its discretion by concluding he failed to demonstrate changed circumstances in China, justifying a reasonable fear of persecution and thereby satisfying an exception to the limitation period. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Zhang maintains: his joining a political group in the United States, that opposes the Chinese government, is a changed condition in China because of the Chinese government\u2019s awareness of his new political activism.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-24\">Our court has jurisdiction over the BIA\u2019s denial of an untimely motion to reopen deportation proceedings where petitioner files a motion \u201cseeking to avail himself of the exception for \u2018changed circumstances\u2019 under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii)\u201d. <em>Panjwani v. Gonzales, </em>401 F.3d 626, 632 (5th Cir.2005). Denial of a motion to reopen is reviewed under a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. La<em>ra v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-25\">The BIA\u2019s denial of Zhang\u2019s untimely motion was not an abuse of discretion. Zhang was required to show changed country conditions arising in China to overcome the 90-day limitation period for his motion. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). Zhang\u2019s assertion that he feared persecution for his pro-democracy activism in this country was based on changes in his personal circumstances, not changed conditions in China, and does not satisfy the requirement for an exception for untimely motions to reopen. <em>See In re C-W-L- </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 346, 349-50 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-26\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b409-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
