Jones (Jones) brought suit against the Defendants-Ap-pellees herein. His complaint generally alleged what he described as \u201cvarious actions, inactions, findings and decisions\u201d of the Louisiana Public Service Commission, Thomas Vilsack, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality, the United States Department of Agriculture, and the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-21\">Jones seeks to appeal from interlocutory orders of the district court: which (1) denied Jones\u2019s motion to quash the warrant for his arrest issued by the state district courts in Louisiana; and (2) denied Jones\u2019s request for appointment of counsel. Neither of the two orders complained of are appealable orders. The district court\u2019s orders \u201cclearly had the effect of disposing of \u2018one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties\u2019 ... involved.\u201d <em>Pettinelli v. Danzig, </em>644 F.2d 1160, 1161 (5th Cir.1981 Unit B) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b)). Because there is no Rule 54(b) certification or certification for interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>no jurisdiction to hear this appeal. This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>Appellant\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
