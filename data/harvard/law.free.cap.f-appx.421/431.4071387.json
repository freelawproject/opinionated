Wayne Johnson, Texas prisoner # 282756, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for a preliminary injunction and for class-action certification. These motions were filed in conjunction with a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application, in which Johnson challenged the validity of Texas\u2019s habeas corpus law, the alleged use of disciplinary infractions to deny inmates release on mandatory supervision, and the charging of criminal acts as disciplinary infractions. Johnson\u2019s application also stated that he was seeking an injunction ordering Texas courts and officials to adhere to Supreme Court precedent, declaring Texas\u2019s habeas corpus law void, and ordering Texas officials to discontinue prosecuting criminal acts as disciplinary infractions in the absence of full constitutional safeguards at disciplinary hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-20\">On appeal, Johnson first states that he is seeking a certificate of appealability (COA). However, he is not required to obtain a COA to appeal the denial of his motion for a preliminary injunction because he is not challenging \u201cthe final order in a habeas corpus proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(A). Accordingly, his request for a COA is denied as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-21\">Interlocutory orders denying preliminary injunctions are immediately appeal-able as an exception to the final-judgment rule. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1); <em>Lake-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>dreams v. Taylor, </em>932 F.2d 1103, 1107 (5th Cir.1991). However, Johnson has not met the criteria for warranting a preliminary injunction. <em>See Byrum v. Landreth, </em>566 F.3d 442, 445 (5th Cir.2009). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying his motion for a preliminary injunction. <em>See Anderson v. Jackson, </em>556 F.3d 351, 355 (5th Cir.2009). Therefore, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Johnson\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) provides that a party may appeal the denial of class-action certification only \u201cif a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within 14 days after the order is entered.\u201d Johnson\u2019s notice of appeal was filed well more than 14 days after the denial of his motion for certification. Therefore, we dismiss his petition for permission to appeal the denial of his motion for class certification as untimely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">MOTION DENIED; AFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
