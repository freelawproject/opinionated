We have reviewed counsel\u2019s brief and the relevant portions of the record reflected therein, as well as Dixon\u2019s response. We concur with counsel\u2019s assessment that the appeal presents no nonfrivolous issue for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>appellate review. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Dixon\u2019s motion for release pending appeal is DENIED. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cut.
