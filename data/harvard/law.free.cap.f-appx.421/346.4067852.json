Zuni-ga-Capilla argues that the standard of review that the IJ and the BIA used to determine his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief was an improper interpretation of \u00a7 212(c) that was not entitled to deference under <em>Chevron USA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). He asserts that the proper standard of review is clearly delineated in \u00a7 212(c) and that the standard used by the IJ and the BIA, i.e., the standard set forth in <em>Matter of Marin, </em>16 I. &amp; N. Dec. 581, 583-85 (BIA 1978), is an ultra vires amendment to the statute. He alternatively argues that, to the extent \u00a7 212(c) is ambiguous, the standard used by the IJ and the BIA is not a permissible construction of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-20\">An alien must exhaust all administrative remedies that are available as of right before this court may review a final order. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number><em>See Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (d). \u201cPetitioners fail to exhaust their administrative remedies as to an issue if they do not first raise the issue before the BIA, either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>See Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 318; <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2001). \u201cThis exhaustion requirement applies to all issues for which an administrative remedy is available to a petitioner as of right.\u201d <em>Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 318 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Zuniga-Capilla did not assert in his direct appeal to the BIA that the standard that the IJ and the BIA employed to evaluate his request for relief was improper because it was either contrary to the clear language of \u00a7 212(c) or an impermissible construction of that statute. He did not file a motion to reopen or for reconsideration. Thus, Zuniga-Capilla did not properly exhaust the issue whether the IJ and the BIA used an erroneous standard of review to determine his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. This court therefore lacks jurisdiction to review the argument. <em>See Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 320-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Zuniga-Capilla also argues that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for \u00a7 212(c) relief. He specifically argues that the IJ did not give proper weight to the factors supporting a discretionary grant of \u00a7 212(c) relief and that the record therefore does not support the denial of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), we generally do not have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting or denying of discretionary relief, including relief under \u00a7 212(c). While Zuniga-Capilla suggests that his appellate argument implicates questions of law over which we do have jurisdiction, <em>see </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), he essentially challenges the weight that the IJ afforded specific discretionary factors in determining whether to grant relief and alleges that the BIA wrongly adopted the IJ\u2019s findings regarding the relative importance of these factors. Because the determination that \u00a7 212(c) relief is not warranted is not a question of law, we lack jurisdiction to review Zuniga-Capilla\u2019s challenge to the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>See Marquez-Marquez v. Gonzales, </em>455 F.3d 548, 560-61 (5th Cir.2006)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Accordingly, Zuniga-Capilla\u2019s petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
