Mims\u2019 complaint alleged that Arrow acted in violation of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227. Mims acknowledges that this Court has held that federal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction over private actions under the Act. Mims, however, contends that we should reconsider our binding precedent in light of two Supreme Court decisions and a Seventh Circuit decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-17\">We held in <em>Nicholson v. Hooters of Augusta, Inc. </em>that \u201cCongress granted state courts exclusive jurisdiction over private actions under the Act,\u201d and therefore \u201cfederal courts lack subject matter jurisdiction [over] private actions under the Act.\u201d 136 F.3d 1287, 1288-89 (11th Cir.1998), modified, 140 F.3d 898 (11th Cir.1998). We are bound by this precedent. <em>See Smith v. GTE Corp., </em>236 F.3d 1292, 1303 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-18\">Mims, in asking this Court to reconsider its precedent, points to <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Eng\u2019g, </em>545 U.S. 308, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005), and <em>Breuer v. Jim\u2019s Concrete of Brevard, Inc., </em>538 U.S. 691, 123 S.Ct. 1882, 155 L.Ed.2d 923 (2003). Neither of those cases considered the Act, and neither of them explicitly or implicitly overrules our precedent. <em>See United States v. Kaley, </em>579 F.3d 1246, 1255 (\u201cTo constitute an overruling ... the Supreme Court decision must be clearly on point.\u201d) (citations and quotations omitted). Additionally, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Brill v. Countrywide Home Loans, Inc., </em>427 F.3d 446 (7th Cir.2005), does not overturn our precedent. <em>See Kaley, </em>579 F.3d at 1255 (\u201cWe may disregard the holding of a prior opinion only where that holding is overruled by the Court sitting en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-19\">Accordingly, the district court properly dismissed Mims\u2019 complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
