Reviewing for abuse of discretion, the district court granted summary judgment to Unum. Byrd appeals, and this court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because we agree that Unum did not abuse its discretion, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">Byrd was employed as a chargeback associate (or accounting assistant) for Accenture LLP when, on March 26, 2003, she suffered a repetitive-trauma work-related hand injury later diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome. Her subsequent medical complaints include that she suffered from bulging discs in her lower back, lumbar radiculopathy, cervical discogenic pain, cervical spondylosis, and other associated ailments. Byrd alleges that these conditions persist today.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-22\">Byrd participated in Accenture\u2019s group long-term disability program administered by Unum. In July 2004, Byrd applied for and received disability benefits. Unum paid Byrd benefits under the program from September 2003 through July 2008, when Unum terminated Byrd\u2019s benefits after concluding that Byrd no longer was physically unable to return to her occupation. Unum made its decision to terminate Byrd\u2019s benefits after asking at least three independent physicians and two occupational experts to review Byrd\u2019s full medical file. Those experts agreed that Byrd would be physically able to perform her former job.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-23\">After Unum\u2019s appeals unit denied her appeal, Byrd filed suit in district court under ERISA \u00a7 502(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a), seeking past damages including unpaid long-term disability benefits, a declaratory judgment that she is entitled to future benefits under the policy, and attorney\u2019s fees. We review the district court\u2019s judgment <em>de novo, </em>but we apply the same abuse-of-discretion test the district court applied in assessing Unum\u2019s decision to terminate benefits. <em>See Wade v. Hewlett-Packard Dev. Co. LP Short Term Disability Plan, </em>493 F.3d 533, 537 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-25\">In arguing that Unum abused its discretion, Byrd raises two arguments on appeal. First, Byrd argues that Unum improperly failed to consider her lumbar radiculopa-thy. Byrd argues that Unum\u2019s decision relied on an independent medical examination performed on April 25, 2008, that did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>not evaluate her spine. Byrd claims that she was diagnosed on July 3, 2007 with lumbar radiculopathy, and that she received treatment for that condition from two treating physicians, Drs. Saqer and Opus, whose opinions were improperly ignored by Unum. As the district coui\u2019t correctly noted, however, the record indicates that Byrd\u2019s cervical and lumbar conditions were reviewed thoroughly by three board-certified orthopedic surgeons and considered by two vocational specialists. At least one of those doctors explicitly addressed Byrd\u2019s specific lumbar complaints and noted that her lumbar problems did not justify an \u201coverly restrictive\u201d work designation. A second physician, Dr. Moses, explicitly addressed Byrd\u2019s complaints to Dr. Saqer and noted that those ailments would not preclude Byrd from performing an eight-hour workday in a sedentary occupation. Unum plainly considered Byrd\u2019s lumbar problems and found them insufficient to justify further benefits. We therefore reject Byrd\u2019s argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Second, Byrd contends that Unum failed to consider her cervical and upper extremity impairments. Her brief states that \u201cByrd is limited to lifting 5 pounds and cannot do repetitive motion....\u201d Since Unum concluded that Byrd could exert up to 10 pounds of force \u2014 or double the amount of force Byrd believes she can exert \u2014 Byrd argues that Unum abused its discretion. We disagree. As discussed above, Unum\u2019s experts reviewed Byrd\u2019s full medical records carefully, and each concluded Byrd could return to her previous sedentary occupation. At least one physician \u2014 Dr. Moses \u2014 concluded Byrd could exert 20 pounds of force occasionally and 10 pounds of force frequently. Unum\u2019s decision took into account Byrd\u2019s cervical and upper extremity impairments, and its decision is supported by substantial evidence presented in the i-ecord.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Unum did not abuse its discretion in denying Byrd further long-term disability benefits. The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b423-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
