Werner appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his application for Social Security Disability Insurance Benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d) benefits, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1383(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) found Werner had some severe impairments but that these impairments did not rise to the level of a qualifying listed disability. The ALJ further determined that Werner was capable of performing the \u201cfull range of light work,\u201d and so could perform jobs that existed in the national economy. Thus, Werner was found ineligible for DBI and SSI. Despite Werner\u2019s submission of new evidence, the Social Security Appeals Council denied his request for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">On appeal, Werner first argues that the ALJ and the Appeals Council failed to apply the correct legal standards in assessing the impact of his medication side effects on his ability to work. Specifically, he asserts that the ALJ made an impermissible \u201cnegative inference\u201d by noting the lack of evidence showing that he had previously complained of such side effects to his physicians. Further, he contends that, in denying Werner\u2019s request for review, the Appeals Council erred by failing to clearly identify what weight it accorded to the pharmacy sheets and excerpts from the <em>Physician\u2019s Desk Reference </em>that he submitted as additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-8\">Second, Werner argues that both the ALJ and the Appeals Council erred in finding that his allegations of disabling pain in his arms, legs, and neck were \u201cnot entirely credible,\u201d because the evidence showed that his underlying medical conditions could be reasonably expected to produce such pain. Third, he contends that the ALJ also erred by relying exclusively on the Medical Vocational Guidelines (the \u201cgrids\u201d), rather than the testimony of a vocational expert, to determine that he was capable of performing other jobs in the national economy. Fourth and finally, he asserts that the Appeals Council failed to give appropriate weight to the fact that the Florida Division of Vocational Rehabilitation (\u201cFlorida DVR\u201d) classified him as \u201csignificantly disabled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-11\">An individual claiming Social Security disability benefits must prove that he is disabled. <em>Jones v. Apfel, </em>190 F.3d 1224, 1228 (11th Cir.1999). \u201cThe Social Security regulations provide a five-step sequential evaluation process for determining if a claimant has proven that [he] is disabled.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1228. A claimant must show that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-12\">(1) he is not performing substantial gainful activity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-13\">(2) he has a severe impairment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-14\">(3) the impairment or combination of impairments meets or equals an impairment listed in the regulations;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-15\">(4) he cannot return to past work;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-16\">(5) he cannot perform other work based on his age, education, and experience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-17\"><em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1237 (11th Cir.2004); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520(a)(4), 416.920(a)(4). For purposes of step five, the regulations classify jobs into various categories based on the amount of physical exertion that they re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>quire. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567, 416.967. One of these categories, \u201clight work,\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-4\">involving] lifting no more than 20 pounds at a time with frequent lifting or carrying of objects weighing up to 10 pounds. Even though the weight lifted may be very little, a job is in this category when it requires a good deal of walking or standing, or when it involves sitting most of the time with some pushing and pulling of arm or leg controls.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(b), 416.967(b). If someone can perform light work, they also are considered capable of performing sedentary work which entails lifting no more than ten pounds at a time, and occasionally lifting or carrying articles like docket files, ledgers, and small tools. <em>Id.; </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1567(a), 416.967(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-6\">I. Medication Side Effects</p>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">Werner first claims that both the ALJ and the Appeals Council failed to adequately consider his testimony about symptoms resulting from medication side effects. The ALJ considered Werner\u2019s testimony and found it simply inconsistent with the objective medical evidence. In determining whether a claimant\u2019s symptoms limit his capacity to work, the ALJ will consider \u201cthe extent to which [such] symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1529(a), 416.929(a). Further, a claimant\u2019s failure to report side effects to his physicians is an appropriate factor for the ALJ to consider in evaluating whether a claimant\u2019s alleged symptoms are consistent with the record. <em>See Swindle v. Sullivan, </em>914 F.2d 222, 226 (11th Cir.1990). Substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Werner was capable of performing light work, because he lived alone and performed basic household activities, and had undergone only a moderate course of treatment for his ailments. Accordingly, the record shows no reversible error in the ALJ\u2019s consideration of testimony about alleged side effects from the medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">Nor did Werner\u2019s submission to the Appeals Council of new evidence of the side effects generally associated with his medications present a reason to doubt the ALJ\u2019s conclusion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mere lists of potential side effects do not establish that a claimant in fact experienced such side effects.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-11\">II. Subjective Pain Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">Werner also claimed that the pain from his medical conditions was so debilitating that he could not perform the full range of light work, and he now claims on appeal that ALJ improperly discredited his testimony about his pain. \u201cIf proof of disability is based upon subjective evidence and a credibility determination is, therefore, critical to the decision, the ALJ must either explicitly discredit such testimony or the implication must be so clear as to amount to a specific credibility finding.\u201d <em>Foote v. Chater, </em>67 F.3d 1553, 1562 (11th Cir.1995) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Here, substantial evidence cited by the ALJ supports the adverse credibility determination. Werner\u2019s descriptions of his pain were inconsistent with reports from his treating and examining physicians, which showed that he had a full range of motion in his arms and legs and was capable of doing light work. His description of his pain was also inconsistent with his own testimony concerning his dai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>ly activities. The question is not, as Wer-ner suggests<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>, whether ALJ could have reasonably credited his testimony, but whether the ALJ was clearly wrong to discredit it. The record reveals no reversible error in the ALJ\u2019s finding. Finally, the new evidence submitted to the Appeals Council was cumulative of other record evidence and so did not require further review.</p>\n<p id=\"A-2b\">III. Reliance on the \u201cGrids\u201d Instead of Vocational Expert</p>\n<p id=\"b965-6\">Having found that Werner was unable to perform his past work in construction, the ALJ relied on the Medical-Vocational Guidelines, or \u201cgrids,\u201d to determine that Werner could perform other work. In a disability determination, once a claimant proves that he can no longer perform his past relevant work, \u201cthe burden shifts to the Commissioner to show the existence of other jobs in the national economy which, given the claimant\u2019s impairments, the claimant can perform.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>190 F.3d at 1229. One way for the Commissioner to carry this burden is through an application of the \u201cgrids.\u201d <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2. The grids provide an algorithm to determine a claimant\u2019s ability to engage in employment other than their past work based on factors such as a person\u2019s age, education, previous employment, and maximum physical capabilities. <em>Gibson v. Heckler, </em>762 F.2d 1516, 1520 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b965-7\">In determining whether exclusive reliance on the grids is appropriate, the ALJ must first categorize the claimant\u2019s impairments as either exertional or nonexertional. <em>See, e.g., Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241-43. Exertional impairments affect an individual\u2019s ability to meet the seven strength demands of the job: sitting, standing, walking, lifting, carrying, pushing, and pulling. <em>Id. </em>at 1241 n. 11. Nonexertional impairments affect an individual\u2019s ability to meet other work-related demands, and include limitations such as pain, medication side effects, and depression. <em>Id.; MacGregor v. Bowen, </em>786 F.2d 1050, 1054 (11th Cir.1986). An ALJ may rely exclusively on the grids when each factor used in the determination describes the claimant\u2019s situation, and when the case involves only exertional impairments. <em>Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1559. In contrast, if the claimant has a nonexertional impairment that limits a wide range of work at a given level, the ALJ is required to consult a vocational expert. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b965-10\">Here, substantial evidence in the medical record supported the determination that Werner\u2019s non-exertional impairments \u2014 depressive disorder and pain disorder \u2014 did not cause more than a minimal limitation to his ability to work. The ALJ also cited substantial evidence that Werner\u2019s exertional impairments did not limit a wide range of light or sedentary work. Thus, there is no reversible error in the ALJ\u2019s use of the grids in place of a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-11\">IV. Deference to Another Agency\u2019s Disability Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">Finally, Werner claims that the Appeals Council improperly disregarded a disability determination from the Florida DVR in denying review. Findings of disability by other agencies are generally entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>\u201cgreat weight.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth, </em>703 F.2d at 1241. However, regulations provide that the Commissioner must ultimately make its disability determination based on social security law, not the rules of other agencies. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1504, 416.904. Accordingly, the findings of other agencies are not binding on the Commissioner. <em>Id.; see also BloodswoHh, </em>703 F.2d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">Here, the Appeals Council explicitly stated that it considered the letter from the Florida DVR and found that it did not provide a basis for disturbing the ALJ\u2019s decision. Further, the letter did not controvert the substantial evidence on which the ALJ relied because it showed only that Werner was entitled to second priority in receiving vocational rehabilitation services due to the fact that the agency classified him as \u201csignificantly disabled.\u201d Werner failed to submit any evidence of what the term, \u201csignificantly disabled,\u201d meant when used by the Florida DVR. Nor did he present any evidence that the term was inconsistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Werner had impairments that prevented him from performing his past work, but which did not prevent him from performing light or sedentary work \u2014 the relevant criteria for the ALJ\u2019s decision. <em>But cf. Falcon v. Heckler, </em>732 F.2d 827 (11th Cir.1984) (holding that similarity between Florida workers compensation disability law and Social Security disability law require that the ALJ give great weight to the Florida determination). Nor does Werner cite any authority on appeal to indicate the significance of the Florida DVR\u2019s determination. Without further evidence showing that the Florida DVR uses criteria similar to the relevant regulations for DIB and SSI determinations, the letter was insufficient to call the ALJ\u2019s decision into question.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">Accordingly, we affirm on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"AoWo\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b963-9\">. We review the Commissioner\u2019s DIB and SSI decisions to determine if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Crawford v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1158 (11th Cir.2004); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Bloodsworth </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>703 F.2d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir.1983). We do not \"decide the facts anew, reweigh the evidence, or substitute our judgment for that of the [Commissioner].\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b964-8\">. The Appeals Council considers the entire record, including the new evidence, and \u201cwill then review the case if it finds that the [ALJ\u2019s] action, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence currently of record.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b). Thus, \"a reviewing court must consider whether that new evidence renders the denial of benefits erroneous.\u2019\u2019 <em>Ingram v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1262 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b965-8\">. Werner argues that because the ALJ found his conditions could reasonably be expected to cause the pain he described, the ALJ could not discredit the testimony. But Werner incorrectly assumes that meeting the threshold \"pain standard\u201d for <em>considering </em>subjective testimony on pain is the end of the inquiry. <em>See Foote, </em>67 F.3d at 1560 (Commissioner \"must consider a claimant\u2019s subjective testimony of pain\u201d if claimant meets the \"pain standard\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
