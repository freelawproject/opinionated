INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). The substantial evidence standard is applied in reviewing factual findings in immigration proceedings. <em>Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir.2006). Under that standard, \u201c[t]he applicant has the burden of showing that the evidence is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could reach a contrary conclusion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Murralles challenges the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which was based on his demeanor, inconsistencies in his testimony with respect to the date of his relocation within Guatemala in response to the alleged persecution, and his failure to produce evidence to corroborate his testimony. Murralles contends that the evidence was not materially inconsistent and that there was no evidence that his testimony was not credible. Murralles contends that his testimony was detailed and consistent and that he explained his failure to present documentary evidence corroborating his testimony. Murralles\u2019s argument misapprehends this court\u2019s standard of review and his burden of proof in the agency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Murralles\u2019s application for relief is governed by the REAL ID Act, which amended the standards for assessing credibility. <em>See Wang v. Holder, </em>569 F.3d 531, 537 (5th Cir.2009). Under the REAL Act, \u201can applicant\u2019s testimony, alone, may be sufficient to sustain the burden of proving eligibility for asylum, \u2018but only if the applicant satisfies the trier of fact that [his] testimony is credible, is persuasive, and refers to specific facts sufficient to demonstrate that the applicant is a refugee.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(ii)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The IJ may consider the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d and \u201call relevant factors\u201d in making a credibility determination. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii) (listing factors). An applicant\u2019s credibility is not presumed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">Thus, \u201c \u2018an IJ may rely on <em>any </em>inconsistency or omission in making an adverse credibility determination as long as the totality of the circumstances establishes that an asylum applicant is not credible.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 538-39 (quoting with approval <em>Lin v. Mukasey, </em>534 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir.2008); quote at 538). This court will defer \u201c\u2018to an IJ\u2019s credibility determination unless, from the totality of the circumstances, it is plain that no reasonable fact-finder could make such an adverse credibility ruling.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 538 (quoting <em>Lin, </em>534 F.3d at 167). In making a credibility finding, the IJ is not required to consider only inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods that \u201cgo to the \u2018heart\u2019 \u201d of an applicant\u2019s claim, <em>id. </em>at 537 (quoting \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii)), as details at the periphery of the applicant\u2019s story \u201c \u2018may expose a liar.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539 (quoting <em>Mitondo v. Mukasey, </em>523 F.3d 784, 789 (7th Cir.2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Murralles was required to establish in the agency proceedings that his testimony was credible, persuasive, and sufficiently specific. <em>See Wang, </em>569 F.3d at 537. He failed to do so. The IJ could have overlooked, for reasons stated in Murralles\u2019s brief, the inconsistencies in Murralles\u2019s statements regarding the timing of his relocation within Guatemala, but she did not. This court may not reverse the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility determination unless the evidence was so compelling that \u201cno reasonable fact-finder\u201d could have failed to find Murralles credible. <em>Id. </em>at 538-39. Murralles has not satisfied that standard. Contrary to Murralles\u2019s argument, his testimony was strikingly lacking in detail with regard to his movements within Guatemala, the activities of the civic committee in which he participated, and the nature of the malfeasance exposed by the civic committee, which led to his alleged persecution. Murralles failed to provide any evidence corroborating his testimony, including his membership in, or the existence (or any activities) of, the alleged civic committee. Because the adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence and because Murralles submitted no additional evidence corroborating his testimony, we have not considered the BIA\u2019s alternative determination that Murralles failed to carry his burden with respect to withholding of removal. <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 790, 792-93 (5th Cir.2004). The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, die court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b506-6\">. Murralles also sought relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). Murralles raises no issue with respect to the denial of his request for relief under the CAT; nor does he dispute the denial of his claim for asylum (no justification was shown for his failure to apply for asylum for more than four years after arrival in the United States). <em>See Thuri v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 788, 793 (5th Cir.2004) (issues not addressed in opening brief are waived).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b506-12\">.
