Sarmiento argues that the BIA erred in denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility because it applied an incorrect legal standard in concluding that he had not demonstrated that his parents would suffer an extreme hardship if he were denied admission to the United States. Sarmiento also argues that the IJ violated his due process rights by requesting that his counsel proffer his parents\u2019 testimonies at his removal hearing. The government contends that we lack jurisdiction over Sarmiento\u2019s petition because he abandoned any claim of error with respect to the denial of his application for adjustment of status and Sarmiento\u2019s appeal of the denial of his discretionary waiver of inadmissibility is moot as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>issues of subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003). Under the INA, an alien must exhaust his administrative remedies before seeking judicial review of any issue. INA \u00a7 242(d)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). When an alien fails to exhaust his administrative remedies, we lack jurisdiction to review the unexhausted issue on appeal. <em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1253 (11th Cir.2006); <em>see also Ama-yar-Artunduaga v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006) (finding that this Court lacked jurisdiction to review an adverse credibility determination because an alien failed to challenge that determination before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-13\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of Sarmiento\u2019s request for an adjustment of status for two reasons. First, Sarmiento abandoned any challenge to the IJ\u2019s denial of his request for an adjustment of status because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies by raising the issue before the BIA and because he waived the issue on appeal to this Court. Second, we lack jurisdiction because the plain language of the INA precludes judicial review of the IJ\u2019s decision to deny relief. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae (\u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review ... any judgment regarding the granting of relief under section ... 1255 of this title [adjustment of status].\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b975-15\">Because we lack jurisdiction to review the denial of Sarmiento\u2019s request for an adjustment of status, his appeal of the BIA\u2019s denial of his waiver of inadmissibility is dismissed as moot. Even assuming that the BIA applied the wrong legal standard in denying Sarmiento\u2019s application for a waiver of inadmissibility, such a waiver if granted would only lift a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>bar to his eligibility for an adjustment of status under INA \u00a7 245(i)(2)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255(i)(2)(A). Because the BIA denied Sarmiento\u2019s application for an adjustment status in an exercise of its discretion, however, whether he is eligible for a waiver of the ground for inadmissibility in INA \u00a7 212(a)(6)(C)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i), is moot. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>273 F.3d 1330, 1335-36 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cA case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \u2018live\u2019 or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in .the outcome.\u201d (alteration omitted)). Therefore, we are without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision denying his application for a waiver of inadmissibility because mootness is jurisdictional. <em>Id. </em>at 1336.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">\u201cEven [though] we [do] not have jurisdiction, we ... still have jurisdiction to review substantial constitutional claims.\u201d <em>Zafar v. United States Atty. Gen., </em>461 F.3d 1357, 1367 (11th Cir.2006) (citation omitted). However, \u201c[t]here is no constitutionally protected right to discretionary relief, which is the relief requested here.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Sarmiento\u2019s argument that the IJ violated his due process rights by requiring his attorney to proffer the contents of his parents\u2019 testimony at his removal proceedings is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
