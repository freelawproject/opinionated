Lin argues that in his motion he submitted evidence (1) that was not available at the time of his initial proceedings and (2) that proves Christians who attend unregistered churches are now subject to considerably heightened religious persecution. Accordingly, Lin contends that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to conclude that he established changed country conditions in China. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-21\">Lin initially applied for asylum based on the Chinese government\u2019s Family Planning Policy, his previous violation of the policy, and his alleged assault on a government official attempting to enforce the policy. In 2005, the immigration judge (\u201cU\u201d) denied Lin\u2019s application. Lin sought review from the BIA, which denied his appeal. He then appealed to this Court, and we denied his petition. <em>See Lin v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>555 F.3d 1310 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-22\">After the IJ ordered his deportation in 2005, Lin married a naturalized United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>States citizen and had two children. Additionally, he discovered Christianity and became a devout worshiper. Lin then filed a motion requesting that the BIA reopen his removal proceedings on the basis of changed country conditions due to the increased persecution of Christians in China. The BIA denied his motion, and he asks this Court to review that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen a removal proceeding for abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009) (citation omitted). Motions to reopen removal proceedings are disfavored, <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citation omitted), and judicial review is \u201climited to determining whether the BIA [abused its discretion by acting] in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009) (per curiam) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Ordinarily, an alien who is subject to a final order of removal and wishes to file a motion to reopen must do so within 90 days of the final administrative removal order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). That time limit is inapplicable, however, if the alien can demonstrate \u201cchanged country conditions arising in the country of nationality or the country to which removal has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and would not have been discovered or presented at the previous proceeding.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); <em>see also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(e)(3). Demonstrating materiality is a difficult task and requires the presentation of evidence that would likely change the result in the case if the proceedings were reopened. <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57. \u201cAn alien cannot circumvent the requirement of changed country conditions by demonstrating only a change in [his] personal circumstances.\u201d <em>Zhang, </em>572 F.3d at 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">The BIA\u2019s opinions need not discuss every piece of evidence presented so long as it \u201c \u2018has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings ----\u2019 \u201d <em>Morales v. INS, </em>208 F.3d 323, 328 (11th Cir.2000) (quoting <em>Martinez v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 973, 976 (1st Cir.1992)). Ultimately, the BIA must \u201c\u2018consider the issues raised and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Vergara-Molina v. INS, </em>956 F.2d 682, 685 (7th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Here, the BIA considered the evidence presented and articulated its decision in a manner that allows for appellate review, despite not engaging in extended discussion. We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Lin failed to present sufficient evidence to prove a material change in the conditions for Christians in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">The BIA provided a brief procedural history of Lin\u2019s asylum proceedings and recognized that changed country conditions formed the basis of his current motion. Next, its decision succinctly and correctly identified the gravamen of Lin\u2019s claim, specifically that conditions for Christians and members of unregistered churches in China have worsened and created changed circumstances within the country. Finally, it recognized the evidence Lin presented and then provided its findings and conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">At the outset of its analysis, the BIA correctly concluded that Lin\u2019s conversion to Christianity constituted a change in personal circumstances that did not absolve him of the requirement to prove a change in country circumstances. Lin does not challenge that determination. Therefore, the BIA appropriately moved on to consider the evidence of the current religious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>climate in China. The government-issued reports and other evidence painted a conflicting portrait that acknowledged an increase in tolerance of Christianity in some respects, while at the same time recognizing that there has been action taken against non-sanctioned Christian leaders and participants. Cumulatively, this evidence lacks the specificity and clarity to warrant analogy to recent cases in this Court involving the increased enforcement of the Chinese Family Planning Policy. <em>See, e.g., Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1257-58 (concluding that the BIA \u201cbadly misconstrued\u201d the appellant\u2019s petition as being based on changed personal circumstances and inexplicably ignored two affidavits detailing forced sterilizations in appellant\u2019s hometown and multiple country reports that recognized \u201cunambiguously corroborated incidents of coerced sterilization\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Though it did not explicitly discuss each individual piece of evidence, the BIA concluded that the \u201carrest of leaders of underground churches and the harassment of church members\u201d does not demonstrate \u201cthat [Lin] will suffer mistreatment amounting to persecution or torture upon his return to China based on his practice of Christianity.\u201d Such a conclusion in this case, reached after acknowledging the conflicting evidence, cannot be considered arbitrary or capricious. Accordingly, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
