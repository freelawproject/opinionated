On appeal, Hernandez-Solis argues that his sentence was procedurally and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>stantively unreasonable. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We review the sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 351, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Id. </em>at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider' the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court need not discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>551 U.S. at 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">If we conclude that the district court did not procedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586). This review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d requiring us to determine \u201cwhether the sentence imposed by the district court fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court, and we will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (internal quotation and brackets omitted). We will remand for resentencing only if we are \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (citation and internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Further, \u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. Another indicator of reasonableness is the relationship between the defendant\u2019s sentence and the applicable statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir.2008) (noting, as one indication of reasonableness, that a defendant\u2019s sentence was \u201cwell below\u201d the applicable statutory maximum), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2848, 174 L.Ed.2d 568 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>(2009). The burden is on the defendant to show that the sentence was unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Hernandez-Solis has failed to show that his sentence was procedurally unreasonable. As we\u2019ve noted, the district court was not obligated to explicitly articulate that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, nor was it required to discuss each factor so long as it considered the factors in some manner. As the record shows, the district court explicitly stated that it thought \u201ca sentence within the guideline range is reasonable, considering the criminal record, the previous criminal history, and Mr. Hernandez\u2019s re-entry after the previous conviction.\u201d Moreover, the parties\u2019 arguments and the court\u2019s reference to Hernandez-Solis\u2019s history and characteristics set forth enough to demonstrate that the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and that it did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007) (concluding that despite failing to cite \u00a7 3553(a), the district court evaluated the statutory factors because it considered appellant\u2019s objections, his motion for a downward departure, and the PSI, all of which implicated several of the factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Hernandez-Solis also has not shown that his sentence was substantively unreasonable. Hernandez-Solis\u2019s self-characterization as a non-malignant, hardworking, safety-conscious parent has not demonstrated that the district court made a clear error of judgment in imposing a sentence near the low-end of the guidelines range, especially in light of the court\u2019s concern for Hernandez-Solis\u2019s criminal past and recidivism. The reasonableness of the sentence is further supported by the fact that the sentence fell within the guidelines range and was well below the statutory maximum of 20 years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d at 1324; <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"AMom\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-8\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
