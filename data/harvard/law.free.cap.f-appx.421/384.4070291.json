Buras was served with a summons and a copy of the complaint in April 2010. Buras did not file an answer, so in June 2010 SUA moved for \u2014 and the clerk of court granted \u2014 the entry of Buras\u2019s default pursuant to Rule 55(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. One month later, SUA moved for a default judgment under Rule 55(b)(2). Buras did not respond, so the district court granted the motion and entered a default <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>judgment declaring that SUA has no duty to defend or indemnify Buras in the underlying state-court litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to enter a default judgment for an abuse of discretion. <em>Rogers v. Hartford Life &amp; Accident Co., </em>167 F.3d 933, 936 (5th Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Three factors guide our review: \u201c(1) the extent of prejudice to the plaintiff; (2) the merits of the defendant\u2019s asserted defense; and (3) the culpability of the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938-39 (citation, internal quotation marks, and brackets omitted). In this case, all three factors weigh in favor of the judgment. Setting it aside would prejudice SUA by requiring it to continue to fund Buras\u2019s defense costs in the state-court litigation during the pendency of this action. Buras has not even hinted at what his defense might be. And his conduct was culpable: he was aware of the suit and chose not to defend against it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Buras advances three arguments as to why we should set aside the default judgment against him. None persuades us that the district court erred. First, he contends that the default judgment should be set aside because he \u201cwas not notified of a hearing before the Court.\u201d However, valid service of process puts a defendant on notice that failure to file an answer to the complaint subjects him to the risk of a default judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(a)(1) &amp; 55(a); <em>Rogers, </em>167 F.3d at 937. \u201cRule 55(b)(2) does not require the district court to hold either an evidentiary hearing or oral argument\u201d before entering a default judgment. <em>First Fin. Group of Texas, </em>659 F.2d at 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Second, Buras contends that he has \u201cthe right to representation at all Court hearings that are pertaining to\u201d him. This is not the law. A defendant in a civil action pertaining to insurance coverage does not enjoy the right to have an attorney appointed to represent him. <em>See Salmon v. Corpus Christi Indep. Sch. Dist., </em>911 F.2d 1165, 1166 (5th Cir.1990) (per curiam). \u201cOne who elects to proceed in a trial court, Pro se, does so at his own peril.\u201d <em>United States v. Blackwood, </em>582 F.2d 1244, 1246 (10th Cir.1978) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">Finally, Buras argues that because his line of work requires him to carry insurance, \u201cSUA Insurance should not be able to get out of defending me.\u201d But Buras forfeited his right to argue that SUA has a duty to defend and indemnify him when he declined to answer SUA\u2019s complaint. This single sentence of argument does not establish the district court erred in entering a default judgment against him. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b410-14\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b411-7\">. Ordinarily a party seeking to have a default judgment set aside files a motion in the district court under Rule 55(c) or Rule 60(b). Buras did not do so, but he was not required to, as a default judgment is directly appeal-able under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Pecarsky v. Galaxiworld.com, Ltd., </em>249 F.3d 167, 170-71 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b411-8\">. Buras\u2019s awareness of the suit is demonstrated by the fact that he filed a motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process. SUA cured any insufficiency by re-serving Buras after he filed the motion. Buras took no further action. We note here that while Buras\u2019s filing of the motion does constitute an appearance, he received sufficient notice of SUA\u2019s motion for a default judgment when he was served with a copy of the motion more than three weeks before the court granted it. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 55(b)(2); <em>Florida Physician's Ins. Co. v. Ehlers, </em>8 F.3d 780, 784 (11th Cir.1993) (per curiam); <em>Sec. Exch. Comm\u2019n v. First Fin. Group of Texas, Inc., </em>659 F.2d 660, 669 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
