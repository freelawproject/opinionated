Ramirez argues that the district court abused its discretion in its answer to a question submitted by the jury. The United States cross-appeals and argues that the district court erred in failing to order Ramirez to forfeit the entire amount \u201cinvolved in\u201d his structuring crime, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c)(1)(A). We reject the arguments of both Ramirez and the United States, and we affirm Ramirez\u2019s convictions and the order of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">Ramirez argues that an answer of the district court to a question submitted by the jury was \u201cconfusing],\u201d but we disagree. During its deliberations, the jury sent the district court a note that asked whether \u201cstructuring mean[t] that [Ramirez] had to know what a [Currency Transaction Report] form was.\u201d The district court responded by identifying the statute that Ramirez was accused of violating, referencing the specific reporting requirement, and naming the form that banks are obligated to file with the government. <em>See United States v. Elso, </em>422 F.3d 1305, 1311 (11th Cir.2005). The district court stated that \u201cSection 5324(a)(3) makes it a federal crime ... to knowingly evade a currency transaction reporting requirement\u201d; \u201cSection 5313(a) ... require[s] domestic financial institutions and banks ... to file reports with the government called Currency Transaction Reports, Form 4789, disclosing\u201d all financial transactions \u201cinvolving more than $10,000 in cash or currency\u201d; and Ramirez had to have \u201cknowledge of the currency transaction reporting requirements as set forth in ... Section 5313(a).\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion in answering the question of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>The United States argues in its cross-appeal that the district court selected arbitrarily an amount for Ramirez to forfeit and ignored the requirement that he forfeit the amount \u201cinvolved in\u201d his crime, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c)(1)(A), but we disagree. The district court considered the amount \u201cinvolved in\u201d Ramirez\u2019s structuring crime and determined that a forfeiture of the entire $967,100 would violate the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment. Although the district court stated that it had \u201cnot ma[de] an Eighth Amendment analysis\u201d because \u201cthe [Eighth] Amendment is not drawn on the case until and unless the Court imposes a f\u00edne that violates the [Eighth] Amendment,\u201d the district court explained that the Eighth Amendment had \u201cinformed\u201d its decision \u201cwith respect to what is proper and what is improper.\u201d That this constitutional concern guided the decision of the district court is apparent from its comments during the forfeiture hearing and at sentencing. At the conclusion of the forfeiture hearing, the district court stated that \u201creally the only question\u201d remaining was whether \u201cthe forfeiture/judgment [would be] unconstitutional,\u201d and the district court commenced the sentencing hearing by stating that it had rejected the \u201cdemand for forfeiture [of $967,100 that] the [United States] sfought]\u201d based on how \u201cthe constitutional question inform[ed] the Court\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">The district court correctly considered whether the amount of forfeiture sought by the United States would constitute an excessive penalty. The Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. Bajakajian </em>that a \u201cforfeiture ... constitutes punishment and is ... a \u2018fine\u2019 within the meaning of the Excessive Fines Clause\u201d and should be examined to determine \u201cwhether it is excessive.\u201d 524 U.S. 321, 334, 118 S.Ct. 2028, 2036, 141 L.Ed.2d 314 (1998). In <em>Bajalcajian, </em>although the forfeiture statute mandated that the defendant forfeit \u201cany property ... involved in\u201d his crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982(a)(1), the Court held that a forfeiture of the entire amount that the defendant had failed to declare he intended to transport outside the United States would have been \u201cgrossly disproportional to the gravity of his offense.\u201d <em>Bajalcajian, </em>524 U.S. at 339^0, 118 S.Ct. at 2039. The Court reasoned that a forfeiture of $357,144 was unconstitutionally excessive because Bajakajian\u2019s only crime was failing to report the currency, the currency was not connected to any illegal activity, Baja-kajian faced a maximum sentence of six months and a $5,000 f\u00edne under the Sentencing Guidelines, and his crime affected only the ability of the government to know that the currency had left the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 337-39, 118 S.Ct. at 2038-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">The district court did not err when it determined that a forfeiture of the entire $967,100 involved in Ramirez\u2019s structuring crimes would be excessive and unconstitutional. Like the defendant in <em>Bajalcajian, </em>Ramirez committed a reporting offense and faced a mandatory forfeiture of \u201call property ... involved in [his] offense,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5317(c)(1)(A), but a forfeiture of that magnitude would be grossly disproportional to Ramirez\u2019s crime. Ramirez structured his financial transactions to evade reporting requirements, but he did not attempt to conceal his wrongdoing and his money was not connected to any illegal activity. In addition, Ramirez faced a fine under the Sentencing Guidelines about 12 times less than the amount demanded by the forfeiture statute and his crime affected only the Internal Revenue Service by depriving it of reports from banks about the amounts of Ramirez\u2019s deposits. The forfeiture of the entire $967,100 would have violated the Excessive Fines Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>We AFFIRM Ramirez\u2019s convictions and the order of forfeiture.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
