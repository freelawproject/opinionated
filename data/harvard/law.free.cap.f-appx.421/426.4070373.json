In his complaint, he alleged that the defendants, in retaliation for his filing grievances or complaints against prison officials, issued a false disciplinary charge for failing to obey an order. According to Flores, this resulted in his transfer to a less desirable prison unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Flores\u2019s IFP motion is a challenge to the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Our inquiry into whether an appeal is taken in good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because the district court dismissed Flores\u2019s claim as frivolous, our review is for abuse of discretion. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Flores alleges several procedural errors by the magistrate judge in conducting the <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179 (5th Cir.1985) hearing. Flores asserts that the magistrate judge erred in not requiring the defendants to file an answer and in not allowing him to conduct discovery. He also asserts that he was not allowed to subpoena any witnesses or question any state officials. Lastly, Flores contends that he was not allowed to examine or challenge the use of prison records.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Section 1915(e) instructs the district court that it \u201cshall dismiss the case at any time if the court determines that ... the action ... fails to state a claim on which relief may be granted.\u201d \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(ii). Dismissal under \u00a7 1915 \u201cis often made <em>sua sponte </em>prior to the issuance of process, so as to spare prospective defendants the inconvenience and expense of answering such complaints.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Barrientos, </em>926 F.2d 480, 482 (5th Cir.1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">A <em>Spears </em>hearing is designed to permit the court to pierce the veil of the pro se complaint so as \u201c \u2018to dig beneath the conclusional allegations.\u2019\u201d <em>Wesson v. Oglesby, </em>910 F.2d 278, 281 (5th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Spears, </em>766 F.2d at 180). Within the context of the <em>Spears </em>hearing, the court \u201chas the discretion to decide the best way to elicit the complainant\u2019s articulation of his grievance and the basis for making any credibility assessment needed.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>926 F.2d at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">It was not error, therefore, for the magistrate judge to dismiss the complaint sua sponte prior to its service on the defendants and without allowing discovery. <em>See id. </em>at 482. Moreover, Flores fails to identify the evidence that would have been produced as the result of any discovery and fails to explain how allowing discovery would have changed the course of the proceedings. Neither does Flores name the witnesses who should have been subpoenaed and has not demonstrated that any relevant testimony or evidence was excluded. He also fails to explain which state officials he desired to question at the hearing or what such questioning would have revealed. Flores also fails to identify the records he was not allowed to review. His conclusional allegations are insufficient to show error. <em>See United States v. Wilkes, </em>20 F.3d 651, 653 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">Furthermore, Flores apparently misunderstands the nature of a <em>Spears </em>hearing. The purpose of the <em>Spears </em>hearing is not to address the merits of the complaint but to focus on the legal viability of the allegations. <em>See Wesson, </em>910 F.2d at 281. The magistrate judge was not required to allow Flores to present witnesses, cross-examine the defendants, or present evidence because these rights relate to consideration of the merits of his complaint. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">We also reject as without merit Flores\u2019s retaliation claim. Flores has not alleged a series of events from which retaliation could plausibly be inferred. <em>See Woods v. Smith, </em>60 F.3d 1161, 1166 (5th Cir.1995). Flores did not identify any specific grievance or complaint against any particular prison official that precipitated the alleged retaliatory act. Flores\u2019s allegations, based on his personal belief, that he had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>retaliated against are not sufficient to state a valid claim of retaliation. <em>See Johnson v. Rodriguez, </em>110 F.3d 299, 310 (5th Cir.1997). The magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in dismissing Flores\u2019s claims that he was denied due process during his disciplinary proceeding as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), in as much as Flores failed to show that the disciplinary conviction had been invalidated or expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Flores\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and thus is frivolous. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 219-20. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Flores is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal as frivolous. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). As he now has two strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), Flores is cautioned that if he accumulates a third strike under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
