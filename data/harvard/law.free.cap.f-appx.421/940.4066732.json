Martinez challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-19\">We review a sentence for reasonableness in a two-step process. <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.2009). First, we \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). When a defendant fails to object in the district court to a purported procedural error, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 818 (11th Cir.2006). The defendant must show (1) an error (2) that is plain, (3) affects substantial rights, and (4) \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1776, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">Second, we review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc). When conducting this review, we take into account the totality of the circumstances, including \u201c \u2018the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1237 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cIf the district court\u2019s sentence is within the guidelines range, we expect that the sentence is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see also United States v. Hunt, </em>526 F.3d 739, 746 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough we do not automatically presume a sentence within the guidelines range is reasonable, we \u2018ordinarily ... expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u2019\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Martinez contends that the district court committed procedural error at sentencing in failing to ask if he and his attorney were supplied with and had discussed the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Because Martinez did not raise an objection at sentencing, we review only for plain error. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 818. At sentencing, the district court \u201cmust verify that the defendant and the defendant\u2019s attorney have read and discussed the presentence report.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(A). The district court never asked Martinez, or his attorney, whether they had received and discussed the PSI. Even if the district court\u2019s failure to ask constitutes plain error, vacatur and remand of Martinez\u2019s sentence is not warranted because Martinez cannot show that he suffered prejudice from the district court\u2019s error. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732, 113 S.Ct. at 1776. Martinez does not allege that the PSI was inaccurate or that he would have challenged the report if the district court had made an express inquiry. Because Martinez has not shown that he suffered actual prejudice from the district court\u2019s error, his sentence is not reversible on this ground. <em>See United States v. Stevens, </em>223 F.3d 239, 246 (3d Cir.2000) (holding that noncompliance with Rule 32(i)(l)(A) does not require vacatur and resentencing unless there is some showing of prejudice by the defendant); <em>United States v. Lockhart, </em>58 F.3d 86, 89 (4th Cir.1995) (applying plain error analysis to hold that when defendant pointed to no portion of the PSI that he would have challenged had the district court conducted an express inquiry, he did not show prejudice and vacatur and remand were not warranted).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Martinez also argues that the district court procedurally erred by treating the Guidelines as mandatory and by failing to adequately explain the reasons for its sentence. We disagree. Before imposing its sentence, the district court acknowledged that it had considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and expressly recognized that the Guidelines are advisory. The district court also stated that its sentence was necessary for deterrence and adequately addressed the totality of the circumstances. The district court\u2019s explanation was adequate. <em>See Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1195 (We have never held \u201cthat a sentencing judge is required to articulate his findings and reasoning with great detail or in any detail for that matter.\u201d); <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201c[NJothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Martinez also challenges the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>He argues that the district court imposed a sentence greater than necessary to achieve the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In light of Martinez\u2019s extensive criminal history and repeated deportations, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s 70-month sentence, which was at the lowest end of Martinez\u2019s advisory guidelines range of 70 to 87 months imprisonment and well below the twenty-year statutory maximum sentence, is unreasonable. <em>See Hunt, </em>526 F.3d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
