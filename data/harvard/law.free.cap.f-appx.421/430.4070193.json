No. 111\u2014 220, 124 Stat. 2372, Antoine did not benefit from the amendment of the statute because he committed his offense, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced before the act\u2019s August 3, 2010 effective date. See <em>United States v. Doggins, </em>633 F.3d 379, 384 (5th Cir.2011). Accordingly, former \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)\u2019s five-year minimum sentence for offenses involving at least five grams of crack cocaine applied in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-21\">Antoine argues that the district court should have granted his motions for downward departure or variance below that mandatory minimum. We ordinarily lack authority to review a district court\u2019s refusal to depart below a statutory minimum, but we may review de novo a district court\u2019s decision that it lacked the authority to do so. <em>United States v. James, </em>468 F.3d 245, 246-47 (5th Cir.2006). The Government did not move for a downward departure based on substantial assistance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), and Antoine was ineligible for a safety valve reduction under \u00a7 3553(f) because he had more than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>one criminal history point. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(1). Accordingly, the district court correctly determined that it lacked the authority to grant Antoine\u2019s request for a downward departure. <em>United States v. Krumnow, </em>476 F.3d 294, 297 (5th Cir.2007). The district court also lacked the authority to grant Antoine\u2019s motion for a nonguidelines sentence below the mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Farias, </em>469 F.3d 393, 401 (5th Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]hatever result the Guidelines yield, the sentence cannot be less than the mandatory minimum.\u201d); <em>see also Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 108, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007) (stating that district courts remain constrained by statutory minimum penalties).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b456-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
