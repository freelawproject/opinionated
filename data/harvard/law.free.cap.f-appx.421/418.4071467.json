In accordance with this Court\u2019s order, counsel filed a transcript of the sentencing hearing and further <em>Anders </em>briefing. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. See 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
