Hon-or\u00e9 and Dexter Honor\u00e9 Construction Company (DXHC) appeal from the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment that dismissed their claims against Cross-Defendant-Appellee Fluor Enterprises, Inc. (Fluor). Although plaintiff Grand Acadi-an\u2019s main demand in the underlying case was settled and dismissed, the parties agree that at least the following claims are still pending in the district court: (1) Fluor\u2019s cross-claim against DXHC for contractual indemnity; (2) Fluor\u2019s third party claims for defense and indemnity against The Gray Insurance Company (Gray) and United National Insurance Company (United National); and (3) DXHC\u2019s third party claim for defense and indemnity against United National. Absent Rule 54(b) certification in a multiparty suit, an order of \u201csummary judgment adjudicating the claims of fewer than all the parties is not a final appealable judgment within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.\u201d <em>Melancon v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>476 F.2d 594, 595 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">We therefore dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. If the trial court enters a new judgment and accompanies it with a proper Rule 54(b) certificate, the second appeal may be submitted on the record and briefs prepared for this appeal as supplemented by the new judgment and certificate. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
