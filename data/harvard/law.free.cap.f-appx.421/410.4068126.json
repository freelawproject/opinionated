We lack jurisdiction to gx-ant the x-elief that Lopez-Sanabxda requests. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s bx-ief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, Lopez-San-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>abria\u2019s motions are DISMISSED FOR LACK OF JURISDICTION, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir.
