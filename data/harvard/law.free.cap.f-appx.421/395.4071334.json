Carrillo does not challenge his conviction on appeal. Carrillo argues that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the career offender enhancement, based in part on his prior conviction for a crime of violence, the burglary of a habitation. He argues that the statute under which he was convicted, Texas Penal Code Annotated \u00a7 30.02(a), includes a means to <em>commit </em>the offense that does not meet the definition of a generic burglary as required by the Guidelines to impose such an enhancement. Carrillo also asserts that, although the indictment charged him conjunctively under two subsections of the statute, one subsection of which satisfied the definition of generic burglary, his guilty plea did not establish that he committed the conduct under that subsection.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The language in the indictment charging Carrillo with burglary tracked the language of \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) and \u00a7 30.02(a)(3), and the offense was charged conjunctively. A Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation under \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes a crime of violence for \u00a7 4B1.2 purposes. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>957 F.2d 157, 162 (5th Cir.1992) (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) context); <em>United States v. Hornsby, </em>88 F.3d 336, 339 (5th Cir.1996); <em>see also James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 206, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (noting that the definition of \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for a career offender enhancement \u201cclosely tracks\u201d the definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d set forth at \u00a7 924(e)). But a conviction under \u00a7 30.02(a)(3) does not, because that statutory subsection does not require entry with an intent to commit a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Constante, </em>544 F.3d 584, 587 (5th Cir.2008) (\u00a7 924(e) context).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The judgment from Carrillo\u2019s prior conviction states that the trial court heard evidence and adjudged Carrillo guilty of both paragraphs of the indictment. In Texas, however, \u201cthe State is only required to present evidence sufficient to support the conviction, the State need not present evidence that the defendant committed the offense according to each of the means alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Morales-Martinez, </em>496 F.3d 356, 360 (5th Cir.2007). The record in this case contains no evidence reflecting the specific subsection to which Carrillo pleaded guilty, nor does it contain the factual basis for his plea or any judicial confession. It thus cannot be determined whether Carrillo pleaded guilty to an offense that meets the definition of a generic burglary, an enumerated crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.1. Accordingly, we hold that the district court erred in applying \u00a7 4Bl.l\u2019s career offender enhancement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">The Government has not met its burden of showing that such an error is harmless. <em>See United States v. Delgado-Martinez, </em>564 F.3d 750, 753 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, the case must be remanded, <em>id., </em>and we do not address the other arguments advanced by Carrillo. Accordingly, we affirm Carrillo\u2019s conviction, but we vacate his sentence and remand his case for a new sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">AFFIRMED in part, VACATED and REMANDED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
