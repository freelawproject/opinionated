She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>argues that the district court clearly erred by finding that she had not met her burden of showing that she qualified for a safety valve adjustment pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. <em>See United States v. Flanagan, </em>80 F.3d 143, 145-47 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Setting aside that Marroquin cites no authority holding that the Government was bound by representations made during plea negotiations when no plea agreement was ever reached, her argument that the Government had agreed prior to trial that the safety valve adjustment was warranted ignores that the applicability of the adjustment was a matter for the district court to decide and was not subject to the Government\u2019s discretion. <em>See </em>\u00a7 501.2(a) (noting that the district court shall grant a safety valve adjustment \u201cif the court finds\u201d that the defendant satisfies the applicable criteria). Contrary to her assertion, the denial of the adjustment was not premised solely upon the credibility determinations of the interviewing detective; rather, the district court determined, based upon evidence adduced during trial and at sentencing, that Marroquin had not truthfully provided all information and evidence known to her during her pretrial debriefing. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(f)(5); \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). This court has rejected the pi'oposition that a defendant whose sentencing hearing has commenced may cure her failure to fully debrief for safety valve purposes by doing so during a suspension of the proceedings. <em>See United States v. Brenes, </em>250 F.3d 290, 293 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
