SMITH, Circuit Judge: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b344-21\">Manuel Avelar-Cruz petitions for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) holding that he is ineligible to apply for relief from removal based on former \u00a7 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) because he has failed to show actual, subjective reliance on the statute before its repeal. Because Avelar-Cruz has not provided evidence so compelling that any reasonable adjudicator would believe he has actively engaged in conduct reflecting an intention to preserve his eligibility for relief, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-23\">Avelar-Cruz, a citizen of Mexico, became a lawful permanent resident of the United States in 1982. In 1992, he was convicted by a state jury of false imprisonment and aggravated battery, both felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-24\">In 2008, the Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) brought removal proceedings against Avelar-Cruz pursuant to the INA. The notice to appear (\u201cNTA\u201d) alleged that Avelar-Cruz was subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>removal as an alien convicted of an aggravated felony after his admission to the United States,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> making him deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">At his initial hearing, Avelar-Cruz admitted the allegations contained in the NTA and conceded that he was removable, but he requested a waiver of removal under former INA \u00a7 212(c) (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994) (repealed 1996)). The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) granted a \u00a7 212(c) waiver and an adjustment of status under \u00a7 245 of the INA. DHS reserved the right to appeal, then filed a motion for reconsideration before the IJ, arguing that, under <em>Carranza-De Salinas v. Gonzales, </em>477 F.3d 200, 204-05, 207-10 (5th Cir.2007), Avelar-Cruz was not eligible for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, because his 1992 convictions resulted from a trial by jury rather than a guilty plea, and at the time Avelar-Cruz chose to proceed with a jury trial, he did not have an actual, subjective reliance on the continued availability of a \u00a7 212(c) waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">In response, the IJ held another hearing, at which Avelar-Cruz testified that he knew of the \u00a7 212(c) waiver at the time of his criminal trial and that one of the reasons he wanted to go to trial instead of plead guilty was that he believed the waiver would still be available to him if he did. He said that he had delayed his application for the waiver so he could acquire additional \u201cproof to be able to demonstrate that I had rehabilitated my life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">In support of his \u201crehabilitation,\u201d Ave-lar-Cruz presented the following evidence: He has lived in the United States for about thirty years; he owns a house in Roswell, New Mexico; he owns and operates his own tile business; he owns three vehicles; he has been married to a United States citizen since 1981; and he has five United States-citizen children. He also testified that his 1992 convictions were the result of alcohol and a bad relationship. He further stated that he no longer drinks; he has a relationship with his children; and his church has \u201chelped me change my life.\u201d He said that, since his convictions seventeen years ago, he has created a new life in which he helps others, including volunteering with ministry and music at the prison where he was formerly incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">When questioned as to his knowledge of the \u00a7 212(c) waiver, Avelar-Cruz stated that he had a conversation with his attorney at the time of his criminal trial about the conditions of the waiver. When asked what kind of waiver he was referring to, he responded, \u201cWell, waiver. A waiver because there are laws in which there are ways to request a pardon or waiver for cases such as this one.\u201d He did not know the legal name of, or the form number for, the waiver, but merely stated that he knew of \u201ca waiver available to keep [him] from being deported.\u201d He also testified that his attorney did not offer that he apply for the waiver and that he did not ask his attorney to do so, because he did not yet have proof that he had \u201crehabilitated [his] life.\u201d He could not, however, remember his previous attorney\u2019s name and did not have any documents to confirm his conversation with his attorney about the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-11\">Avelar-Cruz was taken into DHS custody in 2008 after he attempted to renew his green card. He said that he \u201cknew\u201d he would be taken into custody when he went to renew his green card, \u201cbecause [he] knew that this case that [he] had had was going to end up with an immigration judge or with an immigration officer.\u201d He said he nevertheless felt secure with being taken into custody, because \u201cback then I knew that I had enough proof so that I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>could demonstrate that I had rehabilitated and that I was doing good.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Based on the foregoing evidence, the IJ determined that Avelar-Cruz, despite \u201chis obvious efforts to tailor his responses ... to fit the Fifth Circuit\u2019s ruling in <em>Carranza,\u201d </em>was not eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief, because he did not actively engage in conduct that reflected an intent to preserve his eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. The IJ found that Avelar-Cruz\u2019s passive actions of waiting for an \u201cundetermined day in the \u2018eventual\u2019 future\u201d to seek \u00a7 212(c) relief did not show that he had made an affirmative decision to postpone filing his application to increase his likelihood of receiving \u00a7 212(c) relief or establish a reasonable reliance interest on the continued availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief. As a result, the IJ granted DHS\u2019s motion for reconsideration, vacated its order, denied Avelar-Cruz\u2019s request for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver, and ordered that he be removed to Mexico. The BIA dismissed Avelar-Cruz\u2019s appeal, agreeing with the IJ that, in light of Avelar-Cruz\u2019s passivity in seeking \u00a7 212(c) relief until he was placed in removal proceedings twelve years after his release from prison, he did not show that he had made an affirmative decision to wait to apply for \u00a7 212(e) relief in an effort to increase the likelihood of success based on his rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">We have authority to review only the BIA\u2019s decision, not the IJ\u2019s, unless the latter has some impact on the former. <em>Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). We must decide the petition only on the administrative record, and the administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4) (2006). We review the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>but defer to its reasonable interpretation of immigration regulations. <em>Carranza-De Salinas v. Gonzales, 477 </em>F.3d 200, 203 (5th Cir.2007). We owe no deference to the BIA\u2019s conclusions of law regarding the availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Avelar-Cruz argues that the BIA erred when it found him ineligible for a \u00a7 212(e) waiver on the ground that he did not show an actual, subjective reliance on the availability of the waiver under the INA. Former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA stated, in pertinent part,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">Aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence who temporarily proceeded abroad voluntarily and not under an order of deportation, and who are returning to a lawful unrelinquished domicile of seven consecutive years, may be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General.... The first sentence of this subsection shall not apply to an alien who has been convicted of one or more aggravated felonies and has served for such felony or felonies a term of imprisonment of at least 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed 1996). Aliens who pleaded guilty to a deportable offense before the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) remained eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief even after repeal, because otherwise the repeal of the statute would have had an impermissible retroactive effect. <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 319, 326, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). That is because the decision to plead guilty and receive a sentence that would leave the alien eligible for \u00a7 212(c) relief was likely made in reliance on the continuing availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Id. </em>at 323, 121 S.Ct. 2271.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">Although <em>St. Cyr </em>settled that aliens who pleaded guilty to a deportable offense before the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) remained eligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ble to apply for \u00a7 212(c) waivers even after repeal, the Supreme Court has not addressed the issue whether eligibility for such relief remains available to aliens who proceeded to trial. Relying on <em>Rankine v. Reno, </em>319 F.3d 93, 99-100 (2d Cir.2003), this court concluded that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) relief did not operate retroactively as to aliens who were convicted at trial before repeal, because, in electing to go to trial, they did not detrimentally rely on continued eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief. <em>Hernandez-Castillo v. Moore, </em>436 F.3d 516, 520 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The next year, however, we considered an alternative theory according to which \u00a7 212(c)\u2019s repeal might be impermissibly retroactive as to an alien who was convicted after a trial rather than a guilty plea. <em>See Carranza-De Salinas, </em>477 F.3d at 209. There, before the repeal of \u00a7 212(c), the petitioner was convicted by a jury of possessing marihuana with intent to distribute. <em>Id. </em>at 202. In 1997, a year after repeal, she received an NTA charging that she was removable based on her prior conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 203. She requested relief under former \u00a7 212(c), but the BIA held that a \u00a7 212(c) waiver was available only to aliens convicted pursuant to a plea agreement. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Petitioner appealed, arguing that the repeal of \u00a7 212(c) was impermissibly retroactive with respect to her case, because \u201cshe affirmatively chose not to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief immediately after her conviction, but instead to wait until deportation proceedings were initiated so as to have time to establish her rehabilitation and ties to the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209. We reversed, relying on <em>Restrepo v. McEl-roy, </em>369 F.3d 627, 634-35 (2d Cir.2004), holding that \u201cthe BIA erred in finding [Carranza] ineligible to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief without allowing her the opportunity to demonstrate that her actual, subjective reliance on the prior state of the law caused her to delay her application.\u201d <em>Carranza-De Salinas, </em>477 F.3d at 202. We held that if petitioner could \u201cdemonstrate on remand that she affirmatively decided to postpone her \u00a7 212(c) application to increase her likelihood of relief, then she has, under <em>Hemandez-Castillo, </em>established a reasonable \u2018reliance interest\u2019 in the future availability of \u00a7 212(c) relief comparable to that of the applicants in <em>St. Cyr </em>and she is entitled to make her application for relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 210.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">After <em>Carranza-De Salinas, </em>we require an applicant who alleges eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief to demonstrate \u201cactual, subjective reliance\u201d on \u00a7 212(c) before its repeal. <em>Id. </em>The applicant must show that he \u201c \u2018detrimentally changed his position in reliance on continued eligibility for \u00a7 212(c) relief,\u2019 or that he actively engaged in conduct that \u2018reflectfed] an intention to preserve [his] eligibility for relief under \u00a7 212(c).\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 205 (quoting <em>Rankine, </em>319 F.3d at 99-100). The determination of retroactive effect is made as to the individual applicant. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">Avelar-Cruz contends that, like the petitioner in <em>Carranza-De Salinas, </em>he knew that he could apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief upon his release from prison, but he affirmatively chose not to apply immediately, to have time to show rehabilitation and to form ties to the community. In this regard, Avelar-Cruz argues that his actions over the years (such as owning a house, running his own business, marrying a U.S. citizen, caring for his five United States-citizen children, refraining from drinking, and volunteering at his church and the prison where he was formerly held) provide \u201ctangible proof and objective evidence of his actual mind set\u201d to rehabilitate himself while he patiently waited for the opportunity to apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief. Avelar-Cruz further asserts that when he sought to renew his green card, he knew of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>likelihood that he would be placed in removal proceedings because of his prior convictions, but he saw it as a chance to obtain \u00a7 212(c) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">But whether Avelar-Cruz did in fact affirmatively choose not to apply immediately apply for \u00a7 212(c) relief, in order to show i-ehabilitation, is a question of fact,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would [not] be compelled\u201d to disagree with the BIA\u2019s determination that he did not so choose. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4). Ave-lar-Cruz has no evidence \u2014 other than his testimony during removal proceedings\u2014 that he discussed obtaining \u00a7 212(c) relief with his attorney at the time of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">It is suspicious that Avelar-Cruz is not only unaware of any specifics regarding the \u00a7 212(c) waiver, but also cannot even remember the lawyer who defended him at his criminal trial and who supposedly told him about the availability of \u00a7 212(c) waivers. Yet, Avelar-Cruz vividly remembers the conversation. Moreover, although the mere fact that an alien has \u201clet a considerable time elapse before offering to demonstrate rehabilitation\u201d does not imply that he did not intend to file for a \u00a7 212(c) waiver,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the fact that Avelar-Cruz did not so much as contact an attorney, or at least develop some knowledge regarding how to obtain a \u00a7 212(c) waiver \u2014 his only legal means of remaining in the country \u2014 before being placed in removal proceedings twelve years after he was released from prison suggests that he was not actually planning someday to seek a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Avelar-Cruz has therefore not provided evidence so compelling that any reasonable adjudicator would believe he has actively engaged in conduct reflecting an intention to preserve his eligibility for relief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4); <em>Carranza-De Salinas, </em>477 F.3d at 205. The petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
