She challenges the IJ\u2019s decision to deny her motion, and she challenges the refusal of the IJ and the BIA to reopen the proceedings <em>sua sponte. </em>Finding both challenges to be without merit, we deny Edemeka\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-26\">Edemeka moved to reopen her removal proceedings on the ground that she had received ineffective assistance of counsel. Edemeka challenges the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion on three grounds. First, she argues that the IJ retroactively applied the wrong legal standard to her ineffective-assistance-of counsel claim. Second, she argues that her motion should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>granted because she established ineffective assistance of counsel under the standard announced in <em>Strickland v. Washington.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Finally, she argues that the denial of her motion was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"A6X\">Edemeka\u2019s claim that the IJ applied the wrong legal standard to her motion is without merit. At the time that Edemeka filed her motion to reopen in October 2008, claims of ineffective assistance of counsel during immigration proceedings were adjudicated under the factors laid out in <em>Matter of Lozada</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In January 2009, the <em>Lozada </em>factors were superseded in part by Attorney General Mukasey\u2019s decision in <em>Compean I,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which announced a new, more stringent test for determining when a motion to reopen removal proceedings should be granted because of ineffective assistance of counsel. Less than five months later, Attorney General Holder issued <em>Compean II, </em>which vacated <em>Compean I </em>and restored the <em>Lozada </em>standard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Edemeka argues that this \u201cmid-stream\u201d change in the governing legal standard violated her Due Process rights. However, at no time was there any uncertainty whether Edemeka\u2019s petition would be decided under <em>Lozada </em>or <em>Compean I. Compean I </em>expressly stated that it applied only to motions filed after the date on which it issued: \u201cwith respect to motions filed prior to\u201d the opinion, IJs were instructed that \u201cthey should continue to apply the <em>Lozada </em>factors.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Edemeka\u2019s claim that some of the proceedings in the case were \u201cbased on <em>Compean\u201d </em>finds no support in the record. The IJ was correct to rest his July 2009 denial of Edemeka\u2019s motion to reopen on an application of the <em>Lozada </em>factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-13\">Edemeka\u2019s argument that her motion should have been granted because she has established ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland </em>is likewise without merit. The Sixth Amendment right to counsel at issue in <em>Strickland </em>applies only in criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Removal proceedings are civil in nature; <em>Strickland </em>has no applicability here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">Edemeka also cannot show that the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen was arbitrary and capricious in light of all of the circumstances. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings \u201cunder a highly deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We must uphold a decision of the BIA, \u201ceven a decision that we deem in error, so long as it is not capricious, racially invidious, utterly without foundation in the evidence, or otherwise so irrational that it is arbitrary rather than the result of any perceptible rational approach.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The record shows that Edemeka was not honest in her deal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>ings with the Department of Homeland Security; her applications for relief contained incomplete or inaccurate information. Further, she intentionally failed to voluntarily depart as ordered.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> All but one of the factors Edemeka relies on to support her motion to reopen are conditions that have arisen as a result of her continued unlawful stay in the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Thus, the IJ\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen the proceedings was not arbitrary, capricious, or utterly without foundation in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Edemeka also challenges the refusal of the IJ and the BIA to reopen her removal proceedings <em>sua sponte. </em>The relevant regulatory provisions vest the IJ<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and the BIA<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> with complete, unfettered discretion when determining whether to reopen a case on their own motion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because \u201c \u2018review is not to be had if the statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency\u2019s exercise of discretion,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> we lack jurisdiction to review the refusal of the IJ and the BIA to exercise <em>sua sponte </em>their general authority to reopen immigration proceedings.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Because none of Edemeka\u2019s challenges to the BIA\u2019s decision gives us ground to set that decision aside, her petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b491-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
