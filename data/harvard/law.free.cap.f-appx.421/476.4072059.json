The magistrate judge, presiding with the consent of the parties, dismissed the complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), concluding that Anderson\u2019s claims were frivolous and failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. She did, however, grant Anderson permission to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-19\">Section 1915A(b)(l) provides for dismissal of a prisoner\u2019s civil-rights complaint if it is \u201cfrivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d We review de novo the decision to dismiss a complaint on this basis, accepting the plaintiffs allegations as true. <em>Green v. Atkinson, </em>623 F.3d 278, 280 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-20\">Anderson\u2019s rambling three-page brief to this court does not identify any flaw in the magistrate judge\u2019s analysis. Anderson\u2019s failure to point to specific errors puts him in the same position as if he had not appealed at all. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas Cnty. Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although we liberally construe briefs filed by pro se litigants, even they must reasonably comply with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(9), which requires that the appellant\u2019s brief contain, among other things, an argument setting out his contentions and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the reasons for them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, we decline to revisit the magistrate judge\u2019s decision. <em>See Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Anderson\u2019s appeal is frivolous, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), and is dismissed, 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Anderson that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be permitted to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b502-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
