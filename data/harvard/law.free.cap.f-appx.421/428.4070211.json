Jones argues that his 24-month sentence, which was above the recommended guidelines range, was unreasonable given that his violations were only Grade C violations. Jones did not object to his sentence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>district court. Accordingly, we review his appeal for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Whitelaw, </em>580 F.3d 256, 259-60 (5th Cir.2009); <em>see also Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 1429, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Because the 24-month sentence Jones received on revocation was not greater than the term authorized by statute, it is \u201cclearly legal.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>125 F.3d 285, 288 (5th Cir.1997). Additionally, this court has routinely upheld sentences on revocation greater than the advisory policy range but within the statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 343, 344 (5th Cir.2006) (per curiam); <em>United States v. Milligan, </em>353 Fed.Appx. 954 (5th Cir.2009). Thus, there is no plain error with regard to Jones\u2019s 24-month sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>129 S.Ct. at 1429. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b454-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
