Devlin, administrator, against the mayor of New York and others. The defendant appeals from an order denying a motion made by him to restrain the plaintiff from entering judgment on a referee\u2019s report, upon the alleged ground that it does not direct the judgment to be entered thereon pursuant to Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 1022,- which provides that the report of a referee \u201cmust direct the judgment to be entered thereupon.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b943-5\">Argued before Allen, P.

Y. common pleas, general term, Hovember, 1890, the opinion in which is handed down herewith.) In this view of the main question presented upon this appeal, it is immaterial whether or not the defendants, the mayor, etc., of Hew York, have waived the objection to the report arising from the alleged omission of the referee to direct the judgment, by moving to compel the parties entitled thereto to enter judgment upon the report. Our conclusion that the report is sufficient to authorize the entry of judgment preserves the right to cause such entry to be made without regard to the alleged waiver. The order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
