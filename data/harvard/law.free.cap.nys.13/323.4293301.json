In this action the defendant denied the execution of the note, and that was the question of fact submitted to the jury upon the trial, and found in favor \u2022of the defendant. The note was signed by a cross, and the name of John Boyle was signed as a witness, but Boyle was dead at the time of the trial, and there was no direct proof of the execution of the note by the defendant, and he denied the same. Under such proof, the verdict cannot be disturbed, and we And no error in the record which would justify a reversal of the judgment. The judgment and order should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-13\">Pratt, J., concurs. Barnard, P. J., dissents.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
