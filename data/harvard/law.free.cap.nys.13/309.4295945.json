Sparks against the city of Water-town. The action was to recover for work, labor, and services claimed to have been rendered by the plaintiff John Edwards, and for materials claimed to have been furnished for the defendant. Plaintiffs claim there was an express contract for the services and materials mentioned in the complaint. Defendant claims the services rendered and materials furnished were for the owners of the rooms that were leased. The referee found that John Edwards was the agent or attorney in fact of Adeiia Jane Sparks, Helen M. Edwards, and Susan Hayes in the management of the building known as the \u201cHayes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Block,\u201d upon which the repairs-were made, and that he offered the same for the use of the city for an annual rental of $400. The sixth finding of fact sets forth a letter written by Edwards during the negotiations, and published in a newspaper, setting forth the advantages of the Hayes block, for city offices, over other buildings contemplated. In this letter he says: \u201c The rooms are all that can be desired, and the owners offer to make any alterations and fit them up complete, and have them all ready for their occupation without one cent of expense to the city other than an annual rent of $400.\u201d This letter was admitted in evidence against his objection. The referee further-found \u201cthat the defendant, at or before the execution of said lease, had made no agreement, expressed or implied, to pay said Edwards for the fitting up and furnishing said rooms suitable for occupancy, as aforesaid, nor had he made any claim of the existence of such a promise. \u201d He also found, viz., \u201c that the value or cost of said fitting and furnishing of said rooms does not distinctly appear by any evidence given before me. \u201d He found, as a conclusion of law, \u201cthat the defendant is not indebted to the plaintiff for or on account of any of the matters set forth in the complaint.\u201d From a judgment for defendant, plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b328-5\">Argued before Habdin, P.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AHT\">Whether there was a contract existing between the plaintiff Edwards and the defendant in respect to the matters referred to in the complaint was a question of fact. There was a great variety of evidence given bearing upon the question. There was a conflict in the evidence, and after looking into the evidence, and bearing in mind the rule laid down by the court in <em>Roe </em>v. <em>Roe, </em>14 Hun, 613, that \u201cthe findings are not conclusive, but the whole evidence is open to examination by the appellate court,\u201d we are of the opinion that we ought not to disturb the conclusion of fact reached by the referee. We are not able to say that the findings are not supported by evidence, nor that they are not in accordance with the strength and weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">2. It seems that the common council of the defendant, on the 26th of April, 1882, after the litigation in this case had been quite extensive, passed a resolution to the effect that its mayor was instructed to settle the claim. It is found as a fact that the resolution \u201cwas without consideration other than that payment pursuant to it would have relieved the deft, from further defense of this action.\u201d While there were some steps being taken to carry out the resolution, among others an attempt to adjust the costs, it is found as a fact that one of the attorneys stated and declared that \u201che would not accept the proposition of the resolution and proceedings mentioned in the 13th finding herein, but go on with the trial of the action, which was accordingly done.\u201d We see nothing in the resolution which should be held to conclusively establish the liability of the defendant. Our attention is called to <em>Calanan </em>v. <em>McClure, </em>47 Barb. 206, which is to the effect that the \u201cadmissions of a party, whether of law or of fact, which have been acted upon by another, are conclusive against the party making them, as between him and the person whose conduct he has influenced; and this whether the admissions are made in express language to the person himself or are implied from the open and general conduct of the party. \u201d We see nothing in the case which aids the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">3. Defendant offered in evidence'an article published in the Morning Dispatch, bearing date September 19, 1874, over the signature of the plaintiff John Edwards, and it was conceded that the printed matter is a copy of the letters published in the newspaper, \u201cand left there by Edwards for publicar tian. \u201d It was also conceded that Edwards \u201cdid see at time of publication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the copy as printed apparently over his signature.\u201d This was objected to as incompetent and immaterial, among other grounds. The objections were overruled, and the article was received in evidence, and the article is set out in the sixth finding of fact made by the referee. \"We thing the evidence was properly received as bearing upon the disputed questions of fact arising in the course of the trial. Having found no erroneous rulings made by the referee during the progress of the trial, and being of the opinion that his conclusion of law based upon the findings of fact made by him is correct, we must sustain the judgment entered upon the report of the learned referee. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
