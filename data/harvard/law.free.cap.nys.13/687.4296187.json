Defendant appeals from a judgment for plaintiff, entered on an order striking out the answer as frivolous, and from said order. Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 500, provides: \u201cThe answer of the defendant must contain: (1) A general and specific denial of each material allegation of the complaint controverted by the defendant, or of any knowledge or information thereof sufficient to form a belief. \u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b705-16\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

In order to sustain his proposition he has thought it necessary to cite 26 authorities, none of which have the slightest application to the question presented. The motion seems to, have been granted upon the ground that the answer contained no denial, because it simply denied that the defendant had any knowledge or information as to the allegations contained in the complaint sufficient to form a belief. This form of, denial, however, is expressly authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>section 500 of the Code. It hardly needs authority or argument to establish its sufficiency. The judgment and order should be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
