Fox against the village of Lansingburgh for alleged negligence of the defendant in allowing a pile of flag-stone to be placed upon the sidewalk, over which the plaintiff, while passing along the walk in a dark night, fell and was injured. The proof disclosed that at the time of the injury there was upon the sidewalk of one of the streets of the defendant a pile of flag-stone, piled one upon another, to the height of about 10 to 12 inches at a point where the walk was about 13 feet wide: the stone extending from the curb of the street to within 3 feet 7 inches of the stoop of a house at that point. On a dark night, at 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, the plaintiff, a young man of about 20 years of age, in company with three other young men, were passing along that street, and when a short distance from where these stones were piled, started to run a race to a point beyond where the stones lay, and in running the plaintiff came in contact with the pile of flagging-stone and broke his leg. The proof does not disclose by whom the stones were placed in that position, nor is there any proof of actual knowledge on the part of the trustees or officers of the village that the walk was thus obstructed; but the evidence shows that they had been there for about one week before the injury. The jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $2,000, upon which judgment was entered, from which the defendant appeals, and the principal or only ground urged on this appeal as ground for reversal is alleged misdirection of the judge in his charge to the jury.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b192-12\">Argued before Learned, P. J., and Landon and Mayham, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-13\"><em>Comstock </em>c6 <em>Hyatt, (A. C. Comstock, </em>of counsel,) for appellant. <em>Merritt &amp; Ryan, (H. A. Merritt, </em>of counsel,) for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b192-14\">Mayham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYP\">The learned counsel for the appellant insists that it was error for the court to charge the jury in the following language: \u201cIfow I charge you, gentlemen, as a matter of law, that it is the absolute duty of the village of Lansingburgh to keep its streets in a reasonably safe condition for travel, and that is an absolute duty which they owe to all travelers; and, when that duty is not discharged, and in consequence thereof, a traveler is injured without any fault on his part, they incur a liability.\u201d \u201c That the village of Lansingburgh is under no obligation to provide for everything that may happen on their streets, but only for such use of them as is ordinary, or as may be reasonably expected. \u201d While this language is quite as strong as the rule upon this subject under the authorities will justify, we do not think, when taken in connection with the balance of the charge, that ik'was an erroneous statement of the law. It is doubtless the duty of a municipality to keep its streets in a reasonably safe condition for the public travel, and this, we think, is the fair construction of what was said by the learned judge. In <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Mayor, etc., </em>16 N. E. Hep. 320, relied upon by the counsel for the appellant, Andrew's, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>J., uses this language: \u201cWhere an injury happens from the defect of a roadway itself, or from a dangerous condition of the street, created by the act or consent of the municipality, negligence, as in the cases mentioned, is the ground of liability.\u201d He' also says that \u201cthe mere existence of a defect, from which the traveler sustains injury, does not, independently of negligence, establish a culpable breach of duty on the part of the municipality;\u201d and he proceeds to discuss the difference in the kind of proof in a case where the defect exists by the act of a municipality or to its actual knowledge, or where it exists by the act of a third person, and he adds: \u201cIt is at all times to exercise due care that the streets are safe, and free from dangerous defects, and that they shall not become unsafe. \u201d We think the rule laid down by the trial judge is substantially like that above quoted, when we read the portion to which exception is taken in connection with other expressions of the judge in his charge, such as: \u201cThe village of Lansingburgh is under no obligation to provide for everything that may happen on the streets. I charge you that municipal authorities are not insuraneers.\u201d But if the language used by the judge to which we have referred went too far, it was corrected in his response to the defendant\u2019s request to charge, and the true rule was then enunciated. The defendant requested the judge to charge \u201cthat the defendant is not in law required to keep and maintain the walks of the village in an absolutely safe condition.\u201d To this the court responded: \u201cIso charge, with this qualification: I charge that the village of Lansingburgh must use proper care and vigilance to keep the streets and highways in a reasonably safe condition for travel. That is an absolute duty they owe to travelers.\u201d Taking the whole charge, we think it presented the question in the case fairly to the jury, so as not to mislead them; and that the points to which exceptions are taken are fairly presented, and covered by the charge when taken as a whole. The question of contributory negligence by the plaintiff was one for the jury, under the circumstances of this case, and was properly submitted to them. The evidence shows how long this obstruction had been upon the sidewalk, and presented a proper question for the jury upon the point of the negligence of the defendant, as was said by the court in <em>Kunz </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>10 N. E. Rep. 442: \u201cThis lapse of time, together with the fact that Federal street was a busy and frequented part of the city, made it, we think, under the authorities a question for the jury whether the authorities charged with the care of the public streets ought to have known of the obstruction, and to have caused its removal before the accident.\u201d The denial of the defendant\u2019s motion for non-suit was not error, and the judgment must be affirmed. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Learned, P.
