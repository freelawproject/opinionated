At the trial the judge charged that, if the jury found that said misrepresentations were made, plaintiff could not recover, and they would have to find a verdict for defendant for the $500 which he had \u201cloaned and advanced\u201d to plaintiff; but if no misrepresentations were made then the jury should find a verdict for plaintiff for the amount claimed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The jury found a verdict for defendant, allowing him no recovery for the $500.

The order appealed from will therefore be affirmed, with costs to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
