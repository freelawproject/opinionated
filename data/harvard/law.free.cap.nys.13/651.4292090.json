Wicks andiothers against Albert D. Thomnson. One Joshua Wicks formerly owned a tract of land, which he devised to his sons, James and Selah. Plaintiffs are the devisees of Selah, and defendant the grantee of the devisees of James. During the life-time of Joshua the land was divided by a farm lane, situated wholly upon the land subsequently devised to Selah, the land devised to James adjoining it on the west,'10 feet from the west line of the lane according to his devise; but the testimony showed that Joshua Wicks widened the road in his life-time, and made it extend to the 'line of James\u2019 land. James always used this lane to get to his land, as also did his successors after him. Subsequently Selah Wicks fenced in the lane on both sides. Afterwards he had the lane surveyed, and widened it to 60 feet, making a highway of it, called \u201cMaple Avenue, \u201d and took down the fence, leaving it open up to James Wicks\u2019 land, though, according to the survey, the land would not extend to James Wicks\u2019 land by a few feet. Subsequently the devisees of Selah Wicks built a fence on the line as surveyed, leaving a narrow strip between the lane and James Wicks\u2019 land. They claimed this strip, and the trespass complained of is that defendant, who had purchased part of the James Wicks tract, tore down part of the fence to gain access from the road to his land over this strip. Previous to the building of this fence by plaintiffs the lane, and afterwards the avenue, was used both by Joshua Wicks and Selah and James Wicks and their respective devisees for entrance to the lands on each side of it for a period of over 50 years. James Wicks sold some of his land with reference to this lane, and Selah Wicks, under whom plaintiffs claim, and who opened the road, advised people to buy land from James, knowing that they would have no access to the land so bought except through the road. There was a verdict and judgment for defendant, from which plaintiffs appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b670-9\">Argued before Barnard, P.

The record shows that the case was submitted to the jury under a charge as favorable to the plaintiffs as they were able to ask, and upon the issue as so made a verdict was rendered for the defendant. It is, I think, perfectly clear that Joshua Wicks, when the road was laid out through the land, intended to make the west line of the road the east line of the land devised to James Wicks, the prior owner of defendant\u2019s land. The proof shows that for the space of about 50 years the west side of the lane was the east side of said James Wicks\u2019 land. This was a practical location, and the possession and user by each party of the land upon their respective sides of this lane must be presumptive evidence of title. I think it is also clear that when, in 1879, Selah Wicks opened Maple avenue, he intended to and did open it up to James Wicks\u2019 land, so that, if the plaintiffs have any title as a basis for this suit, it is a varying strip, about six inches wide, upon which the fence stands. But the verdict was right, even upon this contention of the plaintiffs. It is plain that Selah Wicks made the west side of Maple avenue, which he dedicated to public use, so as to take in the whole lane as it existed at that time. It is absurd to suppose that he intended to reserve six inches on the west side of the avenue, as no good purpose can be attributed to such an intention, and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>whole conduct afterwards refutes any such claim. His declaration at the time of opening the avenue, that he did not intend to leave any land between the avenue and the land of his brother, and afterwards advising parties to build upon the west side of the avenue, makes it incredible that he did not intend to dedicate Maple avenue up to his brother\u2019s land. If such is the fact, then Maple avenue, for its whole length, was.a public street, and the plaintiffs had no right to erect a fence on the west side, and the same, when erected, was a nuisance, and the defendant had a right to abate it. But, assuming that the fence stood upon the land of the plaintiffs, and that Maple avenue did not include the land upon which the fence stood, we think, under the proofs, the jury were justified in finding a verdict for the defendant. The trespass consisted in a use of the land as a right of way as it had been uninterruptedly used for over 50 years. It was a use that the common owner had made before it was devised to James Wicks, and by the latter for over 40 years. We think, therefore, the defendant had a right to use the whole roadway, and to enter upon it as he and his father before him had been in the habit of doing for more than 50 years. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
