The defendant denied the employment, and claims that on the same day he sold the property to Annie E. Crooker for $13,150. The evidence was conflicting, and the case had to go to the jury. The fact that the defendant employed and paid another broker, who effected a sale to another person, was not a defense; and the evidence respecting it was incompetent, and therefore properly excluded. <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Schaefer, </em>105 N. Y. 289, 11 N. E. Rep. 634. It is settled that when one of the contracting parties either prevents or waive-, the literal performance of a condition precedent, which the other is ready and offers to fulfill, he cannot avail himself of such non-performance to relieve him from his own obligation. <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Bierling, </em>31 N. Y. 463; <em>Risley </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>64 N. Y. 576; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Drumgoole, </em>109 N. Y. 63,15 N. E. Rep. 747. The evidence sufficiently sustains the verdict, and we find no error requiring a new trial. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
