The case involved no new question of law, and our decision was only an application of well-settled principles. The authority <em>(Macullar </em>v. <em>McKinley, </em>99 N. Y. 353, 2 N. E. Rep. 9) so strenuously urged by the appellant was critically examined by us, and was found essentially distinguishable from the case at bar. Our decision in no way impugns the principle enunciated by the court of appeals. Although we adverted to the omission from the case of a statement that it contained all the evidence, and suggested the effect of such omission, the remark was <em>obiter; </em>and we proceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>to consider and determine the appeal upon the evidence as presented in the record before us. <em>Fx industria </em>we avoided to found our decision on the technical effect. The other considerations pressed upon us are overborne by the equal hardships to the respondent, and by the public interest in the end of the litigation. Motion denied, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
