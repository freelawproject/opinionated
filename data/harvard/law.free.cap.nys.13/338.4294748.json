It also appears from the petition that by reason of such contract this action is brought for an accounting. It being evident that an action upon this contract for an accounting cannot be maintained, the order for the inspection of the books was unauthorized, and should not have been made. For these reasons the order should be reversed, with ;$10 costs and disbursements, and the motion denied. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
