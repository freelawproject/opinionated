On September 14, 1886, the plaintiff was riding in a buggy drawn by one horse, on the highway and approaching the grade crossing over the defendant\u2019s railroad just north of the station at De ICalb Junction. The highway and the railroad tracks south of the crossing lie side by side in converging lines. The plaintiff stopped about 360 feet south of the crossing, which was then occupied by ears that were being sorted and shifted by means of an engine. After waiting about 15 minutes, all the cars had been moved away from the crossing, and the engine backed southerly towards the plaintiff, and stopped on the track about' 30 feet nearer the crossing than the plaintiff then was. The plaintiff then called out: \u201cIs it all right so we can go ahead?\u201d and some one on the engine replied: \u201cAll right; go ahead.\u201d The plaintiff moved forward, and, when his horse and buggy came abreast of the engine, being then about 40 feet from it and 250 feet from the crossing, the steam suddenly escaped from the \u201c pop-whistle, \u201d stopped, went off again, then three \u201c toots\u201d of the whistle sounded, all in rapid succession. Steam escaped from the side of the engine, .and partly enveloped the horse. At the first sound of the whistle the horse sprang sideways into the ditch, and plunged more with the successive noises. The plaintiff was thrown from the buggy, and his leg broken. It appeared that the pop-whistle worked automatically, and usually, when the engine stood still, and that the defendant had given orders to the men operating the engine not to try to control it. The \u201ctoots\u201d of the whistle were signals that the engine was about to move. It, did not appear that the escape of steam from the sides of the engine was controllable. The defendant moved'for a nonsuit at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and renewed the motion at the close of the whole testimony, upon the ground that no negligence on the part of defendant had been shown. Both motions were denied. The jury found for the plaintiff. Defendant appeals from the judgment for plaintiff entered on the verdict, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b168-6\">Argued before Learned, P.

The learned judge said: \u201cIt was their duty, so far as they had control, to so manage the engine that it should not \u00a1unnecessarily jeopardize the plaintiff, and that, if they blew the whistle just as he came opposite them, and it was unnecessary to do so under the circumstances,\u201d\u2014the jury might find that the defendant was liable. This instruction proceeds upon the theory that the defendant was not to be made liable because it made the noises and performed the operations incident to its business, but because, having given the plaintiff, who had waited some time to obtain it, an assurance of safety, it was its duty, if it was in its power, to refrain for the moment from unnecessarily doing any act to imperil his safety. This instruction appears to be reasonable, and is within the doctrine of <em>Borst </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>4 Hun, 346; affirmed 66 N. Y. 639. The defendant contends that the defendant\u2019s servants did no improper act, and' omitted no proper one. If the operations of the en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>gine were under their control they could have suppressed the \u201cpop-whistle\u201d and the \u201ctooting\u201d of the whistle. If the pop-whistle was not under control, but worked automatically, and was liable to go off whenever the engine stood still, these facts were known to the engineer. The plaintiff was not shown to know them. The question would then be whether it was negligence to stop the engine in advance of the plaintiff, instead of in his rear, and tell him to go ahead, without regard to the liability of the pop-whistle to go off. The assurance of safety was made without reservation, and implied, we think, the control of the engineer over his engine and its instruments of alarming sounds. We think the case was proper for the jury, and that the defendant has no ground to complain of the manner of its submission. The defendant\u2019s counsel contends that the fair meaning of the words, \u201cAll right; go ahead,\u201d was that the crossing was clear. We do not think the court could hold that that was its only meaning, or that the jury ought, under the circumstances, to have held so. There was slight cause to charge the plaintiff with contributory negligence, and the verdict cannot be disturbed upon that ground. The charge with respect to damages was carefully, and, we think, accurately, made. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
