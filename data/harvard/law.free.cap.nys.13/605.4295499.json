Arguimban. The action was brought to recover damages for an alleged breach of a written contract for the sale of 3,000 boxes of raisins by plaintiff to defendant; the breach alleged being the refusal of defendant to accept the raisins, and pay for them in cash. The raisins were sold to defendant by plaintiff\u2019s agent under a written contract, which contained the following: \u201cTerms: L/C on London, thro\u2019 Green and Whineray. \u201d The plaintiff failed to have Green &amp; Whineray draw a draft for the contract price of the raisins on defendant\u2019s bankers under a letter of credit and assume the liability of the plaintiff on the contract as was the understanding, which defendant alleged was a condition precedent. Plaintiff claimed that such failure was due to the refusal of Green &amp; Whineray to do business under the arrangement, and offered evidence to show a subsequent modification of defendant's contract, whereby he promised to pay for the goods in cash on delivery. This evidence was allowed over defendant\u2019s objection, and was directly contradicted by defendant. Defendant asked to go to the jury on the question of fact thus raised, but was refused, and he duly excepted. From a judgment on the verdict, and from orders denying.his motion for a new trial, defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b623-13\">Argued before Sedgwick, C.

To hold that the contract required the defendant to pay cash on the delivery of the goods or of the documents therefor would be equivalent to striking out of the contract the words: \u201cTerms: L/C on London, thro\u2019Green and Whineray,\u201d and to the making of a new contract between the parties. At the trial the plaintiff seems to have been conscious of the difficulty, for he sought to overcome it by proving, against the objection and exception of the defendant, that upon the refusal of Green &amp; Whineray to act as it was contemplated they should it was orally agreed between the parties that the defendant should accept the goods on their arrival at New York, and pay cash for them. The evidence relating to such subsequent oral agreement, constituting, as it did, an important modification of the original contract, was only admissible in case the complaint was broad enough for the purpose. Of this I have grave doubt. But, assuming that the complaint was sufficient, the defendant, under his answer, had the right to deny that such subsequent oral agreement was ever made, and he did deny it in positive terms.. In that aspect the case presented a question of fact which should have been submitted to the jury, for the defendant moved for leave to go to the jury upon it, and duly excepted to the denial of the motion. As the conclusion already reached necessitates a new trial, it is not necessary to consider the other questions raised by the exceptions. I cannot refrain, however, from saying that some of the evidence sought to be introduced by the defendant upon the cross-examination of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, and also as part of his own case, seems to have been erroneously excluded; but, as this was probably due to the mistaken view adopted by the trial judge concerning the liability of the defendant under the original contract, and inasmuch as any error so committed can be readily obviated upon the new trial to be had in conformity with the views herein expressed, a discussion of these questions at the present time may well be omitted! The judgment and orders appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Sedgwick, C.
