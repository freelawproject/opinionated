Uelson. The action was commenced in May, 1878, and has been tried at the circuit five times, and has been before this court on three former occasions. See 24 Hun, 395; 36 Hun, 149; 13 FT. Y. St. Rep. 211. At the trial next preceding the one now here for review a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff of $500, which verdict was, by the trial justice, set aside, and an opinion delivered, which is reported in 1 H. Y. Supp. 280. At the trial in March, 1889, at the close of the evidence, the circuit judge directed a verdict for the defendant, and to review that decision this appeal is brought. The action was for slander.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AES\">Upon the first appeal (24 Hun, 398) Smith, J., in speaking for this court, said: \u201cThe case falls within the rule that a communication, made <em>bona fide, </em>and without malice, upon any subject-matter in reference to which the party communicating has a duty, is privileged if made to a party having a corresponding duty, although it contain criminatory matter which, without this privilege, would be slanderous and actionable. <em>Thorn </em>v. <em>Blanchard, </em>5 Johns. 508; <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>21 Wend. 319; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>3 Sandf. 341; <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>32 Eng. Law <em>&amp; </em>Eq. 173.\u201d When the case was before us on the second appeal, (36 Hun, 150,) Follett, J., in speaking for the court, said: \u201cWhen the facts and circumstances on which an accusation is made are undisputed, the question of probable cause is a question of law for the court. The plaintiff\u2019s theory was that defendant sent or procured the communication to be sent for the purpose of accusing the plaintiff and procuring her discharge; and, unless this theory was established as a question of fact, the defendant was entitled to a verdict. Unless the defendant sent or procured this communication to be sent, we think the defendant had probable cause for the accusation. This was the judgment of the executive committee, who must be presumed to have been fair-minded men of intelligence, desiring to discharge their duties to the public and persons interested.\u201d When the case was here on the third appeal, (13 N. Y. St. Rep. 214,) in the course of the opinion delivered it was said: \u201cWe should have been better satisfied with the course of the trial if the learned judge had said to the jury, as a matter of law, that the defendant had probable cause, and that the communication was privileged, if they found he did not send or cause to be sent the matter, even though they found that the plaintiff did not send or cause the same to be sent.\u201d Since that decision was made, the court of appeals, in <em>Byam </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>111 N. Y. 143, 19 N. E. Rep. 75, has held, viz.: \u201cPrivileged communications are exceptions to the general rule which- implies malice in a libelous publication, and infers some damage. It rests with the party claiming the privilege to show that the cause is brought within the exception. The exception covers cases where a communication is made <em>bona fide </em>upon any subject-matter in which the party making it has an interest, or in reference to which he has a duty, legal, moral, or social, which may fairly be presumed to have led to the communication when made to a person having a corresponding interest or duty.\u201d And it was further held in that case that when upon the trial it has been held as a matter of law that the communication was privileged \u201cthe burden rests upon the plaintiff to \u25a0 establish that it was maliciously made. \u201d And upon the fourth trial of this case it was held at the circuit that whether the charge was maliciously made was a question of fact to be determined by the jury in accordance with the doctrine laid down in <em>Byam </em>v. <em>Collins, supra. </em>After the jury had found-a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $500, a motion for a new trial was made, and the learned judge who presided at the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>granted the motion, and held that the \u201cjury must have misconstrued the evidence, or failed to give it its legitimate effect in arriving at the conclusion they did; and that, the verdict being clearly against the weight of evidence, it is the duty of the court to set it aside and grant a new trial.\u201d 1 N. Y. Supp. 280. Upon the trial now brought in review the trial judge approved of the opinion delivered in deciding the case as appears reported in 1 N. Y. Supp. 280, and added thereto his own conviction upon the evidence produced \u201cthat the verdict should be directed for the defendant.\u201d We are inclined, upon a full consideration of the evidence now in the appeal-book, and in view of the previous decisions in the case, to say that the communication made by the defendant to the executive committee was privileged.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">2. Upon the trial the plaintiff stated as a witness an opinion based upon her knowledge of the handwriting of the defendant, tending to the conclusion that the envelope and circular were sent by the defendant, based upon the supposition that the superscription and writing were in the handwriting of the defendant. It was conceded upon the trial by the plaintiff \u201cthat none of the writing nowon the paper is in Mr. Nelson\u2019s handwriting.\u201d Considerable evidence was given by witnesses, who expressed the opinion that none of the writing upon the envelope or circular was in the handwriting of the defendant; besides, his own testimony is fully and forcibly to the effect that he had nothing to do with the origin or sending of the envelope or circular contained therein. After a careful review of the evidence, we are constrained to say that no error was committed by the trial judge in refusing to submit an inquiry to the jury as to whether or no the communication was sent by the defendant. It may be said there was a <em>scintilla </em>of evidence to establish such a proposition. We think it appropriate, upon this aspect of the case, to apply the rule laid down in <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>103 N. Y. 343, 8 N. E. Rep. 654, where it was held, viz.: \u201cIf the proof of a fact is so preponderating that a verdict against it would be set aside by the court as contrary to the evidence, it is the duty of the court to direct a verdict. It is not sufficient to authorize a submission of the fact to the jury that there is a <em>\u2018scintilla </em>of evidence\u2019\u2014a mere surmise\u2014to the contrary.\u201d And, also, the rule as stated in the language of Judge Allen in <em>Baulec </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>59 N. Y. 356, that \u201cit is not enough to authorize the submission of a.question as one of fact to the jury that there is \u2018some evidence.\u2019 \u201d It was for the trial judge to say, \u201cnot whether there is literally no evidence, or a mere <em>scintilla, </em>but whether there is any that ought reasonably to satisfy the jury that the fact sought to be proved is established.\u201d In <em>Improvement Co. </em>v. <em>Munson, </em>14 Wall. 442, the rule is stated as follows: \u201cThat in every case, before the evidence is left to the jury, there is a preliminary question for the judge; not whether there is literally no evidence, but whether there is any upon which a jury can properly proceed to find a verdict for the party producing it, upon whom the <em>onus </em>of proof rests.\u201d We think the views expressed by Kennedy, J., in 1 N. Y. Supp. 280, upon the questions now under consideration, are quite appropriate and applicable. We are therefore of the opinion that the verdict ought to stand. Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Merwin, J., concurs. Martin, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
