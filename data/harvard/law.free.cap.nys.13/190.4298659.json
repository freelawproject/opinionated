St. U. S. \u00a7 5117, as a \u201cdebt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation * * * while acting in any fiduciary character, \u201d although the note was given for money received by him in a fiduciary character, and embezzled by him; by suing on the note the fraud is waived, and the debt is merged in the judgment.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b208-8\">Appeal from special term, New York county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-9\">Motion by James A. Byrne for an injunction to stay proceedings on a judgment obtained against him by Maria Mulock, on the ground of his discharge in bankruptcy. The judgment creditor opposed the motion on the ground that the debt for which the judgment was recovered was created by the defalcation of the defendant in a fiduciary capacity. The defendant replied that the judgment was recovered on a note given by him for the alleged deficiency, and that the fraud, if any, was merged in the note, and the objection, therefore, was inapplicable. There was a judgment in favor of the defendant, and the plaintiff (judgment creditor) appeals. Rev. St. U. S. \u00a7 5117, provides that \u201cno debt created by the fraud or embezzlement of the bankrupt, or by his defalcation * * * while acting in any fiduciary character, shall be discharged by</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-10\">proceedings in bankruptcy.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b208-11\">Argued before Van Brunt, P.

It appears from the judgment roll that the judgment was entered upon a promissory note, and whatever may have been the consideration for this promissory note is entirely immaterial, because, if there had been any fraud, out of which this consideration arose, by suing upon the note simply, the fraud was waived, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>and only the debt remained. And this .debt, having become merged in the judgment, comes within the operative force of the bankruptcy discharge. The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
