Upon defendant\u2019s petition said Louis Grosclaude and Octave d\u2019Hainaut were substituted as defendants, and it was ordered that, upon said savings institution closing the account in the names of Josephine Laurent and plaintiff, and opening a new account as a deposit to the credit of the action, said savings institution might be stricken out as defendant; and thereafter, upon affidavit of the secretary of the savings institution that such former account had been closed and such new account opened, as directed, an order was made striking out the Union Dime Savings Institution as a party defendant. From these orders the defendants substituted thereby, Louis Grosclaude and Octave d\u2019Hainaut, appeal. Laws H. Y. 1882, c. 409, \u00a7 259, p. 679, (General Banking Act, c. 10,) provides: \u201cIn all actions against any savings bank to recover for moneys on deposit therewith, if there be any person or persons * * * claiming the same fund, who are not parties to the action, the' court in which such action is pending may, on the petition of such savings bank, and upon eight days\u2019 notice to the plaintiff and such claimants, make an order amending the proceedings in said action, by making such plaintiffs parties defendants thereto; and the said court shall thereupon proceed to hear and determine the rights and interests of the several parties to the said action in and to said funds.
