Pandjiris against the estate of Alfred Gr. McQueen, deceased, presented to John McQueen, as administrator of said estate, and referred under Kev. St. pt. 2, c. 6, tit. 3, art. 2, \u00a7 36, providing for the reference of any claim so presented, \u201cif the executor or'administrator doubt the justice\u201d of the claim. The claim was for services rendered to the intestate as a professional nurse in his last illness; and two other claims, presented by the physicians who attended.him in the same,illness, were also referred to the same referee by the same order of reference; and the physicians testified in support of the claim of the nurse at the hearing thereon. The referee reported in favor of the claimant. The administrator moved, on a case containing exceptions, for a new trial, which was denied; and he appeals from the order denying his motion. Code Civil Proc. N. Y. \u00a7 829, provides: \u201cUpon the trial of an action, or the hearing upon the merits of a special proceeding, a party or a person interested in the event * * * shall not be examined as a witness in his own behalf or interest * * * against the executor, administrator, or survivor of a deceased person.\u201d Code Civil Proc. N.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuSE\">We have examined the record in the case at bar, and see no reason to differ from the conclusion arrived at by the judge at the special term. None of the objections presented upon the record are well taken, and we do not think it necessary to refer to them in detail, because the counsel for the appellant has not considered the question of sufficient importance to refer in his points to the correct folios in the case affecting the same, but reference is made to folios in some'imaginary ease which is not before the court. The order should be affirmed,' with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Daniels, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A8JY\">(concurring.) The objections taken to the evidence obtained from the physicians, and the motion to strike out their answers, were devoid of legal foundation. What they testified to concerning the claimant\u2019s services and employment in no way entrenched upon section 834 of the Code of Civil Procedure. \u25a0 It was not information at all entering into their professional conduct as the physicians of the intestate, but related to a wholly distinct and separate subject. Neither was either of the physicians a party to her proceeding, nor was this claimant a party to the proceeding of either physician. Joining them in the reference agreed upon and ordered did not deprive eitlibr proceeding of its individuality; and the oath administered was entirely regular. The evidence, too, was sufficient to sustain the conclusion of the referee. It was for him to decide upon the weight of the evidence given. There are other objections, but they seem to be clearly frivolous, and the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Brady, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
