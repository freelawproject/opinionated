O. O.

The defendant is an unincorporated association of more than seven members. This association is a secret organization of Odd-Fellows, known as \u201cMount Herman Lodge.\u201d By the by-laws of this lodge, on the death of a member not disqualified his next of kin are entitled to a funeral benefit of $50 from the lodge. Moses Strasser, deceased, had been in his life-time for many years a member of this lodge, and on his death the funeral benefit was by his next of kin assigned to the plaintiff, who is a son of the deceased. This lodge is subordinate to the grand lodge of the 'state, from which it derives its constitution; and, subject to the provisions of the constitution, enacts its own by-laws, and, among the powers which it may exercise, it may, within certain prescribed limits, fix the amount of the weekly dues of its members. In the exercise of this power this lodge fixed the dues of its members at 13 cents per week by one of the provisions of its by-laws. The constitution provides that \u201cthe dues of a member of the lodge accrue weekly, and its by-laws must express the amount at a given rate per week.\u201d The bylaws also provide that \u201cno brother who is in arrears for dues, fines, or assessments of any kind over the amount of thirteen weeks * * * shall be entitled to receive the benefits of this lodge until after the expiration of six weeks from the time of payment of such arrearage. \u201d The evidence shows that all dues of members were charged and collected quarterly. The book of the lodge shows</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>&amp;' that the dues of deceased were charged on the 1st of, April, July, October, and January in eacli year, and the dues charged July 1, 1888, were paid and credited on the records of the lodge July 13,1888. The deceased died August 4, 1888. Defendant appeals from a judgment of the county court affirming a judgment of the city court of Albany in favor of plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b186-5\">Argued before Learned, P. J., and Landon and Mayham, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b186-6\"><em>J. W. Baker, </em>for appellant. <em>Rosendale </em>c6 <em>Hessberg, (Albert Hessberg, </em>of counsel,) for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b186-7\">Mayham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AKJl\">This controversy must turn upon the construction to be put upon the provisions of- the constitution of the lodge, which provides that \u201cthe dues of members of the lodge accrue weekly, \u201d when read in connection with that provision of the by-laws which prescribes the ground of forfeiture of benefits, and which is as follows: \u201cHo brother who is in arrears for dues, fines, or assessments of any kind over the amount of thirteen weeks * * * shall be entitled to receive the benefits of this lodge until after the expiration of six weeks from the time of payment of such arrearages.\u201d It is quite apparent from the uniform action of the lodge in not exacting weekly payments of dues from its members that it did not interpret the phrase \u201caccrue weekly\u201d as equivalent to \u201cpayable weekly,\u201d or \u201cdue weekly.\u201d Bouvier defines \u201caccrue\u201d as \u201cto grow to; to be added to; as, the interest accrues on the principal.\u201d Applying this definition to the phrase \u201cdues accrue weekly,\u201d and it would not signify that they are payable weekly;.but, rather, that they are estimated or measured weekly, to grow or to be added to each other as interest is added to or increases the amount of a debt. This at least should be its signification when applied to members who for years have been paying quarterly at the rate of 13 cents per week, rather than the other construction, which might result in a penalty or forfeiture, which is not favored in law. If, therefore these dues were payable quarterly, then no dues could be deemed as in arrears until the end of the quarter. The quarter ended on the 1st of July, 1888, and from that time, and that time only, would dues be deemed to be in arrears, but the \u201cdues accruing weekly\u201d thereafter would not be in arrears, because they would not fall due until the first of the succeeding October, when they, under the definition of Bouvier, and the usage of the ' order, would fall due. What dues, then, were in arrears on and after the 1st <em>\u25a0A </em>of July, 1888 ? Clearly only those which fell due on that day, and they were paid and credited on the 13th of July, 1888, nearly a month before the death of Moses Strasser. Ho dues, therefore, at the time of the payment had been in arrears for 13 weeks at the time of the payment on the' 13th of July, and consequently no forfeiture could attach, and the next of kin of Moses Strasser were, under the by-laws of this lodge, entitled to the funeral benefits, unless he deprived himself of that right by bringing his action in the civil courts before exhausting all his remedies under the constitution and by-laws of the order. But it is insisted that the constitution, by-laws, rules, and regulations of the order require that all disputed questions arising in it must first be submitted to the lodge, and an appeal taken from its determination to the district grand committee, and then to the grand lodge, and, unless permission be refused by that body, to the sovereign grand lodge, and that a resort to the civil court until all these remedies are invoked and exhausted, shall render any right or claim to any of the benefits provided for in sections 4, 5, and 6 null and void. It is quite true that controversies between members of a lodge and the lodge itself can and should be settled, or attempts should be made for their adjustment, within the order, where provisions are made for such settlement by the rules, constitution, or by-laws of the order. <em>Lafond </em>v. <em>Deems, </em>81 N. Y. 514; <em>Poultny v. Bachman, </em>31 Hun, 49. The contract or compact under and in virtue of which members can make claims against the order for benefits must \u25a0be the constitution and by-laws. To these members are deemed to have as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>sented, and, so long as they are fairly and impartially executed, that a court of equity would not be authorized to intervene to correct abuses, the parties must and ought to be. governed by the letter of the contract. This would clearly be so where a member of the order was seeking a benefit conferred by the constitution or by-laws of the lodge. <em>Poultny </em>v. <em>Bachman, </em>31 Hun, 54. Does the same rule apply when the claim is made by a person not a member of the orde.r, who can have no hearing in person before its body, or access to the tribunals provided by it for adjustment of questions between its members? The case shows that neither the plaintiff nor any of the next of kin of Moses Strasser now are, or ever have been, members of this order. The remedies which the lodge and its superior tribunals have provided are, by the constitution and by-laws, only open to members of the society. The plaintiff is not such a member, and does not derive title from a member, and cannot appear in the tribunals of the society and prosecute his claim, except by favor. His right to the funeral benefit is a contract right; and. since he has no right to resort to the tribunals of the secret organization, he has not, in a legal sense, failed to exhaust his remedies. The contract provides that the funeral benefit \u201cshall be paid over without delay to the deceased brother\u2019s nearest of kin.\u201d When this contract matures it exists between the lodge and non-members. It would not be a reasonable construction of a contract between the lodge and a nonmember to hold that the non-member\u2019s rights under it are subject to the adjudication of his adversary. Its rules are binding upon its members, for they have so agreed; but, when a member makes a contract with the lodge for the benefit of third parties, the contract must be enforceable according to its terms, and not according to the subsequent adjudication of the lodge as to the meaning of its terms. The provision of the constitution that benefits \u201cshall be dependent upon and recoverable only through the methods provided in the constitution\u201d must mean that benefits to members shall be so recoverable, not benefits to which strangers, by virtue of a contract made in their behalf with the lodge, are entitled. His payment was due without delay. The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
