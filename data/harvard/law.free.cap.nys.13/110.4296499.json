J.</author>\n<p id=\"ANL\">This is an action to recover against defendant, as surviving partner of the firm of W. J. Caywood &amp; Co., on a promissory note of $200 made by said firm. The action was commenced in a justice\u2019s court, and after judgment there an appeal was taken to the county court, where it was retried. A judgment was recovered for the plaintiff, and from that judgment, and from an order denying a new trial, the defendant appeals. The only question was whether the defendant was a member of that firm. There was evidence to go to the jury on that point, and, though the evidence was conflicting, the county court properly refused, so far as we see, a new trial, on the ground that the verdict was against the evidence. It was, however, a closely-contested question of fact, and the defendant was entitled to have no other evidence admitted than such as legitimately bore on the issue. The plaintiff asked one of his witnesses, (Allerton:) \u201cDid you ever hear Walter J. Caywood say anything about Warden\u2019s having an interest in the firm?\u201d The defendant objected, on the ground that the statement was not binding on him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>unless made in his presence. The objection was overruled, and defendant excepted. The witness answered: \u201cI had no conversation except to ask him who was his partner, and he said, \u00abLawrence E. Wardell.\u2019 \u201d This statement was no evidence against the defendant. There was a sharp conflict between plaintiff\u2019s evidence of defendant\u2019s admission that he was a partner and defendant\u2019s denial of such admission; hence it was most important that no hearsay or inadmissible evidence should be received. We do not see how that statement of Cay wood\u2019s, out of court, and not in Warden\u2019s presence, could be evidence against Wardell. Some other questions are raised on the appeal, which need not be discussed here. But, in a case where the question of fact was so sharply contested, this improper evidence may have done harm to the defendant. A jury might very naturally think that Cay wood\u2019s statement that Wardell was his partner would bind the firm, like the act of a partner, and that, hence, Wardell was by the weight of evidence shown to have been a partner. The judgment and order must be reversed, and a new trial granted, costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
