Hunt for rent. Defendant, to secure payment of the rent, had executed to plaintiff a chattel mortgage on certain furniture in the demised premises. On defendant removing from the premises, and abandoning the furniture, plaintiff took possession of and took care of it. Defendant\u2019s answer set up that he was discharged thereby from all obligation for the rent, and also set up a counter-claim for damages suffered by reason of plaintiff\u2019s taking and using the furniture. Plaintiff appeals from a judgment for defendant. See former reports, (9 N. Y. Supo. 494, and 10 N. Y. Supp. 529.)</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b831-13\">Argued before Daly, C.

On the former occasions the law of the case was clearly \"and fully propounded for the guidance of the court below; by Bisohoff and Daly, JJ., 9 N. Y. Supp. 494, and by Bookstaver, J., 10 N. Y. Supp. 529. At the trial under review the only development, if any, to vary the case was evidence of alleged injury to the furniture; but we are of opinion that such evidence was insufficient in law to fix the plaintiff with liability. Judgment reversed, and new trial, costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
