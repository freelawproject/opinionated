Kelly &amp; Co.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">The defenses interposed were that the signs delivered were not like sample, and were not delivered within the time as called for by the contract. As to the first defense there was conflicting evidence as to whether or not the signs delivered were like the sample; and, while some fault might be found to the admission of evidence under objection of one of plaintiff\u2019s witnesses as to the difficulty in obtaining in the market the leather back similar to the sample, the injury thereby done would not be sufficient to call for the reversal of the judgment based upon a verdict which, upon all the facts relating to this issue, the jury found adverse to defendant. To entitle plaintiff to recover it was incumbent to show that the goods were delivered \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d so as to be within the terms of the contract. As the exceptions taken to the judge\u2019s charge and to the exclusion and admission of testimony are to be determined by the consideration of what was meant by this expression \u201cas soon as possible, \u201d it is necessary at the outset to have this phrase defined. In <em>Attwood </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>1 C. B. (N. S.) 113, it was said: \u201cThe expression is one that is susceptible of several different significations.\u201d In that ease Cress well, J., says: \u201cThe case has been argued upon the assumption that the plaintiff\u2019s engagement was to execute the work with more speed than would have been required had the words been \u2018 within a reasonable time.\u2019 * * * If defendant had intended to have the hoops within the limit he should have taken care to express himself accordingly. I think this contract means no more than a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>reasonable time, regard being had to the plaintiff\u2019s facilities and extent of business, and the contracts he already had on hand.\u201d In that same case Crowder, J., says: \u201cThe words \u2018 as soon as possible \u2019 clearly meant * as soon as you possibly can.\u2019 Uor can I understand how it can reasonably be suggested that either party contemplated that the plaintiffs were to put aside any other engagement in order that this particular one should be performed. If the defendant had desired to have the goods by <em>a </em>limited time he should have taken care to have given.a more limited order.\u201d In <em>Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>McHaffie, </em>29 Moak, Eng. R. 102, the case of <em>Attwood v. Emery, supra, </em>was examined and criticised. Bramwell, L. J., says: \u201c To do a thing as soon as possible means to do it within a reasonable time.\u201d In <em>Attwood </em>v. <em>Emery, </em>the expressions of eminent judges seem to favor a different view as to the construction of the words \u2018 as soon as possible.\u2019 I quite agree that a manufacturer or tradesman is not bound to discard all other work for the occasion, in order to take in hand a thing which he promises to do \u2018as soon as possible;\u2019 for instance, a tailor, who accepts an order to make a coat \u2018as soon as possible,\u2019 need not put down a .half-made vest in order to begin the coat. Every customer knows at the time of giving the order that the manufacturer or tradesman may have other orders on hand; and I do not think that <em>Attwood </em>v. <em>Emery </em>goes further than this. * * * If, however, it is an authority in favor of the defendants I cannot agree with it. In construing the contract in the present case, I think it would be utterly unreasonable to hold that the defendants were not bound to deliver the gun until the state of affairs in their workshop should allow them to do so. The defendants ought not to have undertaken to make it unless they were certain that they could carry out their contract.\u201d In the same case Cotton, L. J., says: \u201cBy the words \u2018as soon as <em>possible' </em>the defendants must be taken to have meant that they would make the \u2018 gun \u2019 as quickly as it could be made in the largest establishment with-the best appliances. I do not think that these words can be taken to mean that the defendants merely promised to make the \u2018 gun \u2019 as quickly as the means at their disposal might allow. \u201d In <em>Duncan </em>v. <em>Topham, 8 C. </em>B. 225, cited in <em>Tobias </em>v. <em>Lissberger, </em>105 N. Y. 412,12 N. E. Rep. 13, where the contract was to send five tons of oil cake, to be delivered directly, a verdict in favor of the plaintiff was reversed because the judge charged that the meaning, of, the contract was that the goods should be sent as soon as practicable; and if, on the evidence, there had been a'delivery or offer to deliver within a reasonable time, they should find for the plaintiff. It was therein held that \u201ca reasonable time\u201d means somewhat more protracted time than \u201cdirectly.\u201d There is of course a distinction between \u201cdirectly\u201d and \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d and the only purpose of referring to that case is to show that expressions such as \u201cdirectly\u201d or \u201cas soon as possible,\u201d are not synonymous with nor do they mean the same thing as \u201ca reasonable time.\u201d In Parsons on Contracts (volume 2, 7th Ed., p. 661, foot p. 794) it is said: \u201cIf the contract specifies no time, the law implies that it shall be performed within a reasonable time, and will not permit this implication to be rebutted by extrinsic testimony going to fix a definite time, because this varies the contract. What is a reasonable time is a question of law.\u201d In Addison on Contracts, (volume 2, p. 1188,) where a number of authorities are cited, the rule is thus stated: \u201cA contract to do a particular thing directly or as soon as possible or forthwith does not mean that it is to be done instantly, but there must be no delay in performance; and such a contract requires a much more speedy fulfillment than a contract to do a thing within a reasonable time.\u201d These authorities are sufficient for the statement that unless the expression \u201cas soon as possible\u201d meant a greater celerity than a \u201creasonable time\u201d then it was utterly superfluous in the contract, for, as we have seen, if no time is specified, the law implies that it is to be performed within a reasonable time. Applying the law as thus settled by text-writers and in eases to the questions presented by the excep <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tians, it remains to determine whether any error was committed sufficient to justify a reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Taking the judge\u2019s charge as a whole, I do not think any fault can be found therewith; for, though he defines the words \u201cas soon as possible\u201d as synonymous with \u201ca reasonable time,\u201d he qualifies the latter expression in such a way to bring it within the rule, so that the jury were correctly instructed with regard to plaintiff's duty in reference to delivering the signs with all possible expedition. In other parts of the case, however, we do not find the same care observed, and, notwithstanding the objection made by the defendant, the court and the plaintiff treated the expression \u201cas soon as possible\u201d as synonymous .with \u201ca reasonable time.\u201d Thus the plaintiff asked the witness: \u201c What, in your opinion, would be a reasonable time for the making and delivery and framing of 800 embossed signs such as I show you?\u201d This question is faulty in two respects: <em>First, </em>as calling for an opinion upon a question which the court had ruled was a question of law; and, <em>secondly, </em>as assuming that \u201ca reasonable time\u201d and \u201cas soon as possible\u201d were one and the same -expression. The same fault is to be found with the questions asked by plaintiff as they appear upon page 34 of the printed record. \u00bbThese questions \u25a0directly pointed to one of the main issues about which the parties were contending, and, while it would have been proper to have allowed witnesses who were competent by reason of their experience to state how long it would have d;aken to manufacture the signs, this would not, as the question asked and .answered did, intrench upon the province of the jury. <em>Guttwillig </em>v. <em>Zuberbier, </em>41 Hun, 365. The latter, under the instructions of the court as to the \u2022construction to be given to the contract, were to determine what these witnesses were allowed to conclude, viz., whether the delivery was made in time. 'The defendant\u2019s grievance in respect to this testimony is accentuated when \u2022we refer to a similar question asked by the defendant, which in all respects was like those admitted on plaintiff\u2019s behalf, except that instead of using the \u2022phrase \u201ca reasonable time\u201d the one used was that of the contract, namely, \u201cas soon as possible.\u201d This question was as follows: \u201cYour contract is800 .signs, to be delivered as soon as possible. The date is April 27th. State \u2022what you consider \u2018as soon as possible.\u2019\u201d This question was objected to as being a question of law, and the objection was sustained, and defendant excepted. It will thus be seen that, while we agree with the excluding of the last question, it seems but proper that, where the same questions were asked .and answered in favor of the plaintiff, a similar rule at least should have been applied in favor of the defendant, and the testimony so objected to should have been excluded. These errors cannot be regarded as immaterial, because they went to the whole gist of the action; and upon a reading of the whole \u2022 case it is evident that the confusion introduced relative to plaintiff\u2019s duty in respect to time of delivery must necessarily have prej udiced the defendant. In <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>104 N. Y. 147, 10 N. E. Rep. 131, it was held that \u201c when \u2022the terms and language of the contract are ascertained in the absence of technical phrases, or of terms the meaning of which is obscure, or of latent ambiguities, rendering the subject-matter of the contract uncertain and doubt-ful, the office of interpreting its meaning belongs to the court.\u201d See, also, <em>Dwight </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>103 N. Y. 353, 8 N. E. Rep. 654. The language used in this contract was neither ambiguous nor technical, and the construction thereof was for the court, and not for the witnesses. We are unable to reconcile the rulings made for and against the plaintiff. \u201cAn unequal application of the rules of evidence offered by one party, and excluding evidence \u2022 of the same character on the same point offered by the other, is good ground of reversal.\u201d <em>Holten </em>v. <em>Holten, </em>5 Wkly. Dig. 14. It is unnecessary, therefore, to consider the other questions raised upon this appeal, as the judgment must, for the reasons stated, be reversed, and a new trial had, with costs to defend\u25a0ant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Van Brunt, P.

It seems to me that the fact that as without any words of expedition in the contract the plaintiff would have been bound to furnish the goods within a reasonable time, the addition of such words shows conclusively that the parties had in mind something in addition to xvhat the law implied. \u201cWithin a reasonable time\u201d seems to mean within such time as can be done following the ordinary course of business; \u201cas soon as possible\u201d seems to mean as soon as can be done, using the greatest diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Daniels, J. i concur in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
