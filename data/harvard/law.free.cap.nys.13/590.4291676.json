Upon the trial the following facts were admitted: The recovery of the judgment, as above stated, and that an execution was issued thereon and delivered to the defendant on March 21, 1890, for the sum of $350.63. The defendant in his answer admits that more than 60 days have elapsed since the delivery of the execution to him; and, as a further and separate defense, alleges that he delivered said execution to one of his general deputies, and, in substance, further alleges that his said deputy made a levy, and that the attorney for the plaintiffs therein instructed said deputy to collect said judgment in monthly installments of $50 each, and to hold said execution until the whole amount thereof was collected in full. The action was brought before Justice GiegeRiCH and a jury, on the 9th day of December, 1890. Evidence was given con the'part of the plaintiffs, and also the defendant, as to the quantity and nature of the property in the possession of Schurtz, the defendant in said judgment, at the date of the delivery of the execution to the sheriff; and also as to the facts whether or not the attorney for the plaintiffs who issued the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>had directed or authorized the deputy to hold said execution that had been delivered, and to collect the same in installments, and to hold and not return the same within the 60 days as required by said execution. After the testimony had been closed on each side, it was submitted to the jury under the charge of the trial justice, and the jury rendered their verdict in favor of the plaintiffs for the sum of $361.88, the amount of the judgment and interest. A motion was made by the attorney of the defendant to have the verdict set aside, upon the ground that it was against the weight of evidence and the law, and for a new trial, which motion was denied, and an order was entered denying said motion, from which judgment and order defendant appeals.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b609-5\">Argued before Ehrlich, C.

Evidence was introduced on each of the above questions on the part of the plaintiffs and the defendant, and the trial justice in his charge to the jury directed their attention to each of the questions in dispute, and to the testimony of each of the witnesses who testified in relation thereto, and we think he fully and fairly presented the entire case to the jury. He also called the attention of the jury to the contradictory nature of the evidence; in fact, instructed the jury that, if they believed the testimony adduced on the part of the defendant, their verdict must be for the defendant; and that if they believed the testimony on the part of the plaintiff, then their verdict must be for the plaintiff. Thus the jury necessarily had to pass upon the credibility of the several witnesses. The jury had a right to credit the testimony of any of the witnesses, or to discredit their testimony, unless corroborated. The statute has given an action to a creditor against a sheriff for not returning an execution, and the settled doctrine of the courts is that, where it has not been returned, he (the sheriff) is <em>p rima facie </em>liable for the. debt, but he may mitigate the damages, by showing that the defendant had no property on which the judgment could be levied. See <em>Swezey </em>v. <em>Lott, </em>21 N. Y. 484. There was evidence on the part of the plaintiffs, and also of the defendant, that there was some property in the possession of Schurtz, the defendant in the judgment, on March 21, 1890; and the defendant herein did not undertake to prove that the property found on the premises of Schurtz was of less value than the execution, nor did he prove that such property was exempt from such levy and sale. As to whether the levy was, actually made, the testimony of the defendant\u2019s own witnesses is contradictory. The amount of the execution is the measure of damages, unless it appears that the defendant in the judgment had no property out of which the plaintiffs herein could have collected the debt. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Cornell, </em>39 Barb. 69. And as to whether the defendant had no property on which the judgment could be levied, was a question of fact, to be determined by the jury upon the evidence. The jury passed upon all the questions of fact submitted to it, and found in favor of the plaintiffs, and we do not find any good reason for disturbing their verdict, rendered upon a conflict of testimony which it was the special province of the jury to decide; nor do we think that the verdict was against the weight of evidence. The verdict of a jury will only be disturbed when it is clearly against the weight of evidence, or where there has been some improper or illegal act on the part of the jury. The rulings of the trial justice we think were correct, and the exceptions throughout are without merit. The judgment and order appealed from must be affirmed, with costs to the respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">Alt concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
