The trial was before a judge without a jury, and he has found the facts which justify the action, and directed a judgment against the defendant, with $300 damages. The testimony is amply sufficient to sustain the judgment upon both the questions involved. The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
