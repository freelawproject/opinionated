Schwarz against the Family Fund Society. The court directed a verdict for plaintiff, and ordered \u201cthat the exceptions taken during the trial be heard in the first instance at general term. \u201d The general term overruled the exceptions, on the ground that the case did not show that defendant excepted to the direction of the verdict, and it must therefore be deemed that he acquiesced in the direction, so that the general term had \u00bbo power to disturb the verdict, and all prior exceptions taken in the course of the trial became immaterial. See former report, 12 FT. Y. Supp. 717.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b906-11\">Argued before Sedgwick, C.
