The action was for trespass on land. The trial was at the circuit, before a jury, and the verdict was for the plaintiff. There was but little dispute hbout facts. The charge was correct, and the verdict should remain undisturbed. The judgment and order denying the motion for a new trial on the minutes should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
