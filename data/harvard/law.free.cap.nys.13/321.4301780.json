Jackson and Josephine Jackson.. From a judgment of the county court of Lewis county, affirming the judgment of a justice of the peace rendered in favor of the plaintiff for $16.45, defendants appeal. The following is the opinion of Judge Turner, of the-county court: \u201cAppellants\u2019 counsel insists that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and evidence on the trial are insufficient to uphold the judgment herein. The-defendants did not appear on the return-day of the summons, but their default did not relieve plaintiff from the necessity of establishing his right to at recovery by legal and sufficient evidence. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 Barb. 120; <em>Northrup </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>13 Wend. 85. Under the liberal rules applied to pleadings in justices\u2019 courts, it seems to me plaintiff\u2019s complaint must be deemed sufficient in form and substance. So far as the evidence is concerned, plaintiff made out a <em>prima facie </em>case, sufficiently so to have put defendants on their defense, had they been present, and, after a careful examination and consideration of the brief and authorities cited therein by appellant\u2019s counsel* I fail to find reasons to justify a reversal of this judgment upon the ground of the illegality and insufficiency of the evidence.' Defendants present affidavits having attached thereto the copies of the summons served on each, from which it appears that the copies were dated June 29, 1889, the return-day named in the summons, whereas the original summons is dated June 22, 1889, and returnable June 29, 1889. The return of the constable shows that those copies were personally served on defendants the 22d day of June, 1889; hence they had notice that this action was returnable before Justice Sawyer at bis office in Port Leyden, June 29, 1889, at 6 o\u2019clock in the afternoon of that day, and it would seem that they were put upon their guard and inquiry, notwithstanding the apparent mistake in the date upon the copies served. Did this mistake mislead the defendants? Nothing in their affidavits show that they were misled, and no such allegation is stated therein. The summons, and the constable\u2019s return of service thereon, gave the justice juris-, diction, and upon that return the court was authorized and required to pro- , ceed. <em>Putman </em>v. <em>Man, </em>3 Wend. 202. If the return was false, the defendants had an undoubted remedy at law against the officer it. The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>that the copies of the summons served on defendants were erroneously dated, in the absence of any statement or allegation showing them to have been misled thereby, does not, <em>per se, </em>justify or authorize a reversal of the judgment herein. <em>Arnold </em>v. Maltby, 4 Denio, 498; <em>Hauyhey </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>1 Hilt. 259; section 3063, Code Civil Proc. Upon these grounds the judgment must be affirmed, and an order may be entered accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b340-5\">Argued before Hardin, P. J.\u00a1 and Martin and Merwin, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b340-6\"><em>B. Merriam Bagg, </em>for appellants. <em>L, W.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AcVf\">Plaintiff before the justice, in a complaint in writing, declared \u201cthat the defendants are indebted to him in the sum of $13.25, being for a balance due to him from the defendants for work and labor done and performed for them at their request within six years last past, no part of which has been paid, and for which he demands judgment and costs. \u201d Pleadings are to be liberally construed, especially so in a justice\u2019s court. The complaint alleges the defendants are \u201cindebted to him,\u201d and states what the sum of that indebtedness is, and also states that it is for a balance due to him from the defendants for \u201cwork and labor\u201d done and performed for them at their request. In <em>U. S. </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>6 Pet. 29, the word \u201cdue,\u201d found in a pleading, was considered, and Judge Story stated that it was used to express the state of the indebtedness, and that when it was so used it was equivalent to the words \u201cowed\u201d or \u201cowing;\u201d and he added that it was sometimes used to express the fact that the debt had become payable. This construction was involved in the court of appeals in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>7 N. Y. 480. This case was cited approvingly in <em>Blackmar </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>28 N. Y. 71, in the opinion of Balcom, J., in which opinion he said: \u201cThe same strictness in pleading is not required under the Code that was exacted by the courts under our former system of practice.\u201d We agree with the learned counsel for the appellants that upon the default of the defendants, or their failure to appear before the justice, it became incumbent upon plaintiff to prove his cause of action by legitimate and sufficient evidence. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>44 Barb. 123. Section 2891 of the Code, relating to justices\u2019 courts, is as follows: \u201cIf a defendant fails to appear and answer, the plaintiff cannot recover without proving his case. \u201d It is insisted in behalf of the appellants that the plaintiff\u2019s evidence did not make out a <em>prima facie </em>case. We think otherwise. The plaintiff testified as a witness, viz.: \u201cI have a claim against the defendants for labor, commencing 28th day of February, 1889, until 17th day of J une, 1889. This labor was performed at their request. They have paid me some on the work. There remains due me now on said labor $13.25, no part of which has been paid. I have demanded the said balance.\u201d In our view, the evidence is entirely sufficient to sustain the judgment rendered by the justice. In <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Spencer, </em>54 N. Y. 366, it was said, viz.; \u201cIt is the uniform practice of the courts, in reviewing proceedings had before a justice of the peace, if possible, to sustain them by every reasonable and warrantable intendment. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">2. It seems the original summons was issued and dated June 22, 1889; it was made returnable June 29, 1889. The same was personally served upon the defendants. We do not regard the circumstance that the copy served bore, by a clerical mistake, the erroneous date of the summons as of June 29, 1889, of any importance. The body of the summons required the defendants to appear before the justice on the 29th of June. The original summons was correct as to its date, and the clerical error made upon the date of the copies served did not mislead the defendants. We think, for the reasons suggested -by the learned county judge in his opinion, that the clerical error was properly disregarded; besides, section 3063 requires the county court, as well as this court, to disregard technical errors which do not affect the merits. We think the judgment of the justice was properly affirmed by the county court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>and we must therefore sustain its action. Judgment of the county court of Lewis county, affirming a justice\u2019s judgment, affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
