On April 25,1887, the aqueduct commissioners of the city of New York, created by Laws N. Y. 1883, c. 490, which authorized them, among other things, to \u201cappoint and fix the compensation of suitable engineers and other persons to supervise and inspect all work hereby authorized,\u201d appointed plaintiff an inspector of masonry, to supervise the work of construction of the new aqueduct; and he thereafter served as such inspector, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>except during several periods of suspension from duty by the commissioners, until he was finally dismissed, on February 12, 1890. On January 23, 1889, during one of such periods of temporary suspension, an agreement in writing, reciting his appointment as inspector, on April 25, 1887, was entered into between plaintiff and the commissioners, whereby he agreed, in consideration of being so appointed, \u201cfaithfully and diligently to perform the duties assigned to him as such inspector,\u201d etc.; and further agreed \u201cthat if he is suspended or discharged, for any cause whatever, while in the employ of such commission, * * * his pay as such inspector shall cease from and after the time of such suspension, subject to the direction of the aqueduct commissioners.\u201d The action was brought by plaintiff to recover his salary for the several periods during which he was suspended. At the trial the court directed a verdict for defendants, and ordered the exceptions to be heard in the first instance at the general term.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b906-4\">Argued before Sedgwick, O.

Y. Supp. 269. We have determined to accept this disposition of the question as correct, for the purposes of this appeal. The agreement of January 23, 1889, raises a question which should be determined in favor of the respondent. The plaintiff, by his action in executing this agreement, which was not prohibited by law, and did not relate to an illegal transaction, is estopped from claiming the invalidity of the agreement as to any period of suspension following its execution. It follows that the defendant is liable only for compensation for such periods of suspension as preceded January 23, 1889. The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
