The cargo policy contained the following: \u201cIt is understood that freight and advances insured under this policy are subject to the terms and conditions oi freight policy attached hereto,\u201d and insured defendant on \u201ccargo,freight, and advances.\u201d It also contained the following clause: \u201cIn case of any agree ment or act, past or future, by the insured, whereby any right of recovery of the insured against any persons or corporations is released or lost, which would, on acceptance of abandonment or payment of loss by this company, belong to this company but for such agreement or act, or in case this insurance is made for the benefit of any carrier or bailee of the property insured other than the person named as insurer, the company shall not be bound to pay any loss, but its right to retain or recover the premium shall not be affected. \u201d The freight policy contained no such clause as the above. After the receipt of the letter from the bark\u2019s owners, Parsons &amp; Loud applied to plaintiff to indorse upon the policy for their own account the sum of $1,500 for advances on the bark. The bark was totally lost, together with the cargo onboard, by the perils insured against. Plaintiff refused to pay defendant\u2019s claim, except on an assignment, which was given as follows: \u201cEar and in consideration of the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, we hereby assign and transfer to the Phenix Insurance Company of Brooklyn fifteen hundred dollars (amount insured by us in said Phenix Insurance Company, March 31, 1884, as advances) of our claim of fifteen hundred and seventy 47-100 dollars, which we have against bark Elliot Ritchie and owners for advances, commissions, etc., for her late voyage from Brunswick, Ga., to Buenos Ayres, on which voyage she became a total loss.\u201d \u201cIn consideration of the amount insured as advances on this vessel being paid, all claim on act. of this draft is assigned to the Phenix Ins. Co.\u201d Plaintiff thereupon brought action against the owners of the bark, and was defeated, for the reason that Parsons &amp; Loud, its assignors, had no claim against such owners. Whereupon plaintiff brought suit against the defendant, as survivor, to recover the payment made to him, and also the expenses of the litigation against the bark\u2019s owners; claiming that it insured defendant on the basis of its being a case of simple advances, for which both vessel and owners were responsible. On the first trial the complaint was dismissed, but upon appeal a new trial was granted. 4 Y. Y. Supp. 621. Upon the second trial a verdict was directed for plaintiff.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b634-8\">Argued before Sedgwick, C.

Y. Supp. 621. The learned counsel for appellant argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>that there are in the present case differences from the former case which call for another result. He adverts to the fact that on the former trial it did not appear, as it does now, that the policy on which the insurance for advances was made, called the \u201ccargo policy,\u201d was accompanied by a policy called the \u201cfreight policy.\u201d The freight policy does not contain a special clause, upon which, the counsel argues, the former decision is based, and the cargo policy contained the following clause: \u201cIt is understood that freight and advances insured under this policy are subject to the terms and conditions of freight policy attached hereto. \u201d This does not imply that insurance of advances are not subject to the terms of the cargo policy which insures the advances. And the implied right of the plaintiff to be subrogated to the defendant\u2019s claim against the owners for the reimbursement of advances would secure the same result in this action as has been placed before upon the special clause. On the trial the counsel for defendant objected to there being included in the recovery as being part of defendant\u2019s claim against the owner, and yet not being advances, which was the thing insured, certain commissions on charter and expense of insuring advances. The objection was correctly overruled, for by the assignment of the claims to the plaintiff there was an implied warranty that the claims amounted to $1,500, which in fact comprised the commission and expense of insurance. Against the objection of defendant, the court allowed a recovery for the amount of certain expenses incurred by plaintiff, in connection with a litigation, for the recovery against the owners of the <em>&lt; </em>'aims for advances. The matter involved was not much discussed in the argument of the appeal. The plaintiff was not entitled to recover for services of counsel the charge of $250. Sedg. Dam. 292, note 2. The costs of the action were rightly recovered. Although the defendants did not have notice of the action, the costs were an actual and definite expense to which the plaintiffs were subjected, by acting upon the defendant\u2019s warranty. <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Percy, </em>5 Wend. 535. These costs amounted to $36.65. There was not sufficient proof to justify the recovery of $8.57 for type-writing and copies of brief. The judgment should be modified by deducting the amounts that have been specified, and as modified affirmed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
