As to the remaining two counts, it was found that Mr. Beck violated Canon 6, DR 6-101(A)(3), Canon 7, DR 7-101(A)(2), DR 7-101(A)(3), and Canon 1, DR 1-102(A)(4), DR 1-102(A)(5) of the Code of Professional Responsibility,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and State Bar Rule 15, \u00a7 2(1) \u2014 2(4).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>pline imposed was a two-year suspension and costs of $631.90.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-3\">The findings and order of discipline were affirmed by the State Bar Grievance Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The appellant has advanced numerous assignments of error which present three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">1) Whether the hearing panel\u2019s findings and conclusions are supported by the record;</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">2) Whether appellant was afforded a fair hearing before the hearing panel; and</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">3) Whether appellant was afforded a fair hearing before the State Bar Grievance Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"ACA\">The two counts of the formal complaint upon which the findings of misconduct are based arose out of requests for investigation from two of Mr. Beck\u2019s clients. In one case, the complainant, a Mr. Hawkins, testified that he retained Mr. Beck in November of 1973 to institute divorce proceedings and paid him $200. The complaint for divorce was prepared and signed by Mr. Hawkins but never filed or served upon the defendant. The complainant further stated that throughout April, 1974, he was unable to reach appellant by telephone and that he received no response to a letter to appellant asking for an explanation of the failure to file the complaint. Mr. Hawkins finally retained other counsel and obtained a divorce in October, 1974. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>His $200 retainer was refunded in October, 1974, through the State Bar Grievance Administrator\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Mr. Beck testified that his failure to file the divorce complaint was due to his misunderstanding of his client\u2019s instructions. He stated his impression was that the prepared complaint was not to be filed until the client had attempted to gain custody of his children from Mrs. Hawkins. Mr. Beck stated he understood that further action in the matter was to abide further instructions from his client, and since none were forthcoming, he did nothing about the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The second formal complaint concerned another client, Mrs. Swiencicki, who testified that she retained Mr. Beck to attempt to recover benefits to which she believed she was entitled under an insurance policy. Appellant accepted a retainer totaling $225, prepared and filed a complaint, affidavit and default, and took a default judgment. The judgment was subsequently set aside by the court and the insurance company filed an answer. Mr. Beck, however, failed to notice the case for trial and the action was dismissed for lack of progress in October, 1973. The complainant testified that Mr. Beck told her that trial dates were set in March and July of 1974; that she met with appellant prior to each date to prepare for trial; and that he told her that settlement negotiations with the insurance company ultimately resulted in the defendant agreeing on the day before the July trial date to pay the full amount of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Mr. Beck testified that the meetings with the complainant in March and July, 1974 were not for the purpose of. preparing for trial; denied telling the client that trial dates had been obtained; denied telling her that he had negotiated a settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>ment, and argued that discipline should not be predicated upon the dismissal of the complainant\u2019s case for lack of progress because the lawsuit was reinstated in February, 1975 and ultimately settled in October, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In State Bar disciplinary proceedings on appeal to the Supreme Court, we review the findings and conclusions of the hearing panel, as affirmed by the State Bar Grievance Board, to determine whether they \"have proper evidentiary support on the whole record\u201d. <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Estes, </em>390 Mich 585, 593; 212 NW2d 903 (1973); Grievance Board Rule 16.24(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Having done so in this case, we conclude that the testimony of Mr. Beck\u2019s former clients clearly supports the panel\u2019s conclusions that Mr. Beck accepted a retainer from Mr. Hawkins to file a divorce action and failed to carry out the undertaking, contrary to Canon 6, DR 6-101(A)(3), and Canon 7, DR 7-101(A)(2) of the Code of Professional Responsibility, and that he accepted a retainer from Mrs. Swiencicki to attempt to collect an insurance benefit and allowed the case to be dismissed on the no progress calendar. The record further supports the conclusion that Mr. Beck misrepresented to Mrs. Swiencicki the status of her case and the settlement negotiations, contrary to Canon 7, DR 7-101(A)(2), DR 7-101(A)(3), Canon 6, DR 6-101(A)(3), and Canon 1, DR 1-102(A)(4), DR 1-102(A)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Mr. Beck\u2019s testimony was sharply at odds with that of the two complainants. Confronted by the conflicting testimony, the hearing panel was required to determine whose version of the facts was truthful. The matter was resolved against the appellant upon evidence fully justifying the conclusions reached. The grievance board committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>no error in affirming the findings and conclusions of the hearing panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Appellant next contends that he was denied a fair hearing before the hearing panel because a panel member questioned appellant regarding previous disciplinary proceedings; because of certain errors in the order of suspension and because the panel \"made such repeated, incorrect and prejudicial rulings as to completely undermine [appellant\u2019s] defenses\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The questions put to Mr. Beck by the panel, touching upon previous orders of discipline, were entirely proper because Grievance Board Rule 16.13 requires that the hearing panel\u2019s report include \"a summary of all previous misconduct for which the respondent has been disciplined\u201d. The questions were designed to elicit the required information and were proper for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">The errors in the order of suspension amounted to a misstatement of certain State Bar Rules, and reference to the order of Panel \"1\u201d when the hearing was conducted before Panel \"3\u201d. As to the first claim, the order refers to the disciplinary rules under the original numbering. Compare 383 Mich xl with 386 Mich lxxiii. As to the second claim, the members of the hearing panel that heard the testimony are the members who entered the report and order. The \"error\u201d was obviously typographical. No prejudice resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Finally, we hold that the record does not support appellant\u2019s claim that the panel\u2019s rulings were repeatedly erroneous so as to undermine appellant\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Appellant received a fair hearing before the hearing panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-3\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Appellant also contends that he was denied a fair hearing by the State Bar Grievance Board which affirmed the hearing panel\u2019s report and order of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Appellant acknowledges our recent holding that the grievance board\u2019s procedures are not inherently defective and do not deny a respondent due process merely because the same agency made the initial charge and the ultimate adjudication. <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Baun, </em>395 Mich 28; 232 NW2d 621 (1975). He contends, however, that in this case the grievance administrator was present when the members of the grievance board were deliberating upon his case, thus giving rise to \"special facts and circumstances\u201d such that \"the risk of unfairness is intolerably high\u201d. See <em>Withrow v Larkin, </em>421 US 35; 95 S Ct 1456; 43 L Ed 2d 712 (1975); <em>State Bar Grievance Administrator v Baun, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">If Mr. Beck\u2019s contention that the grievance administrator was present during the deliberations of appellant\u2019s case is true, then, indeed, the \"nexus between the State Bar Grievance Administrator\u201d and the grievance board would not be \"sufficiently attenuated as to negate [the] contention\u201d that appellant was denied a fair hearing before an impartial tribunal. <em>Baun, supra </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Appellant\u2019s supplemental record indicates that the grievance administrator may indeed have entered the room which the members of the grievance board occupied after hearing oral argument on appellant\u2019s case. There is no evidence, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>that he took part in, or was even present during, the board\u2019s deliberation of the case. In fact, the agenda for the board\u2019s October 17, 1975 meeting included, <em>inter alia, </em>appellant\u2019s hearing followed by certain \"Administrator\u2019s Reports\u201d to the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Because there is no evidence that the grievance administrator was present during the board\u2019s deliberation of appellant\u2019s case, and because there is a plausible explanation for the administrator\u2019s presence at the meeting, we do not find \"special facts and circumstances\u201d which give rise to the inference that appellant was denied a fair and impartial hearing before the State Bar Grievance Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">We modify the order of the State Bar Grievance Board to correct the hearing panel\u2019s order to refer to State Bar Rule 15, \u00a7 7 in lieu of State Bar Rule 14, \u00a7 7, and to refer to Grievance Board Rule 16.21 in lieu of Grievance Board Rule 15.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The order of the State Bar Grievance Board affirming the decision of the hearing panel is affirmed as modified.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-8\">Kavanagh, C.
