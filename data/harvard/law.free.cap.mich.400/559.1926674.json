No warrant was obtained from a magistrate before installation of the electronic surveillance equipment. The recordings were played at the trial over defendant\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">A panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed Michael Drielick\u2019s conviction of first-degree murder<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the ground that a warrant is not required for participant monitoring. A separate panel reversed Lawrence Plamondon\u2019s and Craig Blazier\u2019s convictions of extortion by threat of accusation<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on the ground that a warrant is required. We affirm in <em>Drielick, </em>and reverse in <em>Plamondon </em>and <em>Blazier.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">In <em>People v Beavers, </em>393 Mich 554; 227 NW2d 511 (1975),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> this Court held that, unless authorized by a search warrant, a participant may not, consistent with the Michigan constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> electronically monitor a conversation which is transmitted to law enforcement officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number><em>Beavers </em>was given prospective effect only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The participant monitoring in these cases preceded <em>Beavers. </em>The question whether the Michigan prohibition applies in the instant cases, which were pending on appeal with the issue preserved,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was decided by <em>Beavers. </em>The Court is not disposed to reconsider that recent decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Defendants\u2019 principal claim is that warrantless participant monitoring violates the Federal constitutional prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures. In <em>United States v White, </em>401 US 745; 91 S Ct 1122; 28 L Ed 2d 453 (1971), the United States Supreme Court rejected this claim and held that police eavesdropping without a warrant on conversations between an accused and an informant by means of a radio transmitter concealed on the informant\u2019s person does not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Defendants contend that <em>White </em>does not control because: (i) no opinion in that case obtained the signatures of a majority of the sitting justices; (ii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>the decision in <em>White </em>was based on pre-Katz<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> law because Desist<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> had held that <em>Katz </em>only applied prospectively and the monitoring in <em>White </em>preceded the decision in <em>Katz; </em>and (iii) <em>White </em>involved monitoring of a face-to-face conversation while the monitoring in these cases was of telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Mr. Justice White wrote the lead opinion in <em>White </em>which was signed by Chief Justice Burger and Justices Stewart and Blackmun. Mr. Justice Black concurred on the ground that electronic eavesdropping does not constitute a \"search\u201d or \"seizure\u201d within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. Mr. Justice Brennan concurred on the ground that <em>Katz </em>was not retroactive, adding that the Fourth Amendment interposes a warrant requirement. Justices Douglas, Harlan and Marshall signed separate dissenting opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">In <em>Katz, </em>the Court had held that electronic eavesdropping accomplished by attaching a listening and recording device to the outside of a public telephone booth, without the authorization of either participant in the conversation or of a warrant, was violative of the Fourth Amendment. The Court declared that the right to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures \"cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure\u201d, that the \"trespass\u201d doctrine enunciated in earlier decisions had been eroded and could no longer be regarded as controlling, and that the \"Government\u2019s activities in electronically listening to and recording the petitioner\u2019s words violated the privacy upon which he justifiably relied by using the telephone booth and thus constituted a 'search and seizure\u2019, within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\u201d. <em>Katz v United States, supra, </em>p 353. The Fourth Amendment, said the Court, \"protects people, not places\u201d. <em>Katz v United States, supra, </em>351.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">While Mr. Justice White\u2019s lead opinion in <em>White </em>said that the United States Court of Appeals had also erred because, by reason of <em>Desist </em>making <em>Katz </em>wholly prospective, <em>Katz </em>did not apply to the electronic surveillance in <em>White, </em>the primary thrust of the opinion was that there was no invasion of \"the defendant\u2019s constitutionally justifiable expectations of privacy\u201d. \"Inescapably, one contemplating illegal activities must realize and risk that his companions may be reporting to the police. If he sufficiently doubts their trustworthiness, the association will very probably end or never materialize. But if he has no doubts, or allays them, or risks what doubt he has, the risk is his.\u201d <em>White v United States, supra, </em>pp 751, 752. Since the law violator knows that what he says is being heard and may be repeated, no different result is required because the conversation is being listened to or recorded electronically with the consent of the faithless participant.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">This Court, in <em>Beavers, </em>construing the Michigan constitutional prohibition, rejected the argument that participant monitoring was a \"variant of the privilege of a party to repeat a conversation\u201d, and instead was \"persuaded by the logic of Justice Harlan which recognizes a significant distinction between assuming the risk that communications directed to one party may subsequently be repeated to others and the simultaneous monitoring of a conversation by the uninvited ear of a third party functioning in cooperation with one of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>participants yet unknown to the other\u201d. <em>People v Beavers, supra, </em>pp 563, 565.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">It is our duty to \"determine with the best exercise of our mental powers of which we are capable that law which in all probability will be applied to these litigants or to others similarly situated\u201d in the event of a further appeal of the Fourth Amendment issue from this Court to the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>The United States Courts of Appeals for 10 of the 11 circuits have followed Mr. Justice White\u2019s lead opinion in <em>White </em>in holding that the Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant for electronic participant monitoring.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> No distinction has been made between electronic monitoring of face-to-face conversations and of telephonic communications.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Since <em>White </em>was decided, Justices Black, Douglas and Harlan have left the Court, and Justices Powell, Rehnquist and Stevens have taken their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>places on the Court. All four justices who signed Mr. Justice White\u2019s opinion remain on the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">On at least 14 occasions the United States Supreme Court has declined to grant certiorari to review decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals holding that the Fourth Amendment does not preclude warrantless, electronic participant monitoring.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While denial of certiorari is not affirmance, it is a fact of some significance especially since there is no indication in subsequent decisions of the United States Supreme Court which would support the conclusion that the \"doctrinal trend\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> has shifted from the view expressed in Mr. Justice White\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We are of the opinion that were there to be a further appeal on Fourth Amendment grounds, the view of the law which in all probability would be applied by the United States Supreme Court would be that expressed in Mr. Justice White\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The Court of Appeals is reversed in <em>Plamondon </em>and <em>Blazier, </em>and affirmed in <em>Drielick. </em>The convictions are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b710-5\">Kavanagh C.

Both the deterrent purpose of the exclusionary rule and the reliance of law enforcement officers focus upon the time of the search, not any subsequent point in the prosecution, as the relevant date. Exclusion of electronic eavesdropping evidence seized before <em>Katz </em>would increase the burden on the administration of justice, would overturn convictions based on fair reliance upon <em>pre-Katz </em>decisions, and would not serve to deter similar searches and seizures in the future.\u201d <em>Desist v United States, </em>394 US 244, at 253.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b705-8\"> <em>See </em>fn 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b705-9\"> <em>See </em>fn 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> \"The impact of the practice of third-party bugging, must, I think, be considered such as to undermine that confidence and sense of security in dealing with one another that is characteristic of individual relationships between citizens in a free society. * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b707-9\">\"Were third-party bugging a prevalent practice, it might well smother that spontaneity \u2014 reflected in frivolous, impetuous, sacrilegious, and defiant discourse \u2014 that liberates daily life.
