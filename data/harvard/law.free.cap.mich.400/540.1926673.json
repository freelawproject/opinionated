The defendant was sentenced from 20 to 25 years and from 7-1/2 to 10 years respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Defendant appealed his conviction as a matter of right. The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction in a brief opinion. That Court held that certain statements allegedly made by a non-produced codefendant were admissible against the defendant under the co-conspirators exception to the hearsay rule. It also held that sale and possession, while having common elements in certain cases, are nonetheless separate crimes. Therefore, it concluded double jeopardy (more aptly \"double punishment\u201d) problems do not arise when the charges of possession and sale of narcotics are joined in a criminal prosecution arising out of the same transaction. <em>People v Stewart, </em>46 Mich App 282; 207 NW2d 907 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">This Court originally granted leave to appeal in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>this matter on March 29, 1974. On June 4, 1976, it affirmed both the trial court and Court of Appeals. <em>People v Stewart, </em>397 Mich 1; 242 NW2d 760 (1976). This Court\u2019s majority limited its discussion of defendant\u2019s appeal in that opinion to a single issue: the aforementioned hearsay exception problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Thereafter, in light of our decision in <em>People v Martin, </em>398 Mich 303; 247 NW2d 303 (1976), this Court on December 9, 1976, decided to grant the defendant a rehearing \"limited to issues raised on appeal but not discussed in the opinion of the Court released on June 4, 1976\u201d. 398 Mich 951 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Those issues are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">1) Whether conviction of both sale and possession of the same heroin, upon proof of sale incident to possession, was constitutionally proscribed double punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">2) Whether the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proof to establish that the defendant did not have a license to either possess or sell heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">3) Whether the trial court erred in not instructing the jury <em>sua sponte </em>on two possible defenses:</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">(a) That the defendant was entrapped as a matter of law, or;</p>\n<p id=\"b686-10\">(b) That the defendant was only acting as a procuring agent in the alleged transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-11\">4) Whether the prosecution failed to show \"due diligence\u201d in attempting to produce defendant\u2019s named codefendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-12\">5) Whether the mandatory 20-year minimum sentence received by the defendant for the sale of heroin constitutes cruel and unusual punishment, thus rendering the statute unconstitutional and requiring that defendant\u2019s sentence be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-13\">We find merit only in the first issue. We there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>fore reverse and vacate defendant\u2019s conviction of possession of heroin and affirm his conviction of sale of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Justice Levin succinctly set out the pertinent facts in his dissenting opinion in the original case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">\"The people made their case entirely from the testimony of LaTonia Boldin, an unpaid civilian undercover narcotics agent working for the Detroit Police Department. She testified that she went to Stewart\u2019s restaurant, introduced herself as 'Candy\u2019, and told him she needed a job to support her 'habit\u2019. Stewart asked her when she could begin work, and she said as soon as she got a 'fix\u2019. Stewart first offered her marijuana, which she rejected because it was 'too mild\u2019, and then agreed to sell her 'some P\u2019s\u2019 [heroin] for $20.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">\"Boldin testified that Stewart left the restaurant and entered an apartment building across the street. While he was gone, Boldin talked 'for 10 or 15 minutes\u2019 with a man who introduced himself as 'Junior\u2019. During the conversation they discussed narcotics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\"Boldin testified that when Stewart returned to the restaurant he went directly to the kitchen and called 'Junior\u2019. She said that she did not see Stewart carrying anything or give anything to 'Junior\u2019. She could see that Stewart and 'Junior\u2019 were talking, but could not hear what they said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-9\">\"Stewart remained in the kitchen. 'Junior\u2019 rejoined Boldin and sold her heroin for $20.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) 397 Mich 1, 11-12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b687-10\">There is no dispute in the instant case that the same heroin was allegedly possessed and sold by the defendant in a single continuous transaction. There was no evidence of possession distinct and apart from the overall sale sequence.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-11\">The opinion of the Court of Appeals is correct in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>its determination that possession and sale of narcotics are separate crimes which may be separately charged. <em>People v Stewart, supra. </em>In a given case, sale may be found without possession. Likewise, possession may be determined without sale. However, depending upon the facts developed at trial, when the circumstance of possession is not severable or apart from a sale and the jury concludes the defendant is guilty of sale, then the possession blends together with the sale so as to constitute one single wrongful act.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Therefore, from the evidence adduced at this trial, the illegal possession of heroin was obviously a lesser included offense of the illegal sale of heroin. When the jury <em>in the case at bar </em>found the defendant guilty of the illegal sale of this heroin, they necessarily found him guilty of possession of the same heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">In the recent case of <em>People v Martin, </em>398 Mich 303; 247 NW2d 303 (1976), this Court reached a similar conclusion in a case where possession was clearly a lesser included offense of delivery. <em>Martin </em>relied on <em>State v Allen, </em>292 A2d 167, 172 (Me, 1972), as authority for its holding. The <em>Allen </em>case facts and rationale are directly on point with the instant case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">\"It is elementary that the State cannot divide a single offense into several parts according to time and conduct and base separate prosecutions upon and impose separate punishments for the various necessary divisions of that single crime. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">\"The possession of narcotic drugs is an offense distinct from the sale thereof. But in the instant case the possession and sale clearly constituted one single and same act. The possession, as legally defined, is necessarily a constitutent part of the sale, as legally defined. Where the only possession of the narcotic drug is that incident to and necessary for the sale thereof, and it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>does not appear that there was possession before or after and apart from such sale, the State cannot fragment the accused\u2019s involvement into separate and distinct acts or transactions to obtain multiple convictions, and separate convictions under such circumstances will not stand. * * * The error is not cured by the fact the trial Court permitted the two sentences to run concurrently. * * * The conviction and sentence upon the charge of possession must be set aside.\u201d <em>Martin, supra, </em>307-308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">The logic of <em>Martin </em>and <em>Allen </em>applies here. Defendant Stewart may not be \"doubly punished\u201d by convicting him of possession, which in <em>this </em>case was a \"necessary\u201d prerequisite or the <em>sine qua non </em>for the very sale for which he was also convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Furthermore, as we stated in <em>Martin:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">\"The guarantee against double jeopardy protects against not only a second <em>prosecution </em>for the same offense, but it also 'protects against multiple punishments for the same offense\u2019. <em>North Carolina v Pearce, </em>395 US 711, 717; 89 S Ct 2072; 23 L Ed 2d 656 (1969).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-7\">\" '[T]he Constitution was designed as much to prevent the criminal from being twice punished for the same offense as from being twice tried for it.\u2019 <em>Ex Parte Lange, </em>85 US (18 Wall) 163, 173; 21 L Ed 872 (1874).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-8\">\" 'It is clear that preventing multiple punishment for the same offense was foremost in the minds of the framers of the double jeopardy clause. * * * Until joinder became permissible and commonplace, however, multiple punishment could result only from multiple trials.\u2019 Comment, <em>Twice In Jeopardy, </em>75 Yale L J 262, 266, fn 13 (1965).\u201d <em>Martin, supra, </em>309-310. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Nor can we accept the argument that since the two sentences run concurrently, a reversal on the lesser included offense is not required. The concept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>of \"double punishment\u201d not only applies to the sentence, but also includes the conviction. The possession conviction, if allowed to stand, could punish the defendant in several ways, including parole considerations, impeachment at subsequent trials, and habitual offender treatment. See <em>Martin, supra, </em>310.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">For these reasons, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction on the higher charge of sale and vacate defendant\u2019s conviction on the lower charge of possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">We do not find any of the defendant\u2019s other issues to be meritorious. Therefore, we will discuss them only summarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">Defendant maintains that the prosecution failed to meet its burden of proof by establishing through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>competent evidence that he had no license to either sell or possess heroin. While it is true that lack of a license is a necessary element for any crime involving the unlawful sale of narcotics, <em>People v Rios, </em>386 Mich 172; 191 NW2d 297 (1971), the record here discloses that defendant during trial, in effect, stipulated that he had no such license.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Also, the court instructed the jury, \"it has been stipulated in this case that the defendant did not have a license\u201d. Defendant neither objected to the charge as given nor requested that the change be modified. Furthermore, we note that at the time this trial occurred, it was legally impossible for anyone to obtain a license to either possess or sell heroin in Michigan. See <em>People v Harper, </em>379 Mich 440; 152 NW2d 645 (1967). Also see 18 USC 1402<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and <em>Harper v Kropp, </em>426 F2d 108 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Defendant Stewart next contends that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>court erred in not instructing the jury <em>sua sponte </em>as to two possible defenses:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">(a) That defendant was entrapped as a matter of law, or, alternatively;</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">(b) That he was only acting as a procuring agent in the transaction between Ms. Boldin and \"Junior\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">Defendant relies heavily on <em>People v Turner, </em>390 Mich 7; 210 NW2d 336 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">However, the defendant failed to raise either defense at his trial (which occurred, incidentally, before our decision in <em>Turner). </em>The defendant\u2019s defense at trial was that he did not commit either of the charged offenses. He made no motion either before or during trial alleging entrapment. Nor did he assert the procuring agent theory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, he entered no objection to the instructions given as required by GCR 1963, 516.2. It is also noted the defendant failed to raise these issues at the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Accordingly, we cannot second-guess defendant\u2019s trial strategy and reevaluate the evidence in light of possible defenses not raised. Nor can we reasonably expect a trial judge to instruct <em>sua sponte </em>on such defenses when they are not raised. Such instructions, if given <em>sua sponte, </em>could have interfered with defendant\u2019s theory of the case and proofs, and given credence to the people\u2019s theory and proofs. Conceivably, defendant then could allege on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion by giving unsolicited instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Defendant Stewart next maintains that the prosecution failed to show due diligence in attempting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>to produce defendant\u2019s named codefendant \"Junior\u201d. However, the information in this case discloses that \"Junior\u201d was <em>not </em>an indorsed res gestae witness, MCLA 767.40; MSA 28.980. The people are not obligated to produce an unindorsed res gestae witness who is an accomplice.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Therefore, defendant had no reason to expect the prosecution to produce \"Junior\u201d. <em>Cf. People v Mitchell, </em>48 Mich App 361; 210 NW2d 509 (1973), <em>lv den </em>391 Mich 752 (1973). Furthermore, the defendant, even if indigent, has the power to subpoena a codefendant. MCLA 775.15; MSA 28.1252. The record discloses that the defense never asked that the codefendant be produced or requested a showing of due diligence be made by the prosecution. The record does disclose that the police did attempt to apprehend the codefendant and would have prosecuted him had they been able to locate him. Defendant\u2019s issue lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">Finally, defendant asserts that a 20-year minimum sentence for the sale of heroin constitutes cruel and/or unusual punishment<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, thus renders the statute unconstitutional. MCLA 335.152; MSA 18.1122.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We do not agree. In <em>People v Lorentzen, </em>387 Mich 167; 194 NW2d 827 (1972), we found the 20-year minimum as applied to the sale of marijuana to be cruel and unusual punishment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>We did not find the statute itself unconstitutional. We are not prepared to extend our holding in <em>Lorentzen </em>to heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\"><em>Lorentzen </em>determined, upon reviewing United States Supreme Court and Michigan Supreme Court cases, that the dominant test governing cruel and unusual punishment is whether \"the punishment is in excess of any that would be suitable to fit the crime\u201d. We do not conclude that the statutorily prescribed penalty of a mandatory minimum imprisonment of 20 years, which may mean 10 years, 7 months, 6 days, given full credit for good time, is in excess of any that would be suitable to fit sellers of heroin.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is not so excessive that it \"shocks the conscience\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">The social loss and attendant crime which is occasioned by heroin addiction in our society has reached tragic proportions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are unwilling to strike down as cruel and unusual this former statutory punishment, imposed upon those who sold heroin and thus traded in such human ignorance, weakness and degradation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Affirmed as modified.</p>\n<judges id=\"b695-5\">Williams, Coleman, Fitzgerald, and Ryan, JJ., concurred with Blair Moody, Jr., J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b685-10\"> In light of <em>People v Tanner, </em>387 Mich 683; 199 NW2d 202 (1972), and GCR 1963, 820.1(7), the Court of Appeals did order the minimum sentence imposed for the possession of the heroin reduced to 6 years, 8 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b690-10\"> In <em>Martin, supra, </em>we affirmed the conviction on the lower charge of possession and vacated the conviction on the higher charge of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">However, <em>Martin </em>also included a pertinent erroneous instruction. In that case, the trial judge incorrectly instructed the jury that it could only find the defendant guilty of possession <em>and </em>delivery, or not guilty. The judge, in effect, compelled the jury to adopt an all-or-nothing approach. This Court\u2019s majority reasoned it could not readily be determined whether the jury believed the defendant guilty of the lesser or greater offense. Hence, the majority opted for the lesser offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">In the instant case, the trial judge advised the jury, \"there are three possible verdicts\u201d: guilty of sale, guilty of possession, or not guilty. Therefore, we can determine that the jury found the defendant guilty of the greater offense of sale since it could have returned a separate guilty verdict on the possession charge and a not guilty verdict on the sale charge. The jury\u2019s verdict was timely clarified on the record and specifically found defendant guilty of both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">The failure of the court to merely omit charging the jury that it could find but one of the two possible guilty verdicts does not vitiate the jury\u2019s determination here that the defendant was guilty of the greater charge. In this case, the jury was not instructed that they <em>had </em>to find the defendant guilty of both counts in order to find him guilty at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> The colloquy in open court, with the jury absent, was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-7\"><em>\"Mr. Lauck [Prosecutor]: </em>Your Honor, there is one more point I would like to bring out.

The jury may not have understood that it had a choice of finding Stewart not guilty of one offense and guilty of the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">While the jury was not instructed that \"they <em>had </em>to find the defendant guilty of both counts in order to find him guilty at all\u201d (emphasis in original), and therefore this case is distinguishable from Martin<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (where the judge instructed the jury that it could not bring in a verdict of guilty on one count and not guilty on another), the failure of the judge in this case to instruct the jury that it could bring in a verdict of guilty on one count and not guilty on the other may, as in <em>Martin, </em>have left it with a misapprehension regarding the possible verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">While there was no objection to the instruction in the instant case, as in <em>Martin </em>\"the responsibility for a properly conducted trial rests on all the participants, including the prosecuting attorney and trial judge\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The jury\u2019s verdict did not and could not indicate that all the jurors were free of misapprehension.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Since the jury was not properly instructed, we may not properly affirm the conviction of the greater offense and vacate the conviction of the lesser offense.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Since the jury, even if under a misapprehension concerning the possible verdicts, by its verdict found that Stewart was at least guilty of possession,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> there would be no prejudice to him in allowing the conviction for the lesser offense to stand. Stewart\u2019s conviction of the greater offense, sale of narcotics, should be vacated and the conviction of possession affirmed with an option in the prosecutor, if he is persuaded that the ends of justice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>would be better served by retrial for sale, to have both convictions vacated and a new trial on both charges<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> before a properly instructed jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Since we would reverse the conviction for sale, we do not reach the question of the constitutionality of a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence for conviction of sale of a narcotic substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">The statute prescribing that punishment has been amended to eliminate the mandatory minimum sentence.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> If the prosecutor were to elect to have both convictions vacated and to have Stewart retried on both charges,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the constitutional question would not again arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">We would vacate the conviction of sale and affirm the conviction of possession of heroin, with an option in the prosecutor to have a new trial on both charges.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b698-9\">Kavanagh, C.
