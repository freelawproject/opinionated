We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\n<em>A. The Prosecution\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Mr. Ronald R. Reedy, an employee of the Michigan Department of Agriculture, Food Inspection Division testified that he entered a Wrigley Supermarket located in the City of Detroit on August 9, 1973 where he checked 40 packages in the refrigerated self-service counter in the meat department and found that 33 weighed less than the amount printed thereon. He said the defendant\u2019s picture bearing the legend \"meat manager\u201d or \"master butcher\u201d, he was not sure which, was posted behind the meat counter. He testified the defendant greeted him and assisted in weighing the packages. Mr. Reedy stated that he did not know the responsibilities of a meat manager, and that he did not know anything about the assignment of responsibility within the Wrigley Supermarket chain.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Both DeClerk and Wrigley were charged with violating the statute. The corporate defendant pleaded guilty; DeClerk pleaded not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">The prosecutor\u2019s proofs consisted solely of the testimony of Mr. Reedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">At the conclusion of Mr. Reedy\u2019s testimony the prosecutor rested, whereupon the defendant moved the trial court to dismiss the charge against him because the prosecutor failed to prove a prima facie case under the statute. The defendant argued that proof that defendant possessed the title \"meat manager\u201d, without some description of his responsibilities, was an insufficient factual basis from which to infer that he was guilty of violating the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">\n<em>B. The Defendant\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The defendant then testified in his own behalf that he was the head of the supermarket\u2019s meat department and that his title was \"master butcher\u201d. He testified further that he did not personally wrap, weigh or price any of the tested packages, but that this duty was the responsibility of another store employee, Mrs. Wrona. He stated that his duties included cutting meat, instructing new personnel about the operation of the automatic packaging and weighing machines, and spot-checking the wrapped packages for accuracy, when he had time. He also stated that he had not spot-checked Mrs. Wrona\u2019s work on the day in question because he was short of help. The defendant testified that he did not hire any of the store employees, that he was Mrs. Wrona\u2019s immediate superior, and that after discovering the short-weight packages he watched Mrs. Wrona reweigh and package all of the meat on display.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">Mrs. Wrona also testified for the defense. She stated that the short-weight packages were the result of her failure to properly adjust the automatic pricing machinery. She testified that she was preoccupied with personal problems and neglected to make correct adjustments, but that no one had instructed her to short-weigh the meat.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">The trial court found the defendant guilty as charged and sentenced him to serve one day in jail. In a written opinion the court denied defendant DeClerk\u2019s motion for a new trial. The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the trial judge improperly denied \"a directed verdict in defendant\u2019s favor\u201d on motion made after the prosecutor rested. 58 Mich App 528, 532.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>We confine our review to two rather narrow issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">(1) What evidence may an appellate court consider in reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a non-jury trial motion to dismiss the charge made at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case; and</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">(2) What evidence is necessary to establish a violation of \u00a7 31(e) of the Weights and Measures Act of 1964, MCLA 290.631; MSA 12.1081(31).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">At the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the defendant moved the court to dismiss the charge against him. Such a motion is in the nature of a jury trial motion for a directed verdict and in both jury and nonjury trials is governed by the rule that the prosecutor has the burden of producing in his case in chief some evidence as to each element of the crime charged to warrant putting the defendant to his defense. <em>People v Vail, </em>393 Mich 460; 227 NW2d 535 (1975); <em>People v Abernathy, </em>253 Mich 583; 235 NW 261 (1931).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">In the case at bar, the trial court apparently found that the prosecutor had presented a prima facie case against defendant under the statute because it ruled: \"In other words, I think there is sufficient facts for it to go to the jury, and it is a question of the weight of the evidence. And for that reason I am overruling the motion, or denying the motion for a directed verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The Court of Appeals disagreed, and confined its review of the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to the prosecutor\u2019s proofs, declining to follow this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>Court\u2019s holding in <em>People v Barlow, </em>134 Mich 394, 397; 96 NW 482 (1903), that \"[i]n such a case the determination of this question involves all proof\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">We have recently held in <em>People v Garcia, </em>398 Mich 250, 256; 247 NW2d 547 (1976), that \"[a]n appellate court tests the correctness of the denial of [a motion for directed verdict of acquittal made at the close of the prosecution\u2019s proofs] by taking the evidence <em>presented by the prosecution </em>in the light most favorable to the prosecution * * * \u201d. (Emphasis by the Court.) We agree with the Court of Appeals that the \"better rule\u201d in criminal cases is that \"in reviewing the denial of such a motion, the appellate court should consider only the record as it existed when the motion was made\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>State v Rocker, </em>52 Hawaii 336, 348; 475 P2d 684, 691 (1970) (Levinson, J., dissenting). See also <em>United States v Rizzo, </em>416 F2d 734 (CA 7, 1969); <em>Cephus v United States, </em>117 US App DC 15; 324 F2d 893 (1963). Confining the scope of our review in this fashion most effectively promotes the fundamental requirement of our criminal justice system that \"the prosecution must establish a prima facie case by its own evidence before the defendant may be put to his defense\u201d. <em>Cephus v United States, supra, </em>17. To require the defendant to elect between resting on his motion to dismiss and presenting his defense in the event the motion is denied compels him to surrender one constitutional right in order to assert another,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a situation the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>Supreme Court has called \"intolerable\u201d. <em>Simmons v United </em>States, 390 US 377, 394; 88 S Ct 967; 19 L Ed 2d 1247 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We, therefore, overrule <em>People v Barlow, supra, </em>and hold that in reviewing a motion to dismiss for failure to present a prima facie case made at the close of the prosecution\u2019s proofs, an appellate court should look only to the evidence theretofore introduced by the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">We next consider the elements of a prima facie case under MCLA 290.631; MSA 12.1081(31).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">The portion of the statute under which defendant was charged and convicted reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-10\">\"Any person who, by himself or by his servant or agent, or as the servant or agent of another person, performs any of the acts enumerated in this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-11\">\"(e) Sell, or offer or expose for sale, less than the quantity he represents of any commodity, thing or service.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-12\">The Court of Appeals held that the defendant could be convicted \"for selling or offering or exposing for sale short-weight meat if (1) he (defendant) did it by himself, or (2) if it was done by his (defendant\u2019s) servant or agent, or (3) if the act was done by him (defendant) as an agent or servant of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>a principal\u201d. That Court reversed the conviction because \"there was no evidence that the defendant did the short weighing himself, nor that it was done by his servant or agent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The prosecutor contends that the Court of Appeals misconstrued the statute by finding, in effect, that the act of short weighing the commodity is the prohibited activity. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">By its terms, the statute provides penalties for offering or exposing for sale items which are less in quantity than represented. Therefore, the fact that the record fails to reveal any evidence that the defendant (or anyone else) was the one who actually weighed the meat does not, by itself, preclude conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">A relevant question in this case is whether the statute creates \"vicarious liability\u201d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The issue may be stated thus: does the statute in question dispense with the requirement that the prosecution prove an <em>actus reus </em>by the defendant and, if so, is this defendant one of the persons enumerated therein to whom vicarious liability can attach? By its terms, the statute imposes liability upon a principal for the acts of his servant or agent. However, it was not proved in the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tion\u2019s case in chief that the employee who packaged and weighed the meat was the \"servant\u201d or \"agent\u201d of the defendant. Consequently, no guilt predicated on vicarious liability was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">However, the prosecutor contends that the defendant is guilty of a violation of the statute because, in his capacity as \"master butcher\u201d at the self-serve meat counter of the supermarket, he suffered the short-weight meat to be put on display and, therefore, himself offered it for sale. A violation of the statute is proved, the prosecutor contends, if it is established that the commodity, thing or service involved is less in quantity than represented, and that the defendant \"had a responsible share in the [prohibited] transaction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">In <em>United States v Dotterweich, </em>320 US 277; 64 S Ct 134; 88 L Ed 48 (1943), the United States Supreme Court held that criminal liability for violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which prohibited \"[t]he introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any * * * drug * * * that is adulterated or misbranded\u201d, could attach to the defendant \"solely on the basis of his authority and responsibility as president and general manager of the corporation\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that case, the Court of Appeals, <em>sub nona United States v Buffalo Pharmacal Co, Inc, </em>131 F2d 500 (CA 2, 1942), had attempted to severely limit criminal liability which, under a literal reading of the statute, could have extended to any corporate employee \"however remotely entangled in the proscribed shipment [of misbranded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>drugs]\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Justice Frankfurter in his opinion for the Court aptly noted that \"[l]iteralism and evisceration are equally to be avoided\u201d, and circumscribed the statutory criminal liability in this fashion: \"[t]he offense is committed * * * by all who * * * have * * * a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws * * * \u201d. 320 US at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">The rule in <em>Dotterweich </em>was recently reaffirmed in <em>United States v Park, </em>421 US 658; 95 S Ct 1903; 44 L Ed 2d 489 (1975), in which the Court sustained the conviction under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of the defendant who was the \"chief executive officer\u201d of a retail food chain corporation. The Court approved the practice of \"holding criminally accountable the persons whose failure to exercise the authority and supervisory responsibility reposed in them by the business organization resulted in the violation complained of * * * \u201d. 421 US 671. The Court proffered a justification for such criminal accountability by elucidating Justice Frankfurter\u2019s phraseology: \"those corporate agents vested with the responsibility, and power commensurate with that responsibility, to devise whatever measures are necessary to ensure compliance with the Act bear a 'responsible relationship\u2019 to, or have a 'responsible share\u2019 in, violations\u201d. 421 US 672. The Court further noted, however, that it is incumbent upon the government to prove \"beyond a reasonable doubt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>the defendant\u2019s guilt, including his power, in, the light of the duty imposed by the Act, to prevent or correct the prohibited condition\u201d. 421 US 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In light of the United States Supreme Court decisions interpreting Federal consumer legislation analogous to MCLA 290.631; MSA 12.1081(31), we conclude that the statute in this case imposes both vicarious and direct liability. First, the statute imposes vicarious liability \u2014 that is, it dispenses with the requirement that a personal <em>actus reus </em>be proved \u2014 only when criminal liability is imposed on a <em>principal </em>whose \"servant\u201d or \"agent\u201d performs any of the prohibited acts. Second, when the corporate \"agent\u201d who \"performs\u201d the prohibited act is charged with a violation of the statute, direct liability is imposed \u2014 that is, the prosecution is required to prove an <em>actus reus </em>on the part of that \"servant\u201d or \"agent\u201d. However, the element of <em>actus reus </em>may be established by a showing of a <em>failure to act </em>by one \"with the responsibility, and power commensurate with that responsibility, to devise whatever measures are necessary to ensure compliance with\u201d the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">The question, then, is whether the prosecutor offered any evidence in his case in chief to establish the defendant\u2019s \"responsibility, and power commensurate with that responsibility\u201d \"as the servant or agent of another\u201d to avoid or correct violations of MCLA 290.631(e); MSA 12.1081(31)(e).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>The prosecution\u2019s case consisted of one witness, the food inspector, who testified that displayed behind the meat counter was a picture of the defendant with the legend \"meat manager\u201d or \"master butcher\u201d, and that the defendant assisted the inspector in weighing the packages of meat determined to be short weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">This testimony alone, taken in the light most favorable to the prosecution, does not establish a sufficient factual predicate from which one may infer all of the elements of the crime. The prosecution\u2019s case consisted of no evidence of the duties, responsibilities or authority of a \"master butcher\u201d in the business structure. The prosecution\u2019s proofs contain no facts from which we might reasonably infer a responsibility and power on the part of the defendant to avoid or correct violations of the statute. Because we must confine our inquiry to the prosecutor\u2019s proofs we do not consider the effect of the defendant\u2019s case on the existence of the elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Since the prosecutor produced no evidence in his case in chief on one of the elements of the crime charged, to wit: that the defendant \"performed\u201d one of the acts prohibited by the statute, we hold that the trial court erroneously denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss made at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-8\">Kavanagh, C. J., and Levin, Coleman, and Fitzgerald, JJ., concurred with Ryan, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b164-9\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_M\">This weights and measures \"short-weight\u201d case raises two issues. First, did the Court of Appeals err in only considering the prosecution\u2019s evidence in ruling on the propriety of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>motion to dismiss in a nonjury trial, or does Michigan law require in such instances that a court, on review, look to both the prosecution\u2019s evidence and evidence later introduced by the defense. Second, did the Court of Appeals correctly state the elements of the statutory offense in issue, or did the Court err by implicitly refusing to adopt the rationale of <em>United States v Dotterweich, </em>320 US 277; 64 S Ct 134; 88 L Ed 48 (1943), imputing direct liability to a person \u201csolely on the basis of his authority and responsibility\u201d within a corporate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We hold that on review of a denial of a motion to dismiss at the end of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief, only the prosecution\u2019s evidence may be considered. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">We further hold that the Weights and Measures Act, in providing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-8\">\u201cAny person who, by himself or by his servant or agent, or as the servant or agent of another person, performs any of the acts enumerated in this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-9\">\"(e) Sell, or offer or expose for sale, less than the quantity he represents * * * \u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">focuses liability on the person who by himself or herself \u201cperforms\u201d the prohibited act and his, her or its employer or principal, if any. Since the prosecution\u2019s evidence did not show that defendant DeClerk performed the prohibited acts by himself, by a servant or agent, or as a servant or agent of another, the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss was improper. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals and reverse the trial court as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">As the trial court stated, \"the facts of this case are simple, undisputed and important\u201d. On August 9, 1973, Ronald Reedy, a food inspector for the Michigan Department of Agriculture, tested 40 packages of meat at a Wrigley supermarket. He found 33 of the 40 packages to be underweight.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Mr. Reedy then secured a complaint and warrant charging defendant DeClerk, individually, and \"Wrigley\u2019s Supermarket, Inc.\u201d, as criminal defendants, alleging both defendants violated the following provision of the Michigan Weights and Measures Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">\"Any person who, by himself or by his servant or agent, or as the servant or agent of another person, performs any of the acts enumerated in this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-7\">\"(e) Sell, or offer or expose for sale, less than the quantity he represents of any commodity, thing or service.\u201d MCLA 290.631; MSA 12.1081(31).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Defendant Wrigley\u2019s pled guilty and was fined in accord with the statute. Defendant DeClerk, however, claimed he was improperly charged under the statute. His case proceeded to a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">At trial, the prosecution\u2019s sole witness was Mr. Reedy. The trial court accurately summarized the substance of his testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-10\">\"(1) The defendant was present in the meat department on August 9, 1973, when the 33 underweight packages were found to be offered for sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">\"(2) A picture of the defendant was displayed over the meat counter and it described Mr. DeClerk as the 'meat manager,\u2019 or possibly the 'meat butcher\u2019. Mr. Reedy had been to the store previously and seen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>same picture displayed six or eight months earlier; at that time too he saw defendant in the meat department and took him to be the meat manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-6\">\"(3) Mr. Reedy knew Mr. DeClerk by name and the latter accompanied him to the meat counter and witnessed the inspection and weighing of the meat. It is customary for the store manager or meat manager to witness the inspection and in the instant case this arrangement was effectuated without explanation, apparently because of the prior contact between Reedy and DeClerk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-7\">\"(4) Before leaving the store, Mr. Reedy showed the report of his investigation to both Mr. DeClerk and the store manager.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-8\">\"(5) Mr. Reedy further testified that the store in question is a large supermarket, open 24 hours a day and that he did not personally see the meat in question weighed, wrapped nor put on display. Further, he was not familiar with the individual responsibilities of the store or meat or produce managers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Upon termination of Mr. Reedy\u2019s testimony, defendant moved to dismiss<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on the grounds that the prosecution had failed to prove a prima facie case under the statute. The trial court denied the motion, stating that \"I think there is <em>[sic] </em>sufficient facts for it to go to the jury, and it is a question of the weight of the evidence. And for that reason I am overruling the motion * * * \u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Defendant then elected to call two witnesses after the motion to dismiss was denied. First, defendant testified in his own behalf. The trial court accurately summarized the substance of his testimony as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b167-11\">\"(1) He was in fact employed as head of the meat department of the store in question and the picture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>referred to was on display though the caption thereunder read 'master butcher\u2019.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-4\">\"(2) He did not wrap any of the meat packages in question, though he cut it and placed it on the conveyor where it was weighed, wrapped and thereafter placed on display by Ms. Wrona on August 8, 1973.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-5\">\"(3) Tare sheets and shrinkage allowances are provided by the company to adjust the represented weights of produce, and these are and were given by him to the wrapper, Ms. Wrona.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-6\">\"(4) Mr. DeClerk does spot check the work of the wrappers though he did not do so on Wednesday, August 8, because he had 'a skeleton crew\u2019 that day. On Wednesdays only three persons are employed in the meat department as opposed to the usual four persons; on Wednesdays, all prices are changed and it is a busy day for wrappers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-7\">\"(5) Mr. DeClerk, who has no prior record, has headed the meat department in that store for two years, and while only 40 packages were tested he believed that there were approximately 200 packages on display at the time of the inspection, he believed those not weighed to be inaccurate as well and accordingly he had them all reweighed and rewrapped. Ms. Wrona did this and he watched her do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\"(6) He did not hire Ms. Wrona, the company did. He showed her how to operate the scales and part of his duties and responsibilities were to show people how to operate the equipment in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">\"(7) Irene Wrona worked under his direction and he was her supervisor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">Second, Mrs. Wrona testified. The substance of her testimony was accurately summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">\"(1) On August 9 she weighed the meat in question, incorrectly, because she forgot to touch the tare weight button. This error was inadvertent and it occurred because it was her last week of work, and she was worried about being laid off and not having enough money to meet some of her needs. She said this was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>rough on her and as a consequence she was careless and did not pay enough attention to her work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">\"(2) Sometimes her wrapping work was checked and this was usually done by the defendant, the meat manager: ' * * * when he found time enough he would usually run through and see if I had the right tare on. But that Wednesday he didn\u2019t have time.\u2019 She estimated that on two of the five Wednesdays she performed this work Mr. DeClerk did check her work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">\"(3) Mr. DeClerk gave her the sheets from which to take tare and shrinkage adjustments and he was her immediate supervisor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">The trial court found defendant guilty as charged and sentenced him to serve one day in jail. Defendant moved for a new trial. In a written opinion, filed December 11, 1973, the trial court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">\"1. Proof of the meat manager\u2019s status and presence at the time of the ongoing offense is a sufficient prima facie case to create a question of fact for the jury or fact-finder and to deny a motion for a directed verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">\"2. Proofs showing that the error was committed, inadvertently, by an employee under the supervision of the meat manager and that the meat manager did not 'spot check\u2019 the employee\u2019s work, as sometimes done by him, and ever discover the error because he was working with a skeleton crew and was too busy are sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty under a statute prohibiting 'any person who, by himself or by his servant or. agent, or as the servant or agent of another person\u2019 'sell(s) or offer(s) or expose(s) for sale, less than the quantity he represents of any commodity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">Defendant appealed. On February 12, 1975 the Court of Appeals reversed, solely upon the grounds that the trial court improperly denied \"a directed verdict in defendant\u2019s favor\u201d on the motion made after the prosecutor rested his case. 58 Mich App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>528, 532. The prosecution filed a delayed application for leave to appeal. We granted leave on August 14, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">II \u2014 The Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">This case comes to us on an appeal of a denied motion to dismiss by defendant at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">As a general rule of law, \"it is reversible error for a trial judge to refuse a directed verdict of acquittal on any charge where the prosecution has failed to present evidence from which the jury could find all elements of the crime charged\u201d. <em>People v Vail, </em>393 Mich 460, 464; 227 NW2d 535 (1975); <em>People v Abernathy, </em>253 Mich 583; 235 NW 261 (1931); <em>People v Wesley Brown, </em>35 Mich App 153; 192 NW2d 281 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">As noted <em>supra, </em>the record reveals that at trial, the trial court judge denied defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on the grounds that he believed there were \"sufficient facts\u201d for the case \"to go to the jury\u201d, that \"it is a question of the weight of the evidence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">The trial court\u2019s rationale for its denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is crucial to the understanding of the substantive issues on appeal. At the bench trial, the court only indicated \"it is a question of the weight of the evidence\u201d; the court did not elaborate why it believed the prosecution had presented some evidence as to the \"elements of the crime charged\u201d. However, in its written opinion, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-10\">\"Proof of the meat manager\u2019s status and presence at the time of the ongoing offense is a sufficient prima facie case to create a question of fact for the jury or fact-finder and to deny a motion for a directed verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>In the body of its opinion, the court argued that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-4\">\"If the statute reaches defendant DeClerk, as a meat manager in the supervisory capacity supported circumstantially or directly on the record, then his conviction shall be upheld. <em>For if this is the case, sufficient facts could be inferred from his presence and status to raise a question of fact supporting the denial of a directed verdict. \u201d (Emphasis added.)</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">This argument assumes a most essential part of the court\u2019s argument, developed subsequently in its opinion. The court held that it was \"satisfied that Mr. DeClerk did commit the offense charged 'by himself \u201d, that \"[t]he statute is properly interpreted by saying that Mr. DeClerk in his capacity as meat manager \u2014 and sometimes, but not often enough, a 'spot checker\u2019 \u2014 did himself 'offer and expose for sale\u2019 the 33 packages that were underweight\u201d. Thus, the court perceived the element of the offense that a person \"by himself\u2019 \"sell, or offer or expose for sale, less than the quantity he represents of any commodity, thing or service\u201d to mean that although defendant personally did not, in fact, <em>perform </em>any of the above acts, he \"legally\u201d sold, offered,, or exposed for sale, etc., by reason of his \"presence and status\u201d as meat manager. The court\u2019s basis for viewing the statute in this manner was its interpretation of the landmark United States Supreme Court case <em>United States v Dotterweich, </em>320 US 277; 64 S Ct 134; 88 L Ed 48 (1943), which stands for the general proposition that direct liability may be imputed to a person \"solely on the basis of his authority and responsibility\u201d (his \"presence or status\u201d, according to the trial court) within a corporate structure. 320 US 277, 286 (Murphy, J., dissenting). See also discussion part IV, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Thus, legally, the basis for the court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss was based on its judgment that defendant\u2019s picture, labelled \"meat manager\u201d or \"master butcher\u201d and the fact that defendant aided Mr. Reedy in reweighing the underweight packages were adequately factual evidence of defendant\u2019s \"presence and status\u201d as a person in a position of \"authority and responsibility\u201d \u2014 an element of the statutory offense the court \"interpreted into\u201d the Weights and Measures Act \"short-weight\u201d provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">The Court of Appeals overruled the trial court on its denial of the motion to dismiss. In a carefully written opinion, the Court, in reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, focused first on the elements of the statutory offense, \"under the express terms\u201d of the statute, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b172-6\">\"[A] defendant may be held responsible for selling or offering or exposing for sale short weight meat if (1) he (defendant) <em>did it by himself, </em>or (2) if it was done by his (defendant\u2019s) servant or agent, or (3) if the act was done by him (defendant) as an agent or servant of a principal.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 58 Mich App 528, 531.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">Importantly, the Court did not adopt the trial court\u2019s analysis that defendant performed the prohibited acts \"by himself\u2019 by reason of his \"presence or status as meat manager\u201d, <em>i.e. </em>the court did not adopt the <em>Dotterweich </em>approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">Viewing the elements of the offense in this manner, the court then stated that: \"A review of the transcript reveals that there was no evidence that the defendant did the short weighing himself, nor that it was done by his servant or agent\u201d (element 2 of the offense). The Court, in making its conclusion, looked only to the prosecution\u2019s proofs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>to see whether some proof of the elements of the offense was established. The Court did not choose to look to any of the subsequent testimony of defendant; thus, any testimony reflecting on the possibility that defendant was liable because Mrs. Wrona was defendant\u2019s \"servant or agent\u201d was irrelevant to its consideration of the propriety of the denial of the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">From this rather complicated \"procedural history\u201d two issues arise. First, was it error for the Court of Appeals to only consider the prosecution\u2019s evidence in ruling on the propriety of a motion for a directed verdict (here, a motion to dismiss); or does Michigan law require that a reviewing court look to both the prosecution\u2019s evidence and evidence later introduced by the defense. Second, did the Court of Appeals correctly state the proper elements of the statutory offense, or did the court err by implicitly refusing to adopt the rationale of <em>United States v Dotterweich </em>imputing direct liability to a person by reason of \"his presence or status\u201d within a corporate structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Ill \u2014 On Review of a Denied Motion to Dismiss, the Court Shall Only Consider Evidence From the Prosecutor\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">As to the first issue, we agree with the Court of Appeals that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-9\">\"We think the better rule is that if the people without the aid of defendant\u2019s proofs do not establish some evidence on every element, a directed verdict for acquittal must be granted if requested.\u201d 58 Mich App 528, 532.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">As we have recently stated in <em>People v Garcia, </em>398 Mich 250, 256; 247 NW2d 547 (1976), a review<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ing court \"tests the correctness of the denial\u201d of a motion to dismiss or a motion for directed verdict of acquittal made at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case in chief \"by taking the evidence <em>presented by the prosecution </em>in the light most favorable to the prosecution * * * (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">This rule appears to be at odds with the court\u2019s holding in <em>People v Barlow, </em>134 Mich 394, 397; 96 NW 482 (1903), that \"[i]n such a case the determination of this question involves all proof\u2019. But, upon examination of <em>Barlow, </em>we agree with the Court of Appeals that that case is distinguishable because \"the prosecutor had made out a prima facie case. The court simply held that defendant\u2019s testimony only strengthened the people\u2019s case\u201d. 58 Mich App 528, 532. However, to the extent the <em>Barlow </em>opinion conflicts with our holding in <em>Garcia, </em>it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">IV \u2014 The Elements of the Statutory Offense</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">As to the second issue, we believe the Court of Appeals correctly read the statute in issue in ruling that a defendant could be convicted \"for selling or offering or exposing for sale short-weight meat if (1) he (defendant) did it himself, or (2) if it was done by his (defendant\u2019s) servant or agent, or (3) if the act was done by him (defendant) as an agent or servant of a principal\u201d. However, some elaboration upon the court\u2019s analysis is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The Weights and Measures Act provision relating to the facts in this case is quite specific:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-9\">\"Any person who, by himself or by his servant or agent, or as the servant or agent of another person, performs any of the acts enumerated in this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\"(e) Sell, or offer or expose for sale, less than the quantity he represents of any commodity, thing or service.\u201d MCLA 290.631; MSA 12.1081(31).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">The statute is clear and unambiguous as to what the prohibited offense is and as to who is liable. There is no necessity for judicial construction or interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The prohibited offense is <em>\"performing\u201d </em>any of the acts enumerated, including to \"sell, or offer or expose for sale, less than the quantity he represents of any commodity, thing or service\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The person liable is \"[a]ny person, who, by himself or by his servant or agent, or as the servant or agent of another person, performs any of the acts\u201d prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">The facts in this case are clear that Mrs. Wrona weighed, wrapped, marked the meat packaged for sale with the weight and price and exposed it for sale. The weight and price were incorrect because Mrs. Wrona failed to adjust the weighing and pricing machine correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Mrs. Wrona was a person who by herself performed a prohibited act (1 above). But the dispositive issue before us is whether defendant DeClerk, the meat manager, was liable. There is no evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case which indicates defendant was a person who by himself performed a prohibited act (1 above). Nor is there any evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case indicating he was a person who as a servant or an agent of another performed a prohibited act (3 above).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">As to the question of whether defendant DeClerk was a person who \"by his servant or agent\u201d performed a prohibited act, we find again that there is no evidence in the prosecution\u2019s case that Mrs. Wrona, who performed the prohibited acts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>was, legally, a servant or agent of defendant DeClerk.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Therefore, because the prosecution did not show any evidence as to the crucial elements of the statutory offense, the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The people have urged that DeClerk is liable \"solely on the basis of his authority and responsibility\u201d under <em>United States v Dotterweich, </em>320 US 277, 286; 64 S Ct 134; 88 L Ed 48 (1943) (dissent, Murphy, J.). As we noted <em>supra, </em>this rationale in <em>Dotterweich </em>is also the essential basis for the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. See discussion, part II, <em>supra. </em>However, we believe that <em>Dotterweich </em>is in no way apposite. The statute in <em>Dotterweich </em>is far broader and substantively different than the Michigan Weights and Measures Act. In addition, the above quoted words from <em>Dotterweich </em>are cast in terms of limitation rather than in terms of expansion, as the people urge here.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">First and foremost the Michigan Weights and Measures Act is structured in an entirely different manner from the statute in <em>Dotterweich. </em>Circuit Judge Swan <em>of </em>the Federal Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, when the <em>Dotterweich </em>case was before that Court, described the statute in issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-7\">\"Section 301, 21 USCA 331, prohibits 'the following acts and the causing thereof,\u2019 namely, '(a) The introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce of any food, drug, device, or cosmetic that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>adulterated or misbranded.\u2019 Section 333(a) of Title 21 declares that 'any person\u2019 who violates any of the provisions of section 331 shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction be subject to imprisonment or fine or both. The Act defines the term 'person\u2019 to include 'individual, partnership, corporation, and association.\u2019 * * * While the statutory language seems literally to include all who have any part in causing delivery for introduction into interstate commerce, there are serious objections to so construing it.\u201d <em>United States v Buffalo Pharmacal Co, Inc, </em>131 F2d 500, 502-503 (CA 2, 1942).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The Federal statute is different in structure from the Michigan statute in that, to use Judge Swan\u2019s words, the Federal \"statutory language seems literally to include all who have any part in causing delivery for introduction into interstate commerce\u201d, whereas the Michigan statute is specifically limited, as we have seen, to three categories \"[a]ny person who, by himself or by his servant or agent, or as the servant or agent of another person, performs * * * \u201d. In other words, in <em>Dotterweich </em>the Court was dealing with a statute which on its face seemingly allowed for the possibility that any person could be swept within the field of liability, whereas in the case before us, the Michigan Legislature has clearly and explicitly defined and limited the field of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The second difference between <em>Dotterweich </em>and the case before us follows inexorably and logically from the first. The Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Dotterweich </em>wrote to <em>limit </em>the sweep of liability. But the people and the trial court would have this Court use <em>Dotterweich </em>to <em>expand </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>field of liability. We cannot accept this legal <em>non sequitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">The United States Supreme Court in <em>Dotterweich </em>wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">\"To speak with technical accuracy, under \u00a7 301 a corporation may commit an offense and all people who aid and abet its commission are equally guilty. * * * The offense is committed * * * by all who do have such a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws * * * .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\"It would be too treacherous to define or even to indicate by way of illustration the class of employees which stands in such a responsible relation.\u201d 320 US 277, 284, 285.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Subsequently, Chief Justice Burger in <em>United States v Park, </em>421 US 658, 669; 95 S Ct 1903; 44 L Ed 2d 489 (1975), analyzed <em>Dotterweich </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">\"At the same time, however, the Court was aware of the concern which was the motivating factor in the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, that literal enforcement 'might operate too harshly by sweeping within its condemnation any person however remotely entangled in the proscribed shipment.\u2019 <em>Id., </em>at 284. A limiting principle, in the form of 'settled doctrines of criminal law\u2019 defining those who 'are responsible for the commission of a misdemeanor\u2019, was available. In this context, the Court concluded, those doctrines dictated that the offense was committed 'by all who * * * have * * * a responsible share in the furtherance of the transaction which the statute outlaws.\u2019 <em>Ibid. \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">In sum, we do not believe <em>Dotterweich </em>can be used to support the expansion of liability in the Weights and Measures Act. <em>Dotterweich </em>dealt with a statute that seemed to make everyone liable, whereas the Weights and Measures Act is specifically limited; the United States Supreme Court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number><em>Dotterweich </em>was writing to limit liability, whereas the people attempt to use it to expand liability. In short, <em>Dotterweich </em>is neither applicable to this case nor authority for the result for which the people argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">For the above stated reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals, overruling the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-7\">Blair Moody, Jr., J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-10\"> In civil cases a motion to dismiss made when the plaintiff rests is controlled by GCR 1963, 504.2, which may apply to criminal cases through GCR 1963, 785.1. In this case we need not decide the applicability of GCR 1963, 504.2 to criminal proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-6\"> This motion must be distinguished from a post-trial challenge to the adequacy of the record to support the conviction, in which review of the entire record is appropriate. <em>See Thompson v Louisville, </em>362 US 199; 80 S Ct 624; 4 L Ed 2d 654 (1960).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\"> Regarding this so-called waiver rule, Professor Moore states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-8\">\"Denial places defendant in the dilemma of resting without oifering any evidence, thus risking a conviction, or putting in evidence which might result in filling the gaps in the government\u2019s case. For, in determining the sufficiency of the evidence * * * on appeal, the * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>appellate court * * * looks to the entire record and not simply to the evidence offered by the government on its direct case. This means that a conviction may be sustained despite the fact that as of a certain stage of trial \u2014 viz., the close of the government\u2019s case \u2014 defendant was entitled to an acquittal. Putting in a defense which brings about this result is verbalized as a 'waiver\u2019 by defendant of his right to review denial of his motion for acquittal.\u201d 8A Moore Federal Practice (2d ed), \u00b6 29.05.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\"> A statute can create both strict and vicarious liability. It is important to distinguish between the two:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\"The distinction between strict and vicarious responsibility has never been properly explained by the judges. * * * The full difference is this: strict responsibility does not dispense with something like a personal actus reus, whereas vicarious responsibility does. Conversely, strict responsibility dispenses with the need for mens rea altogether, whereas vicarious responsibility does not dispense with the need for mens rea on the part of the servant. The same statute may, of course, create both strict and vicarious responsibility. In that event, since the responsibility is strict, there will be no need to prove mens rea on the part of anyone; and since the responsibility is vicarious, there will be no need to prove an actus reus on the part of the accused master. It may be hoped that such a tyrannous combination will be found to be rare.\u201d Williams, Criminal Law: The General Part, pp 285-286.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\"> 52 Stat 1040; 21 USC \u00a7\u00a7 301-392.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b161-9\"> 320 US 286 (Murphy, J., dissenting).
