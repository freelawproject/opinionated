Mr. Bouchee said that he balked at the price and stepped out of his car for a moment, whereupon the complainant drove away. There were no other witnesses to the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">The defendant asserts that certain questions put to him by the trial court during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination, and certain questions asked of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>his witness, Reverend Amos Williams, constituted improper inquiry relating \"to his opinions on religion\u201d contrary to MCLA 600.1436; MSA 27A.1436 and our holding in <em>People v Hall, </em>391 Mich 175; 215 NW2d 166 (1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The prosecutor argues that the statute and <em>Hall </em>are inapposite because the defendant first broached the subject of his religious practices by certain volunteered responses regarding his intention to tell the truth \"so help me God\u201d, by his claimed church membership and attendance, and by asserting his strict belief in the Bible. The prosecutor urges us to affirm the Court of Appeals holding that \"the defendant\u2019s initiative in putting his religious credentials before the jury invited clarifying inquiry by the people\u201d. To hold otherwise, the prosecutor contends, would allow the defendant to offer unimpeachable religious credentials with impunity, irrespective of their substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In <em>People v Hall, supra, </em>we held that a prosecutor\u2019s question to the defendant inquiring whether he believed in a Supreme Being, although it was merely an oblique reminder to the defendant that he was under oath, and despite no objection by defense counsel, violated Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 18 and MCLA 600.1436; MSA 27A.1436 and amounted to reversible error. The constitutional provisions states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-5\">\"No person shall be rendered incompetent to be a witness on account of his opinions on matters of religious belief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">\"No person may be deemed incompetent as a witness in any court, matter or proceeding, on account of his opinions on the subject of religion. No witness may be questioned in relation to his opinions on religion, either before or after he is sworn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\"This statute leaves little room for discussion by this Court as to whether or not this cross-examination was improper. It clearly was so. As Justice Christiancy, in <em>People v Jenness, </em>5 Mich 305, 319 (1858), stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">\" 'Under this section, it was clearly incompetent to question the witness in this case, in reference to her belief in a God, unless it can be shown that belief or disbelief in a God has no reference to \"opinions on the subject of religion.\u201d Belief is a stronger term than opinion, and necessarily includes the latter. Belief or opinion in reference to the existence or non-existence of a Supreme Being, is, we think, not only a belief or opinion \"on the subject of religion,\u201d but on the most important of all subjects of religion, and that which controls and gives form to all other religious opinions. We think, therefore, <em>it was clearly the intention of the legislature to prevent the first step, </em>and every subsequent step, in all inquiries of this kind * * * .\u2019 (Emphasis added.)\u201d 391 Mich at 181-182.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">In the case at bar, near the conclusion of the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of the defendant, the trial court, after ruling on an objection, asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-8\"><em>\"The Court: </em>* * * Well, you spoke of the Bible, didn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-9\"><em>\"The Witness: </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-10\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Court: </em>Accepting the Bible wouldn\u2019t stop you then from having relations though you were a married man with a single woman or married as far as that is concerned, is that right, that wouldn\u2019t stop you either?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-11\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Witness: </em>No, I don\u2019t think so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-12\"><em>\"The Court: </em>If the occasion presented itself?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-13\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Witness: </em>Well, no, I don\u2019t think it would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-14\"><em>\u2019\u2019The Court: </em>Okay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-15\">It appears that the court\u2019s question \u2018was designed to elicit an admission from the defendant that his claimed belief in the Bible was at odds with his testimony that he was willing to have consensual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>extramarital sexual relations with the complainant. The question, however, constituted an inquiry of the defendant whether his religious beliefs permitted or forbade such conduct. This type of inquiry concerning defendant\u2019s \"opinions on religion\u201d is forbidden by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">We recognize that the defendant did indeed volunteer the testimony that he belonged to the Catholic Church, attended the Church of God in Christ and believed \"strictly in the Bible\u201d, for the ostensible purpose of demonstrating that he was a religious, moral and God-fearing man, and thus was possessed of the qualities of character inconsistent with the criminal sexual conduct of which he was accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">Assuming without conceding the relevance of such evidence as tending to prove that the defendant was possessed of the specific traits of good character relevant to rebut the charge, the evidence did not invite or justify the kind of \"clarifying inquiry\u201d made by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The prosecutor was fully entitled to challenge the defendant\u2019s claim of good character, either upon cross-examination or through extrinsic evidence in rebuttal. Such challenge might have taken the form <em>inter alia </em>of evidence of prior convictions, testimony contradicting the claimed church membership and attendance, or reputation evidence tending to disprove the claim of religious, moral and God-fearing qualities, if indeed such evidence existed. It would not have been competent, however, for the prosecutor to inquire of the defendant concerning the nature, substance and content of his religious beliefs in order to show that such beliefs were inconsistent with the qualities of good character claimed. Nor was it competent for the court to conduct such an inquiry. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Aside from the debatable relevance of such an inquiry to rebut the claim of a moral, God-fearing and religious character, such questioning is expressly forbidden by the statute and our holding in <em>Hall, supra</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Equally offensive to the principle that a witness, particularly \"an accused [,] is entitled to be tried and convicted without the question of his religious opinions ever being put in front of the judge or jury for their consideration\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was the following inquiry made of the defendant\u2019s character witness, Reverend Amos Williams, by the prosecuting attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-7\"><em>\"Q. </em>You wouldn\u2019t classify him as a religious man?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-8\"><em>\u201dA. </em>Let me say a Christian. Let me rephrase it; not religious but let me say Christian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-9\"><em>\u201dQ. </em>Is that a person who believes and does not practice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b403-10\"><em>'A. </em>Religion is a duty. A Christian is a person who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>believes in Christ. You don\u2019t have to believe in Christ in order to be religious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Although the statutory prohibition only precludes questioning a witness concerning his own religious beliefs, we have no hesitancy to extend the rationale and application of the rule to the instance in which a witness\u2019s religious opinions and beliefs are explored through the questioning of another witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">At common law, religious credentials were offered on the issue of the competency of the witness.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 18 explicitly rejects the common-law requirement that belief in a Supreme Being is a prerequisite to testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Many of the other common-law disabilities such as infancy, infamy and interest in the outcome of the litigation no longer operate in the modern law of evidence to disqualify a witness from testifying.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, these disabilities persist in the form of methods of impeachment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> MCLA 600.1436; MSA 27A.1436 expressly prohibits the use of religious beliefs even for impeachment by stating without qualification that \"[n]o witness may be questioned in relation to his opinions on religion, either before or after he is sworn\u201d. We believe that the intention of the Legislature to prohibit this form of impeachment compels us to apply the proscription to intrinsic and extrinsic impeachment alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>Reverend Williams was called by counsel for the defendant as a character witness. The direct examination was carefully confined to an inquiry concerning the defendant\u2019s reputation in the community for veracity. Upon cross-examination, however, in an effort to explain and justify his claimed knowledge of the defendant\u2019s reputation for veracity, Reverend Williams stated, \"People who are connected with our church often says that Bouchee is a good man.\u201d The expression \"good man\u201d which was employed by the witness in an effort to explain the basis for his testimony concerning Bouchee\u2019s reputation for veracity did not offer justification for the prosecuting attorney to conduct a general inquiry concerning the defendant\u2019s entire character and specifically did not warrant any \"clarifying inquiry\u201d concerning the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs and practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Both the inquiry by the court of the defendant and the inquiry by the prosecutor of Reverend Williams concerning the defendant\u2019s religious beliefs were prejudicially unfair and constitute grounds for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">The defendant also complains that it was unfairly prejudicial to allow the prosecutor to cross-examine him and his wife regarding the fact that their four children were all born prior to their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">During his cross-examination of Mrs. Bouchee, the prosecutor was allowed to establish, over objection, that the youngest child of the defendant and his wife was nine years old, while they had been married only seven years. Later, while cross-examining the defendant, the prosecutor was allowed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>pursue the matter further, again over objection that the subject matter was irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The Court of Appeals thought this \"line of inquiry\u201d was one this Court approved in <em>People v La Londe, </em>197 Mich 76; 163 NW 490 (1917), \"as affecting the credibility of the witness\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In <em>La Londe </em>the defendant was charged with statutory rape of a girl who allegedly became pregnant as a result of the incident. La Londe\u2019s defense was that at the time of the occurrence, and for several years before that, he was impotent by reason of an unfortunate kick from his horse. This Court ruled that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecutor to ask the defendant if he was responsible for a child born to another woman employed in his office. <em>La Londe </em>is inapposite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">It is elementary that any witness who testifies, including a defendant in a criminal case, \"puts in issue\u201d his credibility, or as it is sometimes called, his character for truthfulness. Jurisdictions are split on whether a witness\u2019s credibility may be impeached by a showing that he is possessed of a general bad character<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> or whether such impeaching character evidence must be limited to the particular character trait of veracity. McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 41; 81 Am Jur 2d, Witnesses, \u00a7 563. The modern tendency has been to limit the inquiry to character evidence bearing solely upon the witness\u2019s truthfulness. <em>E.g., </em>FRE 608.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">In Michigan the state of the precedent is uneven, but apart from the \"disciplined discretion of the bar to avoid abuses,\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> it appears that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\"extent to which a witness may be cross-examined on questions affecting his or her credibility rests in the sound discretion of the trial court * * * <em>People v Myers, </em>239 Mich 105, 109; 214 NW 130 (1927). Although this Court has accepted the rule that \"the previous life and character of a witness may be inquired into to elicit facts which may aid the jury in determining what credence they will attach to his testimony,\u201d <em>People v Gotshall, </em>123 Mich 474, 483; 82 NW 274 (1900), we have also held that it is the trial court\u2019s duty to \"keep such [character] examinations within reasonable bounds.\u201d <em>People v Gotshall; People v Hammond, </em>394 Mich 627; 232 NW2d 174 (1975) (opinion by Kavanagh, C. J.). In the past we have allowed prosecutorial forays into a witness\u2019s general character in order to challenge credibility, <em>People v Petty, </em>234 Mich 282; 207 NW 920 (1926), <em>People v Cutler, </em>197 Mich 6; 163 NW 493 (1917); however, we have also attempted to limit character impeachment to the particular character trait being attacked. <em>People v Johnson, </em>393 Mich 488; 227 NW2d 523 (1975) (credibility); <em>People v Whalen, </em>390 Mich 672; 213 NW2d 116 (1973)(bias); <em>People v Tolewitzke, </em>332 Mich 455; 52 NW2d 184 (1952) (credibility); <em>People v Rice, </em>136 Mich 619; 99 NW 860 (1904) (bias); <em>People v Gotshall, supra </em>(credibility); <em>Calkins v Ann Arbor R Co, </em>119 Mich 312; 78 NW 129 (1899) (credibility); <em>People v Abbott, </em>97 Mich 484; 56 NW 862 (1893) (credibility); <em>People v Cahoon, </em>88 Mich 456; 50 NW 384 (1891) (credibility); <em>Rickabus v Gott, </em>51 Mich 227; 16 NW 384 (1883). Indeed, we perceive that the latter course is the fairest and most effective way to \"keep such [character] examinations within reasonable bounds\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>We hold, therefore, that character evidence offered to impeach or support a witness\u2019s credibility, other than evidence of prior conviction for crime,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> must be limited to the particular character trait of truthfulness or untruthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The inquiry regarding the birth of the Bouchees\u2019 four children before their marriage was an attempt to show that Bouchee and his wife were either possessed of a bad general character or, more narrowly, a bad character for truthfulness by showing them to be guilty of specific acts of misconduct not resulting in conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">For the reasons indicated above, the evidence was inadmissible because it was not competent to impeach the witnesses\u2019 credibility by showing them to be possessed of a bad general character. We cannot agree with the apparent assumption of the trial court, and the express holding of the Court of Appeals, that the legitimacy of the Bouchees\u2019 four children related to the truthfulness or untruthfulness of the defendant or his wife as witnesses. In light of the unfairly prejudicial nature of the testimony, we hold that its admission on the issue of the credibility of the defendant or his wife amounted to an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">Defendant also contends that portions of the prosecution\u2019s closing argument expressed the prosecutor\u2019s personal opinion as to the credibility of the witness and the defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">We are not persuaded that the argument was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>improper. In any event, because no objection was made at trial, appellate review is foreclosed unless our failure to consider the issue would result in a miscarriage of justice. <em>People v Hall, </em>396 Mich 650; 242 NW2d 377 (1976); <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551; 194 NW2d 709 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">However, because we find prejudicial error resulting from portions of the cross-examination of the defendant and his witnesses, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b409-5\">Kavanagh, C.

We disagree. If we were, on a case by case basis, to evaluate the entire record to determine if prejudice or manifest injustice occurred therein because of this type of question, we would emasculate our statute and the legislative intent behind it. Our statute clearly states that an accused is entitled to be tried and convicted without the question of his religious opinions ever being put in front of the judge or jury for their consideration. Whether the defendant hesitates, or unhesitatingly responds negatively or positively, or if he should quite properly refuse to respond, he still cannot avoid the risk of stimulating an offensively prejudicial reaction in some quarter of the jury. This Court feels that it is inappropriate for it to take it upon itself to determine whether or not such prejudicial reaction did in fact occur, when our statute clearly attempts to foreclose such review by forbidding the asking of the prejudicial question itself. A defendant is entitled to a trial free of such improper questions. Once the question is asked, this is no longer possible. A new trial is mandated.\u201d 391 Mich at 182-183.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b403-13\"> <em>People v Hall, supra </em>at 182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b404-7\"> A common-law requirement to take the oath was the belief in a Supreme Being who would punish false swearing. <em>Attorney General v Bradlaugh, </em>14 QBD 667 (1885). <em>See also </em>6 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7 1817; McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 63.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> <em>E.g., </em>MCLA 600.2158; MSA 27A.2158 (no disqualification of witness from testifying due to interest in the outcome, relationship of witness to party or conviction of a crime); MCLA 600.2163; MSA 27A.2163 (children may testify).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b404-9\"> <em>See </em>MCLA 600.2158; MSA 27A.2158; <em>People v Jackson, </em>391 Mich 323; 217 NW2d 22 (1974); <em>Luck v United States, </em>121 US App DC 151; 348 F2d 763 (1965).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b406-8\"> The impeaching character evidence to which we have reference here relates to specific conduct or specific \"bad acts\u201d, as it is sometimes called, which have not resulted in conviction for crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b406-9\"> <em>See also </em>Proposed MRE 608.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b406-10\"> McCormick, Evidence (2d ed), \u00a7 42. <em>See also, People v Whalen, </em>390 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>Mich 672, 687; 213 NW2d 116 (1973), citing Code of Professional Responsibility, DR 7-106(C); McCormick, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41, 42; 3A Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn rev), \u00a7 983.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\"> The use of prior convictions to impeach a witness\u2019s credibility is governed by <em>People v Jackson, </em>391 Mich 323; 217 NW2d 22 (1974), and related cases.
