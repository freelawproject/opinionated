Upon completion of Moning\u2019s proofs, the trial judge directed a verdict for the remaining defendants. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">We remand for a new trial because a manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer of a manufactured product owe a legal obligation of due care to a bystander affected by use of the product, and whether defendants in violation of that obligation created an unreasonable risk of harm in marketing slingshots directly to children is for a jury to decide, reasonable persons being of different minds.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">My colleague declares that there is no legal duty to refrain from manufacturing slingshots for and marketing them directly to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">It obscures the separate issues in a negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>case (duty, proximate cause and general and specific standard of care) to combine and state them together in terms of whether there is a duty to refrain from particular conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">It is now established that the manufacturer and wholesaler of a product, by marketing it, owe a legal duty to those affected by its use. The duty of a retailer to a customer with whom he directly deals was well established long before the manufacturer and wholesaler were held to be so obligated. The scope of their duty now also extends to a bystander. All the defendants were, therefore, under an \"obligation for the safety\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of Moning; they owed him a duty to avoid conduct that was negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Whether it would be a violation of that obligation to market slingshots directly to children is not a question of duty, but of the specific standard of care: the reasonableness of the risk of harm thereby created.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Negligence is conduct involving an <em>unreasonable </em>risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">Slingshots pose a <em>risk </em>of harm. In manufacturing and marketing slingshots the defendants necessarily created such a risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The meritorious issues are whether the risk so created was unreasonable because the slingshots were marketed directly to children, and whether this should be decided by the court or by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-11\">The reasonableness of the risk of harm, whether analyzed or expressed in terms of duty, proximate cause or the specific standard of care, and whether regarded as one of law or fact or for the court or the jury to decide, turns on how the utility of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>defendants\u2019 conduct is viewed in relation to the magnitude of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">If a court is of the opinion that marketing slingshots directly to children is of such utility that it should be fully protected, the court in effect determines as a matter of law that the risk of harm so created is not unreasonable and, therefore, such conduct is not negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The resolution of the balance between the utility of children having ready-market access to slingshots and the risk of harm thereby created is an aspect of the determination of the reasonableness of that risk and of the defendants\u2019 conduct, and should be decided by a jury:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u2014Reasonable persons can differ on the balance of utility and risk, and whether marketing slingshots directly to children creates an unreasonable risk of harm;</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\u2014The interest of children in ready-market access to slingshots is not so clearly entitled to absolute protection in comparison with the interest of persons who face the risk thereby created as to warrant the Court in declaring, as a rule of common law, that the risk will be deemed to be reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">The statement that \"we are being asked to perform a legislative task\u201d because a holding for Moning \"would in effect be making a value judgment and saying * * * [that slingshots] should not be <em>manufactured or </em>marketed\u201d(emphasis supplied) to children assumes that allowing juries to decide the reasonableness of the risk of harm created by <em>marketing </em>slingshots directly to children will so burden the manufacture and marketing of slingshots that all manufacturing and marketing would cease, rather than merely affect the manner and cost of marketing slingshots, and does not take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>into account that however the Court decides the case it in effect makes a value judgment:</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">\u2014Affirming a directed verdict for the defendants in effect expresses a value judgment that the interest of the child in ready-market access to slingshots is of such societal importance that as a matter of law it takes precedence over the interest in protecting persons exposed to the risk of harm so created, or that all reasonable persons would agree that the risk so created is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">\u2014Reversing the directed verdict and holding that the issue should be decided by a jury is not an expression of a value judgment that slingshots should not be manufactured and marketed, but rather expresses a value judgment that all reasonable persons do not agree concerning the reasonableness of the risk so created and that the interest of the child in ready-market access is not of such overriding importance as to be entitled to absolute protection as a matter of law, and therefore a jury, applying the community\u2019s judgment of how reasonable persons would conduct themselves, should make the ultimate value judgment of the risks and the societal importance of the interests involved in marketing slingshots directly to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">However the Court decides this case, it necessarily makes a choice, even if the Legislature may later make a different choice.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">If the issue is left to juries to decide, different juries will, indeed, reach different results, sometimes in cases appearing to be factually indistinguishable. The variant results may be more perceptible in this kind of case than in one where it may appear there are more variables. The preference for jury resolution of the issue of negligence is not, however, simply an expedient reflecting the difficulty of stating a rule that will readily resolve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>all cases; rather, it is rooted in the belief that the jury\u2019s judgment of what is reasonable under the circumstances of a particular case is more likely than the judicial judgment to represent the community\u2019s judgment of how reasonable persons would conduct themselves.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">If the experience should be that juries invariably reach one result, that may suggest the specific standard of care upon which \"all\u201d reasonable persons would agree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Until the <em>community </em>judgment is made so to appear, the principle that doubtful questions regarding the application of the standard of care should be decided by reference to the community judgment requires jury submission of the question so in doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The law of negligence was created by common-law judges and, therefore, it is unavoidably the Court\u2019s responsibility to continue to develop or limit the development of that body of law <em>absent </em>legislative directive. The Legislature has not approved or disapproved the manufacture of slingshots and their marketing directly to children; the Court perforce must decide what the common-law rule shall be.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">Duty and Proximate Cause</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">While we all agree that the duty question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>solely for the court to decide,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the specific standard of care is not part of that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The elements of an action for negligence are (i) duty, (ii) general standard of care, (iii) specific standard of care, (iv) cause in fact, (v) legal or proximate cause, and (vi) damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">\"Duty\u201d comprehends whether the defendant is under <em>any </em>obligation to the plaintiff to avoid negligent conduct; it does not include \u2014 where there is <em>an </em>obligation \u2014 the nature of the obligation: the general standard of care and the specific standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Dean Prosser observed: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>the duty. \u201d </em>Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 53, p 324 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>\"It is quite possible, and not at all uncommon, to deal with most of the questions which arise in a negligence case in terms of 'duty.\u2019 Thus the standard of conduct required of the individual may be expressed by saying that the driver of an automobile approaching an intersection is under a duty to moderate his speed, to keep a proper lookout, or to blow his horn, but that he is not under a duty to take precautions against the unexpected explosion of a manhole cover in the street. But the problems of 'duty\u2019 are sufficiently complex without subdividing it in this manner to cover an endless series of details of conduct. <em>It is better to reserve \u2019duty\u2019 for the problem of the relation between individuals which imposes upon one a legal obligation for the bene\u00f1t of the other, </em>and to deal with particular conduct in terms of a legal standard of what is required to meet the obligation. In other words, 'duty\u2019 is a question of whether the defendant is under <em>any </em>obligation for the benefit of the particular plaintiff; and in negligence cases, the duty is always the same, to conform to the legal standard of reasonable conduct in the light of the apparent risk. <em>What the defendant must do, or must not do, is a question of the standard of conduct required to satisfy</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>The statement in my colleague\u2019s opinion that the \"defendants did not owe plaintiff minor the asserted duty not to manufacture, distribute and sell slingshots\u201d combines the separate questions of duty, general and specific standard of care and proximate cause: whether in marketing a product a manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer are under any legal obligation to a bystander (duty); the nature of that obligation (general standard of care: reasonable conduct \"in the light of the apparent risk\u201d); whether marketing slingshots directly to children is reasonable conduct (specific standard of care); whether marketing slingshots directly to children is \"so significant and important a cause [of loss resulting from such marketing] that the defendant should be legally responsible\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (proximate cause, a policy question often indistinguishable from the duty question).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Combining in one statement these different questions obscures the functions of the court and jury. While the court decides questions of duty, general standard of care and proximate cause, the jury decides whether there is cause in fact and the specific standard of care:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> whether defendants\u2019 conduct in the particular case is below the general standard of care, including \u2014 unless the court is of the opinion that all reasonable persons would agree or there is an overriding legislatively or judicially declared public policy \u2014 whether in the particular case the risk of harm created by the defendants\u2019 conduct is or is not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Duty is essentially a question of whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>relationship<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> between the actor and the injured person gives rise to any legal obligation on the actor\u2019s part for the benefit of the injured person. Proximate cause encompasses a number of distinct problems including the limits of liability for foreseeable consequences.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In the <em>Palsgraf</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>case, the New York Court of Appeals, combining the questions of duty and proximate cause,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> concluded that no duty is owed to an unforeseeable plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The questions of duty and proximate cause are interrelated because the question whether there is the requisite relationship, giving rise to a duty, and the question whether the cause is so significant and important to be regarded a proximate cause both depend in part on foreseeability\u2014 whether it is foreseeable that the actor\u2019s conduct may create a risk of harm to the victim, and whether the result of that conduct and intervening causes were foreseeable.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">It is well established that placing a product on the market creates the requisite relationship between a manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer and persons affected by use of the product giving rise to a legal obligation or duty to the persons so affected. A manufacturer owes the consumer an obligation to avoid negligent conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The obligation extends to persons within the foreseeable scope of the risk. In <em>Piercefield v Remington Arms Co, Inc, </em>375 Mich 85; 133 NW2d 129 (1965), a bystander, injured when his brother\u2019s shotgun bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>rel exploded, was permitted to maintain an action against the manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer of allegedly defective shotgun shells.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">A manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer of slingshots can be expected to foresee that they will be used to propel pellets and that a person within range may be struck. Moning, as a playmate of a child who purchased a slingshot marketed by the defendants, was within the foreseeable scope of the risk created by their conduct in marketing slingshots directly to children. Moning was a foreseeable plaintiff. The defendant manufacturer, wholesaler and retailer were under an obligation for the safety of Moning.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">The question of proximate cause, like the question of duty, is \"essentially a problem of law\u201d.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Most proximate cause problems are not involved in this case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">Alfono\u2019s conduct in using the slingshot to propel pellets was to be anticipated. \"If the intervening cause is one which in ordinary human experience is reasonably to be anticipated, or one which the defendant has reason to anticipate under the particular circumstances, he may be negligent, among other reasons, because he has failed to guard against it; or he may be negligent only for that reason.\u201d Prosser, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 44, p 272.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">By marketing slingshots directly to children, the defendants effectively created the risk that Alfono would use the slingshot. \"Obviously the defendant cannot be relieved from liability by the fact that the risk, or a substantial and important part of the risk, to which he has subjected the plaintiff has indeed come to pass. Foreseeable intervening forces are within the scope of the original risk, and hence of the defendant\u2019s negligence. The courts are quite generally agreed that intervening causes which fall fairly in this category will not supersede the defendant\u2019s responsibility.\u201d <em>Id, </em>p 273.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Alfono\u2019s shooting pellets toward a tree and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ricochet into Moning\u2019s'eye was within the \"recognizable risk of harm\u201d created by marketing slingshots directly to children.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The ricochet was \"a normal consequence of the situation\u201d created by the defendants\u2019 conduct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">General Standard of Care Specific Standard of Care</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Turning to a consideration of the nature of the obligation owed by a manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer, we note that this is not an ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>products liability case where the plaintiff seeks to recover by proving a defect in the product without carrying the burden of proving fault or negligence. Moning\u2019s claim is grounded in negligence. He asserts that his damage was caused by the fault of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">In a negligence case, the standard of conduct is reasonable or due care. 2 The Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 283, provides: \"[T]he standard of conduct to which [the actor] must conform to avoid being negligent is that of a reasonable man under like circumstances.\u201d \"[I]n negligence cases, the duty is always the same, to conform to the legal standard of reasonable conduct in the light of the apparent risk.\u201d Prosser, Torts, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 53, p 324.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">It is the application of that general standard of conduct to the marketing of slingshots to children, the specific standard of care \u2014 not whether there is a duty of due care in such marketing \u2014 that is the primary area of disagreement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Manufacturing and marketing slingshots necessarily creates a risk of harm. Moning does not, however, contend that manufacturing and marketing slingshots is negligence <em>per se. </em>His contention, rather, is that marketing them <em>directly to children </em>creates an unreasonable risk of harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Moning relies on the doctrine of negligent entrustment, one of the many specific rules concerning particular conduct that have evolved in the application of the general standard of care. A person who supplies an article to a child which may pose a reasonable risk of harm in the hands of an adult but which poses an unreasonable risk of harm in the hands of a child is subject to liability for resulting harm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-10\">\"One who supplies directly or through a third person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>a chattel for the use of another whom the supplier knows or has reason to know to be likely because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving unreasonable risk of physical harm to himself and others whom the supplier should expect to share in or be endangered by its use, is subject to liability for physical harm resulting to them.\u201d 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 390.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">The common law has long recognized that a parent or other responsible adult who entrusts a potentially dangerous instrumentality to a child may be subject to liability.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Liability \"arises from [the defendant\u2019s] active misconduct; he has actually created an unreasonable risk to others by placing a chattel in the hands of a person whose use thereof is likely to create a recognizable risk to third persons\u201d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">The obligation \"to guard or secure objects which are dangerous to children\u201d arises \"because of the likelihood of their own intermeddling\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Persons dealing with children must \"take notice of the ordinary nature of young boys, their tendency to do mischievous acts, and their propensity to meddle with anything that came in their way\u201d.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Special rules for children are not unusual. The attractive nuisance doctrine, an exception to the general rule limiting the liability of landowners for injuries to trespassers,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> is based on the child\u2019s inability to appreciate danger and his inclination to explore without regard to the risk. The doctrine does not depend on the landowner\u2019s knowledge that the \"individual\u201d child is \"incompetent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The doctrine of negligent entrustment is not peculiar to automobiles but rather an ordinary application of general principles for determining whether a person\u2019s conduct was reasonable in light of the apparent risk.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> It is grounded in the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>principle that a reasonable person will have in mind the immaturity, inexperience and carelessness of children. If, taking those traits into account, a reasonable person would recognize that his conduct involves a risk of creating an invasion of the child\u2019s or some other person\u2019s interest, he is required to recognize that his conduct does involve such a risk. \"He should realize that the inexperience and immaturity of young children may lead them to act innocently in a way which an adult would recognize as culpably careless, and that older children are peculiarly prone to conduct which they themselves recognize as careless or even reckless.\u201d 2 Restatement, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 290, comment k.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The issue whether the defendants are subject to liability cannot properly be taken from the jury on the supposition that an 11-year-old boy knows how a slingshot operates and, therefore, appreciates the risk.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Even if it is thought, without supporting evidence and as a matter of law, that children should be deemed to appreciate the risk, there still may be an unreasonable risk of physical harm to the child and others in marketing slingshots directly to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Entrusting potentially dangerous articles to a child may pose an unreasonable risk of harm not only because the child may not appreciate the risk or may not have the skill to use the article safely but \u2014 even if he does appreciate the risk and does have the requisite skill \u2014 because he may recklessly ignore the risk and use the article frivolously due to immaturity of judgment, exuberance of spirit, or sheer bravado.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">\"One has no right to demand of a child, or of any other person known to be wanting in ordinary judgment or discretion, a prudence beyond his years or capacity, and therefore in his own conduct, where it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>may possibly result in injury, a degree of care is required commensurate to the apparent immaturity or imbecility that exposes the other to peril. Thus, a person driving rapidly along a highway where he sees boys engaged in sports, is not at liberty to assume that they will exercise the same discretion in keeping out of his way that would be exercised by others; and ordinary care demands of him that he shall take notice of their immaturity and govern his action accordingly.\u201d 3 Cooley, Law of Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 490, pp 433-434.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">Just as the driver of an automobile is expected to take precautions for the safety of children playing near a highway even though children can be expected to appreciate the risk and the driver does not know that the individual children are incompetent to look after themselves,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> so too a supplier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>can be expected in marketing a product to take precautions for the safety of children and others even if the child may be expected to appreciate the risk and individual children may both appreciate it and be skilled in using the product. It is for a jury to decide whether any negligence in marketing slingshots directly to children is a cause in fact of plaintiffs loss.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">Reasonableness of the Risk of Harm</p>\n<p id=\"b589-8\">Even if a person recognizes that his conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>involves a risk of invading another person\u2019s interest, he may nevertheless engage in such conduct unless the risk created by his conduct is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The reasonableness of the risk depends on whether its magnitude is outweighed by its utility. The Restatement provides: \"Where an act is one which a reasonable man would recognize as involving a risk of harm to another, the risk is unreasonable and the act is negligent if the risk is of such magnitude as to outweigh what the law regards as the utility of the act or of the particular manner in which it is done.\u201d 2 Restatement, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The balancing of the magnitude of the risk and the utility of the actor\u2019s conduct requires a consideration by the <em>court and jury </em>of the societal interests involved.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The issue of negligence may be removed from jury consideration if the court concludes that overriding considerations of public policy require that a particular view be adopted and applied in all cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">A court would thus refuse to allow a jury to consider whether an automobile manufacturer should be liable for all injuries resulting from manufacturing automobiles on the theory that it is foreseeable that some 50,000 persons may be killed and hundreds of thousands injured every year as a result of manufacturing automobiles. The utility of providing automobile transportation is deemed by society to override the magnitude of the risk created by their manufacture. Similarly, a court might conclude that it would be violative of public policy to hold a manufacturer of slingshots liable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>for all injuries resulting from their use. The interest of mature persons who wish to purchase and use slingshots might be deemed to supersede the interest of those who may be harmed by their careless or improper use.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">The issue in the instant case is not whether slingshots should be manufactured, but the narrower question of whether marketing slingshots directly to children creates an unreasonable risk of harm. In determining that question, the Court must first ask whether the utility of marketing slingshots directly to children so overrides the risk thereby created as to justify the Court in refusing to permit juries to subject persons who engage in such conduct to liability for the resulting harm. If it concludes that the utility does not, as a matter of law, override the risk, then the question of balancing utility and risk is for the jury to decide, again, as part of its consideration of the reasonableness of defendants\u2019 conduct, unless the Court concludes that all reasonable persons would be of one mind on that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The Restatement suggests a number of factors that should be considered in balancing the utility of the actor\u2019s conduct and the magnitude of the risk. First, the magnitude of the risk:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\"In determining the magnitude of the risk for the purpose of determining whether the actor is negligent, the following factors are important:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">\"(a) the social value which the law attaches to the interests which are imperiled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-10\">\"(b) the extent of the chance that the actor\u2019s conduct will cause an invasion of any interest of the other or of one of a class of which the other is a member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-11\">\"(c) the extent of the harm likely to be caused to the interests imperiled;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-12\">\"(d) the number of persons whose interests are likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>to be invaded if the risk takes effect in harm.\u201d 2 Restatement, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 293.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">a) The law attaches a high social value to the interest of persons in unimpaired eyesight.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">b) Slingshots are potentially dangerous. An expert witness, called by Moning, testified that the slingshots Alfono purchased were capable of launching projectiles at speeds exceeding 350 miles per hour. Slingshots cause hundreds of serious injuries each year to school-age children. Almost all these injuries are head or eye injuries and occur to children 5 to 14.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Experience therefore shows that marketing slingshots to children may with substantial frequency cause an invasion of the interest in unimpaired eyesight of a substantial number of persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">c) The extent of the harm likely to be caused to the interest so imperiled may be of a most serious nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>d) The number of persons whose interests are likely to be invaded is difficult to estimate, but it appears that hundreds of injuries, many resulting in serious impairment of vision, occur every year as a result of the use of slingshots by children.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Turning to utility:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-7\">\"In determining what the law regards as the utility of the actor\u2019s conduct for the purpose of determining whether the actor is negligent, the following factors are important:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-8\">\"(a) the social value which the law attaches to the interest which is to be advanced or protected by the conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-9\">\"(b) the extent of the chance that this interest will be advanced or protected by the particular course of conduct;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-10\">\"(c) the extent of the chance that such interest can be adequately advanced or protected by another and less dangerous course of conduct.\u201d 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7292.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b593-11\">a) There is a sharp difference of opinion concerning the social value of the child\u2019s interest in having direct-market access to slingshots.

Instead of manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers effectively determining whether children shall have slingshots, an adult who generally would know the child would decide whether he is of sufficient maturity to have one; the adult would, under the common law, assume responsibility for any negligence on his part in entrusting a slingshot to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Having in mind the parent\u2019s interest in protecting the child from potentially dangerous instrumentalities<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> and in avoiding exposure to litigation such as befell the Alfonos, the child\u2019s interest in an opportunity to use slingshots cannot be said as a matter of law to be inadequately advanced or protected by allowing a jury to decide that a manufacturer, wholesaler or retailer is negligent in marketing them directly to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">Balancing the magnitude of the risk and the utility of the conduct in the application of the factors suggested by the Restatement, there is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>a sufficient basis for concluding as a matter of law that the utility of the defendants\u2019 conduct outweighs the risk of harm thereby created.

The latter are viewed by society essentially as are automobiles in that although children are injured and killed riding bicycles and playing baseball, the utility of such activity is regarded by society and all reasonable persons as outweighing the risk of harm created by their manufacture for and marketing to children. Statutes and ordinances do not prohibit the purchase or use of bicycles or baseball equipment by children. There is no ongoing debate, as there is about slingshots, whether children should have direct market access to bicycles or baseball equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">In sum, it cannot be said that there was no \"obligation of reasonable conduct for the benefit of the plaintiff\u2019,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> or that all reasonable men would agree that defendants\u2019 conduct was not \"a substantial factor in producing the result\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> or regarding \"the foreseeability of [the] particular risk\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> or regarding \"the reasonableness of the defendants\u2019 conduct with respect to it, or the normal character of [Alfono\u2019s conduct]\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> as an intervening cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Since reasonable persons can differ regarding the balance of risk and utility (the reasonableness of the risk of harm) and since there is no overriding policy based on social utility of maintaining absolute access to slingshots by children, we reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b599-4\">Kavanagh, C.

And if I lend a car to one known by me to be habitually careless I am negligent precisely because of the likelihood of his negligent operation of the car. Again the importance of the factor of foreseeability is not altered if the intervening act is that of plaintiff himself, nor is it if that act is a negligent one. When I lent my car to the careless driver, one of the risks that made me negligent was surely the chance that he might hurt himself.

He gave one of the slingshots to plaintiff, age 12, and the boys rode their bicycles to a nearby park. At the park plaintiff and Joseph Alfono employed their slingshots to shoot projectiles at frogs which they found in the vicinity of a pond. The incident of injury occurred when plaintiff was standing near the small pond and Joseph was on the side of a nearby hill. Joseph called to plaintiff to look up and watch as Joseph shot at a bird. When plaintiff looked up, he was struck in the left eye by a projectile from Joseph\u2019s slingshot.

The existence of a duty. In other words, whether, upon the facts in evidence, such a relation exists between the parties that the community will impose a legal obligation upon one for the benefit of the other\u2014 or, more simply, whether the interest of the plaintiff which has suffered invasion was entitled to legal protection at the hands of the defendant. This is entirely a question of law, to be determined by reference to the body of statutes, rules, principles and precedents which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>make up the law; and it must be determined only by the court. <em>It is no part of the province of a jury to decide whether a manufacturer of goods is under any obligation for the safety of the ultimate consumer, </em>* * * . A decision by the court that, upon any version of the facts, there is no duty, must necessarily result in judgment for the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 37, p 206.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Decisions of this Court have in similar fashion recognized that the question of duty is to be resolved by the court rather than the jury. See <em>Fisher v Johnson Milk Co, Inc, </em>383 Mich 158, 162; 174 NW2d 752 (1970), in which the Court viewed summary judgment for defendant manufacturer of a wire milk bottle carrier proper after determination that there was \"no legal duty to supply a carrier so designed as to prevent bottles placed therein from breaking when dropped to a hard surface\u201d. Also, see <em>Bonin v Gralewicz, </em>378 Mich 521, 527; 146 NW2d 647 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The trial court in this case found no legal duty owed plaintiff by defendants.

Through the sifting and winnowing action of the trial and appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>late process these allegations have been refined so that we have presently before us only the following contention as stated at page 11 of plaintiffs brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">\"Plaintiffs position [is] that the defendants had a duty as reasonably prudent manufacturers, distributors and retail merchants not to manufacture, market and sell these slingshots to young children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">It is asserted that two factors give rise to this duty:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">\"(1) the inherently dangerous nature of the slingshot, and (2) the youthfulness and lack of discretion of the purchasers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">The question before us is not settled by Michigan case law precedent. A related question was considered by this Court, however, in <em>Chaddock v Plummer, </em>88 Mich 225; 50 NW 135 (1891). In <em>Chaddock, </em>an air gun case, this Court affirmed a directed verdict in favor of the father-purchaser of an air gun used by a neighbor boy in' injurious fashion. Evidence indicated the mother, rather than the father, was in \"control\u201d of the premises at the time the gun was loaned to and used by the visiting child. Negligence of the mother was not asserted. The Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">\"[I]t was not negligence <em>per se </em>for the defendant to buy this toy gun, and place it in the hands of the boy nine years of age; and there were too many intervening causes without the act or knowledge of the defendant, between the buying of the gun and the injury to hold the defendant liable for its use in this case. If his own son had, in any manner, contributed to the accident, a different question would arise, upon which I express no opinion.\u201d <em>Supra </em>230.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number><em>Whalen v Bennett, </em>4 Mich App 81; 143 NW2d 797 (1966), involved the circumstance of injury which occurred when defendant\u2019s son shot an air gun while playing with friends and injured one of his companions. The Court of Appeals<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> concluded that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was improper, there being evidence indicating that a duty on the part of the parent, to supervise the use of an instrumentality as dangerous as an air gun, had been breached.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither <em>Chaddock </em>nor <em>Whalen </em>dealt with the liability of retailers, wholesalers, or manufacturers.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">Cases from other jurisdictions offer instruction not afforded by Michigan precedent. In <em>Pitts v Basile, </em>35 Ill 2d 49; 219 NE2d 472 (1966), a child struck by a dart thrown by another child brought suit against the wholesaler of the dart and the retailer from whom the darts had been purchased. The appeal considered only the question of the wholesaler\u2019s liability. The Illinois Supreme Court concluded that there was insufficient causal con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>nection between alleged negligence on the part of the wholesaler and resulting injury, finding that there was no relation between the marketing of the darts and subsequent injury. In addition, the Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-6\">\"We are not concerned in this case with the liability of the proprietors of the grocery store who sold the darts to the eight-year-old boy, but with the liability of the defendant [wholesaler], who sold the darts to the proprietors of the grocery store. There was no contention or proof that the darts were in any way defective, and the appellate court emphasized that it was not characterizing them as 'inherently dangerous.\u2019 In this court, however, the plaintiff urges that the defendant\u2019s ' \"non-defective\u201d dart manifestly was not safe when used by small children for the purpose for which it was intended. The dart in question was intended to be thrown at various objects * * * . Its propensity to cause serious injury, particularly to the eyes, was demonstrated by the very injury suffered by the infant plaintiff in the instant case.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-7\">\"There are many things used by children that may be said to be unsafe when used for the purpose for which they are intended. A baseball, a baseball bat, a penknife, a Boy Scout hatchet, a bicycle, all have the capacity to injure the user or others in the course of their normal use. They are not, however, to be categorized as 'dangerous instrumentalities.\u2019 As was said by the Tennessee court in <em>Highsaw v Creech, </em>17 Tenn App 573, 69 SW2d 249, 252 [1934], 'an air gun is not a dangerous instrumentality of itself, but is in fact a toy. * * * The fact alone that an injury may be inflicted by such a toy does not make of it a dangerous instrumentality in the sense that the term is generally used.\u2019 In <em>Morris v Toy Box, </em>204 Cal App 2d 468, 22 Cal Rptr 572, 574-575 (1962), a complaint brought by a minor against a retailer alleging that the retailer knew that the intended user of a bow and arrow was the purchaser\u2019s ten-year-old boy was dismissed, the court saying, 'the bow and arrow has been in use by young and old alike for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>thousands of years. * * * To us it is simply inconceivable that a 10-year-old boy, much less his mother, would be unacquainted with the use of so common an article as the one here in question.\u2019 See also, <em>White v Page, </em>105 NE2d 652 (Ohio App, 1950).\u201d <em>Supra, </em>35 Ill 2d 49, 51-52; 219 NE2d 472, 473, 474.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The Supreme Court of Oklahoma in <em>Atkins v Arlan\u2019s Department Store of Norman, </em>522 P2d 1020 (Okla, 1974), quoted the above from <em>Pitts v Basile </em>in concluding that there was no cause of action for plaintiff against the manufacturer and retailer of a lawn dart game for injury caused when a lawn dart struck the eye of a child. That Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">\"There are many toys and playthings, perfectly harmless and inoffensive in themselves, but whose common use can be perverted into a dangerous use and design, and there are very few of the most harmless toys which cannot be used to injure another.

The California Court rejected the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>notion that a bow and arrow were \"inherently dangerous\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\"><em>\"As in the case of a sling shot</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the bow and arrow has been in use by young and old alike for thousands of years; its method of operation, therefore, is a matter so notorious to all that production of evidence relative thereto would be unnecessary * * * (Emphasis supplied) 472.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The Court concluded there was no duty on the part of the retailer to warn of the dangers incident to the bow and arrows\u2019 use and found no cause of action.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Plaintiff refers us to \u00a7 390 of the Restatement of Torts, 2d, indicating that this section affords a basis for liability.

Plaintiff in this case seeks an extension of the Restatement doctrine to recognize the status of children, rather than circumstances concerning an individual child, and in relation thereto to circumscribe with duty the distribution of toys, the misuse of which involves a likelihood of injury <em>\u2014i.e., </em>here, slingshots.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">In our view we are being asked to perform a legislative task. If we were to find a duty on the part of defendants not to supply slingshots to children, we would in effect be making a value judgment and saying to defendants and their coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>terparts that such \u2014 in this instance \u2014 toys should not be manufactured or marketed.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">As has been noted, slingshots have a long history of association with the human race. Indeed, anyone can make one from a tree branch and a piece of inner tube. We acknowledge that there are dangers incident to their use and that such dangers are magnified when slingshots are used by minors. In the case of use by a minor, the law recognizes that parents have some responsibility of supervision. See, <em>e.g., Whalen v Bennett, supra. Cf. Chaddock v Plummer, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">In the absence of legislative prescription circumscribing the manufacture, distribution, or sale of slingshots or providing that defendants insure against the misuse of their products, we are unable to find a duty upon which the liability of defendants may be premised.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">We would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b608-7\">Coleman, J., concurred with Fitzgerald, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b599-8\"> After commencement of this litigation the name of defendant was changed to Chemtoy Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> The Alfonos are party to a cross-appeal concerning their respective rights against the other defendants in the event this Court were to set aside the directed verdict entered by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b600-11\"> The trial court\u2019s extensive opinion was issued from the bench and evidences thorough consideration of the case before that court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\"> Among these duties was the duty to warn plaintiff purchaser of the dangerous propensities of a slingshot either by personal notification as in the case of a retailer or by printed notice as in the case of the wholesaler and manufacturer. Other courts have uniformly rejected a duty to warn when confronted with products, like the slingshot, the dangerous propensities of which are well known. <em>See, e.g., Pitts v Basile, </em>35 Ill 2d 49; 219 NE2d 472 (1966), and <em>Morris v Toy Box, </em>204 Cal App 2d 468; 22 Cal Rptr 572 (1962). <em>See, also, </em>Prosser, Torts (4th ed), \u00a7 96, p 649.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b603-5\"> Justice Fitzgerald authored the opinion when sitting as a judge of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b603-6\"> <em>See </em>for an analogous holding, which additionally discusses application of Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 390, discussed <em>infra </em>herein, <em>Fredericks v General Motors Corp, </em>48 Mich App 580; 211 NW2d 44 (1973).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b603-7\"> Plaintiff also asserts that <em>Crowther v Ross Chemical &amp; Manufacturing Co, </em>42 Mich App 426; 202 NW2d 577 (1972), is a case in point. This action was brought to recover for the wrongful death of two young girls who were killed by a man who had allegedly been sniffing glue manufactured by defendant. The Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was inappropriate because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">\"It is an issue of fact whether, as plaintiff alleges in his complaint, the practice of glue sniffing was, at this time, sufficiently notorious that defendant knew or should have known this was an alternative use for its product.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">In <em>Crowther, </em>however, summary judgment on the pleadings alone was involved. Here we have a directed verdict granted after plaintiff has presented all his proofs. The thrust of decision in <em>Crowther </em>was that plaintiff be given an opportunity to present proofs. In the present case plaintiff enjoyed such opportunity. <em>Crowther </em>is therefore not of decisional significance to the case before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\"> The talismanic label \"inherently dangerous\u201d attained significance because a finding of \"inherent dangerousness\u201d avoided the privity requirement of contract law subjecting the wholesaler, manufacturer or retailer to liability in tort. Plaintiffs complaint is framed in terms of negligence. The doctrine of \"inherent dangerousness\u201d is not of decisional significance to the case at hand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b606-10\"> The California Court at this point footnotes the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">\"And David prevailed over the Philistine, with a sling and \u00e1 stone, and he struck, and slew the Philistine.
