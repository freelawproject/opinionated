J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGE\">We have been requested to render an advisory opinion on the compliance of the Derezinski-Geerlings Job Development Authority Act with certain provisions of the Michigan Constitution of 1963. The purpose of the legislation (hereinafter PA 301) is stated in \u00a7 2 of MCLA 125.1702, MSA 3.540 (102):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-5\">\"(1) The legislature hereby finds and declares:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">(a) That there is a statewide pressing need for programs to alleviate and prevent conditions of unemployment; to preserve existing jobs and create new jobs to meet the employment demands of population growth; to promote the development of present business enterprises and to meet the growing competition for business enterprises; to revitalize and diversify the Michigan economy in general and achieve the goals of economic growth and full employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-7\">\"(b) That, for the preservation and betterment of the health, safety, and general welfare of the people of Michigan, it is necessary to promote and develop new and adequate water and air pollution control and solid waste disposal equipment for the facilities of business enterprises and public utilities located in this state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-8\">\"(c) That the goals of full employment and maximum economic growth can best be provided by the promotion, attraction, stimulation, retention, rehabilitation, and revitalization of business enterprises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-9\">\"(d) That the present and future health, safety, and general welfare of the people of Michigan require as a public purpose the promotion and development of new and expanded business enterprises, and means to facilitate their compliance with state, national, and local standards for pollution control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-10\">\"(e) That the retention, promotion, diversification and development of industry and commerce require additional means of financing, to help existing business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>enterprises expand more rapidly and to promote the location of additional business enterprises in Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\"(f) That the retention and expansion of existing industry and commerce and the acquiring of new industry and commerce to Michigan requires the availability of energy supplies and that, to this end, known sources of energy in Michigan should be developed to the fullest extent possible consistent with environmental protection and ecological preservation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-6\">\"(2) It is therefore hereby declared to be the policy of the state of Michigan that to promote the health, safety, right to gainful employment, business opportunities, and general welfare of the residents thereof a body corporate and politic to be known as the Michigan job development authority shall be created to carry out this act and shall exist and operate for the public purpose of alleviating and preventing unemployment by the retention, promotion, and development of industrial buildings, including the sites therefor and machinery and equipment including water and air pollution control and solid waste disposal equipment with respect thereto or for use by business enterprises, including the training and/or retraining of business enterprise employees affected by the expansion or reduction of the labor force resulting from labor efficiency improvements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">In brief we find:</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">(1) PA 301 does not violate Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 6 prohibiting state involvement in internal improvements because it provides by law for public internal improvement, an express exception to that constitutional proscription.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-9\">(2) PA 301 does not violate Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 25 which prohibits statutory amendments by reference to title only, because PA 301 does not have the amendatory effect asserted.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">(3) PA 301 does not violate Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 29 prohibiting enactment of special or local acts without a two-thirds vote of each legislative house and a referendum, because it is a general act.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>(4) PA 301 does not violate Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 30 which proscribes legislative appropriations of public funds for private purposes without a two-thirds vote in each legislative house because the contemplated appropriation of public moneys to the capital reserve and loan guarantee funds would be for a public and not a private purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">(5) That PA 301 does not violate Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 15, and 18 because it establishes a public authority to administer a self-liquidating project whose bonds and notes do not evidence a debt of the state requiring compliance with the state borrowing provisions of \u00a7 15, nor does the act provide for a pledge of the state\u2019s credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We have been aided in this undertaking by the office of the Attorney General which has submitted one brief in support of the conclusion of constitutionality and one brief in support of the conclusion of unconstitutionality and by the Greater Detroit Chamber of Commerce which has filed a brief as amicus curiae supporting the conclusion of constitutionality. We are grateful for this assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Article 3</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">Michigan\u2019s first Constitution of 1835 stated that internal improvement should be encouraged and that the legislature had the duty to provide therefor. The large debt incurred by the state for the construction of railroads and canals prompted the ban in the Constitution of 1850 on the state\u2019s being a party to or interested in any work of internal improvement, and from subscribing to or being interested in any company, association or corporation, or loaning its credit in aid of any person, association or corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">These bans were continued in the constitution of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>1908 but repeated amendments were adopted to provide specific exceptions. After the final amendment in 1946, Const 1908, art 10, \u00a7 14 read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-5\">\"The state shall not. be a party to, nor be interested in, any work of internal improvement, nor engage in carrying on any such work, except:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-6\">\"1. In the development, improvement and control of or aiding in the development, improvement and control of public roads, harbors of refuge, water-ways, airways, airports, landing fields and aeronautical facilities;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-7\">\"2. In the development, improvement and control of or aiding in the development, improvement and control of rivers, streams, lakes and water levels, for purposes of drainage, public health, control of flood waters and soil erosion;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-8\">\"3. In reforestation, protection and improvement of lands in the state of Michigan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">\"4. In the expenditure of grants to the state of land or other property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-10\">The debate over continuing this ban occupied much of the time of the delegates to the convention which drafted the Constitution of 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-11\">This ban was included as Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-12\">\"The state shall not be a party to, nor be financially interested in, any work of internal improvement, nor engage in carrying on any such work, except for public internal improvements provided by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">The \"Address to the People\u201d summed up the intended effect of the section:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-14\">\"This is a revision of \u00a7 14, art X of the present constitution deleting detailed language listing exceptions relative to internal improvements in which the state may engage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-15\">\"The new, abbreviated wording makes it clear that the state 'may not be a party to\u2019 nor 'financially inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ested\u2019 in internal improvements other than those of a public nature and by authorization of law.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 3368.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">What is equally clear from the abbreviated wording is that the state is no longer barred from being a party to or interested in any work of internal improvement of a public nature authorized by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In answering the question whether PA 301 ignores this ban we posit that all works contemplated under the act are works of internal improvement, for otherwise there is no constitutional impediment.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Our inquiry must be limited to whether they are works of \"public\u201d or \"non-public\u201d internal improvement for \"public\u201d works are expressly excepted from the ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">We are unaided by definition of these words in the constitution. One of the most helpful discussions we found was Justice Cooley\u2019s exposition on the word \"public\u201d in determining whether an act had a \"public purpose\u201d in <em>People ex rel Detroit &amp; H R Co v Salem Twp Board, </em>20 Mich 452, 475-476 (1870):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-8\">\"I propose first to enquire whether the purpose to be accomplished by the act in question is a <em>public </em>purpose, in the sense implied when burdens are to be imposed under the legislative power over the subject of taxation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-9\">\"I do not understand that the word <em>public, </em>when employed in reference to this power, is to be construed or applied in any narrow or illiberal sense, or in any sense which would preclude the Legislature from taking broad views of State interest, necessity or policy, or from giving those views effect by means of the public revenues. Necessity alone is not the test by which the limits of State authority in this direction are to be defined, but a wise statemanship must look beyond the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>expenditures which are absolutely needful to the continued existence of organized government, and embrace others which may tend to make that government sub-serve the general well-being of society, and advance the present and prospective happiness and prosperity of the people. To erect the public buildings, to compensate the public officers and to discharge the public debts, are not the sole purposes to which the public revenues may be applied, but, on the contrary, considerations of natural equity, gratitude and pharity are never out of place when the general good of the whole people is in question, and may be kept in view in the imposition of the public burdens. The sovereign legislative authority must judge of the force of such considerations, on a general view of the just and proper demands upon the public treasury, and of the ability of the people to provide for all; and when that authority determines that such payments will subserve the public good, the responsibility of the legislator for the correctness of his judgment must be to the people whose representative he is, and upon whom the burdens he imposes must rest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The Legislature has expressed its determination that this program is necessary for the promotion of the public welfare. From this we conclude that any internal improvements anticipated therein are deemed to be public internal improvements. We do not regard the benefits accruing to private interests in this program through ownership or use sufficient to convert the internal improvements into \"non-public\u201d or private internal improvements still under the ban.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">We are satisfied that PA 301 provides for works of public internal improvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Article 4</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">A) It is asserted that \u00a7 21(5) of PA 301 has the effect of amending the Municipal Finance Act and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>consequently violates Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 25, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-5\">\"No law shall be revised, altered or amended by-reference to its title only. The section or sections of the act altered or amended shall be re-enacted and published at length.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">MCLA 131.1 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 5.3188(1) <em>et seq. </em>is known as the Municipal Finance Act and it provides in pertinent section as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\">\"Sec. 2. The following definitions shall apply for the purposes of this act unless the context shall otherwise indicate:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-8\">\"(a) 'Municipality\u2019: Any * * * governmental authority or agency within the state with power to issue any of the obligations authorized or regulated under this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-9\">\"(c) 'Obligation\u2019: A general term for evidences of indebtedness such as bonds, refunding bonds, notes, certificates of indebtedness and other like instruments (except those obligations authorized by Act No. 79 of the Public Acts of 1937) issued by a municipality, which on their face pledge the full faith and credit of the municipality and/or are payable primarily from taxes and/or special assessments.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">Because the bonds contemplated in PA 301 are not \"payable primarily from taxes and/or special assessments\u201d we do not consider the Municipal Finance Act to have any application to act-301 bonds, except as expressly provided in PA 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">PA 301 provides in \u00a721(5), MCLA 125.1721(5); MSA 3.540(121)(5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-12\">\"Bonds or notes issued by an authority shall be approved by the municipal finance commission before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>their issuance but shall not otherwise be subject to Act No. 202 of the Public Acts of 1943, as amended, being sections 131.1 to 138.2 of the Michigan Compiled Laws. Before approving the issuance of the bonds or notes the municipal finance commission shall determine that the amount of the proposed issue is sufficient but not excessive, that the revenue and properties pledged for the payment thereof are sufficient and that the bonds or notes and the proceedings authorizing the same comply with this act and other applicable law, but nothing in this section shall be construed as authorizing the municipal finance commission to substitute its judgment for that of the authority in the authority\u2019s evaluation of the efficacy of the proposed project and its relationship to job development in the state.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">The use of the indefinite article \"an\u201d in the first sentence of this section is somewhat confusing, but we are satisfied it is an error and the reference was meant to be to \"the\u201d authority established by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">We read this section to require the authority to submit its proposed bonds or notes to the Municipal Finance Commission for its approval and determination that the amount of the proposed issue is sufficient but not excessive (for the purpose for which issued) that the revenue and properties pledged for their payment are sufficient and that the bonds or notes and the proceedings authorizing them comply with the job development act and other applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">We regard this section as imposing strictures on the authority to the extent indicated but do not consider it as intended to have or as having the effect of amending the Municipal Finance Act or any other law.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">For this reason we find this section does not violate Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">B) Does PA 301 create a corporation by special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>act in violation of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 29, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">\"The legislature shall pass no local or special act in any case where a general act can be made applicable, and whether a general act can be made applicable shall be a judicial question. No local or special act shall take effect until approved by two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house and by a majority of the electors voting thereon in the district affected. Any act repealing local or special acts shall require only a majority of the members elected to and serving in each house and shall not require submission to the electors of such district.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The history and rationale of this provision, which first appeared in the Constitution of 1908, was set forth by Justice Brooke in <em>Attorney General ex rel Dingeman v Lacy </em>180 Mich 329, 337-338; 146 NW 871 (1914):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\"Considering the history of legislation under the Constitution of 1850, it is apparent that there had grown up a pernicious practice on the part of the legislature in passing local acts. The practice was bad in two very important particulars. In the first place, much of the legislation thus enacted constituted a direct and unwarranted interference in purely local affairs and an invasion of the principles of local self-government. In the second place, such legislation affecting as it did certain limited localities in the State, the senators and representatives from unaffected districts were usually complaisant, and agreed to its enactment without the exercise of that intelligence and judgment which all legislation is entitled to receive from all the members of the legislature. This course led to many abuses (principally in amendments to city charters), some of which found their way into the courts, and were there redressed so far as the Constitution then in force would permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">\"With these evils in mind, the Constitution of 1909 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>[sic] </em>was formulated and adopted by the people. From a reading of the provisions above quoted and others of a similar character, it is, we think, entirely clear that it was the settled purpose of the framers of the new instrument and of the people who adopted it to forever insure to the people the right to control their affairs purely local, and to secure for all general legislation grave attention and the application of the collective wisdom of the legislators.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The retention of it in the Constitution of 1963 followed this explanation by the committee chairman:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">\"Mr. Hoxie, chairman of the committee on legislative powers, submits the following reasons in support of Committee Proposal 119:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-7\">\"The committee recommends the retention of this section first found in the 1908 constitution. The purpose of the section, along with the home rule provision, is to lift the burden from the legislature of passing private and local legislation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\"The only changes recommended are to clear up ambiguous language and to remove a date, now unimportant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-9\">\"The requirement of a 2/3 vote of both houses and a majority vote in the area affected protects localities against arbitrary action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-10\">\"By allowing a majority of the legislature to repeal existing local laws, uniformity will be easier to obtain.\u201d 2 Official Record, Constitutional Convention 1961, p 2415.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-11\">From the foregoing and from a careful reading of \u00a7 29 we are convinced that this section properly has application only to legislative action which is limited to some geographical area.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-12\">We do not read PA 301 as so limited and accordingly find in it no violation of Const 1963, art 4, \u00a729.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>C) Does the appropriation of public funds as authorized in \u00a7\u00a7 31 to 48 of PA 301 require the assent of two-thirds of the Legislature as provided in Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 30 which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">\"The assent of two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house of the legislature shall be required for the appropriation of public money or property for local or private purposes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The Legislature which adopted PA 301 has purported to authorize some subsequent Legislature to appropriate money for the loan guarantee funds and capital reserve funds of the Job Development Authority. This \"authorization\u201d is hortative only and accordingly can neither violate Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 30 nor bind some future Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">However, being of the view that these bonds are issued for a public purpose by a public authority, we would not regard appropriations to the funds for this repayment as appropriations for a private or local purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Article 9</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">The Job Development Authority created by PA 301 is authorized to raise revenue through the issuance of its bonds or notes. From these revenues, the authority is authorized to extend loans directly to, or to guarantee loans made by private lenders to business enterprises for financing projects defined in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">We are asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">(1) if the bonds or notes issued pursuant to the act</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">(a) are evidence of state indebtedness proscribed by Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 12 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>\"No evidence of state indebtedness shall be issued except for debts authorized pursuant to this constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">(b) require compliance with Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 15 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">\"The state may borrow money for specific purposes in amounts as may be provided by acts of the legislature adopted by a vote of two-thirds of the members elected to and serving in each house, and approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon at any general election. The question submitted to the electors shall state the amount to be borrowed, the specific purpose to which the funds shall be devoted, and the method of repayment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">(2) We are also asked if the contemplated loans or guarantees of loans by the authority is a violation of Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 18 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">\"The credit of the state shall not be granted to, nor in aid of any person, association or corporation, public or private, except as authorized in this constitution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">(l)(a) The act requires that the individual bonds and notes carry language to this effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-9\">\"The state shall not be liable on notes or bonds of the authority nor shall the notes or bonds be considered a debt of the state. The notes and bonds shall contain on the face thereof a statement indicating this fact.\u201d MCLA 125.1727; MSA 3.540(127).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">Thus these notes or bonds will not purport to be evidence of a state debt. They will not purport to pledge the state\u2019s credit. They will, in fact, purport to be the debt and pledge of credit of the Job Development Authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Unless we are prepared to say that the authority is a sham or subterfuge employed by the state to avoid this constitutional ban and is therefore in legal effect the state itself, we have no reason to blink at the clear terms of the instruments.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We are satisfied that the authority, while an instrumentality of the state, is a legitimate legal entity apart from the state and accordingly hold that its notes and bonds will not be evidence of state debt contrary to Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">(l)(b) We are also satisfied that the bonds or notes contemplated in PA 301 are revenue bonds or notes \u2014 payable from the revenues generated by the projects intended to be financed thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">We held in <em>Schureman v State Highway Commission, </em>377 Mich 609; 141 NW2d 62 (1966), that Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 15 does not apply to revenue bonds. That decision controls here unless it be said that the provision in PA 301 for permissive appropriations to the capital reserve and loan guarantee funds converts these bonds or notes into something other than revenue bonds or notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">We are of the opinion that neither the provision for permissive appropriation in PA 301 nor some future actual appropriation would alter the status of these as revenue bonds or notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The suggestion is made that provision for the possibility of such future appropriation gives rise to a \"moral obligation\u201d in the Legislature to make the appropriations, and that \"as a matter of policy\u201d the state could not refuse to do so, or indeed to pay the bonds or notes if the authority default.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">We are keenly aware of that possibility. But we deal with legal obligations. The Constitution confides such \"policy\u201d and \"moral\u201d determinations to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">We see no legal obligation on the part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>state on account of these bonds or notes. We regard them as true revenue bonds or notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">(2) As we have said, we consider that the Job Development Authority is a legal entity separate from the State of Michigan.

If there is a default, bondholders have no complaint if the state does not make up the deficiency. There is no constraint on the state to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Underlying the proponents\u2019 argument is the assumption, unsupported by any evidence of which we have been made aware, that the obligations of the authority can be underwritten and marketed to the public and that its guarantees will be accepted by the financial community solely on the strength of revenue projections of indeterminate and perhaps problematic projects. Also underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>their argument is the assumption that a failure of the Legislature to respond affirmatively to a certification from the chairman of the authority that a make-up appropriation is necessary to prevent a default would not significantly affect the market for Michigan securities and, therefore, the Legislature truly has discretion to respond affirmatively or negatively. The validity of those assumptions is not a question of constitutional law or of law at all, but a question of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In the instant matter, in contrast with the earlier opinions on hospital bonds<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> and public housing bonds,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> there is no basis for indulging assumptions regarding the marketability of these bonds or the willingness of financial institutions to accept loan guarantees independent of any commitment of the state\u2019s power of taxation.

At present there are approximately 1-1/2 billion dollars of outstanding state obligations, and an additional 7-1/2 billions in obligations of school districts and municipalities and other local units of government. If it were to appear that a failure of the Legislature to make up deficiencies with appropriations to the capital reserve or loan guarantee funds would expose the holders of such securities to financial loss, would have an adverse effect on the market for Michigan securities, and would make it more difficult and expensive to refinance outstanding obligations and market securities in the future, what is in form discretionary could in substance be an effective commitment. By establishing the authority and authorizing bonds, notes and loan guarantees, the Legislature would then have set in motion forces which oblige future Legislatures to provide funds to make up deficiencies under the constraint of adverse implications for the holders of state obligations and consequent impairment of the borrowing capacity of the state and its subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Such constraints on future Legislatures and the people would not create a moral obligation only.

I do so principally because of the interaction of two factors. The first factor is that the Job Development Authority Act deals with bond risks that are different from the secure risks of traditional revenue bonds that the bond buyer can rely on, such as the Blue Water Bridge, the Mackinac Bridge, hospitals, public housing, City-County Building, Detroit, etc., in each of which there was either a firm revenue record or sound engineering revenue projections. The second factor is the very strong emphasis in the act that the Legislature may in the future appropriate to maintain the capital reserve fund at a level to meet bond payments. 1975 PA 301, \u00a7\u00a7 31-48 and 61.
