Despite this small dereliction, however, the all-or-nothing doctrine of contributory negligence was applied below, and plaintiff was denied any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">This unfortunate result raises once again, as in <em>Vanderah v Olah, </em>387 Mich 643; 199 NW2d 449 (1972), the question of whether a more equitable approach to the problem of the negligent plaintiff and the negligent defendant might be in the apportionment of damages commensurate with the degree of fault. This concept underlies the doctrine of comparative negligence, and, in the interest of justice, it is the doctrine we adopt today.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">We would hold therefore that the doctrine of contributory negligence is replaced in this jurisdiction by comparative negligence, and will be applied to all cases filed after the date of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">As to the case before us, we find that remand to the circuit court for retrial is necessary because of confusing and erroneous jury instructions on the question of proximate cause. Therefore, if the matter arises, comparative negligence shall be applied to this case at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-9\">I \u2014 Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b731-10\">An automobile accident at the intersection of Hill and Main Streets in Ann Arbor on August 16, 1971 precipitated this negligence action.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-11\">Plaintiff Christine Kirby, then a high-school student, was a passenger in a small MG automobile owned by her mother and driven by her friend Deborah Cooper. The MG proceeded south on Main and stopped under an overhead traffic light at the intersection of Hill and Main. The light was green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>at the time, and Cooper was signaling for a left turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">A two-ton Buick driven by defendant Ellis Larson proceeded north on Main Street in the inside lane. Another vehicle, in which witness Robert Wright was a passenger, was traveling in the curbside lane in the same direction as Larson. Wright testified that his car stopped at the intersection because the traffic signal was turning amber.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Cooper and Kirby saw the Wright vehicle stop. They both saw defendant\u2019s car about three or four lengths back from the intersection and anticipated that it, too, would stop. Cooper began to complete her left turn. Defendant\u2019s vehicle, however, traveling at 25-30 miles per hour, went past Wright\u2019s stopped car, and proceeded into the intersection at the same time as the Cooper vehicle was going through it.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Buick struck the MG in the right rear, causing the car to spin around 180 degrees. Christine Kirby was flung over the hood of the car, landing on her face and suffering a back sprain, dislocated knees, severe facial lacerations and the loss of four front teeth with the possibility of loss of other teeth in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">Cooper testified she was halfway through the intersection when she was struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">Defendant testified that he did not see the light change from green to any other color, and that he did not observe any movement on the part of the MG until he approached the intersection. He did say, however, that the light had turned yellow before he got to the white line at the intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">Although the police officer at the scene testified he could not identify skid marks from defendant\u2019s vehicle, defendant testified he did point out the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>marks indicating he had tried to stop. He also said he told the police officers the accident was not his fault because he felt he could have made it through the yellow light. However, a summons was issued to defendant for violation of the caution signal, pursuant to Ann Arbor ordinances, \u00a7 10.26. No summons was issued to Cooper.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">The court held that evidence of the traffic summons was inadmissible. It did, however, permit evidence of past traffic convictions to reach the jury, but after receiving this favorable ruling, defense counsel never presented testimony on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Defendant contended that plaintiff Kirby had urged Cooper to make the turn when she did.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff presented two apparently different versions of what actually happened. At trial, she insisted that she said nothing until <em>after </em>Cooper was already cranking the wheel to turn. Her testimony at the deposition, however, was that she told Cooper to turn <em>before </em>the turn had begun. She felt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>there was no contradiction, because she said she urged her friend to turn because it was a crowded intersection, they were blocking traffic and she saw defendant was not stopping.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Relevant to the issues before this Court, the jury was instructed that the verdict should be for the plaintiff if she was injured, if defendant was negligent, and if such negligence was the proximate cause of her injuries, unless plaintiff herself was negligent and such negligence proximately contributed to her injuries. They were instructed that if they found that defendant violated an Ann Arbor ordinance regulating vehicular traffic, such violation would be evidence of negligence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury was also instructed on the same standard of care should they find that plaintiff violated a traffic ordinance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">The jury was instructed to disregard anything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>relative to the issuance of a traffic summons or ticket, and was instructed as follows on the possibility of plaintiffs contributory negligence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">\"I further instruct you the jury while any negligence by the operator of the plaintiff vehicle, Debra <em>[sic] </em>Cooper is not to be imputed to her passenger, the plaintiff, Christine Kirby even though a passenger can be guilty of negligence in her own right in the operation of the vehicle in which she is riding; and if you find that Debra <em>[sic] </em>Cooper acted solely or primarily on the basis of what the passenger Christine Kirby said and that passenger Christine Kirby was aware or should have been aware of the existing dangerous situation then if you find that Christine Kirby was personally and contributorily negligent and such negligence was a proximate cause of the injury and damages alleged by her and in that event Christine Kirby cannot recover from the defendant and your verdict therefore would be for the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Following completion of the instructions, and prior to giving counsel an opportunity to state objections to the instructions, the jury was ordered to begin deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">Plaintiffs counsel objected to that procedure, and to the injection of contributory negligence into the case, claiming that the negligence of the driver could not be imputed to a passenger. Further, he argued, his client could not be negligent on her own because she had no right of control of the automobile and she did not interfere with the driver in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">He also objected to the court\u2019s instructing that the jury was to determine whether the negligence of the defendant was <em>the </em>proximate cause of plaintiffs injuries. The proper statement of law, he maintained, was that defendant\u2019s negligence must be <em>a </em>proximate cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>He also objected to the instruction ordering the jury not to consider the issuance of a traffic ticket, noting that defendant brought that out himself on direct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">All objections were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">After the jury began deliberating, they asked the court for additional help:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-7\"><em>\"The Court: </em>This is a continuation of Chris Kirby against Larson. I have two requested questions from the jury. One, if the driver of plaintiff\u2019s car was proximate<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cause of the accident, but defendant was also negligent, would jury be required to find for the defendant?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b736-8\">\"I can\u2019t answer that question. There are answers in the instructions I have given you. On the city ordinances and state law, I have given them twice so you have to do the best you can on the instructions that I have given you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">The jury also asked for a definition of \"preponderance, that is when one side greatly outweighs the other\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-10\">The jury found for defendant. The Court of Appeals affirmed, in a brief memorandum opinion citing the \"harmless error rule\u201d, GCR 1963, 529.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal December 23, 1974. 393 Mich 772 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-11\">II \u2014 Admissibility of Evidence of a Traffic Ticket</p>\n<p id=\"b736-12\">The trial court refused to admit, over objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>by plaintiffs, evidence of and closing argument about issuance of a traffic summons by the officer on the scene to defendant for disregarding a caution signal. The trial judge also excluded evidence of the bench trial conviction on the ticket because it \"would not be material to this case\u201d. However, citing <em>Sting v Davis, </em>384 Mich 608; 185 NW2d 360 (1971), the judge permitted cross-examination on other traffic convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">MCLA 257.731; MSA 9.2431 requires:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\"No evidence of the conviction of any person for any violation of this chapter or of a local ordinance pertaining to the use of motor vehicles shall be admissible in any court in any civil action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">GCR 1963, 607, however, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-7\">\"During the trial of civil actions the rules of evidence approved in <em>Van Goosen v Barlum, </em>214 Mich 595 [183 NW 8 (1921)]; <em>Zimmerman v Goldberg, </em>277 Mich 134 [268 NW 837 (1936)]; <em>Socony Vacuum Oil Co v Marvin, </em>313 Mich 528 [21 NW2d 841 (1946)]; <em>Cebulak v Lewis, </em>320 Mich 710 [32 NW2d 21 (1948)], and re-enacted by PA 1961, No. 236, \u00a7 600.2158, shall prevail, anything in section 731 of the Michigan vehicle code (CLS 1961, \u00a7 257.731) to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-8\"><em>Zimmerman v Goldberg </em>permitted defendant\u2019s guilty plea to be used as substantive evidence in a subsequent negligence trial based on the same accident. <em>Socony Vacuum Oil Co v Marvin </em>and <em>Cebulak v Lewis </em>permitted evidence of payment of a fine for the same purpose. Thus, GCR 1963, 607 in effect contradicts MCLA 257.731; MSA 9.2431. <em>Van Goosen v Barlum </em>permitted interrogation concerning arrests and convictions on matters not arising from the facts of the instant negligence case.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Our Court\u2019s rule-making power is constitutionally supreme in matters of practice and procedure, Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5. Thus, since admissibility of a traffic ticket is an evidentiary question, the court rule supersedes the statute. As suggested in 3 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 404, \"Because no clear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> section 731 should be construed simply as a statutory rule of practice, validly superseded by Rule 607 to the extent applicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">However, following adoption of GCR 1963, 607, we decided <em>Wheelock v Eyl, </em>393 Mich 74, 78-79; 223 NW2d 276 (1974)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>. In that case we reasoned that because civil and criminal cases involve different considerations and satisfy different policies, even if the same conduct is involved,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-6\">\"a criminal conviction after trial, or plea, or payment of a fine is not admissible as substantive evidence of conduct at issue in a civil case arising out of the same occurrence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\"><em>Wheelock, </em>however, did not involve the question of whether issuance, as opposed to conviction, of a traffic ticket could be considered.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Bolser v Davis, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>62 Mich App 731, 733; 233 NW2d 845 (1975). That issue was considered in <em>Ilins v Burns, </em>388 Mich 504; 201 NW2d 624 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">In <em>Ilins, </em>defendant responded to her counsel\u2019s questions and told the court no traffic ticket was issued. Plaintiff counsel\u2019s motion for a mistrial was denied. Defense counsel asked the police officer the same question, but the officer did not answer. Neither party, under instructions from the court, mentioned the subject in argument, and the court cautioned the jury not to consider the matter in their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Nevertheless, we found prejudicial error because \"[t]he question of the issuance of a traffic ticket was indelibly registered on the minds of the jurors\u201d. 388 Mich 511-512.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-6\">\"In this case, the questioning of defendant and of the police officer with regard to the issuance or nonissuance of a ticket, of necessity, went to the judgment of the police officer and inescapably placed before the jury, by inference, the opinion of the police officer as to who was responsible for the accident. Once it was shown that defendant did not receive a ticket, the opinion of the police officer assessing her responsibility for the accident would be before the jury as clearly as if he had stated such opinion in so many words.\u201d 388 Mich 510.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Thus, the rule today is that evidence of the <em>issuance </em>of a ticket may not be admitted. We do not, however, address ourselves to the conclusion in <em>Dudek v Popp, </em>373 Mich 300, 308-309; 129 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>NW2d 393 (1964), where, because the police officer testified as an expert on the cause of the accident, traffic ticket evidence was admissible in order to indicate the basis of the officer\u2019s expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Since <em>Wheelock </em>and <em>Ilins </em>involved matters of substantive evidence, this leaves us with the question of whether an individual in a civil case may be impeached with evidence of other traffic convictions. GCR 1963, 607 permits this, by reference to <em>Van Goosen v Barlum, </em>214 Mich 595, 599; 183 NW 8 (1921), in which we held it appropriate to attempt to impeach defendant\u2019s credibility by use of previous driving convictions. See also MCLA 600.2158; MSA 27A.2158;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Sting v Davis, </em>384 Mich 608; 185 NW2d 360 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">In <em>People v Renno, </em>392 Mich 45, 55; 219 NW2d 422 (1974), this Court held that municipal ordinance or misdemeanor convictions may not be used for impeachment purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">The proposed Michigan Rules of Evidence would provide that the credibility of a witness may not be impeached by evidence that he was convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for one year or less unless the crime involved dishonesty or false statement. MRE 609(a)(2). This rule would modify <em>Renno, Sting, </em>and GCR 1963, 607. It appears that before this case is likely to be retried this Court will act comprehensively regarding the proposed Michigan Rules of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Ill \u2014 The Proximate Cause Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">The trial court gave varying instructions to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>jury concerning the effect of violation of an Ann Arbor traffic ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">Thus, at one point, the jury was instructed concerning violation of one ordinance:<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\"If you find that the defendant was negligent you must then decide that such negligence was <em>the proximate cause </em>of the injury to the plaintiff.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Concerning another ordinance,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the instruction was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-7\">\"If you find that the defendant was negligent, you must then decide whether such negligence was <em>the proximate cause </em>of the injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-8\">\"If you find no negligence by the defendant or that any negligence was not <em>a proximate cause </em>of the injuries to the plaintiff, then you must find for the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Still another instruction<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-10\">\"If you find the defendant was negligent you must then decide whether such negligence was <em>a proximate cause </em>of the injury to the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-11\">\"If you find no negligence by the defendant, or that any negligence was not <em>the proximate cause </em>of the injuries to the plaintiff, then you must find for the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>A different instruction appeared in the charge on the ordinance concerning duties on turning.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\"If you find that the operator of the plaintiff vehicle was negligent you must then decide whether such negligence was <em>the sole proximate cause </em>of the accident. If it was, and if you find no negligence by the defendant which was <em>a proximate cause </em>of the accident then your verdict would be for the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">As for the effect of the violation of still another ordinance,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the judge instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\"If you find that the defendant was negligent you must then decide whether such negligence was <em>a proximate cause </em>of the injury to the plaintiff. If you find no negligence by the defendant or that any negligence was not <em>the proximate cause </em>of the injuries to the plaintiff then you must find for the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">The same type of mixture of instructing on <em>\"the </em>proximate cause\u201d and <em>\"a </em>proximate cause\u201d occurred in other parts of the court\u2019s instructions. Thus, when explaining the role of contributory negligence, the jury was told such negligence must be <em>\u201da proximate cause\u201d, </em>and that defendant had the burden of proof to show that plaintiff\u2019s negligence was \"a <em>proximate contributing cause\u201d, </em>but that the verdict would be for plaintiff if defendant\u2019s negligence was <em>\"the proximate cause\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">The jury was instructed that their verdict would be for the defendant if defendant\u2019s negligence was not \"a <em>proximate contributing cause\u201d </em>of the injuries. (Emphasis added in all above quotations.)</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">At the conclusion of the instructions, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>asked if the parties were satisfied, but then proceeded to have the jury begin deliberations before the attorneys made their objections. Plaintiffs counsel objected to that procedure, and, objected as well to the use of the term <em>\"the </em>proximate cause\u201d instead of <em>\u201da </em>proximate cause\u201d. Defense counsel had no objections. The plaintiffs protests to the jury deliberating before objections and to the proximate cause instruction were not directly responded to, but other objections were overruled.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">After they began meeting, the jury appeared confused and requested further instructions. Clarification was requested \"as to the ordinance of law pertaining to the driver\u2019s negligence that would be plaintiffs car <em>[sic] how </em>that would affect the case; the city ordinance in regard to a left turn\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">In response, the judge repeated the instructions given previously concerning the ordinances, including the differing standards of \"a\u201d and \"the\u201d proximate cause. Plaintiffs counsel repeated his objections. Once again, the court did not directly respond to this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The jury requested further help. According to the judge, one of the questions was \"if the driver of plaintiffs car was<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> proximate cause of the accident, but defendant was also negligent, would jury be required to find for the defendant?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">The judge replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\"I can\u2019t answer that question. There are answers in the instructions I have given you. On the city ordinances and state law, I have given them twice so you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>have to do the best you can on the instructions that I have given you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Error was committed in this portion of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">GCR 1963, 516.2 requires that counsel object to instructions \"before the jury retires to consider the verdict\u201d. The usual thrust of the rule is to require timely objections by counsel. However, the procedure is also designed to permit the judge, upon being presented with an error properly specified with supporting grounds, to correct or modify the questioned instructions before the jury retires. See discussion, 2 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), Rule 516, pp 564-567. Thus, each party\u2019s right to have the theory of the case explained to the jury in an orderly manner, with equal weight to the theory of each party, is carried out. <em>Id, </em>p 562. \"Only if such procedure is followed by court and counsel can the rights of all parties properly be protected and objections to erroneous jury instructions assuredly be saved for appellate review.\u201d <em>Hunt v Deming, </em>375 Mich 581, 585; 134 NW2d 662 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Thus, the judge in the case at bar erred when he permitted the jury to begin deliberations prior to hearing counsel\u2019s objections. Moreover, this was not harmless error, since for whatever reason, the judge erred in neither responding to the objections nor correcting his charge. Therefore, while this is not a case where counsel was not given an opportunity to state objections on the record, <em>Herndon v Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society, </em>1 Mich App 141, 144; 134 NW2d 825 (1965); <em>Wells v Prudential Insurance Co of America, </em>3 Mich App 220, 229; 142 NW2d 57 (1966), and the objections were clearly and well stated for the benefit, no doubt, of a reviewing court, they were not responded to by the trial court. Thus, we have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>way of knowing whether they were in fact fairly considered by that court. Further, improper instructions pertaining to a vital issue in the case were in fact given.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">It is clear that within the context of this case, the issue of proximate cause was crucial. The jury apparently thought so, and apparently was sufficiently confused or concerned about the concept that it asked for additional help twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Both the Standard Jury Instructions<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and our case law make it clear that the correct instruction is \"a proximate cause\u201d. We have specifically disapproved instructing that defendant\u2019s negligence must be <em>the </em>proximate cause, because such a charge is tantamount to an instruction that plaintiff cannot recover unless defendant\u2019s negligence is the sole proximate cause of an accident, an interpretation completely ignoring the possibility that there may be two proximate causes. <em>Sedorchuk v Weeder, </em>311 Mich 6, 10-11; 18 NW2d 397 (1945); <em>Barringer v Arnold, </em>358 Mich 594, 599-600; 101 NW2d 365 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Unquestionably, the instructions concerning <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>proximate cause were erroneous. It is equally true that the instructions concerning <em>a </em>proximate cause were correct. We, of course, review instructions as a whole in order to ascertain their adequacy. <em>Shreve v Leavitt, </em>51 Mich App 235, 240-241; 214 NW2d 739 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">We find that, given the facts in this case, the correct disposition was that set forth in <em>Iwrey v Fowler, </em>367 Mich 311, 314-316; 116 NW2d 722 (1962):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">\"The effect of inconsistent or contradictory statements, relating to a material issue, in instructions to the jury by the trial judge has been considered in a number of decisions of this Court. In <em>In re Bailey\u2019s Estate, </em>186 Mich 677, 690 [153 NW 39 (1915)], the trial judge, as it was claimed, made conflicting statements to the jury in a will contest with reference to the burden of proof relating to undue influence. In reversing the case and granting a new trial, it was said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\" 'When conflicting charges are given, one of which is erroneous, it is to be presumed that the jury may have followed that which was erroneous. <em>Grand Rapids &amp; IR Co v Monroe, </em>47 Mich 152, 154 [1881]; <em>Madill v Currie, </em>168 Mich 546, 560 [134 NW 1004 (1912)].\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\" * * * In <em>Pettersch v Grand Rapids Gas Light Co, </em>245 Mich 277, 281 (28 NCCA 44) [222 NW 123 (1928)], this Court quoted with approval the general rule on the subject of contradictory instructions as stated in 14 RCL, Instructions, \u00a7 45, pp 777, 778:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-9\">\" ' \"Where instructions give to the jury contradictory and conflicting rules for their guidance, which are unexplained, and following either of which would or might lead to different results, then the instructions are inherently defective and erroneous. And that is true though one of the instructions correctly states the law as applicable to the facts of the case. The reason for this is that where the instructions on a material point <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>are contradictory, it is impossible for the jury to decide which should prevail, and it is equally impossible, after the verdict, to know that the jury was not influenced by that instruction which was erroneous, as the one or the other must necessarily be where the two are repugnant. A further reason is that conflicting and contradictory instructions in effect leave the jury without instructions to guide them with reference to the law arising upon the evidence in the cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\" 'See, also, <em>Herzberg v Knight, 289 </em>Mich 29 [286 NW 145 (1939)]; <em>Socony Vacuum Oil Co v Marvin, </em>313 Mich 528 [21 NW2d 841 (1946)]. It cannot be said in the instant case that the jury did not follow the erroneous instructions. It must be held, in consequence, that the giving of such instructions constituted prejudicial error.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\"We think that the rule applied in the decisions above cited must be applied in the case at bar.

The jury further demonstrated it was confused, but the apparently troublesome instructions were not changed. While it is true that the instructions might have been interpreted to mean <em>a </em>proximate cause, it is also equally true that the jury might have contemplated otherwise. In the presence of the unprovable we cannot surmise. We must reverse. See, <em>e.g., Klenke v Russell, </em>9 Mich App 409, 415; 157 NW2d 428 (1968); <em>Shreve v Leavitt, </em>51 Mich App 235, 240; 214 NW2d 739 (1974) (\"At a number of * * * points in his instructions to the jury, the trial court * * * interchanged the words 'a\u2019 and 'the\u2019 when referring to the question of proximate cause\u201d.). Therefore, a new trial must be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>IV \u2014 Imputed Negligence \u2014 or Contributory Negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Plaintiffs counsel consistently argued that his client was not contributorily negligent and that the court was improperly imputing the negligence of the driver of the car, <em>i.e. </em>Deborah Cooper, to Christine Kirby. In <em>Bricker v Green, </em>313 Mich 218, 236; 21 NW2d 105 (1946), we overturned the rule of imputed negligence first announced in <em>Lake Shore &amp; MSR Co v Miller, 25 </em>Mich 274 (1872):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-6\">\"solely on the ground that the injured person was a voluntary, gratuitous passenger in an automobile, the driver of which was guilty of negligence which was a contributing proximate cause of an accident and injury to such passenger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">\"Our holding herein should not be construed as excluding under appropriate circumstances the defense of contributory negligence on the part of the passenger, if relative to the cause of the accident the passenger failed to exercise such reasonable care and caution as he should have exercised under the circumstances.\u201d 313 Mich 235.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Thus, while the driver\u2019s contributory negligence may not be attributed to plaintiff passenger, the passenger may be contributorily negligent because of her own action or inaction. See <em>Vanderah v Olah, </em>387 Mich 643; 199 NW2d 449 (1972) (passenger knowingly entrusted herself to a drunk driver). The question of plaintiffs contributory negligence is, of course, one of fact. <em>Mitchell v DeVitt, </em>313 Mich 428, 431; 21 NW2d 111 (1946). Thus, the failure to warn of a danger of which passenger knows and of which he or she has every reason to believe driver is unaware may be contributory negligence. 2 Restatement, Torts 2d, \u00a7 315, p 123. This requires, however, that the driver be negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>gent, that this negligence be a legally contributing cause of the harm, that the plaintiff-passenger be able to control the driver,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and that exceptional circumstances exist which require the passenger to keep a lookout.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Restatement also notes that in ascertaining the duty to warn, \"allowance must be made for the possibility that by interfering the plaintiff will increase rather than diminish the danger\u201d. 2 Restatement, Torts 2d, \u00a7 495, p 557.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">Plaintiff\u2019s only action which could be construed as contributory negligence was her urging the driver to turn. See Notice of Affirmative Defense. If a failure to warn can be construed as negligence, is the same true of the converse? Can warning a driver be construed as negligence? The question, then, becomes in this case, did the fact of plaintiff\u2019s telling the driver to turn amount to contributory negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">We agree with defendant that the issue so framed is not one of imputed negligence. There may not only be in specific circumstances a duty to warn, there may as well be instances where a warning may itself create danger. As we said in <em>Sherman v Korff, </em>353 Mich 387, 395; 91 NW2d 485 (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b749-6\">\"[W]hat control or right of control has a passenger, even though he may be a co-owner, as the car speeds down the highway, driven by the other co-owner? Any attempted exercise of the right of control by wrestling the wheel from the driver would be foolhardy. Equally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>menacing to the driver\u2019s' efficient operation of the machine are raucous reproaches, strident denunciations, or even persistent unctuous admonitions from the back seat. 'Generally,\u2019 it was well put in a Federal case, 'it is the duty of the passenger to sit still and say nothing. It is his duty, because any other course is fraught with danger. Interference, by laying hold of an operating lever, or by exclamation, or even by direction or inquiry, is generally to be depreciated; in the long run, the greater safety lies in letting the driver alone.\u2019 <em>Southern Pacific Co v Wright, </em>248 F 261,264 [CA 9,1918].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">The case at bar is not the typical \"back seat driver\u201d situation where the passenger clearly interferes with the safe functioning of the automobile. It is a closer question than that, and originally, plaintiff might have been negligent if she had failed to warn the driver to complete her turn as she observed the other vehicle bearing down on them. Arguably, too, plaintiff\u2019s importunities had no effect on the driver, and she did what she was going to do in the first place anyway. But no one asked her that.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In any event, we are not going to second-guess the jury on the question of contributory negligence, for this conclusion, while arguable, is supportable by the record. Further, since this cause is to be retried, it is possible that a better record will be developed in which the driver\u2019s actions and motivations will be clarified.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">V \u2014 Comparative Negligence as an Issue in This Case</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">This case raises still another issue, one of substantial import to our jurisprudence. Because we are remanding for retrial, and because the issue may well arise then, in the interest of judicial economy, we should consider it at this juncture.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The negligence of plaintiff in this case was apparently so slight, there was even a question whether she was indeed negligent at all. However, she having been adjudged negligent, the doctrine of contributory negligence was triggered, and plaintiff thereby recovered nothing, however deserving she might otherwise have been, and however greater the negligence of defendant might have been.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">Thus, the facts of this case directly raise the issue to which we said, in <em>Vanderah v Olah, </em>387 Mich 643, 654; 199 NW2d 449 (1972) (opinion of Williams, J.), we would return. Because this case constitutes a sufficient instance where the application of contributory negligence causes such substantial injustice, we must invoke the notice we gave in <em>Vanderah </em>\"to remand a similar future case under a doctrine of comparative negligence\u201d (italics removed).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>It is true that plaintiff argued that she was not negligent in this case, and by so doing was foreclosed from arguing comparative negligence. However, under the doctrine of contributory negligence as it applied at the time of trial, she had no other choice. To announce she was contributorily negligent would have been tantamount to announcing she acknowledged she could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Clearly, a trial court was not the place to introduce the doctrine of comparative negligence to the jurisprudence of our state, nor was the Court of Appeals. This is a matter which is clearly within the competence of this Court only. Therefore,. we will not penalize plaintiff for not indulging in exercises in futility and for not possessing sufficient prescience to know we would consider applying the doctrine of comparative negligence to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Plaintiff, further, although strictly denying any contributory negligence as defined in <em>Vanderah, </em>indicated that if there were any such negligence \"Justice Williams also gave notice that he would invoke the doctrine of comparative negligence in cases of a like kind in the future\u201d. (Plaintiffs\u2019 Brief, p 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Further, we have already had the benefit of extensive legal argument on the issue of comparative negligence in the case of <em>Parsonson v Construction Equipment Co, </em>386 Mich 61, 79 <em>et seq.; </em>191 NW2d 465 (1971). There we did not reach the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>issue because we found that plaintiffs theory of defendant\u2019s negligence was at best conjecture. Such is not the case here, and we will therefore proceed with our consideration of the legal issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">VI \u2014 Contributory Negligence in Michigan</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The beginning of contributory negligence is generally attributed to <em>Butterfield v Forrester, </em>11 East 60; 103 Eng Rep 926 (1809). In that case, defendant had put a pole across a highway and plaintiff, \"riding violently\u201d as he left a tavern in the early evening, was injured when his horse fell over the pole. He might not have been so injured had he been riding more carefully. As expressed by Lord Ellenborough, the rule was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">\"One person being in fault will not dispense with another\u2019s using ordinary care for himself. Two things must concur to support this action, an obstruction in the road by the fault of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care to avoid it on the part of the plaintiff.\u201d 103 Eng Rep 927, quoted in Juenger, <em>Brief for Negligence Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan in Support of Comparative Negligence as Amicus Curiae, </em>Parsonson v Construction Equipment Co, 18 Wayne L Rev 3, 9 (1972).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Thus, the doctrine, although hotly defended and closely espoused is not \"of great antiquity or dignity\u201d. <em>Sun Oil Co v Seamon, </em>349 Mich 387, 394, 397-398; 84 NW2d 840 (1957) (opinion of Talbot Smith, J.). No explanation was apparently offered in <em>Butterfield, </em>although justifications have been since applied. As Justice Talbot Smith so brilliantly expressed in his opinion in <em>Seamon, </em>perhaps the most widely-accepted rationale for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>doctrine\u2019s expression and correspondingly warm reception was the Industrial Revolution.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The first American case to adopt the doctrine is generally considered to be <em>Smith v Smith, </em>19 Mass 621; 2 Pick 662 (1825), cited in 18 Wayne L Rev 9, with recovery denied to a plaintiff whose horse and wagon had hit a wood pile projecting into a public road. The concept appeared in our own state\u2019s jurisprudence as early as 1851, with our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Court saying, in denying recovery to the plaintiff whose animals grazed on the railroad right of way,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">\"It is a well settled principle of law, that where an injury, of which a plaintiff complains, has resulted from the fault or negligence of himself, or where it has resulted from the fault or negligence of both parties, without any intentional wrong on the part of the defendant, an action cannot be maintained.\u201d <em>Williams v Michigan CR Co, </em>2 Mich 259, 265 (1851),</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">citing no Michigan cases in support.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">However, at least one early Michigan decision, although accepting the principle of contributory negligence as settled, did not do so uncritically. Thus, in <em>Lake Shore &amp; M S R Co v Miller, </em>25 Mich 274, 277 (1872), Chief Justice Christiancy criticized the rule\u2019s application:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AN7\">\"This rule, it is true, often, and perhaps generally, fails to produce justice; and, upon abstract principles of right and wrong, may be said to be frequently unjust in its operation. Justice might seem to require that each should bear the loss in the proportion they had respectively contributed to the injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-10\">However, we declined the invitation we ourselves raised to alter matters, because of what we considered to be the impossibility of ascertaining the proportion of injury attributable to each party, 25 Mich 277, and because we felt that since this rule was settled in our state, and in most of the others, we were not at liberty to revise it. 25 Mich 278.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>Thus began a period where the question was disposed of by merely observing, \"[t]he doctrine of comparative negligence does not obtain in this State.\u201d <em>Black v Bennett, </em>335 Mich 197, 201; 55 NW2d 795 (1952). See, <em>e.g., Mynning v Detroit L &amp; NR Co, </em>59 Mich 257, 260; 26 NW 514 (1886); <em>Gold v Detroit United Railway, </em>223 Mich 209, 212; 193 NW 775 (1923); <em>Grabowski v Seyler, </em>261 Mich 473, 475; 246 NW 189 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">At the same time, however, we made it clear that there were substantial limitations on the doctrine. For example, contributory negligence is no defense to wanton, willful, or reckless conduct. <em>Matta v Chicago &amp; WR Co, </em>69 Mich 109, 113; 37 NW 54 (1888); <em>Gibbard v Cursan, </em>225 Mich 311, 320; 196 NW 398 (1923). Plaintiffs negligence \"is a legally contributory cause 'if, but only if, it is a substantial factor in bringing about his harm\u2019 \u201d. <em>Mack v Precast Industries Inc, </em>369 Mich 439, 450; 120 NW2d 225 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Plaintiff may recover, even if contributorily negligent, if the finder of fact holds that defendant had the last clear chance to avoid the accident. <em>Zeni v Anderson, </em>397 Mich 117, 144; 243 NW2d 270 (1976). Further, plaintiff may invoke last clear chance without first admitting contributory negligence. 17 Michigan Law &amp; Practice, Negligence, \u00a7 83 (Cumm Supp, p 197).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>An unlawful act, in order to bar recovery, \"must be one which the law recognizes as having a causal connection with the injury complained of. If the unlawful act was merely collateral to the cause of action sued upon, and did not proximately contribute to the injury, recovery is not barred.\u201d <em>Manning v Bishop of Marquette, </em>345 Mich 130, 135; 76 NW2d 75 (1956).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Plaintiff is no longer required to plead freedom from contributory negligence. It is now deemed to be a matter of affirmative defense to be pleaded and proved by defendant. <em>Dearborn v Bacila, </em>353 Mich 99; 90 NW2d 863 (1958); GCR 1963, 111.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Being placed in a position of sudden emergency prevents plaintiff from being charged with contributory negligence even if the accident might have been avoided had he or she acted in a different manner. 17 Michigan Law &amp; Practice, Negligence, \u00a7 78, pp 455-456.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Children under seven years old are incapable of contributory negligence as a matter of law. <em>Baker v Alt, </em>374 Mich 492, 505; 132 NW2d 614 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">Negligence subsequent to the injury is distinguished from contributory negligence, which is negligence which contributed proximately to cause the injury. If plaintiff fails to use due care to prevent or reduce damages subsequent to the injury complained of, he or she may not recover the enhanced damages. While the amount of damages may be reduced by such action or inaction, the action itself will not be barred. Thus, this doctrine of \"avoidable consequences\u201d is distinguished from contributory negligence and, in effect limits the latter doctrine to events which <em>cause </em>the original <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>injury, even though plaintiffs action or inaction in aggravating the injury may result in damage out of all proportion to the original event. See <em>Socony Vacuum Oil Co v Marvin, </em>313 Mich 528, 544; 21 NW2d 841 (1946); <em>Delude v Raasakka, </em>42 Mich App 665, 672; 202 NW2d 508 (1972), <em>rov\u2019d on other grounds, </em>391 Mich 296; 215 NW2d 685 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In short, this survey indicates two things. First, while contributory negligence is a bar to some plaintiffs, it is not a bar to all plaintiffs, and it may well be that the pattern of excused and nonexcused contributory negligence may amount to substantial unfairness. Second, our courts have not hesitated to change and in some cases eliminate the application of the court-made doctrine of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">VII \u2014 Criticisms of Contributory Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Alterations are not usually made in a doctrine which is serving well, and with which the bench, bar and public are satisfied. This is obviously not the case with contributory negligence, and attacks have been made, additionally, on the asserted justifications for the doctrine\u2019s existence in the first place. In fact, short of our Court\u2019s reluctance to say what they have been implying there seems to be no real reason to retain the concept.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">In a well-reasoned and oft-quoted concurrence, Justice Talbot Smith, in a masterful analysis, rejected asserted justifications for the doctrine of contributory negligence, and noted that \"the overwhelming movement of the courts is away from the old rule\u201d. <em>Sun Oil Co v Seamon, </em>349 Mich 387, 394, 404-405; 84 NW2d 840 (1957).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>It is not necessary, therefore, to reiterate what has been done so well before. In summary, however, Justice Smith noted, as have leading commentators and other judges, that none of the traditional explanations manages to support the doctrine \u2014 neither the \"clean hands\u201d requirement,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> the prospect of promoting driver caution,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> or even proximate cause.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>Basically, the commentators have agreed that the most plausible explanation for the origin of the doctrine was the period of individualism and rapid development known as the Industrial Revolution. The policy, it is said, was designed to protect infant industries \"from oversympathetic juries who regarded these corporation defendants as intruders, as well as immensely rich\u201d. Anno: <em>The Doctrine of Comparative Negligence and its Relation to the Doctrine of Contributory Negligence, </em>32 ALR3d 463, 471. It has been argued, then, that if contributory negligence arose to protect rapidly growing industries during the Industrial Revolution, the \"industrial complex is now well established, that most claims against individual defendants are covered by workmen\u2019s compensation statutes where negligence is not at issue, and that, in any event, all industrial enterprises, new or old, are generally protected from burdensome liability by insurance.\u201d 32 ALR3d 489-490. See also Prosser, <em>Comparative Negligence, </em>51 Mich L Rev 465, 468 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Be that as it may, it is acknowledged that the United States is virtually the last stronghold of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>contributory negligence, 51 Mich L Rev 466. The most commonly stated reason for rejection of this not-so-hoary doctrine is that it simply is not fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">As high an authority as the United States Supreme Court has said so, for in rejecting the suggestion that contributory negligence replace the admiralty rule of comparative negligence, the Court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-7\">\"The harsh rule of the common law under which contributory negligence wholly barred an injured person from recovery is completely incompatible with modern admiralty policy and practice. Exercising its traditional discretion, admiralty has developed and now follows its own fairer and more flexible rule which allows such consideration of contributory negligence in mitigation of damages as justice requires. Petitioner presents no persuasive arguments that admiralty should now adopt a discredited doctrine which automatically destroys all claims of injured persons who have contributed to their injuries in any degree, however slight.\u201d <em>Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc v Hawn, </em>346 US 406, 408-409; 74 S Ct 202; 98 L Ed 143 (1953).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The California Supreme Court, in judicially adopting comparative negligence, noted \"the doctrine [contributory negligence] is inequitable in its operation because it fails to distribute responsibility in proportion to fault.\u201d <em>Li v Yellow Cab Co of California, </em>13 Cal 3d 804, 810; 119 Cal Rptr 858; 532 P2d 1226, 1230 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">The same indictment has been made in our own Court in Miller;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> in <em>Seamon</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and in <em>Vanderah.</em><footnotemark><em>33</em></footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>\"The list of its [contributory negligence] distinguished critics reads like a tort law hall of fame. This list includes Campbell, Fleming, Green, Harper and James, Keeton, Leflar, Malone, and Pound.\u201d Juenger, <em>supra, </em>18 Wayne L Rev 19.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">Dean Prosser, the Reporter of the Restatement, which is still one of the last-gasp adherents to the doctrine, has himself written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-6\">\"The attack upon contributory negligence has been founded upon the obvious injustice of a rule which visits the entire loss caused by the fault of two parties on one of them alone, and that one the injured plaintiff, least able to bear it, and quite possibly much less at fault than the defendant who goes scot free. No one ever has succeeded in justifying that as a policy, and no one ever will.\u201d Prosser, <em>supra, </em>51 Mich L Rev 469.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Also, on the positive side it has been said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b762-8\">\"[C]omparative negligence achieves better risk distribution than the contributory negligence defense allows. It permits this without abandoning the advantages of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>the tort-litigation system. Comparative negligence is not pure plaintiffs law; rather, it permits a full implementation of the fault principle.\u201d Schwartz, <em>Comparative Negligence: Oiling the System, </em>11 Trial 58 (July/August, 1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">VIII \u2014 Comparative Negligence in Operation</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">The most clear-cut response to the dilemma of contributory negligence has been to replace it with comparative negligence. Where contributory negligence bars all recovery where the plaintiff is negligent, the doctrine of comparative negligence operates to apportion damages according to the fault of each of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">\"By April of 1974, comparative negligence [had] * * * replaced contributory negligence as a complete defense in at least twenty-six states and Puerto Rico.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This has been achieved by statute and judicial decision. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence (Indianapolis: Allen Smith Co, 1974), \u00a7 1.1, p 3 (hereafter \"Schwartz, Treatise\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Even in states such as our own which have retained the concept of contributory negligence, statutory exceptions exist which result, in effect, in a parallel comparative negligence system.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">The example was set by the Federal employers\u2019 liability act, where plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence reduces the amount of his or her recovery in proportion to his or her negligence in actions by an employee of an interstate railroad carrier against his employer. 45 USC 53. The concept also appears in the Federal Jones Act referring to seafarers who suffer injury in the course of employment, 46 USC 688, in the merchant marine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>act, and the death on the high seas act, 46 USC 766.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Thus, in our own state, a form of comparative negligence exists in employees\u2019 actions against railroad employers. Where the negligence of the railroad worker is less than that of the railroad, the employee\u2019s contributory negligence will not bar a recovery. MCLA 419.52; MSA 17.462.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The concept of avoidable consequences operates as well as a type of comparative negligence, for although it takes effect after the injury has already occurred, it requires the jury to first make a judgment that plaintiff was negligent and that this negligence added to his or her damage. Then the jury ascertains the proportion to which plaintiff\u2019s fault contributed to the injury, and reduces the recovery concomitantly. In this way, the same type of judgment and machinery which operate under comparative negligence already operate in our state to a limited extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">IX \u2014 May the Judiciary Initiate Comparative Negligence?</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">For years, the response to the question of whether the courts could substitute comparative negligence for contributory negligence was negative, as courts, including our own, declared that while contributory negligence was unjust, for one reason or another, the task of abrogating the doctrine should be left to the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Such reluctance has not been characteristic of our Court when confronted with other judge-made tort doctrines which have outlived their useful<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>ness. Thus, our Court has heretofore believed that rules created by the court could be altered by the court. For example, we abrogated the defense of assumption of risk, <em>Felgner v Anderson, </em>375 Mich 23; 133 NW2d 136 (1965), repudiated the doctrine of imputed negligence, <em>Bricker v Green, </em>313 Mich 218; 21 NW2d 105 (1946), eliminated the privity requirement in actions for breach of an implied warranty, <em>Spence v Three Rivers Builders &amp; Masonry Supply, Inc, </em>353 Mich 120; 90 NW2d 873 (1958), overruled the common-law disability prohibiting the wife from suing for the loss of her husband\u2019s consortium, <em>Montgomery v Stephan, </em>359 Mich 33; 101 NW2d 227 (1960), overruled the common law disallowance of recovery for negligently inflicted prenatal injury, <em>Womack v Buchhorn, </em>384 Mich 718, 724-725; 187 NW2d 218 (1971); and even eliminated charitable immunity from negligence, <em>Parker v Port Huron Hospital, </em>361 Mich 1; 105 NW2d 1 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">This Court certainly has recognized our \"corrective responsibility\u201d to \"refuse to blindly imitate * * * [the] dead past\u201d. <em>Dearborn v Bacila, </em>353 Mich 99, 113; 90 NW2d 863 (1958).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> In <em>Bacila </em>along with recognizing stare decisis Justice Black noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-5\">\"Mr. Justice Holmes, commenting on 'The Path of the Law,\u2019 leads the thought-way here. He said (Collected Legal Papers, Oliver Wendell Holmes, p 187):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">\" 'It is revolting to have no better reason for a rule of law than that so it was laid down in the time of Henry IV. It is still more revolting if the grounds upon which it was laid down have vanished long since, and the rule simply persists from blind imitation of the past.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number><em>\"'Stare decisis </em>is not, like the rule of <em>res judicata, </em>a universal, inexorable command. \"The rule of <em>stare decisis, </em>though one tending to consistency and uniformity of decision, is not inflexible. Whether it shall be followed or departed from is a question entirely within the discretion of the court, which is again called upon to consider a question once decided.\u201d <em>Hertz v Woodman, </em>218 US 205, 212; 30 S Ct 621; 54 L Ed 1001 [1910], * * * The court bows to the lessons of experience and the force of better reasoning, recognizing that the process of trial and error, so fruitful in the physical sciences, is appropriate also in the judicial function.\u2019 (Mr. Justice Brandeis in <em>Burnet v Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co, </em>285 US 393, 405-408 [52 S Ct 443, 76 L Ed 815 (1932)].)\u201d 353 Mich 112, 113-114.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">In another opinion, the dilemma of stare decisis versus the need for change was well stated by Justice Talbot Smith:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-5\">\"Thus again we reach the conflict that divides us, for the law, as Dean Pound put it, must be stable, and yet it cannot stand still. Were we to rule upon precedent alone, were stability the only reason for our being, we would have no trouble with this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">\"The precedents of the older cases are not valid precedents. * * * They are out of harmony with the conditions of modern society. They do violence to our convictions and our principles. We reject their applicability. The reasons for the old rule no longer obtaining, the rule falls with it.\u201d 359 Mich 37, 49.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">While we heretofore have not taken the bit in our teeth and totally abolished contributory negligence, we have chipped away at it piece by piece by special exceptions to the rule of contributory negligence, such as wanton and wilful conduct, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>last clear chance, sudden emergency, children under seven, etc., <em>vide supra. </em>But it is perfectly clear that we have the power and the precedent to change an established rule which has, as has the rule of contributory negligence, outgrown its usefulness. We have even done it where the rule of law was legislatively, not judicially, created. <em>E.g., Manistee Bank &amp; Trust Co v McGowan, </em>394 Mich 655; 232 NW2d 636 (1975), in which we found that the guest passenger statute, after 40 years, was no longer experimental and could no longer be justified in terms of any stated legislative policy. (It should be emphasized that the guest act was a creature of the Legislature, not of the judiciary.)</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">It is said that if the arguments against contributory negligence were so persuasive, the Legislature would have changed things long ago. But the Legislature has not acted.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Therefore, in the absence of such a mandate, the argument is that we should not act either.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">As a practical matter, there are a variety of reasons why bills or ideas do or do not become law and it is not the role of the courts to guess what legislative silence means. As Justice Voelker wrote when confronted with the argument that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\"legislative silence and inaction for 37 years * * * amounts to a tacit recognition of its [a doctrine\u2019s] soundness by which we must irrevocably be bound. Now this beguiling doctrine of legislative assent by silence possesses a certain undeniable logic and charm. Nor are we oblivious to the flattery implicit therein; double flattery, in fact; flattery both to the profound learning and wisdom of the particular supreme court which has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>spoken, and flattery to a presumably alert and eagerly responsive State legislature. One pictures the legislators of our various States periodically clamoring and elbowing each other in their zeal to get at the pearls of wisdom embalmed in the latest decisions and advance sheets of their respective supreme courts \u2014 and thenceforth indicating their unbounded approval by a vast and permanent silence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-5\">\"Yet there are several dark shadows in this picture. For one, it suggests a legislative passion for reading and heeding the decisions of our supreme courts which we suspect may be scarcely borne out by the facts. For another, pushed too far such a doctrine suggests the interesting proposition that it is the legislatures which have now become the ultimate courts of last resort in our various States; that if they delay long enough to correct our errors those errors thus become both respectable and immutably frozen; and, finally, the larger and more dismal corollary that if enough people persist long enough in ignoring an injustice it thereby becomes just. We reject as both un-Christian and legally unsound the hopeless doctrine that this Court is shackled and helpless to redeem itself from its own original sin, however or by whomever long condoned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-6\">\"Courts throughout the land have long split over this doctrine of legislative acquiescence by silence. The usual arguments for recognizing it are that it gives stability and sureness to the law; that 'rights\u2019 thus acquired can thus only be disturbed at regular and predictable intervals by but one branch of the government, the legislative; and, finally, that to disregard the doctrine amounts to judicial legislating. Now we recognize that a court should not lightly overrule an interpretation of a statute that has been the law for 37 years, but we also see little justice or utility in continuing to give stability or sureness to an unfortunate rule of law.\u201d <em>Van Dorpel v Haven-Busch Co, </em>350 Mich 135, 145-146; 85 NW2d 97 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">The real problem, we think, confronting the court which desires to undo the sins of the past, is that, unlike reversing a statute or an ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>common-law doctrine, the elimination of contributory negligence requires a <em>substitution. </em>It is not enough to say that we are no longer to be ruled by the not-so-ancient doctrine of contributory negligence. We must then opt for a form of comparative negligence to take its place.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">But is that so much more difficult than the imposition of a brand new doctrine upon the law when there was nothing there before it? For is that not what happened when the courts created contributory negligence in the first place?</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">The task is difficult, but it has not been shirked by others before us, and we will not decline this responsibility now. For while it is true that most courts have not chosen to make the change, within recent years others have done so. We have to guide us not only the experience of those states which have adopted comparative negligence by statute, but those which have done so by way of judicial decision. There is, further, the Federal experience in admiralty and under FELA for whatever additional reference may be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">X \u2014 Action by Other Courts</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">We turn to the task before us with the understanding that we are dealing with a torts problem, and courts are no strangers to the reform of tort law of judicial origin. This makes the question of judicial competence to make serious choice perhaps of somewhat less concern than an exploration of alternatives in other areas. The courts\u2019 day-today confrontation with the problem of torts and the resulting \"interpretative continuity\u201d probably provide the courts with as comprehensive an insight into the question of tort reform as the committee system and public hearings provide the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Legislature. Keeton, <em>Creative Continuity in the Law of Torts, </em>75 Harv L Rev 463 (1962).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The judiciary has as well the ability to fill in details in this area in subsequent cases. Comparative negligence seems ideally suited to such judicial clarification, for the statutes are at best rather sketchy \"and leave the very same ancillary questions [which would be ordinarily left to judicial decision] likewise to the courts for future solution\u201d. Fleming, <em>The Supreme Court of California 1974-1975, Foreword: Comparative Negligence at Last </em>\u2014 By <em>Judicial Choice, </em>64 Cal L Rev 239, 281 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Judicial rulings may also give affected parties an opportunity to prepare themselves for the change of law, because it is possible to give a ruling prospective operation only, <em>Great NR Co v Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co, </em>287 US 358, 364; 53 S Ct 145; 77 L Ed 360 (1932), with the exception perhaps of the successful appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Additionally, the court may, just as the Legislature does, look to statutes in other jurisdictions for guidance,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>Moyses v Spartan Asphalt Paving Co, </em>383 Mich 314, 334; 174 NW2d 797, 806 (1970) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>(contribution among joint tortfeasors),<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> to commentators, <em>Zeni v Anderson, </em>397 Mich 117; 243 NW2d 270 (1976) (Restatement position on last clear chance), and to what other courts have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Three state courts of last resort, in Florida, California and Alaska, and the United States Supreme Court, have recently adopted comparative negligence systems,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> the states substituting \"pure\u201d comparative negligence for the contributory negligence law, and the United States Supreme Court changing the admiralty rule of divided damages to liability proportional to fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>On July 10, 1973, the Supreme Court of Florida held in <em>Hoffman v Jones, </em>280 So 2d 431; 78 ALR3d 321 (Fla, 1973),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-5\">\"that a plaintiff in an action based on negligence will no longer be denied any recovery because of his contributory negligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">\"A plaintiff is barred from recovering damages for loss or injury caused by the negligence of another only when the plaintiffs negligence is the sole legal cause of the damage, or the negligence of the plaintiff and some person or persons other than the defendant or defendants was the sole legal cause of the damage.\u201d 280 So 2d 438.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The Court acknowledged that, following a gubernatorial veto of a comparative negligence statute 30 years before, the Legislature had \"done little to discard the harsh and inequitable contributory negligence rule, perhaps because it considers the problem to be a judicial one\u201d. 280 So 2d 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">The Court felt it should act because,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">\"[s]ince we definitely consider the problem to be a judicial one, we feel the time has come for this Court to join what seems to be a trend toward almost universal adoption of comparative negligence. A primary function of a court is to see that legal conflicts are equitably resolved. In the field of tort law, the most equitable result that can ever be reached by a court is equation of liability with fault. Comparative negligence does this more completely than contributory negligence, and we would be shirking our duty if we did not adopt the better doctrine.\u201d 280 So 2d 438.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">\"Whatever may have been the historical justification for it, today it is almost universally regarded as unjust and inequitable to rest an entire accidental loss on one of the parties whose negligent conduct combined with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>the negligence of the other party to produce the loss.\u201d 280 So 2d 436.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-4\">The Court found it had authority to act to abolish contributory negligence because contributory negligence was a judicial creation.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Even without authority based on the judicial origin of the doctrine, the Court found an obligation to make the change because, after an analysis similar to that we have undergone, it found no compelling justification for the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The rule adopted was one of \"pure\u201d comparative negligence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">\"If plaintiff and defendant are both at fault, the former may recover, but the amount of his recovery may be only such proportion of the entire damages plaintiff sustained as the defendant\u2019s negligence bears to the combined negligence of both the plaintiff and the defendant. For example, where it is found that the plaintiff\u2019s negligence is at least equal to that of the defendant, the amount awarded to the plaintiff should be reduced by one-half from what it otherwise would have been.\u201d 280 So 2d 438.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-8\">California acted next, and in 1975 in <em>Li v Yellow Cab Co of California, </em>13 Cal 3d 804; 119 Cal Rptr 858; 532 P2d 1226 (1975), the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>that state abrogated the doctrine of contributory negligence and adopted comparative negligence.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">To the California Court, the superiority of comparative negligence was so clear that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-6\">\"It is unnecessary for us to catalogue the enormous amount of critical comment that has been directed over the years against the 'all-or-nothing\u2019 approach of the doctrine of contributory negligence. The essence of that criticism has been constant and clear: the doctrine is inequitable in its operation because it fails to distribute responsibility in proportion to fault. Against this have been raised several arguments in justification, but none have proved even remotely adequate to the task.\u201d 13 Cal 3d 810-811; 532 P2d 1230-1231.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">After reviewing some practical and administrative objections to adopting comparative negligence, the Court found these did not \"[diminish] our conviction that the time for a revision of the means for dealing with contributory fault in this state is long past due and that it lies within the province of this court to initiate the needed change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>by our decision in this case\u201d. 13 Cal 3d 826; 532 P2d 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">The Court then proceeded to adopt the \"pure\u201d form of comparative negligence, rejecting the \"50 percent\u201d system and its variants,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> as merely applying \"the lottery aspect of the contributory negligence rule to a different ground\u201d. 13 Cal 3d 827; 532 P2d 1242.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The decision noted that the Wisconsin 50 percent system led to numerous appeals on the narrow issue of whether plaintiff\u2019s negligence was equal to defendant\u2019s, and that, because of the \"development of arcane classifications of negligence according to quality and category\u201d, four members of the Wisconsin Supreme Court indicated a willingness to adopt the pure form if the Legislature failed to act \"with reasonable dispatch\u201d. The majority, however, rejected the invitation, because they concluded that the Legislature by writing a statute had occupied the field. 13 Cal 3d 828; 532 P2d 1243, citing <em>Vincent v Pabst Brewing Co, </em>47 Wis 2d 120; 177 NW2d 513 (1970).<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The California court pronounced the \"pure\u201d rule of comparative negligence as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-4\">\"[T]he contributory negligence of the person injured in person or property shall not bar recovery, but the damages awarded shall be diminished in proportion to the amount of negligence attributable to the person recovering.\u201d 13 Cal 3d 829; 532 P2d 1243.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The Alaska Supreme Court also adopted pure comparative negligence in <em>Kaatz v State, </em>540 P2d 1037 (Alas, 1975). The rationale was simply stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\"We are convinced that the pure system is the one which is the simplest to administer and which is best calculated to bring about substantial justice in negligence cases. It is the system most favored by modern jurists and commentators.\u201d 540 P2d 1049.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Still another judicial vote on the side of pure comparative negligence was cast by the United States Supreme Court, when it replaced the admiralty rule of divided damages<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> with a rule providing for the allocation of liability for damages in proportion to the relative fault of each party. <em>United States v Reliable Transfer Co, Inc, </em>421 US 397; 95 S Ct 1708; 44 L Ed 2d 251 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">A review of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s rationale is applicable to the problem before us and serves to reinforce our reasoning in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>First, the Court noted that while the precise origins of the divided damages rule \"are shrouded in the mists of history\u201d, 421 US 401, the divided damages rule did not emerge \"as we know it\u201d until early in the 19th century, and was adopted by the United States Supreme Court in 1855. 421 US 402.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">\"The rule was adopted because it was then the prevailing rule in England, because it had become the majority rule in the lower federal courts, and because it seemed the 'most just and equitable, and * * * best [tended] to induce care and vigilance on both sides, in the navigation.\u2019 <em>Id, </em>at 177-178. There can be no question that subsequent history and experience have conspicuously eroded the rule\u2019s foundations.\u201d 421 US 402-403 (notes omitted), quoting <em>The Schooner Catharine v Dickinson, </em>58 US (17 How) 170; 15 L Ed 233 (1855).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">The Court then recognized that not only had England abandoned the rule, but the Brussels Collision Liability Convention of 1910 provides for apportionment of damages on the basis of \"degree\u201d of fault. Thus, \"the United States is now virtually alone among the world\u2019s major maritime nations in not adhering to the Convention with its rule of proportional fault\u201d. 421 US 403-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">The Court also observed that lower courts, although following the rule of divided damages, \"have more recently followed it only grudgingly, terming it 'unfair,\u2019 'illogical,\u2019 'arbitrary,\u2019 'archaic and frequently unjust\u2019 \u201d, 421 US 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">They found \"[i]t is no longer apparent, if it ever was, that this Solomonic division of damages seems to achieve even rough justice\u201d. 421 US 405. \" 'This result hardly commends itself to the sense of justice any more appealingly than does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>common law doctrine of contributory negligence ***\u2019\u201d. 421 US 405.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">As to \"escape valves\u201d,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> the Court noted it had attempted to escape the \"patent harshness\u201d of the equal damages rule by applying the \"major-minor\u201d fault doctrine.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> However, they now observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-5\">\"But this escape valve, in addition to being inherently unreliable, simply replaces one unfairness with another. That a vessel is primarily negligent does not justify its shouldering all responsibility, nor excuse the slightly negligent vessel from bearing any liability at all. See <em>Tank Barge Hygrade v The Gatco New Jersey, </em>250 F2d 485, 488 (CA 3 [1957]). The problem remains where it began with the divided damages rule.\u201d 421 US 406.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>As to the attempted justification \"by the difficulty of determining comparative degrees of negligence when both parties are concededly guilty of contributing fault\u201d, the Court acknowledges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">\"Although there is some force in this argument, it cannot justify an equal division of damages in every case of collision based on mutual fault. When it is impossible fairly to allocate degrees of fault, the division of damages equally between wrongdoing parties is an equitable solution. But the rule is unnecessarily crude and inequitable in a case like this one where an allocation of disparate proportional fault has been made. <em>Potential problems of proof in some cases hardly require adherence to an archaic and unfair rule in all cases. </em>Every other major maritime nation has evidently been able to apply a rule of comparative negligence without serious problems, see Mole &amp; Wilson, <em>A Study of Comparative Negligence, </em>17 Cornell LQ 333, 346 (1932); <em>In re Adams\u2019 Petition, </em>125 F Supp 110, 114 (SDNY [1954]), <em>aff'd </em>237 F2d 884 (CA 2 [1956]), and in our own admiralty law a rule of comparative negligence has long been applied with no untoward difficulties in personal injury actions.\u201d 421 US 407 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">The Court rejected the argument that the equal apportionment rule promoted out-of-court settlements, noting as well that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">\"Experience with comparative negligence in the personal injury areas teaches that a rule of fairness in court will produce fair out-of-court settlements.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> But even if this argument were more persuasive than it is, it could hardly be accepted. For, at bottom, it asks us to continue the operation of an archaic rule because its facile application out of court yields quick, though inequitable, settlements, and relieves the courts of some litigation. Congestion in the courts cannot justify a legal rule that produces unjust results in litigation simply to encourage speedy out-of-court accommodations. 421 US 408.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>As for the power of the judiciary to make such a change in the face of congressional silence, the Supreme Court was equally persuasive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-5\">\"This Court, in other appropriate contexts, has not hesitated to overrule an earlier decision and settle a matter of continuing concern, even though relief might have been obtained by legislation.

For example, if an accident is wholly the fault of one party, then that party would not, of course, recover damages. If an injured plaintiff was 51% to blame, there still remains 49% of the fault which was not plaintiffs,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> and for which therefore the person who caused that much of the injury should be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">The rule preventing recovery if plaintiffs negligence exceeds 50% of the total fault is just as arbitrary as that which completely denies recovery. Is the person who is 49% negligent that much more deserving than the one who is 51% negligent?<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">We acknowledge that even under the \"pure\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>form of comparative negligence there will be appeals concerning the percentage of award,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> but it is undoubtedly more compelling to appeal when you have been awarded nothing than when you have received some compensation.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> However, just as we did not reach our decision on contributory negligence because of the anticipated number of case filings, we will not reach our decision on the form of comparative negligence because of an equally unpredictable element, the anticipated number of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">Commentators acknowledge that the hybrid 50% rule leads to strange results.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">\"It is obvious that a slight difference in the proportionate fault may permit a recovery; and there has been much justified criticism of a rule under which a plaintiff who is charged with 49 per cent of the total negligence recovers 51 per cent of his damages, while one who is charged with 50 per cent recovers nothing at all.\u201d Prosser, <em>supra, </em>51 Mich L Rev 493-494.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">See also Keeton, <em>Comment on </em>Maki v Frelk, 21 Vand L Rev 906 (1968); Leflar, <em>Comment on </em>Maki v Frelk, 21 Vand L Rev 918 (1968).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-9\">\"If two parties are injured in one accident, as in an automobile collision, the one who is slightly more negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>gent than the other must bear his own loss and close to one-half of the losses of the other.

The wrongdoer does not recover to the extent of his fault, but only to the extent of the fault of others. To assume that in most cases the plaintiff is more negligent than the defendant is an argument not based on equity or justice or the facts. What pure comparative negligence does is hold a person fully responsible for his or her acts and to the full extent to which they cause injury. That is justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">This is the system of comparative negligence judicially adopted in Florida, California, Alaska, and by the United States Supreme Court to replace the equal division rule in admiralty actions. It is the system in the FELA, the Merchant Marine Act, the Jones Act, and Death on the High Seas Act. It is simplest to administer where multiple defendants are concerned. The system in operation has not led \"to runaway verdicts for negligent plaintiffs\u201d. Schwartz, Treatise, \u00a7 3.2, p 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">We recognize that the 50% system has been the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>most popular among those legislatively adopted. Schwartz, \u00a7 3.5, p 73. But it is not the system which we believe will really do justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\">We recognize that the doctrine of last clear chance served to mitigate the harshness of contributory negligence and therefore its retention might appropriately be reconsidered once pure comparative negligence is adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">Although not mandatory, the trial court may find it desirable to utilize the special verdict procedure, in cases in which comparative negligence is an issue. GCR 1963, 514.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Thus, for example, the jury may be asked the percentage of fault attributable to each party, and the damage each party suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">Because of the extensive changes precipitated by this decision, the rule of comparative negligence will apply only to the present case and to those cases filed after the date of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">XII \u2014 Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">We are remanding the instant case for trial because of errors committed in the charge to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Because the facts of this case raise once again the question of whether we should continue to apply the harsh rule of contributory negligence, we have today rejected that doctrine and have adopted the pure form of comparative negligence. Thus, as to the instant case and all cases filed after the date of this decision, where the negligence of plaintiff is an issue, the amount of damages recovered by plaintiff shall be reduced in proportion to the extent of plaintiff\u2019s fault.

J., and Levin, J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">Questions and Answers About Comparative Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b786-9\">Whether comparative negligence should be adopted was debated before our Court several years ago. <em>Parsonson v Construction Equipment Co, </em>386 Mich 61; 191 NW2d 465 (1971). Although the case was decided on other grounds, the parties and amici curiae<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> raised and discussed some of the principal questions about comparative negligence. These are summarized <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b786-10\"><em>(1) Is Comparative Negligence Confusing? </em>,</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">Those who argue that comparative negligence is both confusing and difficult to administer both underestimate the modern jury and misread the facts. Juenger, <em>supra, </em>18 Wayne L Rev 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">Even under contributory negligence, juries every day make subtle judgments concerning appropriate damages attributable to defendant\u2019s negligence which should be awarded to deserving plaintiffs. And, as we have seen, under the doctrine of avoidable consequences, almost the same kind of reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>ing which would be used in a comparative negligence case in analyzing fault <em>before </em>the injury occurs, is used in analyzing fault <em>after </em>the injury occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-4\">But it is not necessary to conduct this analysis on a theoretical basis. An analysis of comparative negligence systems in states in which the system operates is possible to determine whether indeed the juries are doing the job required. Apparently, the answer is that juries perform their function in these jurisdictions without significant problems.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b787-5\">\"Juries have been making apportionments on the basis of comparative negligence with apparent success in Florida in railway accident cases since 1887; and in Wisconsin they have been applying the rule to all types of negligence cases, apparently to the complete satisfaction of the Wisconsin bar, since 1931.\u201d Maloney, <em>From Contributory to Comparative Negligence: A Needed Law Reform, </em>11 U Fla L Rev 135, 163 (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Certainly, the juries which make up the panels in comparative negligence states are no more sagacious than the panels in those states following contributory negligence. Under conflict of laws rules, if an injury occurs in a state which does follow that concept, the jury would still apply comparative negligence, even if the matter were litigated in a contributory negligence state. We are not aware of any instance where the rules have had to be changed because the juries have not been able to handle it.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Further, there is sufficient case law derived from the experience under state and federal legislation and under common law to provide guidance in the decision-making process. Certainly, too, experience with the FELA and admiralty legislation, and with our own state\u2019s comparative negligence statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>cannot be dismissed with the mere conjecture that the process would suddenly be too confusing or too difficult to administer for the juries and courts of our state alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">\n<em>(2) Will Comparative Negligence Discourage Settlement and Increase the Volume of Litigation?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Comparative negligence adherents have predicted more manageable court dockets because of fewer and shorter trials as plaintiffs no longer feel required to opt for jury trials in order to nullify the contributory negligence law, and defendants feel free to settle once the hope of winning via proof that plaintiff was contributorily negligent disappears. Since the remaining trials would be largely bench trials, the argument goes, trials will be shorter and more simplified.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Opponents, on the other hand, say that what has happened is that more plaintiffs receive awards under comparative negligence. See Brief for Amicus Curiae, Association of Defense Trial Counsel, <em>Parsonson v Construction Equipment Co, supra, </em>pp 12-14.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This, of course, is not the same thing as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>creating unworkable dockets or filing spurious claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Although the arguments concerning the burdens of judicial administration should not by themselves be reasons for changing or retaining legal systems, it is still useful to be able to anticipate future court problems. As best as we can surmise from the litigation and the arguments made to this Court,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> neither party\u2019s theoretical arguments have tended to be true in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">While this says something about basing judgments on theoretical fears, it also indicates the importance of not making decisions based on threatened Pandora\u2019s Boxes or hoped-for Nirvanas.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">A famous study of the operation of comparative negligence in Arkansas was undertaken by the Columbia University Project for Effective Justice. What the Arkansas study showed was:</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">(1) Under comparative negligence more persons who sustained tort injuries found lawyers ready to prosecute their damage claims. Rosenberg, <em>Comparative Negligence in Arkansas: A Before and After\u201d Survey, </em>36 NY State Bar J 457, 466 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">(2) More settlements were promoted under comparative negligence. Rosenberg, <em>supra, </em>36 NYSBJ 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">(3) There was no change in the tendency to demand a jury trial under comparative negligence. Rosenberg, <em>supra, </em>36 NYSBJ 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>(4) Judges felt that liability was easier to assess but damages were difficult to ascertain. Lawyers agreed with the greater difficulty of assessing damages but felt that liability was also harder to determine. The report concluded that the evidence was that comparative negligence did not tend significantly to increase trial length, and that the greater difficulty of determining the damage issue was probably offset by greater ease in determining liability. Rosenberg, <em>supra, </em>36 NYSBJ 468-469.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">(5) Settlements during trial were unchanged. Rosenberg, <em>supra, </em>36 NYSBJ 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">(6) The size of plaintiffs\u2019 verdicts were apparently unchanged by the adoption of the comparative negligence statute. However, plaintiffs won the liability question more often than under contributory negligence. Rosenberg, <em>supra, </em>36 NYSBJ 470. It is likely, then, that cases were worth more for settlement. Rosenberg, <em>supra, </em>36 NYSBJ 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">(7) The survey reported that whereas 63% of defense lawyers opposed comparative negligence at the outset, three years after adoption only 26% thought it was not helpful in before-trial settlements. Sixty percent of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers found comparative negligence helpful, a decline of 10% from those who initially favored adoption. Rosenberg, <em>supra, </em>36 NYSBJ 471-472.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Since neither side has been able to show a disproportionate impact on trial dockets results from the adoption of comparative negligence, we do not hesitate to base our judgment largely on other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">\n<em>(3) Will Comparative Negligence Cause Insurance Rates to Increase?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">Proponents report that the effect of comparative negligence on insurance rates has been minimal, with the suggestion that part of this is due to the tendency of insurance adjusters, juries,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and sometimes even courts to actually practice a form of comparative negligence even in contributory negligence states. Schwartz, Comparative Negligence (Treatise), \u00a7 21.1, p 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">The Brief for Amicus Curiae, Association of Defense Trial Counsel, in the case of <em>Parsonson v Construction Equipment Co, </em>386 Mich 61; 191 NW2d 465 (1971), maintains that the alleged fact of the jury\u2019s de facto repeal of contributory negligence is not necessarily a certainty, p 15. More significantly, however, one amicus refrained from making \"a categorical statement that comparative negligence will mean increased insurance premiums, simply because there are too many variables\u201d. <em>Id, </em>p 15.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Another amicus, Negligence Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan in Opposition to Comparative Negligence, <em>Parsonson v Construction Equipment Co, </em>predicted that adoption of the pure or modified form of comparative negligence would increase insurance rates, while application of the slight negligence rule might have little or no effect. Brief, p 24. That amicus appeared to rely on the opinion of several writers that comparative negligence increases the number of situations in which the plaintiff can recover, and that automobile liability insurance premiums in Wisconsin [with comparative negligence] were higher than in comparable communities in neighboring states. They also noted that insurance rates are already rising, and that it would be against the public interest to add comparative negligence and make costs concomitantly higher. <em>Id, </em>pp 25, 26, 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">However, the Brief for Amicus Curiae, Michigan Trial Lawyers Association in Support of Comparative Negligence, reiterates the conclusion of Professor Peck, <em>Comparative Negligence and Automobile Liability Insurance, </em>58 Mich L Rev 689, 728 (1960):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">\"It is possible that comparative negligence has an effect upon insurance rates, but that that effect cannot be detected with the data on hand and the techniques used. Even if this is true, however, some measure of its force has been obtained. Adoption of a comparative negligence rule, as shown by the Arkansas experience, would not have a catastrophic result upon the insurance rate structure of any state. Indeed, it would not have as much effect as rapid growth of population, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>increased urbanization, or change to a traffic program with the effective safety record of a neighboring state. Its effect, if any, would probably go undetected in the rates and statistics of the insurance industry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">Further, amicus quotes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-7\">\"[O]ne defense practitioner [who] has put the matter more laconically: 'We pay more people perhaps, but we pay less to each.\u2019 Pfankuch, <em>Comparative Negligence v Contributory Negligence, </em>1968 Insurance L J 725, 731 [1968].\u201d Trial Lawyers Brief, <em>supra, </em>p 16.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">One Amicus brief, that of the Negligence Law Section of the State Bar of Michigan in Support of Comparative Negligence, actually presented figures comparing insurance costs at the time between states having contributory negligence and those with comparative negligence:</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">Quoting a defense attorney, amicus wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-10\">\"Let me give you the costs in various states having contributory negligence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-11\">\"Massachusetts \u2014 $129.92 Illinois \u2014 $92.76</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">New York \u2014 $109.69 Connecticut \u2014 $91.32</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-13\">Rhode Island \u2014 $99.97 New Jersey \u2014 $81.95</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-14\">\"Let us compare these costs with the comparative negligence states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-15\">\"Wisconsin \u2014 $75.74 Georgia \u2014 $50.82</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-16\">Mississippi \u2014 $66.54 Nebraska \u2014 $49.05</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-17\">Arkansas \u2014 $55.61 South Dakota \u2014 $33.01</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-18\">\"All [the comparative negligence states] are below the U.S. average of $79.64.\u201d Heft, <em>Comparative Negligence, </em>19 Federation of Ins Counsel Q 91, 93 (Spring, 1969), quoted in Negligence Section Brief, <em>supra, </em>pp 55-56, fn 98.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-19\">Amicus also quotes the observations of Pound:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5e\">\"[K]eeping down insurance rates at the expense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>justice is not in keeping with humanitarian ideals of today. The world has been giving up the idea of leaving the burden of the nine million accidents which are recorded in the United States each year to fall wholly upon the injured victims.\u201d Pound, <em>Comparative Negligence, </em>13 NACCA L J 195 (1954), quoted in Negligence Section Brief, <em>supra, </em>p 22.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Here again, we find ourselves as we did when evaluating the question of increased litigation, with a situation in which the dire predictions appear not to have been realized, but where data to definitively resolve the issue are not fully conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">\n<em>(4) Is Adoption of Comparative Negligence Unnecessary Since Juries Already Apply Some Form of Comparative Negligence?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">This alleged predilection of juries has been adverted to as a factor in favor of <em>not </em>making a formal change to comparative negligence. Powell, <em>Contributory Negligence: A Necessary Check on the American Jury, </em>43 ABA J 1005 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Some courts have also maintained the practice of jury administered comparative negligence exists.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-10\">\"No one can appreciate more than we the hardship of depriving plaintiff of his verdict and of all right to collect damages from defendant; but the rule of contributory negligence, through no fault of ours, remains in our law * * * . It would be hard to imagine a case more illustrative of the truth that in operation the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>of comparative negligence would serve justice more faithfully than that of contributory negligence. We but blind our eyes to obvious reality to the extent that we ignore the fact that in many cases juries apply it in spite of us.\u201d <em>Haeg v Sprague, Warner &amp; Co, Inc, </em>202 Minn 425, 429-430; 281 NW 261 (1938).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-y\">\"The doctrine of comparative negligence, or degrees of negligence, is not recognized by the Courts of Pennsylvania, but as a practical matter they are frequently taken into consideration by a jury. The net result, as every trial judge knows, is that in a large majority of negligence cases where the evidence of negligence is not clear, or where the question of contributory negligence is not free from doubt, the jury brings in a compromise verdict.\u201d <em>Karcesky v Laria, </em>382 Pa 227, 234; 114 A2d 150, 154 (1955).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">However, it is apparent that often a jury, as in the case at bar, does not so compromise and instead follows the court\u2019s instructions as they are supposed to do. This may then result in at best a rough-hewn type of justice, one in which, if the jury chooses to in effect disobey the law, the \"lucky\u201d plaintiff may receive a form of justice, but where a jury chooses instead to follow the law an even more deserving plaintiff would be barred from recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Even if the jury does adopt the compromise verdict,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>\"[I]t has been pointed out that the practice itself is evidence that the contributory negligence rule does not conform to the community\u2019s sense of justice \u2014 indeed, it fosters disrespect for the law by perpetuating a questionable system whereby trial judges instruct juries on the theory of contributory negligence while tacitly recognizing that the jury will disregard the instructions and somehow apportion the damages.\u201d Anno, <em>supra, </em>32 ALR3d 488.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\"T]he disrespect for law engendered by putting our citizens in a position in which they feel it is necessary to deliberately violate the law is not something to be lightly brushed aside; and it comes ill from the mouths of lawyers, who as officers of the courts have sworn to uphold the law, to defend the present system by arguing that it works because jurors can be trusted to disregard that very law.\u201d Maloney, <em>From Contributory to Comparative Negligence: A Needed Law Reform, </em>11 U Fla L Rev 135, 151-152 (1958).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Therefore, we believe this argument is persuasive only to convince us that, if it is indeed true that juries do apply comparative negligence sub rosa, it would be better to bring the practice out from underneath the table.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">\n<em>(5) Does No-Fault Legislation Make Comparative Negligence Unnecessary?</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>11</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">One of the most telling arguments in support of comparative negligence is that because it allocates liability according to fault, it is more faithful to the fault principle underlying our negligence law than the aberrational contributory negligence concept. Logically, then, the adoption of no-fault legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>lation may well reduce the need for a comparative negligence approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">The argument, however, is too simplistic, for, while no-fault would apply to most automobile negligence cases, it does not apply to all, as there is still a considerable area of no-fault exceptions in which the fault principle is still applied.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, no-fault is indeed at the present time restricted to only automotive litigation, and, for example, cases involving slip and fall, products liability, or plane, boat, or train accidents are not affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">It is also coincident with the policy expressed in no-fault, that victims of automobile accidents may be compensated <em>regardless </em>of whether they are at fault, to do away with a rule that \"bars <em>any </em>recovery because of <em>some fault\u201d. Codling v Paglia, </em>32 NY2d 330, 345, 346; 298 NE2d 622, 630, 631 (1973) (Jasen, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">Thus, other states have not found the doctrines mutually exclusive. \"Of the 21 states having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>adopted comparative negligence since 1969 by statute * * * , 13 also have no-fault coverage * * * . Among the six earlier adherents two have since adopted no-fault plans.\u201d Fleming, <em>Foreword: Comparative Negligence at Last </em>\u2014 By <em>Judicial Choice, supra, </em>64 Cal L Rev 239, 240, fn 3 (1976). Georgia and Florida, which adopted comparative negligence by court decision, also have no-fault plans. Schwartz, Treatise, \u00a7 1.4, p 12; \u00a7 1.5, pp 18-19, 24-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Thus, the adoption of no-fault, if it affects comparative negligence at all, affects only the scope of the change. If anything, therefore, it makes the new doctrine less revolutionary than it otherwise might be. But it does not eliminate the need for the change.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b733-6\"> On direct examination, Kirby testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-7\"><em>\"A.
