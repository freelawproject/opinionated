The indictment is laid under a statute of this state which provides that \u201cwhoever shall carry concealed a deadly weapon upon or about his person, other than an ordinary pocket knife, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,\u201d and shall be punished as the law then provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-14\">I have been asked to instruct you to return a verdict of \u201cnot guilty,\u201d because the testimony of the carrying of the concealed deadly weapon is confined to the fact that it was so carried in the dwelling house of the defendant. This I decline to do. The offense charged in the statute is carrying the weapon concealed about his person. The statute is general in its terms as to locality, and there is no provision excepting the defendant\u2019s house or other place. While the question has not heretofore arisen in this state, the courts of other jurisdictions have passed directly upon it. From the almost uniform current of the law, I am convinced that unless there is an exception in the statute, it is no defense that the weapons were carried only in the defendant\u2019s own house and that it is not the province of the court to restrict or change the phrase<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>ology of the statute. <em>People v.
