Hynes, </em>104 <em>Fed. </em>449, 45 <em>C. C. A. </em>271, 52 <em>L. R. A. </em>675; <em>Handley v. Harris, </em>48 <em>Kan. </em>606, 29 <em>Pac. </em>1145, 17 <em>L. R. A. </em>703, 30 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>322; <em>Creelman Lumber Co. v. Lesh, </em>73 <em>Ark. </em>16, 83 S. <em>W. </em>320, 3 <em>Ann. Cas. </em>108; <em>Kanaga v. Taylor, </em>7 <em>Ohio St. </em>134, 70 <em>Am. Dec. 62; Smith v. McLean, </em>24 <em>Iowa </em>322.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">In <em>Langworthy v. Little, </em>12 <em>Cush. (Mass.) </em>109, <em>Chief Justice Shaw </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201cA party who obtains a good title to property, absolute or qualified, by the laws of a sister state, is entitled to maintain and enforce those rights in this state.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">In the states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas and Louisiana, the above-stated principle has not been followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">We think that the statement in Corpus Juris is substantiated by a great majority of the reported cases in this country and is the law in this country. To hold otherwise would take from a great many persons a method which they have of purchasing personal property upon credit, and in many cases might make it impossible for them to acquire necessary property.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">The prayer of the Maryland chattel mortgage creditor to draw the fund in question out of court is, therefore, granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
