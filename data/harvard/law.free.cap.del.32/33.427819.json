Many of the reported cases, and the text-book writers state four essential elements as constituting a voidable preference, viz. insolvency of the debtor, the giving of the preference within four months of bankruptcy, the security to the creditor of a greater percentage of his debt than others, and knowledge by the preferred creditor that he was getting a preference. However, in the same cases, whenever a statement of the declaration appears in the report of the case, there is some statement of the nature and origin of the indebtedness. And we think properly so, for the fact that the declaration must contain allegations of four essentials of a voidable preference should not excuse the necessity of alleging other material facts ordinarily required by the principles of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-12\">We believe the statements \u201cunsecured creditor\u201d and \u201cantecedent debt,\u201d as used in the declaration, are statements of legal conclusions and are practically equivalent to a statement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>bankrupt was indebted to the defendant, and the reported cases hold such a general statement of indebtedness to be a statement of a legal conclusion and, therefore, insufficient. <em>Larimore v.

E. </em>1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">For the reasons stated the demurrer is sustained to both counts of the declaration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
