This rule is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-12\">\u201cMotions * * * for new trials shall be made and the reasons filed within four days next after the trial, if the court shall sit so long; and if it do not, then during the term.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-14\">In computing time, either under a rule of court or a statute, in the absence of anything showing a contrary intent, the first day should ordinarily be excluded, but the day on which the act is to be done should be included. <em>Robinson v. Waddington, </em>66 <em>E. C. L. </em>753; <em>Barnes v. Eddy, </em>12 <em>R. I. </em>25; In <em>re Goswiler\u2019s Estate, </em>3 <em>Pen. &amp; W. (Pa.) </em>200; In <em>re Senate Resolution, </em>9 <em>Colo. </em>632, 21 <em>Pac. </em>475; In <em>re Fortner, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>461; <em>Underwood v. Jeans, </em>4 <em>Harr. </em>201.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-16\">Neither <em>Robinson v. Collins, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>498, nor <em>Warrington v. Tull, </em>5 <em>Harr. </em>107, are inconsistent with this rule. In the former case the statute provided that process should be served \u201cat least four days before\u201d the day set for appearance, while in the latter case it provided that the day for appearance should not be \u201cless than five days after the day of the date\u201d of the summons.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>Both cases involved the construction of different sections of the same statute, and the court merely held that the statute contemplated that both days should be excluded in computing time. <em>Content &amp; Co. v. Bay State Gas Co., 4 Penn. </em>214, 221, 57 <em>Atl. </em>291; <em>Jones v. Hinderer, </em>7 <em>Boyce </em>516, 108 <em>Atl. </em>737, and <em>Chambers v. Jones, </em>1 <em>Penn. </em>209, 39 <em>Atl. </em>1098, are to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">Under the usual method of calculating time, the day on which the verdict was rendered in this case should be excluded, but the day of filing the reasons for a new trial should be included; the four days allowed by the rule, therefore, expired on Sunday, December 11, 1921.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">But the real question is whether the prothonotary\u2019s office being closed on that day <em>(Chapter </em>3, \u00a7 3, <em>Rev. Code </em>1893), the reasons for the new trial should have been filed not later than Saturday, December 10th, or whether the defendant complied with the rule in filing them on the following Monday. There is considerable confusion in the authorities on this question in both England and America. <em>Ency. Pl. &amp; Pr., vol. </em>30, <em>p. </em>1204; <em>Amer. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, vol. </em>28, <em>p. </em>224. In both countries, it has frequently been expressly held or intimated that where the last day for doing an act falls on Sunday, performace on the succeeding day, while good as to a rule of court, or a judicial order, is not ordinarily sufficient where a statute is involved. <em>Hughes v. Griffith, </em>106 <em>E. C. L. </em>323; <em>Morris v. Barrett, </em>97 <em>E. C. L. </em>138 (7 <em>C. B. &amp; S.); Peacock v. Queen, </em>93 <em>E. C. L. </em>262; <em>Milbourn v. Lyster, </em>5 <em>Sim. </em>565 (58 <em>Eng. Repr. </em>451); 2 <em>Stri. </em>87 (93 <em>Eng. Repr. </em>401); <em>American Tobacco Co. v. Strickling, </em>88 <em>Md. </em>500, 41 <em>Atl. </em>1083, 69 <em>L. R. A. </em>909; <em>Atkinson v. Merritt, </em>3 <em>N. Y. Super. Ct. </em>667; <em>Cooley v. Cook, </em>125 <em>Mass. </em>406; <em>Simmons v. Hanne, </em>50 <em>Fla. </em>267, 39 <em>South. </em>77, 7 <em>Ann. Cas. </em>322; <em>Anonymous, </em>2 <em>Hill (N. Y.) </em>375, note.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">And a further distinction has sometimes been made between cases where the act in controversy is to be done by a party to the proceeding, and where it is to be done by the court. Where it is to be done by the court it has in some cases been held that it must be on a day when it can be performed, and that Sundays and holidays, when they occur on the last day for performance, should, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>therefore, be excluded in computing time. <em>Hughes v. Griffith, </em>106 <em>E. C. L. </em>323 <em>(supra); Von de Place v. Weller, </em>64 <em>N. J. Law </em>155, 44 <em>Atl. </em>874.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Whether a statute, rule of court, or judicial order be involved, the question whether a Sunday shall be counted, when that is the last day on which the act is to be done, is still one of interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">When the day for performance under a contract falls on Sunday, where no contrary intent appears, that day is usually excluded in construing contracts, and performance on the next day is good. <em>Von de Place v. Weller, </em>64 <em>N. J. Law </em>155, 44 <em>Atl. </em>874; <em>Hammond v. Amer. Mutual Life, </em>10 <em>Gray (Mass.) </em>306; <em>Craig v. Butler, </em>83 <em>Hun. </em>286, 31 <em>N. Y. Supp. </em>963; <em>Northey v. B. Life Ass\u2019n., </em>110 <em>Cal. </em>547, 42 <em>Pac. </em>1079; <em>Anonymous, 2 Hill (N. Y.) </em>375, note; <em>Porter v. Pierce, </em>120 <em>N. Y. </em>217, 221, 24 <em>N. E. </em>281, 7 L. <em>R. A. </em>847; <em>Owen v. Howard Ins. Co., </em>87 <em>Ky. </em>571, 10 S. <em>W. </em>119.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">Where no contrary intent appears, the better and more reasonable rule, therefore, seems to be that where a given number of days is allowed to do an act, or it is said an act may be done within a given number of days, and whether it be by rule of court, judicial order or statute, Sundays are counted if one or more occur within the time, unless the last day falls on Sunday, in which case the act may be done on the next day. <em>Barnes v. Eddy, </em>12 <em>R. I. </em>25; <em>In re Goswiler\u2019s Estate, </em>3 <em>Pen. &amp; W. (Pa.) </em>200; <em>Monroe Cattle Co. v. Becker, </em>147 <em>U. S. </em>47, 55, 13 <em>Sup. Ct. </em>217, 37 <em>L. Ed. </em>72; <em>Schepel v. Mellen, </em>3 <em>Mont. </em>118, 126, and 127; <em>In re Senate Resolution, </em>9 <em>Colo. 632, </em>21 <em>Pac. </em>475.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Applying this rule, the reasons assigned for granting a new trial were filed within the prescribed time, but the motion was denied for other reasons.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
