The objection of lack of opportunity to cross-examine the deceased witness is met by the fact that the state had full opportunity to cross-examine him when he testified at the former trial. <em>Stephen\u2019s Digest on Evidence, </em>107; <em>Chamberlayne\u2019s Hand Book on Evidence, </em>642; <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence, vol. </em>1, \u00a7\u00a7 227, 228; <em>Underhill\u2019s Criminal Evidence, </em>\u00a7 261; 8 <em>R. C. L.

Hosea, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>397. See also <em>Rogers v. Rogers, </em>6 <em>Penn. </em>267, 66 <em>Atl. </em>374.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">The evidence is therefore admitted; whether it would, however, be admissible if offered by the state, might present a different question.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
