It appears that this rule proved unsatisfactory in England as early as 1795, but it continued to be the rule until 1850, when it was changed by statute. 26 <em>R. C. L. </em>732, 38 <em>Cyc. </em>311.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-13\">This rule has not been followed in this country, and the great weight of authority now holds that the word \u201cmonth,\u201d when used without words of qualification, means a month as designated in the calendar without regard to the number of days contained therein. 38 <em>Cyc. </em>312; 26 <em>R. C. L. </em>732; <em>Guaranty Trust &amp; Safe Deposit Co. v. Buddington, </em>27 <em>Fla. </em>215, 9 <em>South. </em>246, 12 <em>L. R. A. </em>770; <em>Brewer v. Harris, </em>5 <em>Grat. </em>(Va.) 285; <em>Daley v. Anderson, </em>7 <em>Wyo. </em>1, 48 <em>Pac. </em>839, 75 <em>Am. St. Rep. </em>870; <em>Strong v. Birchard, </em>5 <em>Conn. </em>357.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-14\"><em>Chapter </em>1 <em>of the Revised Code of </em>1915, under the heading of \u201cRules of Construction of Statutes,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-15\">\u201cThe word \u2018month\u2019 shall be construed to mean a calendar month, unless otherwise expressed,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>The real question in this case is whether the publication made on July 29, August 5, 12, 19, and 26 amounts to a publication for one month as required by the statue. The alias summons was issued to the present term of court, which began on September 18th, and the first publication was made on July 29th, continuing on August 5, 12, 19 and 26; one each week, during the entire calendar month of August, and three of the dates of publication, namely, July 29, August 5 and 12, being more than a calendar month before court convened. Certainly this publication was sufficient. It seems to us that publication, as used in our divorce act, means notice to the public generally, all persons including the defendant, that the action is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">In the case of <em>Griffith v. Griffith, 1 W. W. Harr. (31 Del.), </em>1, 108 <em>Atl. </em>209 ,the first publication of the alias summons was on the 4th of October and the next term of court, being the second term after the issuing of the original writ, began on the 3d of November; in that case our court held the publication was not for one month and, therefore, insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We feel that the provision of the statute is complied with when there is a publication for five successive weeks, provided that at least the first publication shall be made a calendar month, or more, before the convening of court as was done in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Let a decree nisi be entered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
