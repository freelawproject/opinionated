All these elements are present in this case. The plaintiff has testified that she was present at the trial and personally knew of the conviction and sentence. The forgiveness and resumption of marital relations will be assumed from the birth of a child to the plaintiff in June, 1921, the father of which is admitted to be the defendant. We are clear that from the present state of the record the decree of divorce cannot be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
