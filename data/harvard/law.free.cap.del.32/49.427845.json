One of the exceptions is where, as in an action of this kind, the defendant relies on self-defense. In such cases we think the great weight of authority in this country holds that evidence of the violent character of the plaintiff, when known to the defendant at the time of the assault, is admissible. We, therefore, overrule the objection.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
