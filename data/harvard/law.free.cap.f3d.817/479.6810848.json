He was found in the United States during the course of a traffic stop when a police officer learned that occupants of the stopped vehicle, including Del Castillo-Barron, were not United States citizens and possessed no documents authorizing their presence in the country.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac4\">On appeal, Del Castillo-Barron argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained following the traffic stop. In support of his argument, Del Castillo-Barron contends that the officer conducting the stop exceeded his jurisdiction under Mississippi state law because the stop occurred at a location where' the officer lacked authority to act.</p>\n<p id=\"Asg\">The relevant question is whether the officer, in conducting the traffic stop, violated the Fourth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>960 F.2d 409, 415 (5th Cir.1992). Issues regarding local law-enforcement jurisdiction do not govern in a federal criminal action.' <em>Id.; United States v. Hernandez-Acuna, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 736, 744 (5th Cir.2006). Del Castillo-Barron does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that the traffic stop conformed with the standard set forth in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). The district court, therefore, properly denied the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"ApD\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
