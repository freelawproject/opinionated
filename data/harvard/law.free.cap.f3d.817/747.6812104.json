R.Civ.P. 60(b)(4) motion to vacate a $2,500,000 default judgment against it as void for lack of service of process. The district court granted the default judgment in favor of De Gazelle Group, Inc. (\u201cDe Gazelle\u201d), a Florida corporation, on De Gazelle\u2019s breach-of-contract claim against Ta-maz. On appeal, Tamaz argues that the district court erred in concluding that De Gazelle had properly served it using Federal Express (\u201cFedEx\u201d), when that means of service is not specifically authorized by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4 and De Gazelle had not received prior court authorization to serve Tamaz using that method. After careful review, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">Generally, we review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion to vacate a default judgment under the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Louis Vuitton Malletier, S.A. v. Mosseri, </em>736 F.3d 1339, 1350 (11th Cir.2013). However, we review the denial of a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to vacate a default judgment as void for lack of service of process <em>de novo, </em>because the district court\u2019s failure to vacate a void judgment is <em>per se </em>an abuse of discretion. <em>See Architectural Ingenier\u00eda Siglo XXI, LLC v. Dominican Republic, </em>788 F.3d 1329, 1337-38 (11th Cir.2015); <em>Oldfield v. Pueblo de Bahia Lora, S.A., </em>558 F.3d 1210, 1217-18 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-13\">The Supreme Court has said this about the service-of-process requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-14\">Before a federal court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, the procedural requirement of service of summons must be satisfied. Service of summons is the procedure by which a court having venue and jurisdiction of the subject matter of the suit asserts jurisdiction over the person of the party served. Thus, before a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, there must be more than notice to the defendant and a constitutionally suf-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>f\u00edcient relationship between the defendant and the forum. There must also be a basis for the defendant\u2019s amenability to service of summons. Absent consent, this means there must be authorization for service of summons on the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><em>Omni Capital Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff &amp; Co., Ltd., </em>484 U.S. 97, 104, 108 S.Ct. 404, 98 L.Ed.2d 415 (1987) (quotation, citation, and alteration omitted), <em>superseded on other grounds by </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(k)(2) (1993). As such, \u201can individual or entity is not obliged to engage in litigation unless officially notified of the action ... under a court\u2019s authority, by formal process.\u201d <em>Prewitt Enters., Inc. v. Org. of Petroleum Exporting Countries, </em>353 F.3d 916, 925 (11th Cir.2003) (quotation and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Pursuant, to Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(h), corporations may be served outside the United States \u201cin any manner prescribed by Rule 4(f) for serving an individual, except personal delivery under (f)(2)(C)(i).\u201d Fed.

The methods prescribed in Rule 4(f) for serving an individual outside the United States include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-6\">(1) by any internationally agreed means of service that is reasonably calculated to give notice, such as those authorized by the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra- . judicial Documents;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-8\">(2) if there is no internationally agreed - means, or if an international agreement allows but does not specify other means, by a method that is reasonably calculated to give notice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-9\">(A) as prescribed by the foreign country\u2019s law for service in that country in an action in its courts of general jurisdiction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-10\">(B) as the foreign authority directs in response to a letter rogatory or letter of request; or \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-11\">(C)unless prohibited by the foreign country\u2019s law, by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAzt\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-12\">(ii) using any form of mail that the clerk addresses and sends to the individual and that requires a signed receipt; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b777-13\">(3)by other means not prohibited by international agreement, as the court orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b777-14\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-15\">In this'case, De Gazelle sent its summons and complaint via Federal Express to Tamaz\u2019s post office box in Saudi Arabia, care of the company\u2019s registered agent, Faisal Mubarak Althawadi. FedEx delivered the package on Saturday, September 21, 2013. When Tamaz did not respond to the complaint within 21 days, De Gazelle moved for a clerk\u2019s default. A magistrate judge denied the motion, on the grounds that (1) De Gazelle had provided no authority for service via Federal Express, (2) the summons was delivered to an unidentified \u201cReeeptionist/Front Desk\u201d at a post office box, and (3) service occurred- on a Saturday,*-which was a weekend day in Saudi Arabia. -</p>\n<p id=\"b777-16\">Subsequently, De Gazelle moved to extend the time for service and moved for authorization,, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(f)(3), to serve-Tamaz via FedEx. In support, De Gazelle submitted a print-out of an online inquiry, which was sent by \u201cFaisal\u201d to a professional services referral website, Scorpion Design, and which, coincidentally, was forwarded to De Gazelle\u2019s counsel. The inquiry stated (in broken English): \u201cI have lawsuit against[] me from company in Florida they would like you to find[ ] out that and raise lawsuit against them compensation for damage please let me know and the details of fees.\u201d De Gazelle\u2019s counsel responded to the email, informing \u201cFaisal\u201d that because his firm represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>De Gazelle he had a direct conflict of interest and could not represent Tamaz. Counsel also noted that De Gazelle had \u201cfiled suit, and [was] in the process of procuring \u00e1 default final judgment against [Tamaz] in the federal courts of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Based on this evidence, the magistrate judge found that Tamaz was aware of De Gazelle\u2019s lawsuit and had not been prejudiced by \u201cany irregularities\u201d in the method of process used by De Gazelle. The magistrate judge then granted De Gazelle\u2019s motion to serve Tamaz via Federal Express and found that service had been retroactively effected on September 21, 2013. The district court later entered a final default judgment against Tamaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">After De Gazelle took steps to enforce the default judgment through the Saudi Arabian courts, Tamaz moved to vacate the default judgment on several grounds, including that the judgement was void for lack of service of process. The magistrate judge recommended that the district court deny the motion, noting his earlier determination that \u201cgood service was effected on Defendant and that [the court] had jurisdiction to. enter judgment in this case.\u201d The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and denied Tamaz\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">On appeal, Tamaz argues that the district court erred in concluding that De Gazelle effected good service on September 21, 2013, because De Gazelle failed to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(f)(3) by seeking prior court authorization for, service via FedEx.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree. As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cbefore a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant ... there must be authorization for service of summons on the defendant.\u201d <em>Omni Capital, </em>484 U.S. at 104, 108 S.Ct. 404. If a party cannot, or chooses not to, serve- a defendant abroad using one of the methods specified in Rule 4(f)(1) and (2), the party may accomplish service \u201cby other means not prohibited by international agreement, <em>as the court orders\u201d, </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(f)(3) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">When De Gazelle FedExed the summons and complaint to Tamaz\u2019s post office box on September 21, 2013, it was not acting pursu\u00e1nt to a court order. In fact, De Gazelle did not seek court authorization to serve Tamaz via Federal Express until the magistrate judge denied its first motion .for a default judgment on the ground that De Gazelle failed to show that service via FedEx was authorized under Rule 4. The magistrate judge\u2019s reliance, in later finding that service had been effected on September'21, 2013, on evidence showing that Althawadi, Tamaz\u2019s registered agent, had actual notice of the-'lawsuit was misplaced, since notice does not confer personal jurisdiction on a defendant when it has not been served in accordance with Rule 4. <em>See Omni Capital, </em>484 U.S. at 104, 108 S.Ct. 404 (\u201c[B]efore a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a defendant, there must be more than notice to the defendant_There also must; be ... au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>thorization for service of summons on the defendant.\u201d); <em>Prewitt, </em>353 F.3d at 925 (\u201c[EJven though OPEC had actual notice of the filing of the suit, service of process was ineffective because it was clearly not in substantial compliance with the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(f)(2)(C)(\u00fc).\u201d); <em>see also Brockmeyer v. May, </em>383 F.3d 798, 806 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that, under Rule 4(f)(3), plaintiffs \u201cmust obtain <em>prior </em>court approval for the alternative method' of serving process\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">Accordingly, the district court erred in concluding that Tamaz had been properly served on September 21, 2013. We reverse the order denying Tamaz\u2019s motion to vacate the default judgment as void for lack of service of process, and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b778-7\">. In its responsive brief, De Gazelle ,contends that Tamaz has waived this argument because Tam\u00e1z did not specifically argue in the district court that prior court approval was required. Our review of the record, however, shows that Tamaz indeed argued that De .Gazelle\u2019s attempt at service on September 21, 2013, did not comply with the requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(f)(3). Even to the extent the argument at issue here was not preserved, we would exercise our discretion to- review it, because whether Rule 4(f)(3) requires prior court authorization is a pure question of law, and our failure to address- Tamaz\u2019s argument here would result in a miscarriage of justice, namely, the enforcement of a $2,500,000 default judgment against it, where it was never served in compliance with Rule 4. <em>See Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Fernandez, </em>741 F.2d 355, 360-61 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AR60\">.
