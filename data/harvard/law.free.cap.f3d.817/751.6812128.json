The District Court held that the petition was untimely b\u00e1sed on the limitations period in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). Mr. West-moreland told the court that his limitations period was tolled (which is to say paused) by the pendency of an extraordinary motion for new trial he filed in Georgia state court. He also repeatedly asked the state to turn over a copy of this motion. Each time Mr. Westmoreland asked, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>insisted that it had given the District Court all the records the court needed. The court decided the issue without seeing Mr. Westmoreland\u2019s state-court motion. This Court then granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on these issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">(1) Whether the proper filing of a Georgia extraordinary motion for new trial tolls the time period for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254-petition, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2); and if so, whether Westmoreland\u2019s Georgia extraordinary motion for new trial was properly filed; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\">(2) If a Georgia extraordinary motion for new-trial is a tolling motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2), and Westmoreland properly filed his extraordinary motion, whether the district court erred by dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition .as time-barred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">After our Court granted this COA, the state acknowledged that it had been wrong all along. The state now agrees that Mr. Westmoreland\u2019s petition is timely. We agree too. We thus reverse and remand.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a habeas petition as untimely. <em>Day v. Hall, </em>528 F.3d 1315, 1316 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam). Federal habeas petitions that challenge state-court judgments must be filed within a year of \u201cthe latest of\u2019 one of four triggering dates, including \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). This one-year limitations period is tolled while \u201ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2244(d)(2). An application is considered \u201cfor\u201d collateral review if it seeks \u201ca judicial reexamination of a judgment- or claim -in a proceeding outside of the direct review process.\u201d <em>Wall v. Kholi, </em>562 U.S. 545, 553, 131 S.Ct. 1278, 1285, 179 L.Ed.2d 252 (2011). And an application is considered \u201cproperly filed\u201d if \u201cits delivery and acceptance are in compliance with the applicable laws and rules governing filings.\u201d <em>Artuz v. Bennett, </em>531 U.S. 4, 8, 121 S.Ct. 361, 364, 148 L.Ed.2d 213 (2000). Also, if a properly filed state application is denied, then the time for appealing this denial tolls the federal filing deadline. <em>See Cramer v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>461 F.3d 1380, 1383 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). This is true \u201cregardless of whether the inmate actually files the notice of appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>So long as the applicant was allowed to appeal, the limitations period is tolled \u201cuntil the-time to seek review expires.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b781-12\">In Georgia, a motion for new trial filed more than 30 days after a judgment is entered is called an \u201cextraordinary\u201d motion for new trial. O.C.G.A. \u00a7 5-5-41(b). This Court has never decided whether a Georgia extraordinary motion for new trial is an- application for collateral review, though we have said such a motion is \u201cin the nature of a collateral proceeding.\u201d <em>Mize v. Hall, </em>532 F.3d 1184, 1191 n. 5 (11th Cir.2008). And the Georgia Supreme Court has explained that an ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>traordinary motion for new trial is one of three ways to \u201cchallenge a conviction after it has been affirmed on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Thomas v. State, </em>291 Ga. 18, 727 S.E.2d 123, 123 (2012). (The other . two are \u201ca motion in arrest of judgment\u201d and \u201ca petition for .habeas corpus.\u201d <em>Id.) </em>We thus hold that a Georgia extraordinary motion for new trial can be an \u201capplication for State post-conviction or other collateral review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Mr.- Westmoreland\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is timely. Mr. Westmoreland\u2019s conviction became final' on October 25, 2010. He thus had until October 25, 2011, to file his federal petition. Mr. Westmoreland properly filed an extraordinary motion for new trial in the Georgia trial court on May 2, 2011. This was a motion for collateral review, so while it was pending the one-year clock froze at 189 days (the number of days between October 25, 2010 and May 2, 2011). The state trial court denied-the motion on the merits on June 9, 2011. Mr. Westmoreland had 30 days to appeal this denial. <em>See </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 5-6-35(d). This means the clock did not start again until at least July 9, 2011. Mr. Westmoreland then properly filed his state habeas petition on October 28, 2011. This was 111 days after July 9. 189 plus 111 is 300, so his filing was within \u00a7 2244(d)\u2019s one-year period and'further tolled this period. Mr. Westmoreland then-filed his federal petition on May 1, 2014, before his state petition was denied on June 27, 2014. This means he was still within his one-year time for filing when he filed his federal petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The District Court dismissed Mr. West-moreland\u2019s petition without properly considering the effect of the extraordinary motion for new trial. The state bears much responsibility for this mistake. Shortly after Mr. Westmoreland filed his federal petition, the District Court ordered the state to file all \u201cpleadings, transcripts and decisions as are available and required to determine the issues raised.\u201d The state responded by moving to dismiss the petition as untimely. Mr. Westmoreland then asked the court to order the state to make his extraordinary, motion for new trial a part of the district court record. The state objected, claiming it had \u201calready filed all relevant exhibits that are germane to resolving the issue of the timeliness of this petition.\u201d Mr. Westmoreland then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2250 request for a copy of the same motion. The state again objected, repeating that it had \u201calready filed all relevant exhibits that are. germane to resolving the issue of the timeliness of this petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">In this Court, the state reports that it \u201chas examined the trial court\u2019s public record in Petitioner\u2019s criminal case and does not dispute Petitioner\u2019s contentions.\u201d The state thus concedes that \u201cthe petition was timely filed\u201d because the \u201cone-year period should have been tolled while the extraordinary motion for new trial was pending in the Georgia courts.\u201d If the state had made this concession back in'2014, when Mr. Westmoreland repeatedly pointed the state\u2019s attention to his state-court motion, then the District Court would have had the means to decide the timeliness issue correctly the first time around. Instead, the state repeatedly told-the District Court that it had given the court everything \u201cgermane to resolving\u201d-the-'timeliness issue, the District Court relied on this representation, Mr. Westmoreland was delayed two more years in prison, and this Court had to issue 'an apparently unnecessary COA and decide an unnecessary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-10\">Even with its admission that Mr. Westmoreland\u2019s federal petition is timely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>the state says we should affirm the District Court anyway because Mr. West-moreland failed to exhaust state remedies. The COA did not cover the exhaustion issue. To the contrary, the COA order expressly stated that, \u201cshould this Court ultimately conclude that [Mr. Westmore-land\u2019s] \u00a7 2254 petition was timely filed, the district court will determine any issues of exhaustion, procedural default, and cause and prejudice in the first instance.\u201d. We thus decline the state\u2019s invitation to consider the exhaustion issue now. When considering the exhaustion issue on remand, the District Court must determine whether cause and prejudice excuse any possible failure to exhaust. If not, then the court must determine if a stay and abeyance is proper while Mr. Westmoreland exhausts state remedies; <em>See Rhines v. Weber, </em>544 U.S. 269, 277-78, 125 S.Ct. 1528, 1535, 161 L.Ed.2d 440 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\">. The state also filed a motion asking this Court to expand the appellate record to include Mr. Westmoreland's extraordinary motion for new trial and the order denying that motion, plus documents that purported to show Mr. Westmoreland\u2019s failure to exhaust state remedies. We grant the motion as to the extraordinary motion for new trial (Exhibit 5) as well as the order denying the motion (Exhibit 6). We deny it as to all the other exhibits because, as explained in part III, we are not addressing exhaustion at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"Aku\">Mr. Westmoreland also filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for leave to file a reply brief out of time. We grant this motion. ,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
