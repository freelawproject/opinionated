Mays was convicted of two counts of being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was then sentenced pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA). Relying on <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>570 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013), and <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>576 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015), Mays asserts his sentence under \u00a7 924(e)(1) is illegal. Specifically, he argues that, in light of <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>he does not have the number of qualifying prior convictions required to trigger a \u00a7 924(e)(1) sentence and, therefore, his sentence under the section is unlawful. We agree and find that Mays\u2019s sentence is illegal. Although <em>Des-camps </em>and <em>Johnson </em>were decided after Mays\u2019s conviction and sentence became final, we hold that both eases apply retroactively in the first post-conviction context. Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Mays\u2019s motion and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-17\">I. SENTENCING UNDER THE ACCA</p>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">To provide the legal context for Mays\u2019s appeal, we begin with a brief discussion of <em>Descamps, Johnson, </em>and the relevant portions of \u00a7 924(e). Under \u00a7 924(e)(1), \u201ca person who violates 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) and has three previous convictions for a violent felony or a serious drug offense is Subject to additional fines and a fifteen-year minimum sentence (and has an enhanced guidelines sentence under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Petite, </em>703 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defines a violent felony as \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d that: (1) \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d; (2) \u201cis burglary, arson, or extortion [or] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>involves use of explosives\u201d; or (3) \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). These three \u201cclauses\u201d are known as the \u201celements clause,\u201d the \u201cenumerated clause,\u201d and the \u201cresidual clause,\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">The Court in <em>Descamps </em>addressed our approach to determining, whether a crime constitutes a violent felony under the enumerated clause. The enumerated clause only includes.prior convictions fpr \u201cgener.ic\u201d versions of the offenses it lists. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281. There are two approaches for determining whether an offense is generic: the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and the \u201cmodified categorical approach.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Under the categorical approach, we \u201ccompare the elements of the statute forming the basis of the defendant\u2019s conviction with the elements of. the generic crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe prior conviction qualifies as an ACCA predicate only if the statute\u2019s elements are the same as, or narrower than, those of the generic offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, under the modified categorical approach, we may look beyond the statutory elements of the prior conviction and consider a \u201climited class of documents, such as indictments and jury instructions,\u201d to determine whether the conviction was for a generic offense. <em>See id. </em>In <em>Descamps, </em>the Supreme Court held that this analysis can only be performed if the statute in question is \u201cdivisible,\u201d meaning that it \u201csets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 2281-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In <em>Johnson, </em>the Supreme Court considered a constitutional challenge to the residual cause and determined that the clause is unconstitutionally vague. <em>Johnson, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2557. - As such, a defendant cannot be sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1) unless he has at least three prior convictions that each meet the criteria of either the elements clause or the enumerated clause. <em>See id. </em>at 2563.,</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Mays was sentenced to two concurrent terms of 15 years\u2019 imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1). The sentencing court imposed a \u00a7 924(e)(1) sentence based on two prior convictions for possession of marijuana for other than personal use under Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) and one prior conviction for third degree burglary under Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-7-7. The marijuana convictions were found to be s\u00e9ri\u00f3\u00fcs drug offenses and the burglary conviction was determined to be a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">In. July 2012, Mays filed a pro se \u00a7 2255 motion for habeas relief, arguing that he received ineffective assistance of. counsel during his direct appeal. Soon thereafter, the Supreme Court decided <em>Descamps. </em>In August 2013, Mays filed a notice with the district court alleging he was wrongfully sentenced pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1). Specifically, he asserted that, under <em>Descamps,, </em>his burglary conviction was not a violent felony. He also generally claimed that his sentence is illegal because he does not have at least three prior qualifying convictions under \u00a7 924(e)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Government responded that Mays was procedurally barred from making such an argument by \u00a7 2255\u2019s period of limitations. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7. 2255(f)(3).' The Government also argued that Mays\u2019s burglary conviction is a violent felony, under the residual clause and, therefore, <em>Descamps </em>\u2014 which had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>effect on the residual clause \u2014 did not render Mays\u2019s sentence illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">The district court accepted the Government\u2019s period of limitations defense and dismissed Mays\u2019s challenge to his sentence as time-barred. The court also denied Mays\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. This court granted a certif\u00edcate of appealability (COA) on three issues: (1) whether the district court erred by denying Mays\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim; (2) whether the district court erred in dismissing Mays\u2019s claim that his sentence is illegal under <em>Descamps-, </em>and (3) whether the district court abused its discretion by denying Mays\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Mays was appointed counsel prior to filing his brief on appeal. A few months after Mays submitted his brief, the Supreme Court decided <em>Johnson, </em>which prompted him to file a notice of supplemental authority. In the notice, Mays stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that <em>Johnson </em>disposed of the Government\u2019s argument that his burglary conviction is a violent felony under the residual clause. Following this notice, the Government and Mays submitted a joint motion for resentencing. In the motion, the Government agreed to withdraw its period of limitations defense against Mays\u2019s challenge to his sentence, and Mays agreed to dismiss his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. The Government also conceded that, in light of <em>Johnson, </em>it believes Mays\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 924(e)(1) is unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">After receiving Mays\u2019s notice of supplemental authority and the parties\u2019 joint motion for resentencing, we requested supplemental briefing on several issues related to Johnson\u2019s application to this case. In its responding supplemental briefing, the Government stated that it is waiving non-retroactivity as a defense to Mays\u2019s <em>Des-camps </em>and <em>Johnson </em>arguments. The Government also reiterated its withdrawal of its period of limitations defense to Mays\u2019s challenge to his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b760-9\">The dispositive issue before us is whether Mays\u2019s \u00a7 924(e)(1) sentence is unlawful. This issue turns on two questions of law: whether (1) <em>Descamps </em>and (2) <em>Johnson </em>apply retroactively to Mays despite being decided after his conviction and sentence became final. If both <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Johnson </em>apply retroactively to Mays \u2014 a first time habeas petitioner \u2014 then his burglary conviction is not a qualifying conviction under \u00a7 924(e)(1), and his sentence is illegal because he does not have at least three qualifying convictions. Accordingly, in considering the legality of Mays\u2019s sentence, we focus our analysis on resolving these <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Johnson </em>\u201cretroactivity\u201d questions. However, we first briefly discuss a threshold procedural issue: the scope of the COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-10\">A. <em>Scope of the COA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b760-11\">All three issues included in the COA are now moot. Mays has withdrawn his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, thereby mooting the first COA issue. Furthermore, the \u201ctime-barred\u201d issue that the district court relied on in denying Mays\u2019s challenge to his sentence is moot because the Government has waived its period of limitations defense. <em>See Bryant v. Warden, FCC Coleman-Medium, </em>738 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.2013) (\u201c[T]he procedural-default rule is not jurisdictional [in the post-conviction context], but is an affirmative defense that is subject to waiver by the government.\u201d). Therefore, the second and third COA issues are also moot. Nonetheless, as noted above, the core issue raised by Mays before the district court \u2014 whether his sentence is legal \u2014 remains. Given this issue is not in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>eluded in the COA, we must consider whether the circumstances warrant expanding the COA to include it.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">We find that expansion of the C\u00d3A is clearly warranted. \u201cOn exceptional occasions,\u2019' we may expand a COA sua sponte to include issues that \u201creasonable jurists would find ... debatable.\u201d <em>See Dell v. United States, </em>710 F.3d 1267, 1272-73 (11th Cir.2013); <em>Thomas v. Crosby, </em>371 F.3d 782, 796 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201c[0]ur cases establish the power of our court to add issues to a COA sua sponte.\u201d); <em>Hodges v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>506 F.3d 1337, 1341-42 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cExceptional occasions\u201d include cases where we request supplement\u00e1l briefing on issues not included in the COA. <em>See Dell, </em>710 F.3d at 1272-73. Here, we requested supplemental briefing on issues related to the legality of Mays\u2019s sentence. In addition, as made apparent by the Government conceding that it believes Mays\u2019s sentence is illegal, this issue is. one \u201cthat reasonable jurists would find ... debatable.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1273. Lastly, if we did not expand the COA, remand to the district court would be necessary. But, whether Mays\u2019s sentence is illegal involves purely legal questions that would not benefit from remand. <em>See Reed v. Beto, </em>343 F.2d 723, 725 (5th Cir.1965) (\u201cPassing then to the merits of this argument, in view of its being a pure question of law, we see no need to remand it for a determination by the District Court.\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">B. <em>Legality of Mays\u2019s Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">Mays\u2019s challenge to his sentence turns on whether his Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-7-7 conviction for third degree burglary is a violent felony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We review de novo whether that burglary conviction qualifies as a violent felony. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>742 F.3d 1334, 1341 (11th Cir.2014). The only ACCA clauses that could apply to the conviction are the enumerated and residual clauses,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, we conclude that, in light of <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Johnson, </em>neither clause applies to Mays.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">1. Enumerated Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">At the time Mays was sentenced, an Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-7-7 third degree burglary conviction could qualify as a violent felony under the enumerated clause. <em>See United States v. </em>Rainer, 616 F.3d 1212, 1213, 1216 (11th Cir.2010). PostDescamps,\u2019 this is no longer the case. Based on <em>Descamps, </em>we held in\u2019 <em>Howard </em>that a conviction for third degree burglary cannot qualify as a violent felony under the enumerated clause because Alabama Code \u00a7 13A-7-7 is ah indivisible, non-generic statute. <em>Howard, </em>742 F.3d at 1348-49. Thus, if\u2019 Mays was sentenced today, the enumerated clause would not apply to his burglary conviction. But, given that Mays\u2019s conviction and sentence became final prior to <em>Descamps, </em>our analysis does not end here. We must consider whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Descamps </em>and <em>Howard </em>apply retroactively to Mays. This requires us to analyze <em>Des-camps </em>through the \u201cretroactivity\u201d framework set forth in <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989) and related Supreme Court cases. '</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In <em>Teague </em>and subsequent cases, the Supreme Court \u201claid out the framework to be used in determining whether a rule announced in one of [its] opinions should be applied retroactively to judgments in criminal cases that are already final.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Whorton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 416, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 1180, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007). \u201cUnder the <em>Teague </em>framework, an old rule applies both on direct and collateral review, but a new rule is generally applicable only to cases that are still on direct review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA new rule is defined as a rule that was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u201d' <em>Id. </em>at 416, 127 S.Ct. at 1181 (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Supreme Court and other circuits have recognized, <em>Descamps </em>did not announce a new rule \u2014 its holding merely clarified existing precedent. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2283 (\u201cOur easelaw explaining the categorical approach and its \u2018modified\u2019 counterpart all but resolves this case.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 2285 (\u201cThat is the job, <em>as we have always understood it, </em>of the modified approach....\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Ezell v. United States, </em>778 F.3d 762, 763 (9th Cir.2015) (\u201cWe hold that the Supreme Court did not announce a new rule of constitutional law in <em>Descamps. </em>Rather, it clarified \u2014 as a matter of statutory interpretation \u2014 application of the ACCA in light of existing precedent.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 136 S.Ct. 256, 193 L.Ed.2d 212 (2015); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>751 F.3d 769, 775 (6th Cir.2014) (\u201cThe Supreme Court in <em>Descamps </em>explained that it was not announcing a new rule, but was simply reaffirming\u201d an existing approach.).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">Given <em>Descamps </em>did not announce a new rule, it and <em>Howard </em>apply here. <em>See Whorton, </em>549 U.S. at 416, 127 S.Ct. at 1180. Under <em>Descamps </em>and <em>Howard, </em>third degree burglary convictions in Alabama cannot qualify as violent felonies under the enumerated clause. Accordingly, the enumerated clause does not apply to Mays\u2019s burglary conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">2. Residual Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Although we conclude that the enumerated clause does not apply, Mays\u2019s sentence could still be upheld if the residual clause is applicable. It is clear that the residual clause is unconstitutional under <em>Johnson, </em>but <em>Johnson </em>was also decided after Mays\u2019s conviction and sentence became final. Thus, as with <em>Descamps, </em>the dispositive \u201cresidual clause\u201d question before us is whether <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively in the present context.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This means we must again turn to Teague.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>As. noted above, under <em>Teague, </em>new rules .are not typically applicable to cases on collateral review. <em>Whorton, </em>549 U.S. at 416, 127 S.Ct. at 1180. However; the Supreme Court has established a general principle that new substantive rules and watershed rules of criminal procedure are not subject to this retroactivity bar;1' <em>See Montgomery v. Louisiana, </em>577 U.S. -, -, 136 S.Ct. 718, 728, 193 L.Ed.2d 599 (2016); <em>Schriro v. Summerlin, </em>542 U.S. 348, 351-52, 124 S.Ct. 2519, 2522, 159 L.Ed.2d 442 (2004); <em>Teague, </em>489 U.S. at 307-09, 109 S.Ct. at 1073-74. New substantive rules include, for example, \u201cdecisions that narrow the scope of' a criminal statute by interpreting its terms\u201d and \u201cconstitutional determinations that place particular conduct or persons covered by the statute beyond the State\u2019s power to punish.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 351-52, 124 S.Ct. at 2522. \u201cSuch rules apply retroactively because they necessarily carry a significant risk that a defendant stands convicted of an act that the law does not make criminal or faces a punishment that the law,cannot impose upon him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352, 124 S.Ct. at 2522-23 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under this framework, a new rule applies retroactively if: d\u00ed the Supreme Court holds the rule is not subject to the <em>Teague </em>retroactivity bar; or (2) the <em>Teague </em>principles of retroactivity established by the Court, such as those outlined above, provide for retroactive application of the rule. <em>See Tyler v. Cain, </em>533 U.S. 656, 663-66, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 2482-84, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1277-78 (finding a new rule retroactive based on the <em>Teague </em>principles of retroactivity but noting that, in the \u00a7 2255(h) context, only the Supreme Court can find a rule retroactive).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-12\">In <em>In re Rivero, </em>we held that <em>Johnson </em>established a new substantive rule. 797 F.3d 986, 989 (11th Cir.2015). Specifically, we found that <em>Johnson </em>\u201cnarrowed the class- of people who are eligible for an increased sentence under the\u201d ACCA. <em>Id. </em>In that case, we considered a federal prisoner\u2019s application to file a second- or successive- habeas petition. Such an application-may only be granted if it involves newly discovered evidence or \u201ca new rule of constitutional law, <em>made retroactive to cases on collateral revieiv by the Supreme Court, </em>that was previously unavailable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) (emphasis added). The prisoner in <em>Rivero </em>claimed <em>Johnson </em>satisfied the \u201cnew rule of constitutional law\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>A new rule is only made retroactive by the Supreme Court if the Court explicitly holds that the rule applies retroactively or such a holding results by \u201clogical necessity from multiple Court opinions. <em>Tyler, </em>533 U.S. at 668-70, 121 S.Ct. at 2485-86. \u201cThe Supreme Court does not make a rale retroactive when it merely establishes principles of retroactivity!, such as the <em>Teague </em>principles,] and leaves the application of those principles to lower' courts.\u201d <em>See id, </em>at 663, 121 S.Ct. at 2482 (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>Rivero, </em>we concluded that the Supreme Court has not explicitly held <em>Johnson </em>to be retroactive and \u201c[n]o combination of holdings of the Supreme Court \u2018necessarily dictate\u2019 that <em>Johnson </em>should be applied retroactively on collateral review.\u201d 797 F.3d at 989. Accordingly, we rejected the prisoner\u2019s argument that <em>Johnson </em>was \u201cmade retroactive ... by the Supreme Court,\u201d and we found that the prisoner failed to \u25a0 satisfy \u00a7 2255(h). <em>See id. \u25a0 </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">In contrast to <em>Rivero, </em>we are presented here with a prisoner\u2019s first habeas petition, not an application for a second or successive petition. As such, \u00a7 2255(h) and its \u201cmade retroactive ... by the Supreme Court\u201d requirement are 'not 'applicable. This means we must engage in a broader retroactivity analysis than we did in <em>Rive-ro. </em>In other words, <em>Rivero </em>is not controlling here. As noted above, the retroactivity analysis demanded by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h) is narrow \u2014 it is limited to whether the Supreme Court has explicitly, or by logical necessity, <em>made </em>a rule retroactive. <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1278 (stating that the Supreme Court\u2019s general ret-roactivity jurisprudence \u201cis quite different from the stricter, <em>statutory </em>retroactivity requirements in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(h)\u201d), Given that \u201cthe Supreme Court does not <em>make'a </em>rule retroactive when it merely festablishes principles of retroactivity and leaves the application of those principies to lower courts,\u201d a \u00a7 2255(h) analysis does not address such principles. <em>See Tyler, </em>533 U.S. at 663, 121 S.Ct. at 2482 (emphasis added); <em>Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1278. However, we may not ignore Supreme Court precedent regarding principles of retroactivity, such as the <em>Teague </em>principles, when \u00a7 2255(h) is not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-8\">Applying the <em>Teague </em>principles, <em>Johnson </em>is retroactive because it qualifies as a substantive rule.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> , First, we have already found that <em>Johnson </em>is a new substantive rule since it narrows the class of people that may be eligible for. a heightened sentence under the ACCA. <em>See Rivero, </em>797 F.3d at 989. Second, \u201ca significant risk exists that some defendants ... who were sentenced before <em>[Johnson </em>] have erroneously received the increased penalties under \u00a7 924(e) <em>and </em>now are serving prison terms ... that the law cannot impose upon them.\u201d <em>See Bryant, </em>738 F.3d at 1278 (citing <em>Schriro, </em>542 U.S. at 352, 124 S.Ct. at 2522-23) (internal quotation marks omitted). This case is demonstrative. Mays does not simply face a significant risk of unlawful punishment in light of <em>Johnson. </em>Unlawful punishment is guaranteed. <em>Johnson </em>\u201celiminated [the] State\u2019s power to ... impose [the very] punishment\u201d that Mays currently faces \u2014 a prison term based on the residual clause. <em>See Montgomery, </em>136 S.Ct. at 729-30 (discussing the scope of and rationale underlying the <em>Teague </em>substantive rale principle). Finally, <em>Rivero </em>supports a finding that <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively under the <em>Teague </em>principles. Referencing Schriro\u2019s conclusion that, under <em>Teague, </em>\u201cnew substantive rales generally apply retroactively on collateral re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>view,\u201d <em>Rivero </em>stated that <em>Johnson </em>would apply retroactively to a prisoner \u201cseeking a first collateral review of his sentence.\u201d <em>See Rivero, </em>797 F.3d at 991. Therefore, we hold that <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively on collateral review to prisoners seeking habeas relief for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">In light of our finding that <em>Johnson </em>applies retroactively to prisoners, like Mays, who are challenging their \u00a7 924(e)(1) sentence via an initial habeas petition, we conclude that Mays\u2019s burglary conviction cannot be considered a violent felony under the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">***</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">In sum, neither the enumerated clause nor the residual clause applies to Mays\u2019s burglary conviction. The conviction is, therefore, not a violent felony, and Mays has, at most, two qualifying prior convictions under \u00a7 924(e)(1). As a result, Mays\u2019s sentence is illegal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">We reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Mays\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate and remand this case to district court for resen-tencing, without the \u00a7 924(e)(1) enhancement. In resentencing Mays, the district court shall perform a fresh review of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v.

In its supplemental briefing, the Government states that it \"waives any non-retroactivity defense that would bar the application of <em>Descamps' </em>to the merits of Mays\u2019[s] claim.\u201d Based on this waiver, the Government asserts that we need not consider whether <em>Descamps </em>triggers a \u201cretroactivity\u201d analysis under <em>Teag-ue. </em>The Government takes a similar position with <em>Johnson. </em>However, <em>\u201cTeague </em>analysis is ordinarily our first step when we review a federal habeas case,\u201d and we have discretion to perform such analysis even where the Government completely fails to raise a <em>Teague </em>argument. <em>See Schiro v.

Under our precedent prior to <em>Johnson, </em>burglary convictions similar to Mays's qualified as violent felonies under the residual clause. <em>See United States v.

As an initial matter, the Government contends that we may not consider <em>Johnson </em>because Mays did not specifically raise any residual clause claims before the district court.

Although the latter type of substantive rule is often characterized as a <em>Teague </em>exception, the <em>Schriro </em>Court clarified that such a rule simply is not subject to the <em>Teague </em>retroactivity bar. 542 U.S. at 352, 124 S.Ct. at 2522 n. 4. Indeed, the principle that this type of substantive rule applies retroactively is independent of <em>Teague </em>\u2014 it arises from the Constitution. <em>See Montgomery, </em>136 S.Ct. at 729; <em>Mackey v.

Moreover, such an illegal sentence warrants habeas relief. Defendants convicted under \u00a7 922(g)(1) are subject to a 10-year statutory maximum sentence unless they qualify for \u00a7 924(e)(l)\u2019s 15-year minimum sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(a)(2), (e)(1). Hence, erroneously sentencing a defendant under \u00a7 924(e)(1) results in \"actual prejudice\u201d: a sentence 5 years above the applicable statutory maximum. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 1722, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Indeed, that sentencing error \"affect[s] [the defendant\u2019s] substantial rights and seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>See United States v.

Whether or not <em>Montgomery </em>also calls into question the retroactivity holding of <em>Rivero </em>itself (as to applications to file a second or successive motion to vacate based on <em>Johnson) </em>is a matter left for another day. I note also that <em>Montgomery, </em>which held that <em>Miller v.

That standard of review, however, does not call for a different result here. \u25a0 We have held that, - where a sentence exceeds the statutory maximum, plain error exists and needs to be corrected because it affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights as well as the. fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the judicial proceedings. . <em>See United States v. </em>Sanchez, 586 F.3d 918, 930 (11th Cir.2009).
