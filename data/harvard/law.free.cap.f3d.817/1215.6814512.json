Taohim contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict him and that, even if there was enough evidence, he is entitled to a new trial for other reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-15\">The United States is a party to an international agreement that regulates the discharge of garbage from vessels at sea: the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, (collectively referred to as \u201cMARPOL\u201d). MARPOL has b\u00e9en implemented in the United States by the Act to Prevent Polhition from Ships, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901-1915. Together, the Treaty and the Act prohibit vessels from throwing plastic overboard. MARPOL Annex V, Reg. 3(l)(a); 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1902(a)(3). They also require that vessels keep a \u201cgarbage record book,\u201d which is a written record of the date, time, and volume of all garbage discharges and the latitude and longitude of all discharges at sea. MAR-POL Annex V, Reg. 9(3)(a); 33 C;F.R. \u00a7 151.55.- The vessel\u2019s officer in charge must record each discharge in the garbage record book on the date of discharge, and the captain must' sign each completed page. 33 C.F.R, \u00a7. 151.55. The book must be maintained on the vessel for two years following the discharge and must be made available for inspection by the United States Coast Guard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1246-18\">Taohim was the Captain of the <em>M/V Gaumv Prem, </em>a cargo vessel operated and managed by Target Ship Management. Joel Atiga, the Chief Officer, was responsible for recording each garbage discharge in the garbage record book so that Taohim could review and sign it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1246-19\">On August 6, 2011, while the vessel was sailing for Panama, Captain Taohim ordered Chief Officer Atiga to throw some plastic pipes overboard. Atiga responded, \u201cSir, throwing the plastic into the sea is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1219\">*1219</page-number>prohibited, and you know that.\u201d Taohim said, \u201cJust follow, my orders.\u201d Taohim also told Atiga not to record the discharge of the plastic into the garbage record book. Atiga did not order the-crew to throw, the plastic- overboard that day because, he knew that it was illegal. The next - day, Taohim asked Atiga if he had thrown the pipes overboard, and he responded, \u201cNot yet.\u201d Taohim .again told Atiga to. follow his orders, and, fearing .he would be charged with insubordination and fired at the next port, Atiga ordered the crew to throw the plastic pipes overboard. The crew did that, as photographs introduced into evidence at trial show the pipes being thrown overboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-5\">Prom Panama, the vessel sailed to Mobile, Alabama and docked there in September 2011. The. United States Coast Guard conducted a Port State Control Inspection, which is routinely done to verify that foreign vessels are complying with conventions governing safety, pollution, cargo, and labor. While checking the vessel\u2019s compliance, the Coast Guard interviewed crew members and reviewed the records, including the garbage record book. During that inspection, two crewmembers' approached the Coast Guard officers and told them there was illegal activity onboard. The Coast Guard then interviewed other crew members who stated that they had been directed to throw plastic pipes overboard. The garbage record book, however, did not reflect any discharge of plastics overboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-6\">A grand jury issued a seven-count indictment against Taohim, Target Ship Management, and two other codefendants. Count One charged that Taohim corruptly influenced a Coast Guard proceeding by presenting the vessel\u2019s false garbage record book, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505. Count Four charged that Taohim knowingly caused the omission of information in the garbage record book with the intent to influence a .Coast Guard investigation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519. At Taohim\u2019s trial,, which was severed, from that of his codefendants, Chief Officer Atiga testified that Taohim told him to throw the plastic, overboard and to omit that discharge from the garbage record book. Taohim testified on his own behalf and denied telling any crewmembers to throw the pipes overboard. After the government\u2019s case in chief and again at the close of all the evidence, Taohim moved for a judgment of acquittal on both counts against him under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, arid the district court denied those motions. The jury found him guilty on both counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-8\">.In May 2012 Taohim filed a motion for a new trial based on allegedly improper comments made by-the prosecutor during, his closing argument. Taohim argued that the prosecutor improperly invoked religion, misstated Taohim\u2019s testimony, and made improper and misleading references to.whistleblowers. -The district court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-9\">Also in May 2012, Target Ship Management and the other two codefendants pleaded guilty to the counts against them. The court imposed, among other things, a $1,200,000 monetary penalty against Target Ship Management. On June 25, 2012, the government filed a motion asking the court to order that seven crewmembers who provided information leading to the successful prosecution of Target Ship Management be awarded $250,000 to be divided among them as whistleblower payments under 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1908, and the court granted that motion. Four of the seven crewmembers who received whistle-blower awards in the severed, proceedings had testified at Taohim\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1247-10\">On June 29, 2012, Taohim filed a motion in which he argued that a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1220\">*1220</page-number>was required based on \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that four of the witnesses Who testified at his trial had received whistle-blower awards for their testimony against Target Ship Management. The district court denied that motion, reasoning that the evidence was \u201cmerely impeaching evidence which was not material and would not have changed the result of the trial.\u201d Taohim appeals his convictions and the district court\u2019s denial of his motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Taohim contends that the government did not present enough evidence to convict him on either count. \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on sufficiency of evidence grounds.\u201d <em>United States v. Pena, </em>684 F.3d 1137, 1152 (11th Cir.2012). \u201cIn reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we look at the record in the light most favorable to the verdict and draw all reasonable inferences and resolve all questions of credibility in its favor.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>663 F.3d 1207, 1213 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted). \u201c[W]e will not disturb a guilty verdict unless, given the evidence in the record, no trier of .fact could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>643 F.3d 807, 856 (11th Cir.2011) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505, it is a crime to \u201ccorruptly ... influence[ ], obstruct ],' or impede[ ] or endeavor[ ] to influence, obstruct, or impede the due'and proper administration of the law under which any pending proceeding is being had before any department or agency of the United States.\u201d The term \u201ccorruptly\u201d means \u201cacting with an improper purpose, personally or by influencing another, including making a false or misleading statement, or withholding, concealing, altering, or: destroying a document or other information.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515(b). The jury in this case was instructed that the government had to establish three elements to support a conviction under \u00a7 1505: (1) that there was a pending agency proceeding; (2) that Taohim was aware of that proceeding; and (3) that Taohim \u201cintentionally endeavored corruptly to influence, obstruct, or impede the pending proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-9\">Taohim contends that the government failed to present evidence establishing the third element \u2014 that he \u201cintentionally endeavored corruptly\u201d to obstruct the Coast Guard\u2019s proceeding. He argues that he \u201ccould not have had \u2018corrupt\u2019 intent\u201d to influence the Coast Guard\u2019s investigation because it \u201cwas not even pending at the time the alleged omissions in the garbage record -book allegedly should have been recorded.\u201d Taohim, however, was not convicted of intentionally failing to record the discharge in the garbage record book. He was convicted of intentionally obstructing an agency proceeding by presenting a garbage record book that he knew was false because it omitted some entries, and there was enough evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict on that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-10\">Chief Officer Atiga testified that Taohim ordered him to throw plastic pipes overboard and to omit that discharge from the garbage record book. Atiga also testified that He told Taohim that it was illegal to throw plastic into the sea, and Taohim ordered him to do it anyway. Atiga further testified that before arriving in the port of Mobile, Taohim asked to see the garbage record book, and Atiga delivered it to his cabin. Coast Guard Petty Officer Gregory Spring testified that the garbage record book was made available for the Coast Guard to inspect and that his initial review did not show any plastic discharges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1221\">*1221</page-number>overboard. From that testimony, the jury reasonably could have inferred that Tao-him knew that the garbage record book did not include the discharge of plastic into the sea and that he made that fraudulent book available to the Coast Guard with the intent to interfere with its investigation, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505.-</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Moreover, \u201cwhen a criminal defendant chooses to testify on his own behalf, his statements, if disbelieved by the jury, may be considered as substantive evidence of his guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Kendrick, </em>682 F.3d 974, 986 (11th Cir.2012). Taohim . testified that when the Coast Guard came aboard the ship, he did not know that the plastic pipes had been thrown overboard and that the discharge had not been recorded in the garbage record book. He also testified that he \u201cnever\u201d had any intention to \u201cfool\u201d the Coast Guard. Because the jury returned a guilty verdict, it clearly did not believe those statements, which may be considered substantive evidence of Taohim\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">Taohim also argues that the gpv\u00e9rnment failed to show corrupt intent because Chief Officer Atiga testified that before the Coast Guard\u2019s inspection, Taohim told him that the garbage book \u201cshould be filled up properly.\u201d But as we have. already discussed, Atiga also testified that Taohim had clearly told him that he should omit any record of the illegal plastic discharge from the garbage record book. And Tao-him testified that he did not tell any crew members to throw the pipes overboard and that he was not responsible for making entries into the garbage record book which, if disbelieved by the jury, may be considered as \u25a0 substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>See Kendrick, </em>682 F.3d at 985. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">From all of the testimony, the jury could reasonably have inferred that Taohim intended for the book to contain no record of the\" plastic discharge, notwithstanding his later statement about making .sure the book was \u201cfilled up properly\u201d before the inspection. The jury was entitled to make a credibility determination on this point, and obviously did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-10\">Taohim further argues that the dumping of the plastic pipes and the omission of that dumping' from the'' garbage record book happened while the vessel was sailing from South Korea to Panama, which is beyond the jurisdiction of'' the United States. Even if we assume, without deciding, that those events were \u201cbeyond the jurisdiction of the United States,\u201d Taohim still presented a false garbage record book intending to interfere with a pending proceeding of the Coast Guard \u2014 the crime of which he was convicted \u2014 in the port' of Mobile, Alabama!</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-12\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519, it is a crime to \u201cknowingly alter[], destroyf], mutilate[], conceal[], cover[] up, falsiffy], or make[] a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation ... of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1222\">*1222</page-number>of the United States ... or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case.\u201d Count Four .of the indictment charged that Taohim knowingly caused the omission of information in the garbage record book with the intent to influence an agency proceeding in violation of \u00a7 1519, and the jury convicted him of that crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">Taohim argues that he could not have intended to impede, obstruct, or influence the Coast Guard's investigation when he allegedly ordered the omission of the plastic discharge from the garbage record book because at that time, the vessel was outside the territory of the United States and no investigation was pending. Section 1519, however, does not require that an investigation be pending or that the defendant be aware of one when he falsifies the record.. Instead, the statute only requires that the falsification be done with intent to impede an investigation and \u201cin contemplation\u201d of that investigation. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1519. A jury rationally could have concluded, as the one in this case obviously did, that Taohim anticipated that the garbage record book would be reviewed in a future agency proceeding and that he ordered it falsified for that reason. <em>Cf. United States v. Kernell, </em>667 F.3d 746, 755 (6th Cir.2012) (-\u201c[T]he belief that a federal investigation directed at the defendant\u2019s conduct might begin at some point in the future satisfies the \u2018in contemplation\u2019 prong.\u201d). Jang Jit Singh Yadav, an independent consultant for Target Ship Management, testified that Taohim is an \u201cold sea dog\u201d who was \u201cquite aware that most ports these days are very strict about the Port State Control\u201d Inspections. Yadav also testified that Taohim was \u201cvery well\u201d aware that the-garbage record book would be reviewed during any Port State Control Inspection. It was the jury\u2019s prerogative to credit that. testimony and infer that Taohim ordered that the garbage record book be falsified \u201cin contemplation of\u201d a future Port State Control Inspection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">Ill,</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">Taohim also contends that the district court erred in denying his motion for a new trial. \u201cUpon the defendant\u2019s motion, the court may vacate' any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\u201d Fed.R.CrimuP. 33(a). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a motion for a new trial. <em>United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-10\">Taohim contends that he is entitled to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. He notes that after his conviction, he learned-that four of the crewmem-bers who testified at his trial received monetary awards for providing information to the Coast Guard that led to the successful prosecution of Target -Ship Management. Taohim argues that the awards are evidence of the witnesses\u2019 motives and that he was not able to cross-examine those witnesses about the awards during his trial. He does not, however, contend that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1223\">*1223</page-number>the payments were promised or made before the end of his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-4\">A new trial based on newly discovered evidence is warranted if the defendant satisfies a five-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-5\">(1) the evidence must be discovered following- the trial; (2) the movant must show due diligence to discover the evidence; (3) the evidence must not be merely- cumulative or impeaching; (4) the evidence must be material to issues before the court; and (5) the evidence must be of such a nature that a new trial would probably produce a new result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AyJ\"><em>United States v. DiBernardo, </em>880 F.2d 1216, 1224 (11th Cir.1989). Failure to satisfy any one of those elements is fatal to a motion for a new trial. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>68 F.3d 1267, 1274 (11th Cir.1995). The district court concluded that the first two elements were satisfied, but that the newly discovered evidence was merely impeaching, not material, and not likely to have changed the result of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Taohim concedes in his reply brief that \u201cevidence of a witness\u2019s bias or motive is considered impeachment- evidence,\u201d but also argues that the evidence is not \u201cmerely\u201d impeaching because it \u201chighlights the Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause violations that occurred\u201d during his trial. Specifically, he contends that he was denied a full and fair opportunity to cross-examine the four witnesses about inducements made by the prosecutors in exchange for their testimony and their subjective belief that they would be entitled to a reward for cooperating with the government. The record, however, does not support that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Before trial, Taohim, through counsel, filed a motion asking the court to take judicial notice that the government routinely asks courts to approve payments to whistleblowers. The court denied that request, noting that those payments are not \u201can appropriate thing to take judicial notice of.\u201d At trial, Taohim attempted to ask Coast Guard Captain Donald Rose whether he received a report that there was a whistleblower onboard the vessel. The government objected,. and the -court informed Taohim during a sidebar that he could ask any testifying -whistleblower if he made a report or had any motive to testify, but if he did raise the subject of the whis-tleblower\u2019s report, he would open the door to questions by the government about the report, which contained some facts that Taohim did not want the jury to hear. The record does not show that Taohim attempted to ask the testifying whistle-blowers whether they expected to receive a monetary award for their testimony. He cannot use his failure to ask to establish a Sixth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-10\">Because the evidence of the whistleblower payments was merely impeaching evidence, it is not the type of evidence that warrants a new trial. <em>See DiBemardo, </em>880 F.2d at 1224. The evidence is also not material and would not likely produce a different result if a new trial were granted. Three of the crewmembers testified about the location of the plastic pipes, and one stated that the pipes disappeared while the vessel was travelling to Panama, The fourth crewmember testified that he threw some of the pipes overboard. That testimony was corroborated by photos of the pipes being thrown into the sea and by the testimony of Chief Officer Atiga, who did not receive a whistleblower payment. And Taohim testified that he never saw the pipes and did not tell any crew members to throw them into the sea. Taohim\u2019s testimony, if disbelieved by the jury, may also be considered substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>See Kendrick, </em>682 F.3d at 985. The district court was correct in concluding that the evidence in this case was strong and the evidence of whistleblower <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>payments after the trial would not have changed the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Taohim also contends that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor engaged in misconduct by making improper statements to the jury during closing arguments. A prosecutor\u2019s statements to the jury constitute misconduct only if: (1) the remarks were improper, and (2) the remarks prejudicially affected the substantial rights of the defendant. <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d 1285, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIn order to assess the prejudicial impact of a - prosecutor\u2019s statements, we must evaluate them in the context of the trial as a whole and assess their probable impact on the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>145 F.3d 1433, 1438 (11th Cir.1998). To warrant a new trial, there must be a reasonable probability that \u201cbut for the remarks, the outcome would be different.\u201d <em>United States v. Hall, </em>47 F.3d 1091, 1098 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Because Taohim did not object to the allegedly improper .statements at the time they were made, we review his claim under the plain error standard. <em>United States v. Merrill, </em>513 F.3d 1293, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2008). Under that standard, a defendant must show that \u201c(1) an error occurred;. (2) the error was plain; (3) it affected [his] substantial rights; and (4) it seriously affected the fairness of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>627 F.3d 1372, 1380 (11th Cir.2010) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">Taohim first asserts that the prosecutor improperly invoked religion when he said, \u201cSo give me strength that I say the right words, that I make the right points.\u201d He argues that the prosecutor \u201cwas clearly playing to the passion and prejudice of the [j]ury, by seeking to have the [j]ury identify with a common Judeo-Christian archetype\u201d in a trial \u201cagainst a foreign national defendant from Thailand.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s statement, however, did not refer to any specific higher power, and Taohim\u2019s religion was never discussed at trial. Moreover, the court instructed the jury to perform its duty objectively without sympathy or prejudice against the defendant. The prosecutor\u2019s statement . does not amount to misconduct and was not error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-11\">Taohim next asserts that the prosecutor misstated Taohim\u2019s testimony when he said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, I ask that you use your common sense and that you use your life experience. Is anyone lying? Captain Taohim, my notes, my recollection, says those pipes were not on the deck.\u201d Taohim argues that the prosecutor \u201cmisstated\u201d his testimony because he testified only that he did not \u201csee\u201d the pipes on the deck, not that they weren\u2019t there. The prosecutor, however, was not attempting to quote Taohim\u2019s testimony when he made that statement. Inst\u00e9ad, he was suggesting that Taohim was lying about whether the pipes were ever on the deck, which is the inference the jury could have drawn from Taohim\u2019s statement that he never saw the pipes on the deck. <em>See United States v. Johns, </em>734 F.2d 657, 663 (11th Cir.1984) (noting that in closing argument, an attorney is permitted \u201cto state his contention as to the conclusions that the jury should draw from the evidence.\u201d). And Taohim\u2019s counsel responded to the prosecutor\u2019s statement in his own closing argument by saying, \u201cThe captain never said they weren\u2019t there. What he said was he didn\u2019t see them there. That\u2019s different.\u201d In context, the prosecutor\u2019s statement was hot error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-12\">Taohim further asserts that the prosecutor made an improper statement \u201cby bringing up the - defense\u2019s theory of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>motivation and the potential bias of the government\u2019s witnesses.\u201d Specifically, the prosecutor told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-5\">Let\u2019s look at the different theories that the defense has had. Sometime during the trial the theory has been the Filipinos, the Filipinos, the Filipinos. At one time there was a whistle blower theory. I remember whistle blower coming out. He\u2019s argued that it was Atiga, \u25a0 Atiga, Atiga and then this is a frame job, this is a frame job.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Taohim argues that it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d for the court to allow the government to refer to whistleblowers because it had denied his motion to take judicial notice that the government routinely asks courts to approve payments to whistleblowers, and had sustained the government\u2019s objection to his questioning of Coast Guard Captain Rose about the presence of whistleblowers on the ship. As .we have already discussed, the court did not prohibit Taohim from questioning the whistleblowers about their motives \u2014 he could have asked them, but chose not to do so. The court committed no error in allowing the government to mention whistleblowers in its closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">. Taohim argues that the intent to corruptly influence an agency's proceeding could not have existed at the time the garbage record book was presented to -the Coast Guard because that presentation \"is a ministerial act <em>required by </em>law, and done without specific intent.\u201d We disagree. Even if presenting the garbage record book was a \"ministerial act\u201d required by law, the law did not require Tao-him to present the garbage record book without disclosing that an entry had been omitted. The government presented evidence showing that Taohim knew the book was inaccurate when he presented it to the Coast Guard and that he-did not disclose its inaccuracies, from which a reasonable jury could conclude that \u2022 he intended to interfere with - the Coast Guard\u2019s investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">. Taohim' also contends in his brief to this Court that he was not responsible for falsifying the garbage record book because that book \u201cwas the sole responsibility of Chief Officer Atiga.\u201d Taohim admitted in his trial testimony that one of his responsibilities as captain was to \"ensure that there- [were] proper entries in the garbage log.\u201d But he also testified that it was the Chief Officer\u2019s responsibility to make entries into the garbage record book.and that he had \u201cno way to know\u201d about issues with the garbage record book unless the Chief Officer reported those issues to him. - The jury decided not to credit his later statement, and we will not disturb that credibility determination on appeal.
