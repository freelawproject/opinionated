The district court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 120 months of imprisonment on Counts One and Three, a consecutive term of 60 months of imprisonment on Count Two, and a consecutive term of 300 months of imprisonment on Count Four, for a total of 480 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-18\">In February 2013, Coleman filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion challenging his conviction and sentence. The district court denied his multiplicity and ineffective assistance of counsel claims with prejudice. However, the district court concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>Coleman was entitled to relief on his claim that he was eligible for resentencing under the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. Consequently, the district court vacated Coleman\u2019s sentence and resentenced him to concurrent terms of 60 months of imprisonment on Count One and one month of imprisonment on Count Three, a consecutive term of 60 months of imprisonment on Count Two, and a consecutive term of 300 months of imprisonment on Count Four, for a total of 420 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">Coleman appeals the sentence imposed on resentencing. He also seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s partial denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. The Government has moved for dismissal and summary affir-mance. In\u2019 the alternative, the Government requests an extension of time in which to file a brief on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Coleman contends that the district court erred in denying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim without conducting an evidentiary hearing. The Government asserts that we lack jurisdiction to review this issue. Coleman did not file a timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s partial denial of his \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See </em>Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Moreover, the documents filed within the period prescribed by Rule 4(a)(1) did not clearly evince his intent to appeal the district court\u2019s judgment. <em>See Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Therefore, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED IN PART for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>551 U.S. 205, 214, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Coleman also contends that the district court erred in failing to consider <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013), at his resentencing. He argues that the district court violated his constitutional rights* by resentencing him to a 25-year statutory minimum sentence on Count Four because the eletiients of his \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i) offense were not submitted to the jury and found beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"As5\">The Government'asserts that-Coleman\u2019s argument is foreclosed by <em>Arnold v. United States, </em>598 Fed.Appx. 298, 299 (5th Cir.2015). Coleman agrees but seeks to preserve the issue for further review. Because our decision in <em>Arnold </em>is unpublished, it is not binding precedent and the Government\u2019s motion for summary affir-mance is DENIED. <em>See </em>5th Cib. R. 47.5.4; <em>United States v. Holy Land Found. for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"AY0q\">Although our decision in <em>Arnold </em>is not binding precedent, it may be considered persuasive authority. <em>See Ballard v. Burton, </em>444 F.3d 391, 401 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (5th Cir.2006). In <em>Arnold, </em>we observed that <em>Al-leyne </em>does not affect the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i) because the enhancement is \u201cbased on a prior conviction, not because of some other fact.\u201d <em>Arnold, </em>598 Fed.Appx. at 299. Further, we have held that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), remains binding precedent <em>post Alleyne. United States v. Wallace, </em>759 F.3d 486, 497 (5th Cir.2014). Therefore, Coleman\u2019s <em>Alleyne </em>challenge is unavailing, and the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED IN PART. The' Government\u2019s alternative motion for an extension of time in which to file a brief is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
