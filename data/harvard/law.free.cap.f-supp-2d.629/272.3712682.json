(\u201cNovaGold\u201d). NovaGold\u2019s decision to abandon the mining project because of spiraling capital costs, and the sharp decline in its stock price, have led to this putative securities class action lawsuit, which primarily challenges NovaGold\u2019s disclosures regarding the anticipated costs and risks of the mining project. This Opinion addresses the motions to dismiss that three separate groups of defendants have filed. As explained below, the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss the claims filed under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), are granted. As for the claims brought under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), only the claim against NovaGold survives.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b316-21\">The following allegations are taken from the corrected consolidated class action complaint (the \u201cconsolidated complaint\u201d) and the documents on which it relies. No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>vaGold was founded as a mineral exploration company, but shifted its focus to mineral extraction and production in the late 1990s. As part of its foray into mineral extraction, NovaGold began investigating the untapped mineral reserves of Galore Creek in northern British Columbia in 2003, and acquired the mineral rights to 215,000 acres. Located in a mountainous area, the untapped Galore Creek \u2014 initially accessible only by helicopter \u2014 was believed to have large copper, silver, and gold deposits.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The minerals were to be extracted through an \u201copen pit\u201d mine, close to the surface, but spread out over a large area.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">A. Scoping the Project: Engineering Challenges and the Preliminary Feasibility Study</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Considerable engineering challenges accompanied the lucrative potential of the mine. Because the Galore Creek site was an open pit mine, extracting the minerals would require excavating the waste rock sitting on top of the minerals first. The excavated earth, which contained waste rock (the portion not containing valuable minerals) and tailings (the material left over from the process of separating the valuable minerals from the worthless portion of the ore) needed to be stored permanently elsewhere, usually in a structure known as a \u201ctailings dam.\u201d NovaGold initially intended to place the tailings dam in a valley where Galore Creek flowed, requiring the creek to be directed for 4.7 miles around the tailings dam area. Heavy rains and snowfall in the winter of 2005-06 sharply increased the amount of surface water that NovaGold would need to divert. The remote location and large size of the mine only amplified these logistical difficulties.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">NovaGold undertook feasibility studies regarding the project in compliance with Canadian securities regulations imposing specific disclosure requirements on companies undertaking mineral exploration. These requirements include preparation of \u201cfeasibility studies\u201d by independent experts that include sufficient detail to enable a financial institution to determine whether it should finance the development of a project. NovaGold retained defendant Hatch Ltd. (\u201cHatch\u201d) in 2003 to perform a preliminary study of the feasibility of the Galore Creek mine (the \u201cProject\u201d). Defendant Rick Van Nieuwenhuyse, Nova-Gold\u2019s CEO, announced the results of the preliminary study in October 2005, which included a capital cost estimate of US$ 1.1 billion (approximately 1.3 billion Canadian dollars (\u201cC$\u201d)), indicating the commercial viability of the Project. Hatch then began a final feasibility study, which was designed to estimate costs within 10-15% (the \u201cHatch Study\u201d). NovaGold expected Hatch\u2019s study to be complete in the second half of 2006. NovaGold subsequently raised US$ 165.3 million through an initial public offering (\u201cIPO\u201d) on January 24, 2006. A week later, it announced an agreement with the Native Canadian Tahltan First Nation, which resided on portions of the Galore Creek area (the \u201cFebruary 2006 Participation Agreement\u201d). In June 2006, NovaGold reported to Canadian authorities that it had explored \u201call viable options\u201d so that it could make a \u201creasonable decision\u201d about planning the Project.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">B. Barrick\u2019s Hostile Takeover Bid and the Release of the Hatch Study</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">NovaGold had earlier begun discussions with global mining giant Barrick Gold Corp. (\u201cBarrick\u201d) regarding a potential joint venture to develop Galore Creek. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>July 24, 2006, Barrick announced a hostile bid for NovaGold at US$ 14.50 per share, and NovaGold\u2019s share price increased from US$ 11.67 to US$ 16.17 the following day. NovaGold issued a press release on July 25 condemning Barrick\u2019s offer. While attempting to fight off the hostile bid, Nova-Gold also continued to learn more about the surface water issues caused by heavy precipitation, which drove up the costs of the Project further. By October 2006, NovaGold\u2019s share price declined to $15.35, approaching the $14.50 offered by Barrick.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">NovaGold issued a press release on October 12 announcing that the Hatch Study would likely be released by the end of the quarter. Barrick responded on October 24 by raising its offer to US$ 16 per share. The next day, NovaGold announced the release of the Hatch Study in a press release (the \u201cOctober 25, 2006 Press Release\u201d), entitled \u201cFinal Feasibility Study Completed at NovaGold\u2019s Galore Creek Project.\u201d As described in the October 25, 2006 Press Release, the study confirmed the economic viability of the Project, stating that it was \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest undeveloped copper-gold-silver projects with one of the lowest cash costs in the industry,\u201d and calculated capital costs at US$ 1.8 billion, or C$ 2.2 billion. The October 25, 2006 Press Release also explained that the study\u2019s estimates reflected a +15%/-10% level of accuracy, and encompassed \u201call the direct and indirect costs and appropriate project estimating contingencies,\u201d including \u201cconstruction of all major civil earthworks for the dams and water diversion structures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Analysts responded to the Hatch Study enthusiastically and advised investors to reject Barrick\u2019s bid. NovaGold announced in an October 31 press release that, because of the strong projections in the study, its negotiations with potential joint venture partners had accelerated. It noted its recent \u201cvalue-adding milestones,\u201d including the release of the \u201cindependent Galore Creek Feasibility Study, confirming economics of the project and providing the Company\u2019s first Proven and Probable Reserves.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The hostile takeover bid was overwhelmingly rejected on November 8, 2006, and NovaGold announced the same in a press release issued that day. It attributed the shareholders\u2019 rejection of the bid to \u201cmilestones,\u201d which included the \u201c[e]ompleted final Feasibility Study at Galore Creek.\u201d NovaGold also held a conference call on November 8 (the \u201cNovember 8, 2006 Conference Call\u201d), in which Van Nieuwenhuyse characterized the Hatch Study as \u201cdone\u201d and informed the public that NovaGold was moving forward with construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-8\">Final preparations are now being made ... to basically take that feasibility study and implement that into a construction plan ... having completed the feasibility study at Galore Creek, we can now speak about the reserves there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Also participating in the call, defendant Robert J. MacDonald, the CFO of Nova-Gold, described \u201csignificant interest <em>from </em>potential joint venture partners,\u201d who had been awaiting \u201cthe completion of our feasibility study, which was just released two weeks ago.\u201d MacDonald also repeated the Hatch Study\u2019s cost figures: \u201cbased on the feasibility study ... for Galore Creek, we have a total capital of about [US]$ 1.8 billion.\u201d Van Nieuwenhuyse referred to the Project as \u201ceminently finaneeable\u201d in a November 14 press release (the \u201cNovember 14, 2006 Press Release\u201d), noting that \u201c[w]ith the Feasibility Study for Galore Creek now complete, NovaGold has been approached by a variety of interested financial and industry partners ... we are confident that Galore Creek is of significant interest to potential joint venture parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Another press release of December 5 (the \u201cDecember 5, 2006 Press Release\u201d) urged investors to continue to reject Bar-rick\u2019s bid, with Van Nieuwenhuyse declaring that \u201cwe plan to build [the Galore Creek] project on time and on budget.\u201d The press release also mentioned \u201cthe release of an independent Feasibility Study confirming Proven and Probable Reserves and the economics of the Galore Creek project.\u201d NovaGold again touted the Hatch Study in a December 14 press release, noting cost estimates of \u201capproximately US$ 1.8 billion\u201d to be incurred \u201cbetween 2007 and 2010\u201d and again stating that \u201c[a] final Feasibility Study for the Galore Creek project, completed by Hatch Ltd. in October 2006, provided Proven and Probable Reserves for NovaGold and confirmed the economics and mine plan of the Galore Creek project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">C. Cost Increases and a Secondary Offering</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Behind the scenes, plaintiffs confidential sources report that costs were spiraling upward and approached C$ 3.7 billion by early summer 2007. Without publicly disclosing its decision, NovaGold retained AMEC Americas Ltd. (\u201cAMEC\u201d), a competitor of Hatch, to conduct a new feasibility study to re-estimate certain costs beginning in February or March 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">NovaGold\u2019s disclosures, meanwhile, continued to refer to the cost figures calculated in the Hatch Study. On February 9 (the \u201cFebruary 2007 Report\u201d), NovaGold issued a press release stating that \u201cthe Feasibility Study budget is sufficient for construction of the Project within current contingency allegations\u201d and reiterating the cost figures from the Hatch Study.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The February 2007 Report quoted defendant Peter W. Harris, Chief Operating Officer of NovaGold, who, after noting that a \u201cProject Development Team has been reviewing the Feasibility Study capital costs,\u201d stated that \u201cthe team has determined that the Feasibility Study budget is sufficient for construction of the Galore Creek project within current contingency allocations. This review will continue as basic and detailed project engineering proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">The press release accompanying Nova-Gold\u2019s 2006 annual statement, released on February 28 (\u201cthe February 28, 2007 Press Release\u201d), again \u201cconfirmed the economics and mine plan,\u201d of the Project, as well as the US$ 1.8 billion cost figure. During a March 2, 2007 conference call reviewing earnings for the fourth quarter of 2006 (the \u201cMarch 2, 2007 Conference Call\u201d), MacDonald reviewed the cost figures once again: \u201c[y]ou see the total capital for Galore Creek at approximately [US]$ 1.8 billion or C$ 2.2 billion ... just over four months ago, NovaGold completed the feasibility study for Galore Creek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">D. The Secondary Offering</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">On the advice of Citigroup, NovaGold sought to obtain additional financing for the Project. On April 18, NovaGold commenced a secondary offering of 12.5 million shares of its stock that raised US$ 194 million pursuant to an Amended Registration Statement on Form F10/A, filed with the SEC on April 16, 2007 (the \u201cRegistration Statement\u201d). NovaGold also issued a press release and its Form 6-K Quarterly report on April 16. The press release noted that the start-up of operations at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Galore Creek would be delayed from 2011 to 2012, but that the construction would nonetheless require an \u201cunchanged overall construction budget of [C]$ 2.2 billion (US$ 1.8 billion).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">NovaGold then held an earnings conference call on April 25 (the \u201cApril 25, 2007 Conference Call\u201d), where Van Nieuwenhuyse commented that NovaGold was \u201cdriving down into the very low end of the cash cost curve with production from Galore Creek.\u201d MacDonald repeated the same cost and viability tropes: \u201c[t]he total project financing cost [for the Project] is about C$ 2 billion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">On May 23, NovaGold issued a joint press release with Teck Comineo (\u201cTeck\u201d) announcing their US$ 2 billion partnership to develop Galore Creek, named \u201cthe Galore Creek Mining Corporation\u201d (\u201cGCMC\u201d) (the \u201cMay 23, 2007 Press Release\u201d). The press release noted that \u201c[s]ince the completion of the Feasibility Study last fall, NovaGold has been preparing <em>for </em>the start of construction.\u201d NovaGold also disclosed that it planned \u201can aggressive program of ... technical studies ... aimed at increasing the value of the Galore Creek project by optimizing the additional approximately 1 billion tonne mineral resource in the Galore Creek Valley that is not currently included in the Galore Creek feasibility study.\u201d In the meantime, construction would \u201ccontinue in accordance with Nova-Gold\u2019s previously announced timelines and budgets to achieve production by mid-2012.\u201d Several analysts responded favorably to the joint venture, viewing it as evidence of the value of the Project. By the fall of 2007, Teck had provided C$ 78 million of funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">E. Cost Estimates Rise</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">In mid-2007, NovaGold began to experience cost overruns at another project, Rock Creek. Analysts from MGI questioned management regarding whether the flawed estimates could impact the Project. Satisfied that they would not, MGI issued a report in July stating that NovaGold had reviewed estimates with \u201ctheir consultants\u201d and \u201cbelieve[d] that the numbers provided still stand.\u201d A June 1 press release (the \u201cJune 1, 2007 Press Release\u201d) discussed further technical studies, but without any effect on the Project\u2019s budgets or timelines:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-9\">Construction will proceed in accordance with NovaGold\u2019s previously announced budgets and timelines to achieve production by mid-2012, and the Galore Creek partnership will engage in exploration and technical studies aimed at increasing the value of the project by optimizing the additional resources that are not currently included in the Galore Creek Feasibility Study completed by Hatch Ltd. in October 2006.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">A press release issued on July 16 reiterated that the Project would require an \u201cinvestment of US$ 2 billion.\u201d A Form 6-K quarterly report filed that same day with the SEC (the \u201cJuly 16, 2007 Quarterly Report\u201d) also confirmed that the budget described in the Hatch Study would remain \u201cunchanged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-11\">Taking analysts on a tour of the Project in August 2007, NovaGold described the AMEC study as a \u201cscoping study\u201d intended to measure a project\u2019s reserves, compared with capital costs. Following the analyst visit, some analysts began to increase their own cost estimates for the Project. On August 30, an analyst from defendant Cormark Securities Inc. (\u201cCor-mark\u201d) explained that he now believed capital costs on the Project to be higher than originally estimated, owing to currency fluctuations and the fact that Hatch\u2019s estimate did not account for cost inflation occurring during the construction period or a US$ 115 million power line that the Project required. Cormark increased its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>capital expenditure assumption by approximately 25%, to US$ 2.3 billion. NovaGold issued a press release on October 1 that hewed to the Hatch Study\u2019s cost figure, referencing only the \u201cC$ 2.2 billion\u201d \u201cestimated construction costs\u201d of the \u201cOctober 2006 Feasibility Study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">F. Disclosures of Cost Increases</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">NovaGold\u2019s first disclosure that costs were expected to exceed the Hatch Study\u2019s estimate, and that AMEC had been engaged to conduct a new feasibility study, came in a press release issued on October 15 (\u201cOctober 15, 2007 Press Release\u201d). The October 15, 2007 Press Release disclosed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">Galore Creek Mining Corporation <em>has engaged AMEC to prepare an updated feasibility study </em>to, amongst other things, support the project financing of Galore Creek. The updated feasibility study is <em>expected to result in significant increases to capital costs </em>resulting from, among other things, the inclusion of additional power line costs in connection with the higher-capacity line described below, and escalating local and worldwide constructions; further optimization of the project, including potential modifications to grind size and the significant strengthening of the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar. Capital cost increases are expected to be <em>partially offset by improvements in operating costs. </em>The updated feasibility study is targeted to be complete in the first half of 2007, but revised costs for the project may be available earlier than that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVH\">(Emphasis supplied). NovaGold\u2019s Form 6-K quarterly earnings report signed the same day (the \u201cOctober 15, 2007 Quarterly Report\u201d) repeated the statements above. Following the press release, the share price fell by forty-six cents, from US$ 19 to US$ 18.54. On a conference call two days later (the \u201cOctober 17, 2007 Conference Call,\u201d) Van Nieuwenhuyse again described the AMEC study as an \u201cupdated\u201d feasibility study. A presentation to the New Orleans Investment Conference delivered on October 23, 2007 (the \u201cOctober 23, 2007 NOIC Presentation\u201d), however, referred twice to the Hatch Study when estimating Project costs, without mentioning any \u201cupdate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Six weeks after it first disclosed that AMEC was updating the Hatch Study, on November 26, 2007, NovaGold and Teck announced that they were suspending the Project, whose capital costs were now expected to approach US$ 4.4 billion (C$ 5 billion), a 144% increase from the original estimate. A member of the Tahltan Nation (\u201cCW 3\u201d) learned that Teck insisted on the Project\u2019s suspension, while Nova-Gold had hoped to continue, despite the dramatic increase in the capital cost estimate. The press release announcing the suspension, dated November 26, 2007, disclosed that NovaGold had retained AMEC in April 2007 to review the results of the Hatch Study, with a focus on the construction of the tailings and water management structures and mine facilities. According to the press release, by October 2007, AMEC\u2019s preliminary findings</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOv\">indicated it expected capital costs would be significantly higher than originally estimated. As a result, NovaGold and Teck Comineo commenced a project strategy review ... to assess the AMEC work. Estimated costs have continued to increase during this review, and NovaGold and Teck Comineo now have sufficient information to indicate that the capital cost of the project could approach as much as [C]$5 billion. The engineering review is ongoing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">Although there have been changes in scope from the original feasibility study, <em>the largest portion of the capital cost increase is related to the complex sequencing of activities necessary to build </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number><em>the tailings dam and water management structures, and the resulting extension of the construction </em>by 18 to 24 months. The project has also been affected by the rapidly escalating capital costs affecting major construction projects world-wide.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-4\">In light of these developments, Nova-Gold and Teck Comineo have agreed to suspend construction ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">(Emphasis supplied). The day that the press release announcing the suspension was issued, NovaGold\u2019s share price fell 53% to US$ 10.76 on a trading volume of over 24 times the daily average during the class period.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">G. The Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Three prospective lead plaintiffs filed securities class action complaints against NovaGold, alleging that the company had deceptively concealed the true costs of the Project in violation of securities laws, seeking recovery on behalf of a class who had acquired NovaGold common stock between October 25, 2006, the day of the press release announcing the completion of the Hatch Study, and November 23, 2007 (the \u201cClass Period\u201d). The first complaint was filed on August 7, 2008 by Rudolph Textor, naming NovaGold, Van Nieuwenhuyse, MacDonald, and Harris as defendants and alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j, 78t(a), and Rule 10b-5, the parallel regulation promulgated under Section 10(b), as well as Sections 11 (against all defendants except Harris) and 15 of the Securities Act (against Van Nieuwenhuyse and MacDonald only), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k(a) and 77(o).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">After a second plaintiff filed a complaint on September 9 against the same defendants, bringing Exchange Act claims only, an Order issued on September 15 scheduling a conference to consider any motions to be appointed as lead plaintiff and for consolidation. Following the conference, held on October 31, an Order of November 5 appointed the New Orleans Employees\u2019 Retirement System (\u201cNOERS\u201d) as Lead Plaintiff (\u201cplaintiff\u2019), consolidated the actions, and required a consolidated complaint to be filed by December 19, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">NOERS then filed its own complaint on November 21. To the defendants already named in the previously filed actions, it added the remainder of the defendants named below, including NovaGold\u2019s directors, Hatch Ltd., and the companies who served as underwriters of the April 18, 2007 secondary offering. In addition to the violations alleged by other plaintiffs, plaintiff alleged that NovaGold and the underwriters had violated Section 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>111 </em>(a), and that the underwriters, NovaGold\u2019s directors, and Hatch and its employee Bruce Rustad, had violated Section 11 of the Securities Act, and that NovaGold officers Douglas Brown, Carl Gagnier, Harris, Gregory S. Johnson, Joseph R. Piekenbrock, Elaine M. Sanders, and Douglas Nicholson had violated Section 15 of the Securities Act. The plaintiffs complaint did not include Exchange Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Plaintiff filed the consolidated complaint on December 30, 2008, challenging Nova-Gold\u2019s disclosures regarding the Project.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It asserts causes of action under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, as well as others under Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act. In essence, the complaint alleges that NovaGold, fearing Barriek\u2019s hostile takeover bid, manipulated the results of the Hatch Study, and continued to rely on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>estimates contained in the Hatch Study in public disclosures, including the Registration Statement, while concealing the true escalation in the costs of Galore Creek and the retention of AMEC to assess those costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">In addition to NovaGold and GCMC, the consolidated complaint identifies several groups of defendants, including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-5\">\u2014 NovaGold officers Van Nieuwenhuyse, MacDonald, Harris, and Brown, who was NovaGold\u2019s Vice President of Business Development at the time that the Registration Statement became effective and the General Manager of Galore Creek and President of GCMC beginning in May 2007;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u2014 NovaGold Directors George Brack, Michael H.

If they are correct, the limitations period expired on October 15, 2008, over a month before plaintiff first alleged that the Hatch Defendants, the NovaGold Directors, Brown, and the Underwriter Defendants had violated the Securities Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">1. Statute of Limitations: the Duty of Inquiry</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Claims brought under Sections 11, 12, and 15 of the Securities Act are subject to the one-year statute of limitations set out under Section 13 of the Securities Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77m; <em>Dodds v. Cigna Securities, Inc., </em>12 F.3d 346, 359-50, 350 n. 2 (2d Cir.1993) (Section 15). The limitations period begins to run when the plaintiff \u201cobtains actual knowledge of the facts giving rise to the action or notice of the facts, which in the exercise of reasonable diligence, would have led to actual knowledge.\u201d <em>Kahn v. Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co., </em>970 F.2d 1030, 1042 (2d Cir.1992). Put otherwise, \u201cSection 13 imposes a duty of inquiry.\u201d <em>Jackson Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., Inc., </em>32 F.3d 697, 701 (2d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">The presence of the duty to inquire is evaluated according to an objective, totahty-of-the-circumstances test examining \u201cwhen the circumstances would suggest to an investor of ordinary intelligence the probability\u201d that she has a cause of action. <em>Staehr, </em>547 F.3d at 427 (citation omitted). The circumstances giving rise to constructive notice and the duty to inquire are referred to as \u201cstorm warnings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To trigger the duty of inquiry, the storm warnings must \u201crelate directly\u201d to the misrepresentations and omissions on which the plaintiffs base their claims, but they \u201cneed not detail every aspect\u201d of the alleged scheme. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). When the storm warnings take the form of \u201ccompany-specific information probative\u201d of the alleged wrongdoing, a duty to investigate arises. <em>Id. </em>at 428 (citation omitted). But, storm warnings exist only when the available information makes wrongdoing \u201cprobable, not merely possible.\u201d <em>Shah v. Meeker, </em>435 F.3d 244, 249 (2d Cir.2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">In some cases, despite the presence of storm warnings, investors are not placed on inquiry notice \u201cbecause the warning signs are accompanied by reliable words of comfort from management.\u201d <em>LC Capital Partners LP v. Frontier Ins. Group, Inc., </em>318 F.3d 148, 155 (2d Cir.2003). While such statements must be considered, their existence will prevent or dissipate the duty to inquire \u201conly if an investor of ordinary intelligence would reasonably rely on the statements to allay the investor\u2019s concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This depends \u201cin large part on how significant the company\u2019s disclosed problems are, how likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>they are of a recurring nature, and how substantial are the \u2018reassuring\u2019 steps announced to avoid their recurrence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">2. The Registration Statement\u2019s Alleged Misrepresentations</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The Securities Act claims arise from the Registration Statement filed on April 16, 2007. Plaintiff describes five ways in which the Registration Statement was allegedly false and misleading: 1) it did not disclose the true capital cost projections for Galore Creek; 2) it stated that the Project was economically viable; 3) it failed to disclose that proceeds from the offering would be used to fund a new feasibility study; 4) it characterized the Hatch Study as the \u201cfinal\u201d feasibility study; and 5) it failed to disclose that NovaGold had retained AMEC to conduct a new feasibility study. When the Registration Statement is examined, it becomes clear that each of these misrepresentations or omissions arises from the statement\u2019s discussion of the Hatch Study.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">After a general description of the Galore Creek Project, the Registration Statement proceeds to a section entitled \u201cFeasibility Study.\u201d In that section, it explains that in</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5n\">October 2006, Hatch Ltd., an independent engineering services company ... completed a feasibility study (the \u2018Galore Creek Feasibility Study\u2019) for the Galore Creek project. <em>This study confirms the economic viability </em>of a conventional open-pit mining operation using long-term metals prices____The information set out below is a summary of information contained in the Feasibility Study and is subject to important qualifications, assumptions and exclusions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2_\">(Emphasis supplied). The next page and a half of the Registration Statement sets out tables with financial information drawn from the Hatch Study, including a line item for total capital costs, comprised of mine facility and infrastructure costs, which were listed as US$ 1.805 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">In addition, among the items described in the fourteen-page Risk Factors section of the Registration Statement, NovaGold disclosed the possibility that the capital cost estimate might later be revised by a future feasibility study:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-10\">[cjapital and operating costs, production and economic returns, and other estimates contained in the [Feasibility Study] or other feasibility studies or economic assessments, <em>if prepared, </em>may differ significantly from those anticipated by NovaGold\u2019s current studies and estimates, and there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s actual capital and operating costs will not be higher than currently anticipated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">The Registration Statement also incorporates \u201cby reference\u201d one other document on which the plaintiff relies: the February 2007 Report \u201cannouncing that the Galore Creek copper-gold-silver project in northwestern British Columbia is rapidly advancing toward the start of construction.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The Registration Statement explains that this document and others have been filed with the securities commission in Canada and are available through the internet. The February 2007 Report includes the following description of the Project:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">A <em>final Feasibility Study </em>for the Galore Creek project, completed in October 2006, ... <em>confirmed the economics ... </em>of the project.... The Feasibility Study estimates that the <em>total capital cost </em>to develop the Galore Creek project <em>will be approximately US$ 1.8 </em>billion..... The Feasibility Study was completed by Hatch Ltd....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">The first two misrepresentations of which the plaintiff complains, which concern the capital cost projections and the Project\u2019s economic viability, .come directly from the Registration Statement\u2019s (and the February 2007 Report\u2019s) discussion of the Hatch Study. Plaintiff\u2019s fourth and fifth allegations of misrepresentation also relate directly to the Hatch Study as well as the retention of AMEC to undertake another feasibility study. These two allegations take issue with the characterization in the February 2007 Report of the Hatch Study as \u201cfinal,\u201d and with the allusion in the Risk Factor section of the Registration Statement to other feasibility studies that might be prepared. The plaintiffs assert that AMEC had already been retained by NovaGold by March 2007 to prepare another feasibility study.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Plaintiffs remaining Securities Act allegation asserts that the retention of AMEC rendered the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d portion of the Registration Statement misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d section explained that the proceeds from the offering</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ayx\">will be used to fund further exploration at, and initial construction of, the Galore Creek project, to fund general exploration and development on the Company\u2019s other projects and for general corporate purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Plaintiff alleges that the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d section does not describe any funding for an additional feasibility study, even though AMEC\u2019s was already under way.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">In summary, each of plaintiffs Securities Act allegations rests on the Registration Statement\u2019s description of the Hatch Study or its failure to disclose the retention of AMEC to prepare another feasibility study. They derive from the Hatch Study\u2019s cost estimates and conclusions regarding the viability of the Project and its status as the sole and final feasibility study.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">3. The October 15, 2007 Press Release Triggers the Duty of Inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">In relevant part, the October 15, 2007 Press Release disclosed that \u201cGalore Creek Mining Corporation has engaged AMEC to prepare an updated feasibility study to, amongst other things, support the project financing of Galore Creek. The updated feasibility study is expected to result in significant increases to capital costs.\u201d This statement is \u201ccompany-specific information\u201d that relates directly to the misrepresentations alleged. <em>See Staehr, </em>547 F.3d at 428. The October 15, 2007 Press Release thus put plaintiff on inquiry notice of the claims relating to the retention of AMEC, including the Regis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>tration Statement\u2019s alleged failure to disclose that proceeds from the offering would be used to fund a new feasibility study; its characterization of the Hatch Study as the \u201cfinal\u201d feasibility study that had \u201cconfirmed\u201d the economic viability of the Project; and its failure to disclose that NovaGold had retained AMEC to conduct a new feasibility study. When plaintiff first sought to bring these claims against the NovaGold Directors, Brown, the Hatch Defendants, and the Underwriter Defendants over a year later, they were time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Plaintiff argues that \u201cnothing\u201d in the October 15, 2007 Press Release is indicative of a securities fraud claim, that the press release does not foreshadow the cost increases relating to the tailings dam and water management structures that were largely responsible for derailing the Project, that the small correction in Nova-Gold\u2019s stock price following the press release evinces a lack of inquiry notice, and that the October 15, 2007 Press Release contained words of comfort tempering the storm warnings. Each argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Plaintiffs complaint and opposition brief repeatedly advise that its Securities Act claims are not based on fraud, and fraud is not a requirement of a Securities Act claim. <em>See Rombach v. Chang, </em>355 F.3d 164, 170-71 (2d Cir.2004) (considering whether a particular Securities Act claim sounded in fraud or negligence). Rather, the simple presence of \u201can untrue statement of a material statement\u201d or an omission of \u201ca material fact required to be stated\u201d to make the statement at issue not misleading is sufficient for liability. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77k(a). Accordingly, Section 13 of the Securities Act, its statute of limitations provision, provides that the limitations period expires \u201cwithin one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission,\u201d and makes no mention of fraud. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77m; <em>In re WorldCom Securities Litigation, </em>496 F.3d 245, 249 (2d Cir.2007). A plaintiff is thus on inquiry notice when it learns of the probability of an earlier \u201cuntrue statement\u201d or \u201comission,\u201d not when it learns a misstatement involved fraud.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">Plaintiff also attempts to characterize the October 15, 2007 Press Release as \u201cvague and misleading\u201d in its failure to suggest the \u201ccolossal underestimation\u201d of costs required to complete the tailings dam and water management structures. As explained above, the cost estimates and economic viability projection that plaintiff faults in the Registration Statement are expressly identified as the estimates and projection of the Hatch Study, which was specifically called into question by the October 15, 2007 Press Release. This press release clearly discloses that the Hatch Study is under revision, and that the new feasibility study \u201cis expected to result in significant increases to capital costs.\u201d These disclosures triggered inquiry notice. While it did not detail every line item in the Hatch Study that the AMEC study was calling into question, storm warnings \u201cneed not detail every aspect\u201d of the alleged scheme. <em>Staehr, </em>547 F.3d at 427.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Plaintiff submits that the decline in NovaGold stock following the October 15, 2007 Press Release, which, at under fifty cents, was much smaller than the drop that occurred after the November 26 disclosure that the Project was being suspended, is \u201ctelling\u201d evidence that investors were not, in fact, put on notice of misstatements by the October 15, 2007 Press Release. While courts have considered fluctuations in share price following a disclosure when determining the presence of inquiry notice in the securities fraud context, stock price is \u201ctypically not dispositive standing alone.\u201d <em>Newman v. Warnaco Group, Inc., </em>335 F.3d 187, 195 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In this case, the share price for Nova-Gold stock promptly fell US$ 0.46, from US$ 19 to US$ 18.54, following the October 15, 2007 Press Release. The plaintiff does not suggest that this drop was insignificant when compared to the stock\u2019s historical performance or when assessed against the control provided by the entire market\u2019s and the mining industry\u2019s stock price movements of that same day. Instead, the plaintiff points to the even more dramatic collapse of the stock that followed the suspension of the Project six weeks later. The issue is not, however, whether the October 15, 2007 Press Release adequately warned investors of the Project\u2019s suspension, but whether it placed them on inquiry notice that the Hatch Study\u2019s financial analysis of the Project was no longer reliable. That, it did, and the stock price drop following the press release supports that finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Finally, plaintiff cannot point to words of comfort tempering the October 15, 2007 Press Release\u2019s questioning of the Hatch Study. Plaintiff points to statements in the press release that suggested that construction was proceeding, but these do not impact or conceal the disclosure that the Hatch Study was being superseded. As explained above, the Hatch Study is the basis of the Registration Statement\u2019s assurances concerning the economic viability of the Project. The duty of inquiry having been triggered, plaintiffs Securities Act claims against Brown, the NovaGold Directors, the Hatch Defendants, and the Underwriter Defendants, all of which appeared for the first time in the November 21, 2008 complaint, are time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">4. Securities Act Claims Against Nova-Gold and Three of Its Officers</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The remaining Securities Act allegations accuse NovaGold and its officers Van Nieuwenhuyse, MacDonald, and Harris of violating Section 11 of the Securities Act, assert a claim under Section 12(a) (2) of the Securities Act against NovaGold only, and charge the three officers with \u201ccontrol person\u201d liability under Section 15 of the Securities Act. Defendants do not challenge the timeliness of Securities Act claims brought against these defendants, but seek dismissal on other grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">First, the NovaGold Defendants assert that the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b), Fed.R.Civ.P., applies to plaintiffs Securities Act claims because, despite disclaimers to the contrary, the claims actually sound in fraud, and fail to state a claim under this standard. Second, they assert that the language of the Registration Statement is not actionable for various reasons, including those contained in the Underwriter Defendants\u2019 papers and incorporated by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>5. Applicable Pleading Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As already noted, Sections 11 and 12(a)(2) of the Securities Act impose liability for misrepresentations of material fact in registration statements or prospectuses, respectively. To state a claim under either section, a plaintiff need not plead scienter, reliance, or fraud. <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 169 n. 4. But the Second Circuit has determined that the wording of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) \u201cis cast in terms of the conduct alleged, and is not limited to allegations styled or denominated as fraud or expressed in terms of the constituent elements of a fraud cause of action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171. Therefore, \u201cthe heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b) applies to Section 11 and Section 12(a)(2) claims insofar as the claims are premised on allegations of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, under <em>Rombach, </em>in determining which pleading standard applies to a securities cause of action, a court must look not to the statutory elements of the cause of action, but rather to the underlying conduct alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The heightened pleading standard does not apply to the Securities Act claims here. Plaintiff sets off its Securities Act claims in a separate section of the complaint, prefaced with the statement that they sound in \u201cstrict liability and negligence.\u201d The Securities Act allegations also charge defendants with failing to make a reasonable and diligent investigation into the statements contained in the Registration Statement, conduct suggesting negligence, not fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Moreover, the Securities Act claims do not delineate between the conduct of the Underwriter Defendants, the Hatch Defendants, and the NovaGold Defendants. Each group of defendants had different incentives in the secondary offering, and each served a different function. The complaint could not uniformly plead fraudulent conduct against all defendants given these distinctions; more specific conduct would need to be alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">Defendants identify no controlling authority finding that Securities Act allegations, when plead entirely separately from Exchange Act allegations, and accompanied by a disclaimer explaining that they sound in negligence, in fact sound in fraud. The <em>Rombach </em>court advised that \u201ccourts are not required to sift through allegations of fraud in search of some lesser included claim of strict liability,\u201d but no sifting is required in a situation such as this, where the claims are separately plead. <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 176 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">6. Allegations, of False Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">a. Legal Standard: PSLRA Safe Harbor and Bespeaks Caution</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Defendants argue that the items in the Registration Statement which plaintiff claims violated the Securities Act are not actionable, principally because they are protected as forward-looking statements under the PSLRA safe harbor or bespeaks caution doctrine, or because they were not untrue statements of material fact. The PSLRA defines a forward-looking statement, in relevant part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">(A) <em>a statement containing a projection </em>of revenues, income (including income loss), earnings (including earnings loss) per share, <em>capital expenditures, </em>dividends, capital structure, or other financial items;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">(B) a statement of the plans and objectives of management for future operations, including plans or objectives relating to the products or services of the issuer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-14\">(C) <em>a statement of future economic performance, </em>including any such statement contained in a discussion and analysis of financial condition by the management or in the results of operations included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Commission ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77z-2(i) (emphasis supplied).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The PSLRA safe-harbor provision provides that an issuer, or a person acting on an issuer\u2019s behalf, is not liable for a forward-looking statement that contains an untrue statement of material fact or an omission of material fact</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOQ\">if and to the extent that (A) the forward-looking statement is (i) identified as a forward-looking statement, and is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement; or (ii) immaterial ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmZ\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77z-2(a), (c)(1); <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 173. The safe harbor does not apply to forward-looking statements if made with \u201cactual knowledge\u201d that they are false or misleading. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77z-2(c)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Similarly, the judicially created \u201cbespeaks caution\u201d doctrine also removes liability for statements accompanied by cautionary language, providing that \u201calleged misrepresentations in a stock offering are immaterial as a matter of law if it cannot be said that any reasonable investor could consider them important in light of adequate cautionary language set out in the same offering.\u201d <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 173 (citation omitted). If a disclosure contains cautionary language, the court does not look at the alleged misrepresentation in isolation, but considers the disclosure in its entirety \u201cto determine whether a reasonable investor would have been misled,\u201d asking \u201cwhether defendants\u2019 representations or omissions, considered together and in context, would affect the total mix of information and thereby mislead a reasonable investor regarding the nature of the securities offered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Examined in context, the cautionary language must \u201cwarn [] of the specific contingency that lies at the heart of the alleged misrepresentation.\u201d <em>P. Stolz Family Partnership L.P. v. Daum, </em>355 F.3d 92, 97 (2d Cir.2004). <em>See also Hunt v. Alliance N. Am. Gov\u2019t Income Trust, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 723, 729 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cThe cautionary language ... must relate directly to that by which plaintiffs claim to have been misled.\u201d). In addition, \u201c[c]autionary words about future risk cannot insulate from liability the failure to disclose that the risk has transpired.\u201d <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 173; <em>see also P. Stolz, </em>355 F.3d at 97 (\u201cknowledge within the grasp of the [company] \u2014 is a different matter\u201d). \u201cThe doctrine of bespeaks caution provides no protection to someone who warns his hiking companion to walk slowly because there might be a ditch ahead when he knows with near certainty that the Grand Canyon lies one foot away.\u201d <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 173 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">b. Legal Standard: Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">If a part of a Registration Statement is not protected under the PSLRA safe harbor or because it bespeaks caution, it violates the Securities Act, as stated above, if it \u201ccontain[s] an untrue statement of a material fact or omit[s] to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k(a); 771(a)(2). The materiality of a misstatement is evaluated using the well-established standard articulated in <em>Basic Inc. v. Levinson, </em>485 U.S. 224, 108 S.Ct. 978, 99 L.Ed.2d 194 (1988), which requires proof that there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact would have been viewed by the reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231-32, 108 S.Ct. 978, (citation omitted). Put otherwise, \u201c[t]he materiality of a misstatement depends on whether there is a substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it important in deciding how to act.\u201d <em>ECA, Local 134 IBEW Joint Pension Trust of Chicago v. JP Morgan Chase Co., </em>553 F.3d 187, 197 (2d Cir.2009) (citation omitted) (\u201cECA\u201d). A material fact can relate to past, existing or even prospective events. <em>Sonesta Int\u2019l Hotels Corp. v. Wellington Assoc., </em>483 F.2d 247, 251 (2d Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u201cBecause materiality is a mixed question of law and fact,\u201d it is ordinarily inappropriate for resolution at the motion to dismiss stage. <em>ECA, </em>553 F.3d at 197. A complaint may be dismissed because the alleged misstatements or omissions are immaterial, however, if the \u201cthey are so obviously unimportant to a reasonable investor that reasonable minds could not differ on the question of their importance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">c. Disclosures Relating to the Project\u2019s Cost Estimate and Its Economic Viability</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">The US$ 1.8 million cost estimate figure calculated in the Hatch Study and the Hatch Study\u2019s assessment that the Project was economically viable are forward-looking statements accompanied by cautionary language, eligible for protection under the PSLRA safe harbor. At the time of the Secondary Offering, years remained until Galore Creek was operational, and a prediction about its ultimate costs, as well as whether the costs would be offset by sufficient revenue to render the Project economically viable, are \u201cprojection^]\u201d plainly satisfying the definition in the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Plaintiff unpersuasively depicts these statements as statements of present fact by arguing that NovaGold, at the time the statement was made, had already determined what the Project would cost. Any projection or forward-looking statement necessarily has its basis in current conditions, but this does not change the fact that it uses those current conditions to make some kind of prediction about the future. Plaintiffs argument is better understood as an assertion that NovaGold knew, based on present conditions, that the statements were false when made, and should not be protected by the PSLRA safe harbor. This argument is addressed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Plaintiff also submits that the fact that the Hatch Study was a \u201cbankable\u201d study, designed to serve as the basis for investors to ascertain whether the Project could provide long-term returns, demonstrates that its conclusions were not forward-looking projections. Investors routinely make investment decisions using forward-looking material, betting on future returns from investments. That they do so does not render such information not forward looking.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\">The cost figure and economic viability prediction were also accompanied by cautionary language adequate to invoke the PSLRA safe harbor and bespeaks caution doctrine.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Registration Statement\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d warns investors that the Registration Statement</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADr\">eontain[s] <em>forward-looking statements ... concerning </em>the Company\u2019s plans at the Galore Creek, Donlin Creek, Nome Operations and Ambler projects, production, <em>capital, </em>operating and cash flow <em>estimates </em>.... These statements relate to analyses and other information that are <em>based on forecasts </em>of future results, estimates of amounts not yet determinable and <em>assumptions of </em>management.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFV\">(Emphasis supplied). The Registration Statement then included a list of twenty-four separate risks. The fifth item on the list was \u201cuncertainty of capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">In the Risk Factors section of the Registration Statement, bold, italicized text noted that \u201c[ajctual capital costs, operating costs, production and economic returns may differ significantly from those NovaGold has anticipated and there are no assurances that any future development activities will result in profitable mining operations.\u201d Underneath, the Registration Statement disclosed that \u201c[t]he capital costs to take the Company\u2019s projects into production may be significantly higher than anticipated. None of the Company\u2019s mineral properties, including the Galore Creek ... project[has] an operating history upon which the Company can base estimates of future operating costs.\u201d After noting that decisions to develop Galore Creek and other properties would be based on feasibility studies, the Registration Statement warned that \u201cother feasibility studies or economic assessments, if prepared, may differ significantly from those anticipated by NovaGold\u2019s current studies and estimates, and there can be no assurance that the Company\u2019s actual capital and operating costs will not be higher than currently anticipated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In the same section of the Registration Statement, under the bold, italicized heading disclosing that \u201cNovaGold has no history of producing precious metals from its mineral exploration properties and there can be no assurance that it will successfully establish mining operations or profitably produce precious metals,\u201d the statement added that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">NovaGold is subject to all of the risks associated with establishing new mining operations ... including: the timing and cost, which can be considerable, of the construction of mining and processing facilities .... The costs, timing and complexities of mine construction and development are increased by the remote location of the Company\u2019s mining properties. It is common in new mining operations to experience unexpected problems and delays during development, construction and mine start-up ... Accordingly, there are no assurances that the Company\u2019s activities will result in profitable mining operations <em>or that the Company will successfully establish mining operations </em>or profitably produce precious metals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">(Emphasis supplied). Additionally, the \u201cSummary Financial Results\u201d table, which includes the US$ 1.8 million cost figure, lists the Project\u2019s expected costs based on a \u201cbase case\u201d of assumptions about metals prices, as well as \u201cestimates of annual production and cash costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">These examples indicate that the cost figure and prediction of the Project\u2019s economic viability were subject to risks regarding capital costs, the very risks which ultimately materialized. <em>See, e.g., Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 176 (caution that there was \u201cno assurance\u201d that company could raise sufficient capital for continued expansion bespoke caution); <em>Luce v. Edelstein, </em>802 F.2d 49, 56 (2d Cir.1986) (representations regarding potential cash and tax benefits of a partnership protected by state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>ment in offering memorandum that \u201c[n]o assurance [could] be given that these projections [would] be realized\u201d). The warnings appeared \u201cprominently and specifically\u201d at the beginning of the Registration Statement and then again, in partially bolded text in the Risk Factors section. <em>See Olkey v. Hyperion 1999 Term Trust, </em>98 F.3d 2, 5 (2d Cir.1996) (finding no liability where prospectus gave \u201cprominent and specific\u201d warnings of \u201cexactly the risk the plaintiffs claim was not disclosed\u201d so as to \u201cbespeak caution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Additionally, characterizing a cost figure as an \u201cestimate,\u201d as the Registration Statement did, is inherently cautionary, as the word \u201cestimate\u201d connotes uncertainty. Using the language of the bespeaks caution doctrine, no reasonable investor could review the Registration Statement and not understand that its cost estimates and NovaGold\u2019s current view that the Project was economically viable were subject to change. When the Registration Statement was issued, mine production start-up was still five years away, as the Registration Statement noted. Given the warnings regarding capital costs, it would be unreasonable to demand that a cost estimate must hold steady over a multi-year period requiring considerable amounts of construction of a large mine in a remote location by a company just getting its start in the mineral production business.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Plaintiff argues that the cautionary language provided is inadequate because it did not warn of the \u201cspecific\u201d event that came to pass, an increase in the construction of the tailing dam and water management structures. The Registration Statement does warn of this risk at a higher level of generality, at the level of capital costs. This level of generality is sufficient and addressed the \u201crelevant risk directly,\u201d a risk of rising capital costs. <em>See Halperin v. eBanker USA.com, Inc., </em>295 F.3d 352, 360 (2d Cir.2002). The Registration Statement need not predict all of the details of the contingency that came to pass. Requiring it to do so would force companies warning of capital cost risks to detail every single capital expenditure they planned to make and their expected costs. Such an approach would be impractical.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>In addition to criticizing the cautionary-language as too general, plaintiff also argues that the safe harbor and bespeaks caution doctrine should not apply because the defendants knew, at the time they disseminated the Registration Statement, that the Hatch Study \u2014 and its predictions \u2014 were false. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77z-2(c)(1). The consolidated complaint and plaintiffs brief, as discussed above, go to great pains to allege that misstatements in the Registration Statement resulted from negligence, not fraud, and to disclaim any intention that the Securities Act claims sound in fraud. Defendants by definition could not have been acting with negligence if they had actual knowledge that they were making false statements. Actual knowledge is the basis for a mental state supporting an allegation of fraud that involves the heightened pleading standards of Rule 9(b). <em>See Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 176 (where offering document contained sufficient cautionary language, \u201ca negligence claim, if properly pleaded, would be defeated in any event by the bespeaks caution doctrine\u201d). The consolidated complaint thus fails to allege that defendants made objectionable statements in the Registration Statement with knowledge of their falsity. The statements regarding the cost estimate and economic viability of the Project are therefore not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">7. Statements Concerning AMEC\u2019s Retention</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Defendants argue that the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d statement is not false or misleading because payment to AMEC, which plaintiff alleges the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d provision concealed, is a payment for a \u201cgeneral corporate purpose\u201d authorized by the provision. Item 504 of Regulation S-K requires a registration statement to disclose only the <em>\u201cprincipal purposes </em>for which the net proceeds to the registrant from the securities to be offered are intended to be used.\u201d 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 229.504 (emphasis supplied). Additionally, \u201c[djetails of proposed expenditures need not be given.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On its face, payment to a contractor appears to be a \u201cgeneral corporate purpose.\u201d Plaintiffs opposition presents no argument regarding the veracity of the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d provision, thereby conceding defendants\u2019 argument that the \u201cgeneral corporate purposes\u201d language contemplated payment of a consultant and was not misleading.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-8\">8. Finality of Hatch Study</p>\n<p id=\"ANki\">Plaintiffs remaining Securities Act allegation takes issue with the characterization of the Hatch Study as \u201cthe \u2018final\u2019 feasibility study,\u201d arguing that such a characterization concealed the fact that a further feasibility study was under way. Nowhere does the Registration Statement identify the Hatch Study as \u201cthe\u201d final feasibility study; the only mention of its finality is in the February 2007 Report (which is incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement) where it is called \u201ca\u201d final feasibility study. The February 2007 Report stated that \u201c[a] final feasibility study for the Galore Creek project ... confirmed the economics and mine plan of the project.\u201d The distinction between the plaintiffs allegation and the actual language used in the February 2007 Report is significant, because the term \u201cthe\u201d suggests that there is only one such study, whereas \u201ca\u201d final study contemplates the existence of others.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>Even were plaintiff to amend its complaint to allege that calling the Hatch Study \u201ca final feasibility study\u201d violated the Securities Act because NovaGold planned another feasibility study, that complaint would still fail to state a claim. The Registration Statement itself discloses the prospect of preparation of other feasibility studies: \u201cother feasibility studies ... may differ significantly from those anticipated by NovaGold\u2019s current studies and estimates.\u201d This statement contradicts an allegation that the Registration Statement misleadingly communicated that the Hatch Study would not be superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Plaintiff has thus failed to state a claim for a violation of the Securities Act based on the Registration Statement\u2019s characterization of the Hatch Study as final. As no alleged violations of the Securities Act have survived defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, the motions to dismiss the Securities Act claims are granted in their entirety.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">B. Exchange Act Claims</p>\n<p id=\"AV_Z\">Still to consider are plaintiffs claims under Section 10 of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, which are brought against the NovaGold Defendants and GCMC. Plaintiff alleges that the NovaGold Defendants defrauded investors by making material misrepresentations and omissions concerning Galore Creek. Plaintiff also brings claims under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against the NovaGold officers and directors named as defendants in the consolidated complaint. The core theory of plaintiffs Exchange Act claims resembles its core theory under the Securities Act: that NovaGold made false statements regarding the finality of the Hatch Study, the economic feasibility of the Project, and the Project\u2019s cost estimate. After considering whether plaintiff has stated an Exchange Act claim against NovaGold, the existence of a claim against the NovaGold Officers and NovaGold Directors and GCMC will then be addressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Plaintiff first argues that the NovaGold Defendants deceived investors regarding the true costs of the Project and made fraudulently optimistic statements in order to inflate NovaGold\u2019s stock price to fend off Barrick\u2019s hostile takeover bid in November 2006 (preserving the company\u2019s independence and their own jobs) and to reduce the number of shares it needed to issue in the secondary offering in April 2007, thereby minimizing the offering\u2019s dilutive effect. Absent a finding that the NovaGold defendants had motive and opportunity to commit fraud, plaintiff seeks to demonstrate that defendants, in continuing to rely on the Hatch Study in their public statements, exhibited knowledge or reckless disregard of the truth regarding escalating costs at Galore Creek and the Hatch Study\u2019s finality.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">1. Section 10(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act is designed to protect investors by serving as a \u201ccatchall provision\u201d which creates a cause of action for manipulative practices by defendants acting in bad faith. <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, </em>425 U.S. 185, 206, 96 S.Ct. 1375, 47 L.Ed.2d 668 (1976).

To state a cause of action under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 a plaintiff must allege that \u201cthe defendant, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, made a materially false statement or omitted a material fact, with scienter, and that plaintiffs reliance on defendant\u2019s action caused injury to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>ECA, </em>553 F.3d at 197 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Pleading standards beyond those required by Rule 12(b)(6), Fed.R.Civ.P., apply to plaintiffs Exchange Act claims. \u201cThe requisite state of mind in a section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 action is an intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud,\u201d or, in the alternative, recklessness. <em>ECA, </em>553 F.3d at 198 (citation omitted). Section 10(b) claims therefore sound in fraud, and must satisfy the pleading requirements of Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA by \u201cstating with particularity the circumstances constituting fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b), \u201cin all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b).

The Consolidated Complaint\u2019s Exchange Act Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">The consolidated complaint identifies two categories of allegedly material false statements.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> They are statements that failed to disclose that (1) the Hatch Study was inaccurate when released and grew increasingly obsolete, as NovaGold\u2019s internal capital cost estimates for the Project were materially higher than the Hatch Study\u2019s estimate and ultimately exceeded US$ 4 billion, rendering the Project nonviable;<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and (2) the Hatch Study was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>\u201cthe\u201d final feasibility study performed on Galore Creek, nor was it a \u201cbankable\u201d feasibility study.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">a. Statements Regarding the Project\u2019s Costs and its Economic Viability</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">The Hatch Study was announced to the public in the October 25 Press Release, with its capital cost estimate for the Project of US$ 1.8 billion or C$ 2.2 billion. The announcement indicated that the estimate had a 15% level of accuracy for cost increases and confirmed the economic viability of the Project. The study and its figures were described repeatedly in company disclosures and communications over the course of the following year, through the October 23, 2007 NOIC presentation, delivered just over a week after the October 15, 2007 Press Release announced AMEC\u2019s retention to prepare an updated feasibility study.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The plaintiff has pleaded with sufficient particularity facts supporting an inference that NovaGold knew that the Hatch Study and its cost estimate of US$ 1.8 billion were unreliable and misleading shortly after release, if not at release, or that NovaGold was at least reckless in its public statements of reliance on the estimate. Confidential informants, either from the Tahltan First Nation; the Coast Mountain Power Corporation, a power company purchased by NovaGold to supply the Project\u2019s power; or Ter con, a company hired by NovaGold to construct access roads to Galore Creek, describe NovaGold\u2019s internal cost estimates for the Project from early 2006 as running as high as C$ 2.7 billion. By early 2007, the Project was running over budget, especially due to the costs of the tailings dam and water management. By the summer of 2007, NovaGold construction managers were discussing costs approaching C$ 3.7 billion. On November 26, 2007, NovaGold announced that capital costs were expected to approach US$ 4.4 billion or C$ 5 billion. This massive revision of the Hatch Study\u2019s estimates could not have occurred without NovaGold realizing in the course of the year following the announcement of the Hatch Study that its estimates were unreliable. Despite such knowledge, NovaGold continued to tout the Hatch Study\u2019s figures throughout that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">NovaGold makes two principal attacks on this conclusion. It argues that the confidential informants are unreliable, and that the plaintiff has failed to show a material internal change to its cost estimates that it was required to disclose some time before its October 15, 2007 Press Release revealed that the new feasibility study was expected to result in significant increases to capital costs. NovaGold\u2019s witness-by-witness attacks on the confidential informants are unpersuasive and do not displace the extent to which the allegations, \u201ctaken collectively,\u201d support an inference of scienter based on knowledge or recklessness. <em>ECA, </em>553 F.3d at 198. Nova-Gold is correct that the confidential informants largely fail to identify reports or documents that would have demonstrated the falsity of NovaGold\u2019s statements, but they are not required to do so. <em>Teamsters, </em>531 F.3d at 196, on which NovaGold relies, involved allegations of scienter based on the mere presence of raw data, without any showing that it had been digested into reports concluding that the asset at issue was under-performing. Plaintiff here relies upon confidential sources, not data points, and those confidential sources attest to the presence of contrary knowledge regarding the Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>ject\u2019s budget. The confidential witnesses have described widespread knowledge at NovaGold that the Project was over budget and that the Hatch Study\u2019s figures were inaccurate. As noted, their assertions are corroborated by the fact that the November 26, 2007 announcement projected capital costs that were more than twice the amount estimated by the Hatch Study just one year earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Finally, defendants attack the plausibility of the inference of scienter by asking why Teck would have invested in a nonviable project; Barrick was willing to negotiate with NovaGold regarding a joint venture before launching a hostile takeover effort; and NovaGold continued to invest in the Project. Barrick and Teck, however, could have accepted the Hatch Study and NovaGold\u2019s representations regarding the study. Regarding NovaGold\u2019s continued investment, plaintiff points out that NovaGold had obtained additional sums from investors in the secondary offering and Teck, which it was able to use to finance the Project, rather than spending its own money.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">As defendants rightly point out, not every cost overrun or internal revision to an estimate is material, and defendants challenge the sufficiency of the allegations on this basis. In light of NovaGold\u2019s prominent and repeated reliance on the Hatch Study and its cost estimates to lure investment, however, the plaintiff has adequately pleaded materiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">First, defendants assert that a revision to the cost estimate was not material unless the Project\u2019s economic viability was jeopardized, which they assert occurred at the C$ 5 billion price point and was disclosed when NovaGold suspended the Project in November 2007. The consolidated complaint alleges that the Project was nonviable when the cost increased to only C$ 3.2 billion, raising a question of fact regarding the viability threshold inappropriate for resolution at this stage of the litigation. In any event, while defendants may prevail at trial on their arguments concerning materiality, defendants\u2019 conception of materiality is too limited at the pleading stage. <em>See Ganino v. Citizens Utils. Co., </em>228 F.3d 154, 161 (2d Cir.2000) (\u201cAt the pleading stage, a plaintiff satisfies the materiality requirement of Rule 10b-5 by alleging a statement or omission that a reasonable investor would have considered significant in making investment decisions\u201d) (citing <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 231, 108 S.Ct. 978). Applying the test from <em>Basic, </em>plaintiff has adequately alleged that a reasonable investor would want to know whether the Project costs were escalating, as described in its pleading, beyond those estimated in the Hatch Study.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The SEC\u2019s guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, 64 Fed.Reg. 45150 (1999) (\u201cSAB 99\u201d), regarding the determination of materiality, which the Second Circuit considers to be persuasive authority, <em>ECA, </em>553 F.3d at 197, supports a finding that materiality has been adequately pleaded. SAB 99 requires consideration of both quantitative and qualitative factors. <em>Id. </em>Quantitatively, SAB 99 observes that misstatements of less than 5% (with respect to the specified item) are <em>prima facie </em>unlikely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>to be material. SAB 99 at 45151. Qualitative factors \u201cthat may well render material a quantitatively small misstatement of a financial statement item\u201d include, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cwhether the misstatement arises from an item capable of precise measurement or whether it arises from an estimate and, if so, the degree of imprecision inherent in the estimate\u201d as well as \u201cwhether the misstatement concerns a segment or other portion of the registrant\u2019s business that has been identified as playing a significant role in the registrant\u2019s operations or profitability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the misstatement alleged here \u201carises from an estimate,\u201d the error was allegedly of large magnitude, and it concerned a venture highly significant to NovaGold, as evinced in part by analysts\u2019 positive comments following the release of the Hatch Study.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Defendants further attack the extent to which failure to disclose a cost estimate is a material omission by arguing that forecasts need not be disclosed even if they render previously issued forward-looking statements incorrect. They rely on two decisions of district courts in this Circuit, <em>In re New York Community Bancorp, Inc., Securities Litigation, </em>448 F.Supp.2d 466, 480-81 (E.D.N.Y.2006), and <em>In re Duane Reade Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>No. 02 Civ. 6478(NRB), 2003 WL 22801416, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2003), to argue that NovaGold had no duty to disclose internal forecasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u201cStatements that are opinions or predictions are not <em>per se </em>inactionable under the securities laws.\u201d <em>In re International Business Machines Corporate Securities Litigation, </em>163 F.3d 102, 107 (2d Cir.1998) (\u201cIn <em>re IBM</em>\u201d). Having chosen to speak out publicly regarding the Project\u2019s cost estimates, NovaGold was under a duty to \u201cspeak truthfully about material issues,\u201d <em>Caiola v. Citibank, </em>N.A., <em>New York, </em>295 F.3d 312, 331 (2d Cir.2002), and to correct misleading statements, regardless of whether or not they were \u201cforecasts.\u201d The duty to correct applies to statements that are false at the time they are made, and it arises \u201cwhen [the defendant] learned that its prior statement ... was untrue.\u201d <em>Lattanzio v. Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP, </em>476 F.3d 147, 154 (2d Cir.2007) (citation omitted). <em>Cf. In re IBM, </em>163 F.3d at 109 (duty to correct does not arise if the original statements were not misleading when made). In contrast, the more limited duty to update applies to \u201ca statement made misleading by intervening events, even if the statement was true when made.\u201d <em>Overton v. Todman and Co., </em>478 F.3d 479, 487 (2d Cir.2007).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> NovaGold\u2019s role in the Hatch Study and adoption of its figures further saddled the company with a duty to correct material errors in the Hatch Study. <em>Elkind v. Liggett &amp; Myers, Inc., </em>635 F.2d 156, 163 (2d Cir.1980) (\u201ca company may so involve itself in the preparation of reports and projections by outsiders as to assume a duty to correct material errors in those projections\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Finally, defendants argue that the alleged misstatements are immaterial expressions of optimism about the Project and the Hatch Study. Simple \u201cexpressions of puffery and corporate optimism\u201d do not violate securities laws, as companies \u201care not required to take a gloomy, fearful or defeatist view of the future.\u201d <em>Rombach, </em>355 F.3d at 174. Statements classified as puffery are expressions of optimism \u201ctoo general to cause a reasonable investor to rely on them.\u201d <em>EGA, </em>553 F.3d at 206. Cost estimates, a forecast that the Project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>will be commercially viable, or a comment that the Project\u2019s budget and construction schedule are unchanged are too specific to be considered mere puffery.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The three Second Circuit decisions on which the defendants rely all involved general expressions of optimism and are thus inapposite. <em>See In re IBM, </em>163 F.3d at 108 (\u201ccompany was not concerned about being able to cover the dividend\u201d was \u201ctoo indefinite to be actionable\u201d); <em>San Leandro Emergency Medical Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Companies, Inc., </em>75 F.3d 801, 811 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cPhilip Morris was \u2018optimistic\u2019 about its earnings and \u2018expected\u2019 Marlboro to perform well\u201d); <em>Lasker v. New York State Electric and Gas Corp., </em>85 F.3d 55, 59 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cstrategies [that] lead to continued prosperity\u201d and \u201ccommitment to create earnings opportunities\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">b. Finality of Hatch Study and Existence of AMEC Feasibility Study</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">This second category of misrepresentations includes allegations that from October 25, 2006 until May 23, 2007 the defendants portrayed the Hatch Study as \u201cthe\u201d final feasibility study and represented the feasibility study process as complete, while secretly retaining AMEC to conduct a new feasibility study, using proceeds from the secondary offering in an unauthorized manner. It also includes the disclosures in the October 15, 2007 Press Release and October 17, 2007 Conference Call that AMEC was retained to conduct an \u201cupdated\u201d feasibility study, rather than a \u201cnew\u201d feasibility study, the omission of any mention of AMEC in the October 23, 2007 NOIC Presentation, and NovaGold\u2019s failure to disclose that AMEC had been retained by March 2007 at the latest. The plaintiff has failed to plead that these statements were false or if false were made with the requisite scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The problems plaguing plaintiffs attack on the Registration Statement\u2019s alleged representation of the Hatch Study as \u201cthe\u201d final feasibility study similarly plague its Exchange Act claims regarding the finality of the Hatch Study and the retention of AMEC. The disclosures that form the basis of the Exchange Act claim do not describe the Hatch Study as \u201cthe\u201d final feasibility study, only \u201ca\u201d final study. In addition, the Registration Statement discloses the possibility of \u201cother\u201d feasibility studies, and the February 2007 Report and May 23, 2007 Press Release both state that various forms of reviews were ongoing. For example, the February 2007 Report disclosed that review of the Project budget \u201cwill continue as basic and detailed project engineering proceeds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Finally, the consolidated complaint alleges that NovaGold omitted to disclose on two occasions that proceeds were being used to fund AMEC\u2019s engagement. In addition to the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d section in the Registration Statement, which was discussed above in connection with the Securities Act claims, the consolidated complaint alleges that, on April 24, 2007, \u201cNovaGold reiterated that it intended to use the proceeds of its secondary offering to, <em>inter alia, ... </em>fund further exploration at ... the Galore Creek project.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The source of the latter statement is unclear. If an oral, contemporaneous statement, it may not be used to contradict the \u201cUse of Proceeds\u201d provision in the Registration Statement. <em>See Olkey, </em>98 F.3d at 9. Regardless, the allegation that proceeds would be used for exploration at Galore Creek, <em>among other uses (\u201cinter alia </em>\u201d), does not mean that proceeds could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>not also be used for a feasibility study. Additionally, it is unclear why a feasibility study would not be part of the exploration process.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The disclosures\u2019 failure to name AMEC as the author of a new study is similarly insufficient to render the omission material. As already described, NovaGold disclosed that reviews were ongoing. The plaintiff has not pleaded sufficient facts to give fair notice that the retention of AMEC, as opposed to different outside consultants or Nova-Gold employees, was material. Plaintiff\u2019s opposition brief fails to argue that the omission of AMEC from the disclosures constituted a violation of the Exchange Act, essentially abandoning claims based on AMEC\u2019s retention.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">9. Exchange Act Claims Against Nova-Gold Officers, Directors, and GCMC</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Having found that the consolidated complaint states a claim for relief under the Exchange Act against NovaGold to the extent that it alleges that it made knowingly or recklessly false statements regarding the Hatch Study\u2019s accuracy (but not its finality), it is necessary to determine whether the consolidated complaint states a Section 10(b) claim for relief against GCMC, the NovaGold Directors, or any of the four NovaGold Officers it names \u2014 CEO Van Nieuwenhuyse, CFO MacDonald, COO Harris, and Brown, the Vice President of Business Development and General Manager of Galore Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-11\">A plaintiff must plead scienter for each defendant. <em>See Gemino, </em>228 F.3d at 168. It is possible to plead scienter against a corporation \u201cwithout being able to name the individuals who concocted and disseminated the fraud.\u201d <em>Teamsters, </em>531 F.3d at 195 (citation omitted). Here, the plaintiff has failed to plead scienter with respect to any defendant but NovaGold.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">Defendants assert \u2014 and plaintiff does not contest \u2014 that the complaint lacks any allegations of scienter against the NovaGold Directors or GCMC. It also fails to identify any misrepresentation uttered by Brown.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> While Van Nieuwenhuyse, Harris, and MacDonald each made statements alleged to be false,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> none of the confidential sources whose comments supported the finding of corporate scienter allege that these three individuals were aware of the falsity of the representations they were disseminating. With respect to scienter, the plaintiff does not even argue in its brief that Van Nieuwenhuyse, MacDonald, Harris and Brown specifically acted with scienter, instead presenting its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>arguments against the \u201cExchange Act defendants,\u201d which include NovaGold, collectively. The plaintiff attempts to impute an inference of scienter to each defendant by virtue of the fact that the alleged fraud concerned \u201ccore\u201d business operations, <em>see In re Atlas Air Worldwide </em>Holdings, 324 F.Supp.2d 474, 489 (S.D.N.Y.2004), but the Second Circuit has not endorsed this theory. The plaintiff fails to plead any motive and opportunity to defraud particular to the NovaGold Officers.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">While the consolidated complaint has failed to plead scienter with respect to the NovaGold Officers, it suggests a basis for such allegations against Van Nieuwenhuyse and MacDonald premised on their duty to speak truthfully and Van Nieuwenhuyse\u2019s certification of the Registration Statement and their joint certification of two separate quarterly reports in 2007 containing the alleged misrepresentations. Plaintiff will thus be given leave to replead scienter for Van Nieuwenhuyse and MacDonald.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The defendants have also moved to dismiss claims for \u201ccontrol person\u201d violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), solely because plaintiff has not alleged any primary violation of the Exchange Act. Because an Exchange Act claim against NovaGold survives, defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss control person violations brought pursuant to Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a), is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">C. Scope of the Class</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">Defendants also argue pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), Fed.R.Civ.P., that there is no subject matter jurisdiction over putative class members who reside abroad and purchased their shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange. The Securities Act claims having been dismissed, this issue will be addressed with regard to Exchange Act claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">Congress determines the subject-matter jurisdiction of lower federal courts, and a plaintiff bears the burden of proving its existence. <em>Morrison v. National Austra</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>lia Bank Ltd., </em>547 F.3d 167, 170 (2d Cir.2008) (citation omitted). As the securities laws are silent regarding their extraterritorial application, courts have long used use their \u201cunderlying purpose\u201d to discern congressional intent regarding the use of \u201cthe precious resources of the United States courts and law enforcement agencies\u201d to police securities transactions. <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The Court of Appeals has often concluded that \u201cCongress would have wanted to redress harms perpetrated abroad which have a substantial impact on investors or markets within the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 (citation omitted). Courts employ a binary inquiry to determine the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction over securities law claims with an international component, known as the \u201cconduct test\u201d and the \u201ceffects test,\u201d which ask \u201c(1) whether the wrongful conduct occurred in the United States, and (2) whether the wrongful conduct had a substantial effect in the United States or upon United States citizens.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The two parts of the test may be applied together, although a party may also rely on one prong alone. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Here, plaintiff avails itself of the conduct test. The conduct test allows for subject-matter jurisdiction \u201cif activities in this country were more than merely preparatory to a fraud and culpable acts or omissions occurring here directly caused losses to investors abroad.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Assessing whether American acts directly caused losses abroad requires courts to identify the actions constituting the fraud and then determine whether those actions \u201cemanated from the United States.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Plaintiff has not carried its burden on the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction. This issue presents an example of what the Second Circuit recently referred to as a \u201cforeign-cubed\u201d securities class action, at least regarding the segment of the putative class at issue here. <em>Id. </em>at 172. The plaintiffs in this segment of the class are foreign and they bring a lawsuit against a foreign issuer, based on their purchase of securities in a foreign country. <em>See id. </em>The fraud was concocted and conducted in Canada, at NovaGold\u2019s headquarters and at Galore Creek, both of which are located in British Columbia. The financial information at issue was derived from Canadian activities and analyzed there, by both Hatch, another Canadian company, and NovaGold, and formed the basis for reports issued from Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">To establish jurisdiction under the conducts test, plaintiff cites the use of Citigroup, a New York-based investment bank, to be the lead underwriter on the secondary offering; the October 23, 2007 NOIC Presentation, which occurred in New Orleans; investment banks\u2019 reporting on NovaGold in the United States, Nova-Gold\u2019s dissemination of SEC filings, and press releases in the United States, and conference calls with participants from the United States. The plaintiff also notes that up to 75% of NovaGold\u2019s trading volume occurred on the American Stock Exchange (the \u201cAMEX\u201d), and that Nova-Gold\u2019s share price declined on both the AMEX and the Toronto Stock Exchange following the disclosure of the Project\u2019s suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">None of plaintiffs allegations satisfy the conducts test. The location of an underwriter is insufficient conduct to support jurisdiction. <em>See, e.g., Bersch v. Drexel Firestone, Inc., </em>519 F.2d 974, 979-80, 987 (2d Cir.1975). The interest of American analysts, and the purchase of Nova-Gold shares on the AMEX also are not part of the fraud alleged. The only allegedly culpable conduct occurring in the United States was the dissemination of disclosures, including SEC filings. The disclosures, however, \u201cemanated\u201d from Canada. <em>Morrison, </em>547 F.3d at 173. No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>vaGold has not alleged that the disclosures were concocted in the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 174; <em>see also SEC v. Berger, </em>322 F.3d 187, 194 (2d Cir.2003) (subject matter jurisdiction existed where the \u201cfraudulent scheme was masterminded and implemented by Berger in the United States\u201d). <em>Morrison </em>declined to find subject matter jurisdiction arising from an Australian company\u2019s public statements, largely because \u201c[ejnsuring the accuracy of such statements is much more central to the responsibilities of ... corporate headquarters, which issued the statements.\u201d <em>Morrison, </em>547 F.3d at 176. Plaintiff having not alleged otherwise, NovaGold\u2019s Canadian headquarters similarly bore responsibility for the company\u2019s public statements and disclosures, and such statements thus emanated from Canada, not the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">While SEC filings constitute U.S. conduct, <em>Berger, </em>322 F.3d at 195 (citation omitted), filing documents with the SEC alone is insufficient to confer subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>See Itoba v. Lep Group PLC, </em>54 F.3d 118, 123-24 (2d Cir.1995). Moreover, a foreign plaintiff would struggle to show that those filings \u201cdirectly caused\u201d the losses they suffered. <em>Berger, </em>322 F.3d at 193 (citation omitted). The same problem would plague any attempt to pin subject-matter jurisdiction on the October 23, 2007 NOIC Presentation in New Orleans. The lack of culpable conduct occurring in the United States and the pleading\u2019s failure to tie foreign losses \u201cdirectly\u201d to that conduct militate against the exercise of subject-matter jurisdiction over the claims of foreigners purchasing shares abroad.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Plaintiff also requests leave to amend to allege sufficient jurisdictional facts following discovery of NovaGold\u2019s conduct in the United States. As plaintiff has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case favoring the exercise of jurisdiction over foreign plaintiffs purchasing shares abroad, plaintiffs request for jurisdictional discovery is denied. <em>In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, </em>538 F.3d 71, 96 (2d Cir.2008). Should facts emerge during fact discovery on plaintiffs claims suggesting the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction over foreign plaintiffs who purchased shares abroad, any decision on class certification could be altered to include those plaintiffs. <em>See Boucher v. Syracuse University, </em>164 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201ccourts are required to reassess their rulings as the case develops,\u201d and \u201cmust define, redefine, subclass, and decertify as appropriate in the progression of the case from assertion to facts\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">The Underwriter Defendants\u2019 and the Hatch Defendants\u2019 January 23, 2009 motions to dismiss are granted, and all claims against those defendants are dismissed. The NovaGold Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss of the same date is granted with respect to the consolidated complaint\u2019s Securities Act claims and Exchange Act Section 10(b) claims brought against the NovaGold Officers, the NovaGold Directors, and GCMC, as well as Exchange Act claims against NovaGold that are premised on allegations regarding the finality of the Hatch Study, the use of proceeds from the secondary offering, and the retention of AMEC.

The consolidated complaint appears to describe this document both as a \u201cpress release,\u201d and as \u201cthe February 20, 2007 Change Report, which was dated February 9, 2007.\u201d It is possible that both a press release and a report were issued, but the consolidated complaint does not clarify whether this occurred, and the language of which the plaintiff complains appears to be drawn from the press release only. Nonetheless, the document(s) will be referred to as \u201cthe February 2007 Report\u201d throughout this Opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\">. Plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint on December 20, 2008. Plaintiff submitted a letter on December 22 requesting permission to file a corrected consolidated amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\">. The Securities Act claims in the December 30, 2008 consolidated complaint are time-barred because November 26, 2007 announcement of plaintiffs on inquiry notice that contained the false statements of The plaintiff therefore relies on it is undisputed that the Project\u2019s suspension put the Registration Statement which the plaintiff complains its November 21, 2008 complaint to bring its Securities Act claims against these moving defendants within the one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b326-7\">. The consolidated complaint criticizes four additional documents incorporated by reference into the Registration Statement as \"materially false and misleading,\u201d but fails to identify any language these documents contained or indicate that they used language similar to the allegedly misleading language contained in the February 2007 Report. Allegations based on the Registration Statement\u2019s incorporation of these documents fail to give defendants fair notice of how they provide the grounds for a Securities Act claim. They will accordingly be dismissed pursuant to Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Civ.P. <em>See Leibowitz v. Cornell Univ., </em>445 F.3d 586, 591 (2d Cir.2006) (Rule 8 requires a plaintiff to \"give a defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d). In any event, the consolidated complaint treats the language in the February 2007 Report as exemplary of the objectionable language in the other documents incorporated by reference (\u201d[f]or instance, the [February 2007 Report] stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>the Hatch Study was the 'final' feasibility study\u201d). Making inferences in the plaintiff's favor by assuming that the plaintiff intended to challenge these other documents on the same grounds on which it challenges statements in the February 2007 Report, and that allegations regarding additional incorporated documents therefore meet the Rule 8(a) standard, such challenges would consequently be time-barred in the same manner as challenges to the February 2007 Report, because its objectionable language is based on the Hatch Study.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-6\">. Plaintiff commits the same error when it attempts to distinguish the October 15, 2007 Press Release from cases cited by defendants, arguing that the press release at issue here does not reach \"the exacting level of detail needed to put a plaintiff on inquiry notice <em>of fraud.\" </em>(Emphasis supplied). Given the heightened pleading standard required for fraud claims, described elsewhere in this Opinion, it is reasonable to require that plaintiffs need more information before they may be charged with being on notice of a securities fraud claim than they need to bring a claim challenging an untrue statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b328-11\">. Moreover, recent Second Circuit precedent addressing whether a particular disclosure is vague or specific enough to trigger inquiry notice has focused on whether the disclosure at issue specifically identifies the company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>against which a plaintiff brings its claims. In <em>Staehr, </em>while noting that there is no \"categorical rule that inquiry notice can only be triggered by public pronouncements containing company-specific information,\u201d 547 F.3d at 429, it proceeded to analyze the degree to which the public information concerned the defendant\u2019s practices. <em>Id. </em>at 429-30.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\">. The identical safe harbor applies to the Exchange Act, and is codified at 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b332-7\">. Because the Registration Statement itself contains adequate cautionary language, it is unnecessary to consider the even more extensive risk disclosures in the Hatch Study. The Registration Statement instructed investors on how to retrieve the study over the internet via the System for Electronic Document Access and Retrieval, the official website that provides access to information filed by public companies with the Canadian securities authorities, and explained that the study contained a complete description of the important \u201cassumptions\u201d and \"qualifications\u201d which were only summarized in the Registration Statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">. The requirement that the language in the offering document must warn of \"the specific contingency that lies of the heart of the alleged misrepresentation\u201d is drawn from the <em>P. Stolz </em>case, which cited to the Second Circuit's slightly different characterization of the requirement in <em>Hunt, </em>159 F.3d at 729, that the cautionary language \"must relate directly to that by which the plaintiffs claim to have been misled.\u201d <em>P. Stolz, </em>355 F.3d at 97. The <em>P. Stolz </em>plaintiffs, who had purchased membership interests in a company called \u201cSmart World,\u201d alleged that Smart World failed to disclose \"that the investment bank it had retained had failed to raise any money for the company ..., that the projections of sales and revenues it was relying' upon were totally without foundation, or that the Company was essentially insolvent and was supporting itself through continued sales of membership interests rather than from revenues from ongoing business operations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Smart World had orally represented that it had agreed to partner with an investment bank to undertake an initial public offering to raise $30 million. <em>Id. </em>The Second Circuit found that the non-disclosures were forward-looking and were protected by sufficient cautionary language, which also had the effect of neutralizing the oral representation regarding the $30 million offering. <em>Id. </em>at 98. Among other statements, the court emphasized the following language in Smart World\u2019s disclosure: \"we may need additional capital, which we may not be able to obtain .... No assurance can be given, nor has any been given, that any of the Financing transactions ... will be consummated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 98 (emphasis omitted). It was sufficient to speak in terms of \"transactions\u201d and \"additional capital\u201d to offset the promise of the $30 million initial public offering; Smart World did not need to reference that specific transaction. Adopting the rule that plaintiff suggests by requiring that cautionary language disclose a risk in perfect detail would be inconsistent with the outcome in <em>P. Stolz.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">. Plaintiff also fails to respond to defendants\u2019 argument that the securities laws did not require disclosure of AMEC's retention because the decision to engage a consultant to provide advice regarding the Project\u2019s costs is immaterial, given that the uncertainty of the Project\u2019s costs was disclosed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b335-9\">. Canadian securities regulations indicate that a feasibility study is designated as \u201cfinal,\u201d in contrast with a \u201cpreliminary\u201d feasibility study, to denote that it may serve as the basis for a final decision by a financial institution regarding funding, because it is \"compre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>hensive\u201d and investigates the relevant issues \"in sufficient detail.\u201d National Instrument 43-101, Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects, B.C. Reg. 381/2005, s. 1.1 (Can.). Again, no indication exists that a \"final\u201d feasibility study may not later be revised as conditions change.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b336-11\">. The allegations of control person violations brought pursuant to Section 15 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>77o, </em>must be dismissed as well. Establishing control person liability requires a plaintiff to make a <em>prima facie </em>showing of a primary violation by the controlled person. <em>See ATSI, </em>493 F.3d at 108.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b338-5\">.Following the <em>Tellabs </em>decision, the Seventh Circuit has held that allegations from confidential witnesses must be discounted, because \"[i]t is hard to see how information from anonymous sources could be deemed 'compelling' or how we could take account of plausible opposing inferences. Perhaps these confidential sources have axes to grind. Perhaps they are lying. Perhaps they don't even exist.\u201d <em>Higginbotham v. Baxter Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>495 F.3d 753, 757 (7th Cir.2007). The Second Circuit has not yet addressed the issue, and, absent its guidance to the contrary, its precedent allowing the use of confidential sources to demonstrate scienter will be followed here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b338-10\">. The plaintiff asserts six different misleading aspects of the allegedly false statements. The six aspects have been consolidated into two categories here for ease of analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b338-11\">. While defendants point out that many of these statements related to costs are forward-looking, because the consolidated complaint alleges that NovaGold had actual knowledge that the statements were false when made, the PSLRA safe harbor and bespeaks caution doctrine would not apply. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77z-2(c)(1)(B) (PSLRA safe harbor); <em>P. Stolz, </em>355 F.3d at 97 (bespeaks caution doctrine).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\">. The alleged false statements appeared in the sections of the press releases, conference calls, quarterly reports, and the Registration Statement quoted in the Background section above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\">. On the October 17, 2007 Conference Call, MacDonald stated that Teck's initial contribution to the joint venture \"covers 100% of the cash payments for Galore Creek from August 1, 2007 to well into 2008.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\">. Defendants attempt to analogize to drug testing, where the Second Circuit has ruled that a drug company did not need to report isolated deaths from its drug until they occurred in statistically significant numbers, threatening the product\u2019s commercial viability. <em>In re Carter-Wallace, Inc. Securities Litigation, </em>150 F.3d 153, 157 (2d Cir.1998). Here, the plaintiff has adequately alleged a concealment of significant financial information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b341-6\">. While the PSLRA safe harbor suggests that a duty to update would not apply to some forecasts, the safe harbor is not an obstacle to imposing the duty to update here, as Nova-Gold continued to refer to the Hatch Study despite mounting evidence that the Hatch Study was materially obsolete.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b342-6\">. Stating that the Project would be commercially viable is not the same as generally touting a company\u2019s optimistic outlook. The commercial viability determination is the result of a cosl/revenue analysis that may be assessed using quantitative data.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b343-8\">. Brown joined NovaGold in 2007, and the consolidated complaint makes no mention of any role he played in the events at issue other than reciting his title.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\">. The consolidated complaint attributes statements regarding the costs and economic viability of the Project in the October 25, 2006 Press Release, the November 8, 2006 Conference Call, the November 14, 2006 Press Release, the December 5, 2006 Press Release, the April 25, 2007 Conference Call, and the October 17, 2007 Conference Call to Van Nieuwenhuyse. It also alleges that Van Nieuwenhuyse and the NovaGold Directors signed the Registration Statement. MacDonald allegedly reiterated the Hatch Study\u2019s cost estimate on the November 8, 2006, March 2, 2007, and April 25, 2007 Conference Calls. Van Nieuwenhuyse and MacDonald also both allegedly certified the July 16, 2007 and October 15, 2007 Quarterly Reports, which reiterated the Hatch Study\u2019s budget for the Project. Only one comment is attributed to Harris: the statement in the February 2007 Report that a \u201cProject Development Team has been reviewing the Feasibility Study capital costs\u201d and \"determined that the Feasibility Study budget is sufficient for construction of the Galore Creek project within current contingency allocations,\u201d noting that \"review will continue as basic and detailed project engineering proceeds.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\">. With respect to the allegations that the defendants sought to fend off Barrick\u2019s takeover bid by inflating NovaGold's stock price, plaintiff pleads and argues that the NovaGold Defendants generally had this motive. Such a motive, when ascribed to individual employees, could be understood as the desire to preserve one's career and compensation, but these are too general to support an inference of scienter. <em>Kalnit, </em>264 F.3d at 139. Plaintiff introduces a new theory in its opposition brief \u2014 which it again argues generally against all NovaGold defendants \u2014 that the defendants wanted to keep the stock price high to minimize the dilution of NovaGold's stock price in the secondary offering, relying on <em>In re Time Warner Inc. Securities Litigation, 9 </em>F.3d 259, 269-70 (2d Cir.1993) <em>(\"Time Warner\"). </em>Plaintiff has not pleaded avoidance of dilution and not sought leave to amend its complaint to allege such a theory. As the consolidated complaint does not plead scienter on this basis, a motive to avoid the dilution of Nova-Gold\u2019s stock price need not be addressed here. Even were the court to consider such a motive, however, it would fail to establish scienter, as any company issuing new shares of stock could be deemed to be acting with scienter. Moreover, <em>Time Warner </em>involved not only a new stock offering that \"substantially diluted the rights of existing shareholders,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 262, but also an offering that followed unsuccessful efforts to find strategic partners who would infuse the debt-laden company with cash. <em>See Rothman v. Gregor, 220 </em>F.3d 81, 93 (2d Cir.2000) (explaining the <em>Time Warner </em>holding as \"in some circumstances, the artificial inflation of stock price in the acquisition context may be sufficient for securities fraud scienter\u201d). Finally, the opposition brief does not tie the desire to avoid dilution of the stock to each of the NovaGold Officers, again ascribing a general corporate motive to individuals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b344-11\">.
