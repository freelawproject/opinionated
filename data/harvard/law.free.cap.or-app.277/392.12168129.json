Because father now supports placement of the children with mother, we dismiss father\u2019s appeals as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Sometime after the juvenile court took jurisdiction of the children and the children were placed in relative foster care in Klamath County, DHS proposed to move the children, in accordance with the permanency plan of reunification, from foster care to mother\u2019s care in Portland. Father and the Tribes filed separate objections to the relocation of the children, asserting that, among other things, it would severely and detrimentally affect father\u2019s visitation with the children, would not be in the best interests of the children, and would affect the safety and stability of the children and their connection with the Tribes. The juvenile court denied the objections of father and the Tribes and entered an order from which father appeals.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On appeal, father contends that the court erred by denying the objections \u201cbefore allowing an evidentiary hearing on the matter.\u201d During the pendency of this appeal, the juvenile court held a permanency hearing. The court\u2019s resulting permanency judgment concluded that mother had made sufficient progress to allow the children to return home and that, in fact, the children had been recently returned to mother in Portland. The court also noted that father <em>\u201csupports the current placement </em>and did not contest this hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">DHS filed a notice of probable mootness in this court, asserting that, given father\u2019s position supporting placement of the children with mother, there is no longer a controversy between the parties. Father did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Oregon courts retain the authority to dismiss moot cases. <em>Couey v. Atkins, </em>357 Or 460, 520, 355 P3d 866 (2015). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u201cA case is moot when it involves a matter that no longer is a controversy between the parties.\u201d <em>Dept. of Human Services v. B. </em>A., 263 Or App 675, 678, 330 P3d 47 (2014). Here, because the sole issue on appeal is the court\u2019s denial of father\u2019s objection to placement of the children with mother, and father now <em>supports </em>placement of the children with mother, there is no longer a controversy between the parties. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Appeals dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-9\"> The Tribes did not appeal the order and are not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
