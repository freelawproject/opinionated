It has no effect on the\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Shawn Terris appeals a summary judgment in favor of her former employer, defendant County of Santa Barbara (County), in her wrongful termination action. We conclude, among other things, that: 1) Terris did not exhaust her administrative remedies on her claims that the County terminated her job to discriminate against her in violation of sections 1101, 1102, and 1102.5; [ [2) there are no triable issues of fact on Terris's claim that she was terminated because of her sexual orientation ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a), Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) );] ] but 3) the trial court erred by awarding the County costs on the FEHA cause of action. We affirm in part and reverse in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Terris was a County employee in the position of a \"Program Business Leader\" analyst. She was subject to civil services rules. The County projected a \"budget shortfall for the fiscal year 2009-2010\" of nearly $11 million. Terris was one of 35 employees laid off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After receiving a layoff notice in July 2009, Terris exercised her right to remain employed by displacing or \"bump[ing]\" a person in another position-the \"First 5 Program/Business Leader.\" Patricia Wheatley, the director\n   of First 5 Santa Barbara, decided that position required special skills. She requested a \"special skills designation\" to expand the requirements for that position. Theresa Duer, the County assistant human resources director, granted that request and determined Terris was not qualified for that position. Terris was laid off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Terris filed a complaint with the County's Civil Service Commission (Commission). She alleged her termination procedure violated her seniority rights. She argued the County and County Executive Officer (CEO) Michael F. Brown engaged in \"discrimination against her for exercising her rights as a County employee, as an elected Santa Barbara County Employees Retirement Board Trustee, and for filing a Claim Against Public Entity....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 20, 2009, the Commission ruled that 1) it could decide whether the County followed the proper procedures for terminating Terris's employment, but 2) it could not decide Terris's discrimination claims because she had not exhausted her administrative remedy of filing a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Office (EEO). Terris did\n   not file an EEO complaint. She urged the Commission to decide only whether the County followed the proper procedures in terminating her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   One month later, the Commission ruled the special skills designation was appropriate, the layoff was authorized, and the County complied with all required procedures. It found, \"[A]ll proper notices were given and seniority was followed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Terris filed a wrongful termination and employment discrimination action. In her third amended complaint, she alleged the County: 1) terminated her employment to prevent her from holding an elected office as a retirement board trustee (\u00a7 1101) (second cause of action), 2) interfered with her political activity as a retirement board trustee (\u00a7 1102) (third cause of action), and 3) retaliated against her for lawful complaints she had made (\u00a7 1102.5) (fourth cause of action). [ [In her fifth cause of action, she alleged sexual orientation discrimination. She said the County \"regarded her as [a] lesbian,\" which was the \"motivating factor\" in its decision to terminate her. ( Gov. Code, \u00a7 12940, subd. (a) (FEHA).) ] ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court granted the County's motion for summary judgment. It found: 1) Terris did not exhaust her administrative remedies on her second, third and fourth causes of action; and 2) there was no triable issue of fact on her FEHA cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Exhausting Administrative Remedies\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Terris contends the trial court erred in ruling that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies before filing her wrongful termination action alleging violation of sections 1101, 1102, and 1102.5.

By enacting section 244, subdivision (a), the Legislature did not create such a new administrative review process that applies to all administrative agencies. It eliminated the requirement that a claim must first be bought before the Labor Commissioner before filing a civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <em>\n    Adequate Notice\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Terris contends the County did not provide her adequate notice of her rights and the consequences. She claimed the County's notices only said she \"may\" appeal. But exhaustion of administrative remedies is mandatory \" 'even though the administrative remedy is couched in permissive language.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Marquez v.

Moreover, Terris admitted she \"was aware of\" the \"EEO complaint procedure\" and was represented by counsel at all relevant stages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Commission also advised Terris and her counsel that if Terris wanted to raise her Labor Code discrimination/retaliation issues, she first had to file an EEO complaint. Because she had not filed it, the Commission could only decide whether proper job termination procedures were followed. It offered her a continuance so that issue and the discrimination/retaliation issues could be decided together. But she and her counsel\n   <em>\n    rejected\n   </em>\n   that alternative and\n   <em>\n    elected\n   </em>\n   to have a Commission hearing only on the procedural issues. Terris decided not to file the EEO complaint. Consequently, her section 1101, 1102, and 1102.5 claims are barred. (\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

Awarding costs against them could undermine the state's anti-discrimination public policy and have a chilling effect on meritorious FEHA \"suits by plaintiffs with limited financial resources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 113,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=186%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20826\">\n    186 Cal.Rptr.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=347%20P.3d%20976\">\n    347 P.3d 976\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) There is, however, an exception to this rule for frivolous litigation. But it does not apply here. The inability to prove an FEHA element is not equivalent to filing an entirely baseless lawsuit.
