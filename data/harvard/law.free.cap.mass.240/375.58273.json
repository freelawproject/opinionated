The only witness at the trial was one Wedge, a salesman of the plaintiff, who testified that the defendant was a baker with whom he had had business dealings for about four or five years previous to September 21, 1920; that on that date he called at the defendant\u2019s place of business and requested bim to buy some flour; that after further conversation the defendant said to him, \u201cAll right. I will take a car.\u201d The brand and size of the packages having been agreed upon, the witness thereupon took out his order book and made out the contract, the defendant standing at his elbow; before signing the witness said to the defendant, \u201cI\u2019ll sign this, Frank,\u201d and then signed \"Omaha Flour Mills Co. by A. J. Wedge\u201d in the place for the seller\u2019s name; and Frank Santarpio in the place for the buyer\u2019s name; that while he was writing, the defendant was standing by his side. He further testified that he thought the defendant could not read nor write, having been told so; that when he had previous business dealings with the defendant while representing the plaintiff, or the Washburn-Crosby Company, the same form of written contract as Exhibit 1 was made out by the witness, and that he filled in the blank spaces; that he had sold the defendant about two thousand barrels of flour, covered by four to six contracts in the same form as that upon which this action is brought; that when the earlier sales were made he filled in all the blank spaces except on one occasion when the signature of the defendant was written by the latter\u2019s twelve year old son at the request of the witness, in the presence of the defendant. Copies of these contracts were admitted in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The witness also testified that in making all the contracts with the defendant he had followed his usual practice of preparing four copies: a blue original for the mill, a yellow copy for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>purchaser, a white one to be kept in the branch office of the plaintiff in Boston, and a tissue which remains in the salesman\u2019s book. At the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence the contract, Exhibit 1, which is annexed to the declaration and appears to be the original. This evidence was excluded by the trial judge, as was the yellow copy, given by the witness to the defendant. A verdict was directed for the defendant on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to show the execution of the contract by the defendant. To the exclusion of the evidence so offered, and to the direction of the verdict, the plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The question is whether the jury would have been warranted in finding that the salesman Wedge was authorized by the defendant to sign his name to the contract. We are of opinion that it could not have been ruled as matter of law that there was no evidence to show that Wedge was so authorized, but it was a question of fact for the jury to determine. It is plain that Wedge could have been the agent of the defendant for that purpose. \u201cWhere the principal is present, the act of signing ... is to be deemed his personal act, as much as if he held the pen, and another person guided his hand.\u201d Story on Agency, \u00a7 51. If the name of the defendant was written by Wedge in the presence of the defendant and at his request or by his consent, express or implied, it is his act. <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Gardner, 5 </em>Cush. 483. <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Goodridge, </em>6 Cush. 117. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Maguire, </em>7 Gray, 177. <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Lynde, </em>6 Allen, 305, 309, 310. <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Lucy, </em>157 Mass. 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">From the evidence that in previous dealings in the purchase and sale of flour the witness Wedge signed the defendant\u2019s name to contracts in the same form as that declared on in the present action, and the evidence that the defendant could not write, it could have been inferred that when Wedge said to him, \u201cI\u2019ll sign this, Frank,\u201d it was the defendant\u2019s name that was to be signed, and was so intended by Wedge and so understood by the defendant; and that the latter having made no objection he thereby authorized it. There would have been no occasion for Wedge to announce his intention of signing, merely for the purpose of writing his own or his employer\u2019s signature. It follows that the original contract and the copy were admissible. A verdict could not properly have been directed for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
