It appeared that, while the defendant had possession of the premises in question, she collected rents in the amount of $10,871, and at the hearing before the master she contended that she should be allowed, and that the plaintiffs should be charged, with $652.26 as \"agent\u2019s commission for care and management of the estate, being at the rate of six per cent upon rents collected,\u201d and with $513.60, \u201cagent\u2019s commission for making leases which reserve rents in the total of $10,272, the charge being five per cent upon that amount.\u201d As to these contentions of the defendant the master found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-12\">\u201cI find that . . . the defendant, acting through her agent, has managed the property to the advantage of all interested parties since March 12, 1920, and I rule, if it is the master\u2019s duty so to do, that if the plaintiffs wish to retain their equity in the property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>whether by setting aside the foreclosure proceedings or otherwise, they must pay reasonable compensation to the defendant for the prudent and successful management which she has exercised. I find that there was no express agreement as to the amount to be paid for said services. Upon all the evidence I find that the defendant is entitled to $825 for her services in the care and management of the property, making leases and collecting rents.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-5\">The plaintiffs requested the master to rule that \u201con the evi-. dence no more than five per cent of the gross amount of rentals received can be charged for all collections and management, including effecting leases and making disbursements.\u201d The request was refused. The plaintiffs filed objections and exceptions to such refusal and to \u201cthe finding of the master that for the management of the property in the ways found by him as facts the sum of $825 is reasonable to allow the defendant therefor.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-6\">The exceptions were heard by <em>Sislc, J., by </em>whose order there were entered an interlocutory decree sustaining an exception not now material, overruling the exceptions above described and confirming the report as thus modified, and a final decree permitting the plaintiff to redeem on <em>payment to </em>the defendant of $21,149.10 and interest and costs.

The single contention made now by the plaintiffs is that there are no facts which warrant the allowance of any sum larger than the five per cent on the rents collected by the mortgagee while in possession. The rule of law governing this subject was stated in <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Brown, 7 </em>Cush. 220, at page 222, in these words: \u201cIn many cases, a commission of five per cent on the rents received would be wholly inadequate, while in other cases, it might be a very liberal compensation. Each case in this respect must depend on its own peculiar circumstances. <em>Cazenove </em>v. <em>Cutler, </em>4 Met. 246. As the master has found the services of the defendant in this case to have been worth more than he felt at liberty to allow, this excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>tian to the report is sustained, and the case is to be recommitted to the master, with directions to allow the defendant such further sum as he may think just and reasonable.\u201d That rule has been constantly followed. The usual allowance is indeed five per cent. That will be adopted unless the master finds that the services were actually worth more but that is not an inflexible percentage. <em>Gerrish </em>v. <em>Black, </em>104 Mass. 400, 403. <em>Montague </em>v. <em>Boston &amp; Albany Railroad, </em>124 Mass. 242, 247. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>South Boston Savings Bank, </em>148 Mass. 300. See <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Story, </em>208 Mass. 36, 40. No reason appears in the case at bar for disturbing the master\u2019s finding for a larger amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
