The purchasing partner organized a corporation under a name, which was the former firm name with the word \u201cIncorporated\u201d added, for the purpose, as stated in its charter, of engaging in and carrying on \u201cthe business of manufacturing and selling candy and confectionery at wholesale and retail,\u201d and conveyed to it the assets formerly of the firm \u201ctogether with the good-will, trade-marks, trade names, and copyrights belonging to or appertaining to said business.\u201d A third party, having secured control of the corporation and of its officers, organized a second corporation for the purpose of the manufacture and sale of chocolate and cocoa in various forms, the manufacture and sale of candy and confectionery not being included in the stated corporate purpose. The name of the new corporation was composed of the old firm name preceded by \u201c The \u201d and followed by the words \u201cChocolate Company.\u201d By his control of both corporations the third party then undertook to convey to the second corporation the right to use the old firm name, transferring to the first corporation a valuable consideration for such right.

Page and Charles N. Shaw against the corporation, The Page Si Shaw Chocolate Company, the corporation,, Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, and Otis E. Dunham.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-5\">The allegations of the bill as amended in substance were as-follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-6\">For over twenty years previous to the year 1912 the plaintiffs-were copartners doing business under the firm name of Page-Si Shaw, and were engaged during all that period in the manufacture and sale of fine candies in Boston and elsewhere. The firm had become well and favorably known, and the name of\u2019 Page Si Shaw had acquired great value as a trade name and trademark.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b528-7\">In the early part of the year 1912 the firm was dissolved by mutual consent of the partners and a written agreement of dissolution was entered into, dated March 11, 1912, set out below. The plaintiff Shaw early in the year 1912 caused to be organized Under the general laws of Massachusetts the defendant corporation Page Si Shaw, Incorporated, to engage in and carry on the-business of manufacturing and selling candy and confectionery at wholesale and retail, and became the holder of the greater part of the stock of said company; and by an agreement in writing dated April 30, 1912, set out below, he undertook to convey to that corporation, with certain reservations not now material, \u201cthe wholesale business heretofore conducted by Charles N. Shaw individually and by Dudley L. Page and Charles N. Shaw under the firm name of Page Si Shaw for the manufacture of candy and confectionery, and except as hereinafter limited, the exclusive right to manufacture and to sell at wholesale and at retail the so-called Page <em>&amp; </em>Shaw candy and confectionery, and to establish retail stores or agencies, or both, for the sale of such candy and confectionery, together with the goodwill, trademarks, trade names, and copyrights belonging to or appertaining to said business.\u201d No right was conveyed to the said Page Si Shaw, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Incorporated, by that or by any agreement to use the trade name Page &amp; Shaw, except in the manufacture and sale by itself of \u25a0fcandy and confectionery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-3\">In or previous to November, 1918, the defendant Dunham be--c&amp;me the owner of all or substantially all of the common stock of Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, and became the president and general manager of that corporation; and early in 1919 Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, and Dunham, acting together, promoted the organization of a new corporation, the defendant The Page &amp; Shaw \u2022Chocolate Company. The principal business which the company was authorized to engage in, as shown by its agreement of association, was the manufacture and sale of chocolate and cocoa in various forms. The manufacture and sale of candy and confectionery was not included in its purposes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b529-4\">On February 20, 1920, the directors of The Page &amp; Shaw Chocolate Company, including the defendant Dunham, held a \u2022meeting and voted to issue three thousand five hundred shares \u2022of the preferred stock of the company of the par value of $100 \u25a0each and four thousand nine hundred and ninety seven shares of the common stock also of the par value of $100 each. The directors further voted to purchase from Page 8s Shaw, Incorporated, the right to use the name Page 8s Shaw, to be used as a part of the corporate name of The Page 8s Shaw Chocolate Company, and also to purchase from Page 8s Shaw, Incorporated, \u25a0the good will attaching to the name Page 8s Shaw and to issue to Page 8s Shaw, Incorporated, in payment therefor common stock of The Page 8s Shaw Chocolate Company of the par value of $250,000, and to issue to Page 8s Shaw, Incorporated, other shares of the common stock of The Page 8s Shaw Chocolate \u25a0Company of the par value of $249,700 in payment for a contract \"by Page 8s Shaw, Incorporated, to purchase the entire output \u25a0of The Page 8s Shaw Chocolate Company upon certain terms agreed upon. All of the defendants well knew that the names Page and Shaw which they were using or about to use-were the names of the plaintiffs respectively. The property received by the defendant Page 8s Shaw, Incorporated, for the use of the name Page 8s Shaw as aforesaid and for the good will attaching to it was of great value. On February 26, 1920, stock of The Page 8s Shaw Chocolate Company was issued pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>votes, and Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, now holds a considerable part of the stock so issued. Since the spring of 1920, The Page &amp; Shaw Chocolate Company has been engaged in a large way in manufacturing chocolate of various kinds, cocoa such as is used for drinking, and cocoa butter such as is used in the manufacture of candy. It has sold its entire output to Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, pursuant to the contract above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-3\">The plaintiffs did not know until shortly before the filing of the bill that The Page &amp; Shaw Chocolate Company had been formed or that their names or the name Page &amp; Shaw was being used by a new company, and they never consented either separately or jointly to the use of their names or the use of the name Page &amp; Shaw by The Page &amp; Shaw Chocolate Company as a part of its corporate name or as a trademark or trade name or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-4\">The plaintiffs alleged that \u201c each and all of the defendants have derived large sums of money or large amounts of property by means of their unlawful use of the plaintiffs\u2019 names and goodwill as aforesaid and the plaintiffs have suffered great loss and damage by reason of such unlawful use; and the defendants are liable to account to the plaintiffs for the profits they have received and for the damages sustained by the plaintiffs, if the plaintiffs so elect.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\">Prayers of the bill were that the defendant Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, and the defendant Dunham be ordered to account for what they received from The Page &amp; Shaw Chocolate Company for the right to use the names of the plaintiffs and the good will as aforesaid, and to pay over and deliver the same or the proceeds of the same to the plaintiffs; or that the defendant The Page &amp; Shaw Chocolate Company be permanently enjoined from using in its business or as a part of its corporate name or as a trade name or trademark the names of the plaintiffs or of either of them or the name Page &amp; Shaw; and that it be determined how much the plaintiffs were entitled to as damages \u201cby reason of the unlawful acts aforesaid and how much of the same should be paid by each of the defendants; and also how much the plaintiffs were entitled to by reason of the profits which the defendants or any of them had derived from the unlawful use of the names of the plaintiffs and said good-will, as aforesaid,\u201d and \u201cthat each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of the defendants be ordered to pay to the plaintiffs the several amounts which the plaintiffs are found entitled to receive as aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-3\">The dissolution agreement between the plaintiffs was. dated March 11, 1912, and, so far as material, provided as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\">\u201cWhereas said Page and said Shaw have heretofore been associated together in business and otherwise as partners and by the contracts and agreements heretofore executed, and whereas the said Shaw intends to incorporate his said business as wholesale manufacturer of candy, and that, therefore, it is necessary and desirable that the mutual rights and obligations of the said Page and the said Shaw be established and herein definitely set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\">\u201cTherefore . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-6\">\u201c (1) The said Dudley L.

In the dissolution agreement of March 11, 1912, Page released to Shaw his interest in the property and good will of the business, and also \u201cthe right to use the name \u2018Page\u2019 accompanied by the name \u2018Shaw\u2019 as the trade name or trade-mark in the business of the manufacture or sale of candy.\u201d In accordance with the terms of said agreement, Shaw, early in 1912, caused to be organized a corporation with the name Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, to carry on the business of manufacturing and selling candy and confectionery at wholesale and retail; and he became the holder of the greater part of the capital stock of said company. To that corporation Shaw transferred the assets of the former partnership, with certain reservations.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">In November, 1918, the defendant Otis E. Dunham acquired substantially all the capital stock of Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, and became its president and general manager. Early in 1919, these two defendants, acting together, organized a new corporation with the name The Page &amp; Shaw Chocolate Company, for carrying on the business of the manufacture and sale of chocolate and cocoa in various forms. On February 20,1920, the chocolate company, by its directors, undertook to purchase from Page &amp; Shaw, Incorporated, the right to use \u201cPage &amp; Shaw\u201d as part of the corporate name of the new company, together with the good will attaching thereto, giving shares of the capital stock of the chocolate company as consideration therefor. The plaintiffs seek by this bill in equity, among other things, to enjoin the new corporation from using in its business or as a trade name or trademark the names of either of them or the name Page &amp; Shaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">It is provided by G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 4: \u201cA person who conducts business in the Commonwealth shall not assume or continue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>use in his business . . . the name of any other person, either alone or in connection with his own or with any other name or designation, without the consent in writing of such person or of his legal representatives.\u201d As matter of construction it is doubt- <em>\u25a0 </em>fui, to say the least, whether the dissolution agreement between <em>j </em>Page and Shaw authorized the use of the name \u201cPage &amp; Shaw\u201d/ by any other than the contemplated original corporation Page' &amp; Shaw, Incorporated. It certainly did not authorize that corporation to transfer the use of the name Page &amp; Shaw to another company, organized for carrying on an entirely different kind of business. <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Weld, </em>139 Mass. 499. <em>Fairfield </em>v. <em>Lowry, </em>207 Mass. 352. <em>Q. H. Batchelder &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Batchelder, </em>220 Mass. 42, 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-3\">The plaintiffs have a joint and concurrent interest in preventing the use of the names Page and Shaw by the defendant chocolate company. Their consent in writing is required in order to justify that use. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>109 Mass 409. <em>Lodge </em>v. <em>Weld, supra. </em>See <em>Cadigan </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>120 Mass. 493, 494. We cannot say that the defendant Dunham is improperly joined, in view of the allegations of the bill. The objection of multifariousness is not tenable. <em>Lovejoy </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>214 Mass. 134, 151. It is not necessary at this stage of the case to consider whether the plaintiffs are entitled to damages or profits. See <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Hull, </em>169 Mass. 250; <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>223 Mass. 104. The plaintiffs state a ease entitling them to an injunction, under the statute. G. L. c. 110, \u00a7 7. <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>3 Allen, 76. <em>C. H. Batchelder &amp; Co. Inc. </em>v. <em>Batchelder, supra. </em>That requires the overruling of the demurrer. In accordance with the report, the defendants are to answer to the bill as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
