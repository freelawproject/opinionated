L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 13, 30, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMC\">\u201cSection 8. Such member shall make such inquiries and investigations as shall be deemed necessary. The hearing shall be held in the town where the accident occurred or in such other place as the department may designate; and the decision of the member, together with a statement of the evidence, his findings of fact, rulings of law, and other matters pertinent to questions arising before him, shall be held with the department. Unless a claim for review is filed by either party within seven days, the decision shall be enforceable under section eleven.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A07\">\u201cSection 13. Fees of attorneys and physicians and charges of hospitals for services under this chapter shall be subject to the approval of the department. If the insurer and any physician or hospital, or the employee and any attorney, fail to agree as to the amount to be paid for such services, either party may notify the department, which may thereupon assign the case for hearing by a member thereof. The member shall report the facts to the department for decision, and the decision shall be enforceable under section eleven.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AMW\">\u201cSection 30. During the first two weeks after the injury, and, if the employee is not immediately incapacitated thereby from earning full wages, then from the time of such incapacity, and in unusual cases, in the discretion of the department, for a longer period, the insurer shall furnish adequate and reasonable medical and hospital services, and medicines if needed. The employee may select a physician other than the one provided by the insurer; and in case he shall be treated by a physician of his own selection, or where, in case of emergency or for other justifiable cause, a physician other than the one provided by the insurer is called in to treat the injured employee, the reasonable cost of his services shall be paid by the insurer, subject to the approval of the department. Such approval shall be granted only if the department finds that the employee was so treated by such physician or that there was such emergency or justifiable cause, and in all cases that the services were adequate and reasonable and the charges reasonable. In any case where the department is of opinion that the fitting of the employee with an artificial eye or limb, or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>mechanical appliance, will promote his restoration to industry, it may order that he be provided with such an artificial eye, limb or appliance, at the expense of the insurer.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-3\"><em>C.

On January 15, 1920, the insurer paid to him under the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act $500 as specific compensation for the \u201c loss of the use of his hand,\u201d apparently on the ground that it had been so injured as to be permanently incapable of use. He was also paid compensation for seven months following the injury, but received nothing for partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">From early in September, 1919, to the date of the hearing upon the petition hereinafter described, he has been treated upon three hundred and three different days by Gertrude R. Doyle as masseuse. Her bill for services amounts to $909.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">The present proceeding was begun by the petition of the masseuse for the approval of her charges under St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 13, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 12, and St. 1917, c. 297, \u00a7 9, now contained in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13. This section of the statute provides that the fees of attorneys and physicians and charges of hospitals for services under the act shall be subject to the approval of the Industrial Accident Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-18\">A petition by the masseuse for the approval of her bill was filed with the board and heard by a single member, upon whose report of the facts the board found that the nature of the injury constituted \u201can unusual case,\u201d St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 5, as amended by St. 1914, c. 708, \u00a7 1, and St. 1917, c. 198 (see now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30), inasmuch as it resulted in complete atrophy of the right hand and arm of the employee; that the amount was a reasonable charge for the services, and ordered its payment by the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-25\">The procedure in this case was correct. The statute did not provide for the decision of a single member which was subject to review. The procedure differs materially from that specified when the insurer and the injured employee fail to reach an agree-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>ment as to the compensation of the latter. In such cases, the claim is assigned for hearing by a single member of the board, whose \u201c decision . . . together with a statement of the evidence, his findings of fact, rulings of law, and other matters pertinent to questions arising before him . . . ps] filed with the department. Unless a claim for review is filed by either party within seven days,\u201d the decision of the single member is enforceable under the statute. St. 1911, c. 751, Part III, \u00a7 7, as amended by St. 1912, c. 571, \u00a7 12, and St. 1917, c. 297, \u00a7 4. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 8. In the proceedings now considered no decision of a single member was made. All that such member was authorized to do was after hearing to \u201creport the facts ... for decision.\u201d See <em>Huxen\u2019s Case, </em>226 Mass. 292. Inasmuch as the single member made no \u201cdecision\u201d the statutory provision for a review by the board was wholly inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-16\">We do not find it necessary to decide whether the employee\u2019s injury properly could have been found to constitute \u201can unusual case,\u201d or whether payment for medical services for a period commencing nearly a year and a half after the accident could rightly have been ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-21\">The statute provides for the payment of only physicians and hospitals. Under the procedure now considered, that which is to be furnished (St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 5, as amended by St.-1914, c. 708, \u00a7 1, and St. 1917, c. 198. See now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 30), is \u201cadequate and reasonable medical and hospital services, and medicines, when they are needed.\u201d Detailed provisions as to the selection of a physician are set forth. While the term medical services, if used without limitation, may be susceptible of a broad construction, the statutes cited clearly indicate that those words, as therein used, are restricted to medical assistance rendered by the physician or under his direction and control. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Pierson, </em>176 N. Y. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-32\">It is not necessary to decide whether massage may be employed in connection with or as a part of treatment by a physician, and under such circumstances properly classed as medical services. The massage performed, so far as it appears solely upon the employee\u2019s request and not as a part of treatment by a physician, was not medical services within the statute, and the insurer is not liable therefor in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>The decree of the Superior Court ordering the insurer to pay to the petitioner the amount of her charges must be reversed, and. a decree entered dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\"><em>So </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
