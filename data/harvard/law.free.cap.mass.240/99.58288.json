The defendant stated that he had no such letter. The plaintiff then produced a carbon copy of a letter addressed to the defendant in Boston, Massachusetts, his usual place of business, and testified that it was a copy of a letter which he had mailed to the defendant on the day it was dated, and no question as to the prepayment of postage was raised by the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that such copy was admissible in evidence if the contents of the letter were relevant and material.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b121-22\">The depositing of a letter in the post office, postage prepaid, properly addressed to a person at his place of business or residence, is <em>\u25a0prima facie </em>evidence that it was received in the ordinary course of mails.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b121-25\">.From a bill of exceptions filed by the defendant in an action at law by a mining engineer to recover salary and expenses alleged to be due trader a contract with the defendant, it appeared that at the trial of the action eighty letters and cablegrams which passed between the parties during a period of two years were in evidence. The exceptions related to but two letters, which were set out in the bill. Neither the substance nor copies of the rest of the correspondence appeared. <em>Held, </em>that, in the absence of the other evidence, it could not be said that the defendant had sustained the burden which was upon him of showing that the admission of the letters in evidence was error.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b121-34\">.An exception to the admission in evidence of a letter, a part of which is inadmis- ' sible and apart admissible, will not be sustained if the defendant at the time the letter is offered does not seek to have the admission limited to the part of the letter which was admissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b121-38\">.An exception by the defendant to the admission in evidence at the trial of the action above described of a letter produced by the defendant at the request of the plaintiff, which was written by the plaintiff in response to a request from the defendant for a report and with which was enclosed the report asked for, must be overruled.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>Contract for $2,967.85, alleged to have become due to the plaintiff for salary and expenses while employed by the defendant in \"investigating certain mining properties in South America.\u201d Writ dated May 8, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-4\">In the Superior Court the action was tried before <em>Quinn, </em>J.

The defendant testified that he authorized no services except an original examination of the Gardner-White claim, so called, and that he at no time ratified the performance of additional services for him by the plaintiff. The issue at the trial was whether the defendant owed the plaintiff for services and expenses in connection with the investigation of properties other than the Gardner-White claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-12\">The exceptions recite that \u201cThere was evidence from which the jury could have found either way on the issues of original employment for services other than the Gardner-White claim or subsequent ratification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">The questions raised by the bill of exceptions are whether the judge erred in admitting in evidence two letters, Exhibits 82 and 83. Exhibit 82 was a carbon copy of a letter dated April 3, 1917, the original of which the plaintiff testified he mailed to the defendant on the day of its date, directed to \u201c Mr. Thomas W. Lawson, Boston, Mass.\u201d The record shows that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had notified the defendant to produce all letters received by him from the plaintiff. At the trial the defendant stated that he had no letter dated April 3, 1917; he objected to the admission of the copy, and said that there was no evidence that it had been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>ceived. In his brief he contends that there was no evidence whatever of how the letter was addressed or of the payment of the postage. The defendant is described in the writ as \u201chaving a usual place of business in Boston,\u201d and there is no evidence to that that recital was not in accordance with the fact. The objection that the postage was not prepaid was not specifically raised at the trial and there was no evidence that the letter was not received by the defendant. In these circumstances it was properly admitted if it was otherwise competent. The depositing of a letter in the post office, postage prepaid, properly addressed to a person at his place of business or residence, is <em>prima facie </em>evidence that it was received in the ordinary course of mails. <em>Huntley </em>v. <em>Whittier, </em>105 Mass. 391. <em>McDowell </em>v. <em>\u00c6tna Ins. Co. </em>164 Mass. 444. <em>Tobin </em>v. <em>Taintor, </em>229 Mass. 174.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We are of opinion that the letter cannot be said as matter of law to have been improperly admitted. The correspondence between the parties and between the plaintiff and the defendant\u2019s son (who could have been found to have acted as his father\u2019s agent) consisting of letters and cablegrams was voluminous and covered a period of about two years; more than eighty were put in evidence without objection, so far as appears; the letters in question were a part of mutual correspondence, none of which is before us except Exhibits 82 and 83. If all the correspondence which was before the trial judge were presented for our inspection, it might clearly appear that the facts stated in these letters were material and competent; in the absence of any other correspondence we cannot say that their admission was error, as the burden rested on the defendant to show such error. The case at bar is distinguishable in its facts from those- in <em>Kumin </em>v. <em>Fine, </em>229 Mass. 75, <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>Lord, </em>232 Mass. 585, and the other cases relied on by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">It is also the contention of the defendant that the statements in the letter were self-serving and for that reason inadmissible. Apart from the question whether all the statements in the letter, Exhibit 82, were admissible, that part of it in which the plaintiff requested to be informed by the defendant as to whether he desired the plaintiff to continue in his employ was competent. If the defendant believed that the admission of the letter should have been so limited, it was his duty so to state to the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>when it was offered. It follows that the exception to the admission of Exhibit 82 must be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\">The letter, Exhibit 83, dated April 5, 1917, was sent in response to a request from the defendant for a further report upon mines examined by the plaintiff in Chile. A report as requested by the defendant was enclosed in the letter. The exception to its admission cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
