that a certain employee, Wallet by name,, always bothered the men a great deal by blocking the way to the clock so that the others could not punch it; that this employee, Wallet, was pushed out of the way by fellow employees with such force as to send him hurrying through the open door and caused him to knock down Lee, the claimant, causing\u201d the injuries for which compensation was sought; \u201cthat the object of the employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>who pushed Wallet away from the time clock was to perform their duty of registering their time with which he was interfering; and that the injury to the claimant, Lee, followed as a natural incident of his duty to his employer to register his time before leaving for his noon luncheon period. . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-5\">\u201cThe circumstances under which the injury in this case occurred .meet the test laid down by the court in ruling cases of this and other jurisdictions, including <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, in which the court laid down the general rule that an injury arises out of the employment \u2018when there is apparent to the rational mind, upon consideration of all the circumstances, a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury.\u2019 The conditions under which the work of registering time was required to be performed called for all employees to \u2018ring out\u2019 at twelve o\u2019clock noon. This meant that a line of employees must form, each anxious to register with the least possible delay. Naturally, such a crowd of employees would not look with any appreciable amount of tolerance upon any employee who endeavored to block the line, as Wallet did, and a \u2018natural incident\u2019 of such a situation about the time clock was the forcible pushing of Wallet away from his blockading position and the injury of a fellow employee. It was just such an incident as might well have been contemplated \u2018by a reasonable person familiar with the whole situation as a result of the exposure occasioned by the nature of the emoplyment,\u2019 particularly in view of the fact that Wallet had always given the men desirous of registering their time a great deal of annoyance by blocking the way to the clock.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b497-6\">In the Superior Court, by order of <em>Sisk, </em>J., a decree was entered awarding compensation as determined by the Industrial Accident Board.

The board member found that he \u201cwas the innocent victim of a friendly scrap between three other employees, one of whom was thrown out of the doorway, his body striking the claimant and throwing him to the ground, causing the injury to his shoulder and back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">As he was on his way to the time clock during the noon hour' to ring out his time, it is obvious that his injuries were received in the course of his employment. The question remains whether the injuries arose out of his employment. It has been held by this court that, where an employee is injured as a result of fooling or play by employees in which he participates, such injury does not originate in any risk connected with, and caused by, his employment; and that such injury does not arise out of the employment within the meaning of the workmen\u2019s compensation act. <em>Moore\u2019s Case, 225 </em>Mass. 258. The precise question presented by this record is, whether an injury received by an employee in the course of his employment, as the result of fooling or play by other employees in which he takes no part, can be said to have arisen out of the employment. While this issue has been decided in other jurisdictions, it has not been directly adjudicated by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">It is clear that there was no causal connection between the employment and the injury. The injury did not arise because' the employee was exposed by the nature of his employment to some peculiar danger, it did not follow as a natural incident of his work, and it does not appear \u201cto have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment, and to have flowed from that source as a rational cons\u00e9quence.\u201d <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, 499. The interpretation of the workmen\u2019s compensation act enunciated in the case last cited when applied to the facts in the present case makes it plain that the injury to the claimant cannot be said to have arisen out of his employment. The pushing of Wallet out of the doorway by other employees and against the claimant, assuming it was a wrongful act, was not within the scope of his employment. Such acts, whether done in a spirit of play or from a malicious motive, have no relation whatever to the employment; and they are wholly outside the scope of the employment of those who caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>The weight of authority in England and in this country is in harmony with the result we have reached. <em>Armitage </em>v. <em>Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire Railway, </em>[1902] 2 K.
