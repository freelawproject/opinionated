L. c. 152, \u00a7 36 (d), by reason of a loss of \u201cthe distal phalanges of the second, third and fourth fingers, and \u2018 half of the middle phalanges of these fingers\u201d of her right hand, it appeared . that the board\u2019s decision was upon review of a report by a single member which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>included a finding that the remaining phalanges of the claimant\u2019s right hand, \u201cwhile permanently incapable of use as phalanges, are still of such a character that they add sufficient to the use of the several fingers as to preclude a finding that the fingers had been lost at or above the second joint.\u201d A judge of the Superior Court ruled upon the record before him as a matter of law \u201cthat the hand is useless, and that she [the employee] is entitled to twenty-five weeks compensation.\u201d <em>Held, </em>that the ruling must be reversed, and additional compensation under cl. d and not under cl. e of that section of the statute must be awarded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-5\">Certification to the Superior Court under the provisions of the workmen\u2019s compensation act of a decision of the Industrial Accident Board, more fully described below, relating to compensation to be paid to Annie Ramondetta for personal injuries received on March 15, 1918, while in the employ of the Ayer Mills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-6\">The findings of the single member of the board and of the full board are described in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b515-7\">In the Superior Court, the case was heard by <em>Bell, </em>J., by whose order, after he had ruled as described in the opinion, a decree was entered directing the insurer to pay to the claimant .$223.25 less $107.16 already paid on account of specific compensation. The insurer appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b515-8\"><em>G.

As a result of the injury the end, or distal phalanges, and one half of the next, or middle phalanges, of the fore, middle and ring fingers were severed; that is, one and one half phalanges of each of these fingers are gone. On each the end joint is gone; the next or middle joint remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-11\">The single member of the Industrial Accident Board found that the claimant was entitled to receive $140.33 for total disability; he further found \u201cthat this girl has not suffered the loss By severance of two or more fingers at or above the second joint. . . . that there was a certain portion of the phalange in each finger left below the second joint. These phalanges, . . . while permanently incapable of use as phalanges, are still of such a character that they add sufficient to the use of the several fingers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>as to preclude a finding that the fingers had been lost at or above the second joint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-3\">The Industrial Accident Board upon review found, \u201cthat total disability ended on July 12, 1918; that compensation should be paid to that date, at the rate of $8.93 per week, or a total of $140.33.\u201d No question arises respecting the correctness of this finding. The board further found, \u201cthat the distal phalanges of the second, third and fourth fingers, and half of the middle phalanges of these fingers are severed and the employee is entitled to additional compensation being $107.16. The total sum due under this decision is $247.49.\u201d Thereafter a decree was entered by a judge of the Superior Court in favor of the employee for $223.25, \u201cminus one hundred and seven dollars and sixteen cents already paid on account of specific compensation.\u201d This was the equivalent of twenty-five weeks additional compensation. A motion to vacate the decree was filed by the insurer, and denied; and the insurer appealed from the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">The judge made the following ruling: \u201cI rule as a matter of law on the papers before me that the petitioner has lost the second joint, that the hand is useless, and that she is entitled to twenty-five weeks compensation . . . being two hundred and twenty-three 25/100 dollars.\u201d The sole issue before the board upon the question of additional compensation was whether the claimant was entitled to compensation for twelve weeks or for twenty-five weeks. This must be determined under the proper interpretations! St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 11 (see now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Clause \u201cc\u201d of that section provides that \u201cfor the loss by severance at or above the second joint of two or more fingers, . . . of the same hand\u201d the employee is entitled to compensation for a period of twenty-five weeks. Clause \u201cd\u201d provides that \u201cFor the loss by severance of at least one phalange of a finger, . . .\u201d the employee is entitled to compensation for a period of twelve weeks. There was medical testimony that the distal or first joint is the one farthest from the body; and we are satisfied that the act must be so construed. It is plain that the first joint is that nearest to the tip of the finger, and that the words in cl. \u201cc\u201d \u201cat or above the second joint\u201d mean at or above the second or middle joint. As the claimant\u2019s fingers were severed not \u201cat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>or above the second joint\u201d but nearer the finger tip than that point, it is clear that she is not entitled to compensation under cl. \u201cc\u201d. The single member\u2019s finding that she had \"not suffered the loss by severance of two or more fingers at or above the second joint,\u201d was right, and the board in effect also so found. These findings of fact must stand as they were fully warranted by the evidence. The correct interpretation of cl. \u201cc\u201d apart from any evidence is that the second joint is the middle joint, or the second joint counting from the tip of the finger. The place where the fingers were severed was a question of fact; accordingly the ruling that the claimant had lost the second joints of the injured fingers was wrong, and the finding of the board was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-3\">The judge further ruled \"that the hand is useless,\u201d (cl. \u201ce\u201d). That ruling cannot stand. The finding of the single member was to the effect that the hand was not so injured as to be useless or permanently incapable of use; the board on review failed to find such incapacity; and the rational inference to be drawn from the finding is that the hand was not incapable of use. The question was one of fact, and the finding was not unwarranted. <em>Meley\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 136. <em>Lactone\u2019s Case, </em>227 Mass. 269. <em>Jakutis\u2019s Case, </em>238 Mass. 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\n<em>Decree to be entered in accordance with the findings of the Industrial Accident Board.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
