There was no allegation that the mayor was required to hold a public hearing before granting a license, nor that the mere erection of the building would constitute a nuisance. The prayers of the bill were that the mayor be restrained from granting a license until after a public hearing, and that, after a hearing upon the merits, the erection, maintenance and use of the public dance hall be adjudged a nuisance as alleged.

Sawtelle, the mayor of Leominster, who, it was alleged, intended without holding a public hearing to issue a permit for the use of the building as a public dance hall, which, it was alleged, in the circumstances would result in a nuisance. The prayers of the bill were that the defendant Sawtelle, \u201cin his capacity as mayor as aforesaid, be restrained and enjoined from granting a license for public dances or for the conduct of a public dance hall in the said building or at the said location, until after a public hearing shall be given by him upon the same,\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\"after a hearing on the merits . . . the erection, maintenance or conduct of a public dance hall or the giving of public dances in said building or at said location, shall be decreed to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b383-5\">The defendants severally demurred.

L. c. 140, \u00a7 181, is as follows: \u201cThe mayor or selectmen may, except as provided in section one hundred and five of chapter one hundred and forty-nine, grant, upon such terms and conditions as they deem reasonable, a license for theatrical exhibitions, public shows, public amusements and exhibitions of every description, to be held upon week days only, to which admission is obtained upon payment of money or upon the delivery of any valuable thing, or by a ticket or voucher obtained for money or any valuable thing, or in which, after free admission, amusement is furnished upon a deposit of money in a coin controlled apparatus; and the mayor [or selectmen may revoke or suspend such license at their pleasure, but they shall not grant a license for any such theatrical exhibitions, public shows or public amusements or exhibitions of any description whatever to be held upon Sunday, except as provided in chapter one hundred and thirty-six.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b383-7\"><em>R.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AI4\">Various householders seek by this suit in equity to enjoin the defendants, one of whom is mayor of Leominster and the other of whom is a resident of that city intending to erect and complete in the vicinity of the homes of the several plaintiffs a public dance hall of an open type for continual use during summer seasons. There are allegations of purpose by the defendant Vigeant, immediately upon the completion of the building, to apply to the mayor for a license to conduct a public dance hall, that the mayor is vested by law with authority to grant such license, that he will grant such license without hearing the plaintiffs, that the proposed location is wholly unfit for a public dance hall, and that the operation as a dance hall would be a great detriment to the residential character of the neighborhood where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the plaintiffs reside, would seriously damage their property, and would constitute a nuisance. Separate demurrers were filed by each defendant, which were sustained. The plaintiffs\u2019 appeal from a decree dismissing the bill brings the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">There is no allegation in the bill that the law requires the mayor to hold a public hearing before granting a license for a public dance hall. No such hearing is required by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">There is no allegation that the mere erection of a building susceptible of use as a dance hall would be a nuisance. The gravamen of the bill is that the use of a building for that purpose in the designated locality would be a nuisance. It is provided however, by G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 181, that public amusements may be licensed by the mayor. This section is broad enough in its scope to include public dances and dance halls. If the hall is not licensed, it cannot be used, and therefore no nuisance can arise. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>239 Mass. 90. If the hall is licensed and public dances are authorized, there can be no nuisance because the statute in effect confers upon the mayor jurisdiction to determine finally whether the use of the property in accordance with the license would be a nuisance, and such use would not subject the owner to injunction or indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">General allegations of nuisance are taken at their face value on demurrer, but they must be read in conjunction with the specific averments and are limited by the definite facts set forth. They must be all considered in the light of controlling provisions of the statute. No facts are stated in the bill which would warrant the issuance of an injunction against a public officer like the mayor from exercising the discretion and the power vested in him by law as to granting a license. No facts are disclosed which warrant the interposition of a court of equity against the other defendant because, if he procures a license as is averred to be likely, then such license will completely protect him, provided that he conforms to its conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The case is in principle within the authority of numerous decisions. <em>Sawyer </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>136 Mass. 239. <em>Call </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>1 Allen, 137. <em>Alter </em>v. <em>Dodge, </em>140 Mass. 594. <em>White </em>v. <em>Kenney, </em>157 Mass. 12. <em>Murtha </em>v. <em>Lovewell, </em>166 Mass. 391. <em>Levin </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>191 Mass. 341. <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Fall River, </em>239 Mass. 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">\n<em>Decree dismissing hill affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
