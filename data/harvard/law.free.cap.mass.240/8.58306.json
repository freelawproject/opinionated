He relies upon the exception to the general rule which is well established in this Commonwealth, that drivers of horses,- automobiles, locomotives and perhaps other vehicles of travel, when lent with the vehicles pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>sumptively remain the servants of the general employer and are subject to his control in so far as pertains to the care, management and preservation of the property. <em>Huff </em>v. <em>Ford, </em>126 Mass. 24. <em>Reagan </em>v. <em>Casey, </em>160 Mass. 374. <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Towle, </em>181 Mass. 416. <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>Jacobs, supra.

In the Coughlan ease by the contract between the city and the railroad company, the latter agreed \u201cto furnish for the use of the city a locomotive and twenty dump cars, together with conductor, engineer, fireman and one brakeman to manage the same; said train to be used for the purpose of transporting gravel and other material for filling the low ground around the northwesterly side of Fresh Pond in said Cambridge, and to be furnished for as long a time of continuous service as the city may desire.\u201d The railroad company agreed \u201cto keep the said locomotive and cars in proper repair, and to furnish all fuel and necessary supplies for the same.\u201d The company also agreed \u201cto lay about one mile of track to be used in said filling, to furnish rails, ties and other material for the same, and to take up and remove said track after said filling shall have been completed.\u201d The city agreed to pay $400 a mile for the use of the track, thirty-five cents apiece for the ties and thirty-seven dollars per day, Sundays excepted during the continuance of the-work. It also agreed to assume all risk of injury to any of the-trainmen. The evidence warranted the jury in finding that; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the accident was due to the negligence of the engineer. Upon the contract and upon the facts, the jury could warrantably have found that the train and trainmen were under the control of the conductor who received directions from an employee of the city and not of the railroad company. Upon these facts the court said, as a reason for its decision that the presiding judge was right in refusing to rule that the trainmen and Leland were not in law in the employ of the defendant: <em>\u201cA </em>locomotive and cars without men to run them would have been useless. Instead of hiring trainmen outside, the city hired them of the railroad with the train. No doubt it was expected by the company and the city that the men hired of the company would continue to run the train till the work was finished. But there was nothing in the contract which prevented the city from discharging the men, and hiring others in their places, if it saw fit to incur the additional expense which would be thus caused.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\">In the case at bar by the contract between the railroad company and the American Steel and Wire Company the railroad agreed to provide \u201cswitch engines and crews to do the work required in the yard,\u201d of the south works in Worcester of the American Steel and Wire Company, upon the agreement of the American Steel and Wire Company \u201cto pay monthly upon presentation of bill thirty-three and one third per cent of the wages of the engine crews and yard crews, also thirty-three and one third per cent of the value of the fuel used by these switch engines.\u201d By the contract \u201cIt is understood that the time of service is to be reckoned from the time the engine or engines leave the company\u2019s engine-house until their return to that house, deducting from this time any unreasonable delay that may occur in the movement between the engine-house and your yard.\u201d By the terms of the contract \u201cIt is also understood that these switch engines and their crews will be under your control and direction as to the work to be performed by them in your yard [that of the American Steel and Wire Company]. The responsibility will rest with this [the railroad] company for any accident or damage to equipment that may result from negligence of employees of this company while working with these switch engines. In all other cases this responsibility will rest with your company The American Steel &amp; Wire Company \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>In the case at bar as in <em>Coughlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra, </em>the train crews were subject to the direction of the master servant of the employer by whom the engine and cars were hired so far as concerned what work was to be done and how it was to be done. In the case of <em>Coughlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra, </em>the engines, cars and men were lent for an indefinite term <em>to be </em>used and to perform the specified work upon the premises of the city of Cambridge and at no other place. In the case at bar the engine, cars and crew were moved as occasion required from the engine-house of the defendant over its tracks, to the tracks of the American Steel and Wire Company, within an enclosure there to do the work called for by the contract and then to return to the place from whence they came. In the case of <em>Coughlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge, supra, </em>the hiring of the crew was separable from the hiring of Iocomotive and cars. As said in the opinion, \u201cthere was nothing in the contract which prevented the city from discharging the men, and hiring others in their places.\u201d In the case at bar it is plain the contract did not permit of the American Steel and Wire Company discharging the crew and hiring others. The railroad company assumed responsibility \u201cfor any accident or damage to equipment that may result from negligence of employees of this company while working with these switch engines.\u201d This responsibility manifestly contemplated that those in charge of the equipment, the engineer and fireman, and possibly the conductor, should remain employees of the railroad company for the preservation of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">The difference in facts in the two cases pointed out makes it plain that the issue of fact should have been submitted to the jury under proper instructions and that the rule of the case of <em>Coughlan </em>v. <em>Cambridge </em>did not require a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">As regards the issue of the due care of the plaintiff aided by St. 1914, c. 553; G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, it is obvious it could not be ruled as a matter of law that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">As regards the issue of the defendant\u2019s negligence, it is clear that the evidence should have been submitted to the jury and that it would warrant a finding of a disregard of the rules relating to the operation of the locomotive by the fireman in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>absence of the engineer, and in thus operating the engine with no one to keep a lookout on the left side of the engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\">The ruling directing a verdict was wrong. In accordance with the terms of the report judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff for $1,500 on count 1 for death and $500 for the plaintiff on count 2 for conscious suffering, the total being $2,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
