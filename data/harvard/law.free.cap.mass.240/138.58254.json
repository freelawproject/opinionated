The counts were stated to be for the same cause of action and claimed damages in the sum of $3,009.30.

The motion to abate the writ and to dismiss the action was heard in the Superior Court by <em>Wait, </em>J., who ordered the writ abated \u201cfor lack of proper service,\u201d and reported his rulings to this court for determination.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b161-6\"><em>E.

After the writ was entered and after a general appearance and answer by the defendant, an amendment was allowed in court in the presence of an attorney who represented the defendant, without his assent, increasing the <em>ad damnum </em>to $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">The motion to increase the <em>ad damnum </em>was allowed on September 10,1920. Twenty days thereafter the defendant filed a motion to abate the writ and dismiss the action. The judge ruled that \u201cThere has been no unreasonable delay in filing the motion to abate and dismiss,\u201d with a further ruling \u201cthat there has been no sufficient service of the writ as amended,\u201d ordered \u201cthat the writ as amended abate for lack of proper service,\u201d and at the request of the parties reported the case \u201cfor the consideration of the full bench.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">The defendant admits that he was properly before the Superior Court on a duly served writ before the <em>ad damnum </em>was increased; but contends that after the writ was amended without his assent and with no further service of process to a writ with an <em>ad damnum </em>greater than a constable has authority to serve he was no longer before the said court on a duly served writ, and was entitled to be relieved from the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-12\">Notwithstanding the suggestion found in the concurring opinion in the case of <em>Neszery </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>226 Mass. 332, 334, in substance that an amendment to a writ served by a constable which changed the <em>ad damnum </em>to an amount greater than $300, without the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>sent of the defendant, is the foundation for a motion by the defendant for abatement on the ground that he has not been brought into court on the amended writ, we are of opinion that the court after a general appearance had authority for the reasons stated in the opinion of <em>Neszery </em>v. <em>Beard, supra, </em>to allow the amendment which was allowed, and that a different rule would be out of harmony with our statutes and decisions allowing amendments at any time before final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\">It follows that the action of the Superior Court must be reversed and the case stand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
