He found the facts to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-6\">\u201cThe parties were married in June, 1916. They lived together first in Northfield, Vermont, and later in Boston in this Commonwealth. They last lived together in March, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-7\">\u201cThe libellee was about eighteen years old at the time of her marriage. The parties were engaged for about six months. Before marriage they made an agreement not to have sexual intercourse for six months.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-8\">\u201cI find that the libellee did not marry the libellant intending never to have sexual intercourse with him. The libellant claimed and testified that the libellee never permitted him to have such intercourse and that he never had it. The libellee testified to the contrary and submitted to a medical examination at the hands of . . . [a physician] who reported'that he was unable to say whether intercourse had taken place or not.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-9\">\u201cI am unable to find upon the evidence that the parties have never had intercourse. I find, however, that for some time before March, 1919, the libellee persistently refused to have intercourse with her husband basing her refusal upon the claim that he had treated her unkindly and had not given her money enough. Dining this period no intercourse took place between the parties. I find that the Iibellee\u2019s refusal has been continuous, wilful and without justification. After the hearing I continued the case for three months, during which interval neither party made any offer to resume living together.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-10\">The judge ruled \u201cthat upon these facts the petitioner is not entitled- to a divorce of nullity,\u201d and on May 10, 1920, ordered the entry of a decree, \u201cLibel dismissed.\u201d That decree was entered on the same day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-11\">By leave of this court the libellant was permitted to enter an appeal late on March 4, 1921.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b606-12\">On October 19, 1921, this court suspended argument of the case to enable the libellant to consult the judge who heard' the case in the Superior Court as to reporting the case. Thereupon on October 29, 1921, he reported the case with the following statement: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u201cBeing of opinion upon further consideration that the decree of May 10, 1920, was improperly entered before the expiration of the time allowed under common law Rule 46 [of the Superior Court] for saving exceptions to the ruling made on said date, that said \u2018decree\u2019 had, therefore, no greater force than an order for a decree, and that I have the right to do so, I now report the case at the request of the libellant and against the objection of the libellee for the determination of the full court, the libellee contending that I have no right so to do. If iny ruling was correct, the order dismissing the libel is to stand; otherwise a decree of nullity is to be entered. If I have no power to report the case, this report is to be discharged.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-5\"><em>A. Santosuosso, </em>for the libellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b607-6\"><em>H. R. Donaghue, </em>for the libellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b607-7\">Braley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFb\">The decree dismissing the libel before the expira^ tian of twenty days after notice of the decision had been received in which the libellant had the right to file and prosecute exceptions to the judge\u2019s ruling, must be taken as having no greater effect than an order for a decree, and not as a final decree from which an appeal would lie to this court for errors of law apparent on the record. <em>Prescott </em>v. <em>Prescott, </em>175 Mass. 64. <em>Tyndale </em>v. <em>Stanwood, </em>186 Mass. 59, 63. <em>McCusker </em>v. <em>Geiger, </em>195 Mass. 46. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>211 Mass. 334. <em>Harvey </em>v. <em>Bross, </em>216 Mass. 57. <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>216 Mass. 545, 546. R. L. c. 173, \u00a7 106, as amended by Sts. 1906, c. 342, \u00a7 2; 1911, c. 212. But if the appeal cannot be entertained, the case is properly before us on the report. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Blodget, </em>214 Mass. 374, 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The material allegations of the libel are, that the libellee not only has been wholly regardless of her marriage obligations, and \"without cause has refused to have marital intercourse with the libellant and to bear children, but that she entered into the contract of marriage fraudulently intending not to perform her marriage vows, and that the libellant was misled and induced to marry her by the deception practised upon him. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>3 Allen, 605. <em>Donovan </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>9 Allen, 140. It is settled by <em>Cowles </em>v. <em>Cowles, </em>112 Mass. 298, that a wife\u2019s utter denial of sexual intercourse \u201cdoes not go to the original validity of the marriage, and affords no ground for\u201d a divorce from the bonds of matrimony or for a decree of nullity. See <em>Dickinson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>Dickinson, </em>[1913] P. <em>198; Napier </em>v. <em>Napier, </em>84 L. J. (N. S.) 177. But in <em>Anders </em>v. <em>Anders, </em>224 Mass. 438, it was held that where a woman went through a marriage ceremony secretly intending to leave her husband immediately thereafter and not to see him again as well as \u201cto secure a right to bear the name of a married woman and in that way to hide the shame of having had an illegitimate child,\u201d and carried out her purpose, the husband who had acted in good faith and had been deceived was entitled to a decree of nullity. It was a question of fact whether the material allegations of the libel had been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The judge found that the libellee was not impotent and no valid ' reason appeared for her refusal of intercourse after six months from the date of the marriage had expired; a period of abstinence mutually agreed upon by the parties before marriage. This finding and his further findings, \"that the libellee did not marry the libellant intending never to have sexual intercourse with him,\u201d and \u201cI am unable to find . . . that the parties have never had intercourse,\u201d are conclusive in favor of the libellee. <em>Barron </em>v. <em>International Trust Co. </em>184 Mass. 440, 443. <em>American Malting Co. </em>v. <em>Souther Brewing Co. </em>194 Mass. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The entry must be appeal dismissed; order dismissing libel to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
