He was attended by a physician who died before the trial. Another physician, testifying as an expert, stated that the described circumstances of the plaintiff\u2019s illness presented \u201ca classical picture of food poisoning; that the term ptomaine poisoning was not now used; that the incubation period for food poisoning was from eight to twenty hours; that it was less than twenty-four hours; that it would be out of the question for diseased food to remain in a person\u2019s stomach for a period of from forty-eight to seventy-two hours before he would feel any effects from it\u201d and that, in his opinion, the plaintiff\u2019s illness was caused by poisoning from food eaten on the boat the last afternoon he was aboard. <em>Held, </em>that a finding for the plaintiff was warranted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b427-10\">Tort or contract, with a declaration in two counts, the first in tort and the second in contract, for injuries alleged to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>resulted to the plaintiff from eating unwholesome food furnished by the defendant to him when he was a passenger on a boat of the defendant running from Savannah in the State of Georgia to Boston.

Other material evidence is described in the opinion.

The action is in contract, the plaintiff alleging that food was served by the defendant and eaten by the plaintiff which was unwholesome and \u201c contained foreign matter \u201d and was \u201c otherwise unfit to be eaten whereby the plaintiff . . . was injured,\u201d and \u201cmade sick.\u201d At the close of the evidence, the defendant moved that a finding be entered in its favor. This motion was denied. The judge, sitting without a jury, found for the plaintiff, and the defendant excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">There was evidence that the plaintiff ate his dinner about six o\u2019clock on the night of June 17; that the .next morning he had no breakfast; and was seasick; that during the rest of the voyage he was in good health and after the first morning on shipboard was able to \"go down and take meals;\u201d that Sunday, June 20, about five o\u2019clock, he had lunch or supper; that he thought soup was served, did not recall whether he ate fruit or dessert but remembered eating some cold meat which \u201cdidn\u2019t taste very good to . . . [him];\u201d that he remained on the boat until about fifteen minutes after seven o\u2019clock that evening, when he pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>ceeded to the elevated station and thence to his room; that he went to the theatre in the evening and to a caf\u00e9 with a friend, and about twelve o\u2019clock went to bed; that he had eaten or drunk nothing after he departed from the boat, but had been smoking during the evening; that about four o\u2019clock the next morning he was suffering from cramps, was covered with perspiration, and was in pain due to great distress in his intestines; that he did not recall anything until some time after eight o\u2019clock in the morning when \u201che was conscious that the landlady was holding his head and that he was vomiting and that there w;as a doctor in the room;\u201d that the doctor attended him twice a day for five days; that he had a high temperature, could not retain food, and suffered with cramps. He testified that he never before suffered from indigestion.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-3\">The doctor who attended the plaintiff was dead at the time of the trial; but a physician testified that, from the plaintiff\u2019s story and what he had heard on the witness stand, the plaintiff presented to him \u201ca classical picture of food poisoning; that the term ptomaine poisoning was not now used; that the incubation period for food poisoning was from eight to twenty hours; that it was less than twenty-four hours; that it would be out of the question for diseased food to remain in a person\u2019s stomach for a period of from forty-eight to seventy-two hours before he would feel any effects from it.\u201d He further testified that in his opinion the plaintiff\u2019s illness was caused by food poisoning, and was caused by the food he ate Sunday afternoon on the boat.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">It was decided in <em>Friend </em>v. <em>Childs Dining Hall Co. </em>231 Mass. 65, that, when food is furnished by a restaurant keeper in response to the order of a guest, there is an implied contract by the restaurant keeper that the food is fit to eat. At page 73 of that opinion it was said: \u201cOn principle and on authority it seems to us that the liability of the proprietor of an eating house to his guest for serving bad food rests on an implied term of the contract and does not sound exclusively in tort, although of course he may be held for negligence if that is proved.\u201d And at page 75: \u201cOur conclusion is that, whether the transaction established on the evidence between the plaintiff and the defendant be treated as a sale of food, or as a contract for entertainment where the defendant simply \u2018utters his provision\u2019 (to use the neat phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>of <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Flint, </em>12 Mod. 254, employed more than two centuries ago) for the benefit of the plaintiff, there was a case to be submitted to the jury.\u201d This principle is applicable to the case at bar. The defendant contracted to furnish the plaintiff with proper food, and if the defendant failed in this duty it was responsible to the plaintiff in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\">The difficulty in the case is to determine whether there was any evidence that the defendant furnished the plaintiff with unwholesome food which caused his sickness. On this point the evidence is very slight; but in our opinion, taking all the testimony into consideration, it could not be ruled as matter of law that there was no evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s injuries resulted from the improper food furnished by the defendant. It could have been found that he was in good health when he became a passenger on the defendant\u2019s steamship; that the white meat he ate at lunch on Sunday afternoon \u201cdidn\u2019t taste good\u201d to him; and in answer to the question, \u201cYou knew you had supper on-the Savannah vessel or boat; that you spent the evening with a friend at the theatre; that you smoked more or less; that you had been pretty seasick a day or two before; that you carried two heavy cases home and the next morning about eleven hours later you woke up with this attack. Have you any other cause or reason to connect your attack with the Savannah Steamship Lines than what I have spoken of?\u201d He replied, \u201cExcepting that white meat I didn\u2019t think that was very good, whatever it was.\u201d With this evidence and the testimony of the physician that in his opinion the plaintiff\u2019s illness was caused by the food he ate Sunday afternoon on the boat, we cannot say there was no evidence to support the plaintiff\u2019s contention. The evidence, as we have said, was very meagre; but the credibility of the witnesses was for the trial judge, and if he believed them he could find that the plaintiff\u2019s case was proved.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
