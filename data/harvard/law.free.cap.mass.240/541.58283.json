It appeared that the tenant was the mother of a debtor of a corporation and that he had forged her name as an indorser upon notes which he gave the corporation in payment; that after negotiations between an attorney for the son and an attorney for the corporation and for its treasurer, the tenant gave the mortgage to the president of the corporation, the forged notes were surrendered, and the mortgage was assigned to the corporation and by it was foreclosed by sale to its treasurer, the demandant, who, it was agreed, \u201ctook title with full notice and knowledge of the tenant\u2019s claim that the mortgage was obtained by duress and was voidable.\u201d There was evidence tending to show that the attorney for the corporation, acting within the scope of a retainer to obtain payment or security for the payment of the notes, stated in substance to the attorney for the tenant\u2019s son that, if the mortgage was not given, the son would have to goto jail, and intended and proposed to the son\u2019s attorney that he should cause the tenant to be informed of the attitude and demands of the corporation; that such information was given to the tenant by the son\u2019s attorney; that the demandant, treasurer of the corporation in charge of the negotiations, with full knowledge acquiesced therein, and that the mortgage was executed by the tenant \u201cfor fear of the consequences\u201d of her not doing so. <em>Held, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>(1) The representations and knowledge of the attorney for the corporation in the circumstances were binding upon the corporation and the demandant;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-5\">(2) Testimony of the attorneys, respectively for the corporation and for the son, detailing the history of their negotiations, was admissible as evidence;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-6\">(3) In the circumstances, the fact, that neither the attorney nor any representative of the corporation \u201csaw or communicated [directly]] with the tenant\u201d or her husband about \u201c these forgeries, or the giving of the mortgage in question,\u201d was immaterial;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b564-7\">(4) A finding was warranted that the mortgage was procured or obtained by duress by the corporation or by its president or by an agent, servant or attorney of one of them.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b564-8\">Writ of entry to recover possession of three parcels of land in Beverly Farms and Manchester.

Bullard and assigned by him to the William M. Flanders Company, which foreclosed it, the demandant being the purchaser at the sale. The following issue to determine this question was framed by the Land Court and transmitted to the Superior Court for trial. St. 1904, c. 448, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 8. G. L. c. 185, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 15.' \u201cWas a certain mortgage, alleged to have been given by Arthur P. Thissell and Mary E. Thissell to Benjamin F. Bullard, dated February 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>1918, and recorded with Essex South District Deeds, book 2387, page 7, and assigned to William M. Flanders Company, procured or obtained by the said Benjamin F. Bullard or the said William M. Flanders Company, or the agents, servants, or attorneys of either of them, by duress?\u201d The jury answered the question in the affirmative. The parties agreed that Bullard was the president and Stevens the treasurer of the company, while Alfred W. Putnam, Esquire, acted as counsel for it and for Stevens who \u201ctook title with full notice and knowledge of the tenant\u2019s claim that the mortgage was obtained by duress and was voidable.\u201d It was admitted that the t\u00e9nant\u2019s son, being indebted to the William M. Flanders Company, forged the name of his mother as an indorser on two promissory notes which he gave the company in payment. The forgery as to one of the notes at least having been confessed to the company\u2019s treasurer, he employed counsel to represent the company, who after negotiations with Oscar E. Jackson, Esquire, counsel for the son, received the mortgage duly executed by the tenant and the notes were surrendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The demandant contends that the record does not show that any duress was practised upon the tenant, or that if she was influenced by any improper suggestion, it did not come from any one representing the company \u201cbut from her son . . . who w\u00e1s the forger,\u201d and that there is no evidence showing that the tenant\u2019s \u201c\u2018fear of the consequences\u2019 was known or in any way intimated to the demandant or any person representing the\u201d company. The representations and knowledge of counsel retained by them and through whose efforts the mortgage was ultimately procured were binding upon Stevens and the company. <em>Anthony &amp; Cowell Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>214 Mass. 439. <em>Raynes </em>v. <em>Sharp, </em>238 Mass. 20. The treasurer, called as a witness by the tenant, testified that his counsel told him that the inducement which was being held out to the tenant \u201cas a consideration or reason for her giving the mortgage was the surrender of the forged note,\u201d and when asked, \u201cWasn\u2019t it because with these forged notes in your possession you could jail this man?\u201d answered, \u201cThat could be done.\u201d He further said \u201cthat he knew whatever inducement or reason was being held out, or had to be held out, for the obtaining of that mortgage was being held out or made through Putnam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and Jackson; and that if the surrender of the forged notes as an inducement for her giving the mortgage was being held out to Mrs. Thissell, he knew it would have to be held out through Jackson and Putnam, and he was willing that that should be done; that he did n\u2019t care how Putnam got their money as long as they got it; that it was entirely agreeable to him what Mr. Putnam did in the matter and that he permitted Mr. Putnam to surrender the forged notes on the condition that he could get the mortgage; that he would have approved of anything Mr. Putnam did in the case.\u201d The jury could find on the evidence of Mr. Jackson and of Mr. Putnam detailing the history of their negotiations, which was plainly admissible, <em>Raynes </em>v. <em>Sharp, supra, </em>that if the mortgage was not given, \u201cabout the only alternative was\u201d that the son \u201cwould have to go to jail.\u201d And when Mr. Jackson was asked whether Mr. Putnam in his interviews with him said in any form of words, \u201cIf he gives this mortgage he wont have to go to jail?\u201d he answered, \u201cYes. That was said, or that inference was given in some form, that, of course, if Ije was successful in carrying through the negotiations all right, why then it would not be necessary for him to go to jail.\u201d It appears in Mr. Putnam\u2019s evidence that Mr. Jackson demanded the surrender of the \u201cforged note,\u201d and he further said, \u201cYes,\u201d in answer to the question, \u201cAnd you expected him,\u201d meaning Mr. Jackson, \u201cto communicate that fact to her in some way that you would surrender the note if she would give that mortgage?\u201d And \u201cthat he did undoubtedly tell Mr. Stevens that they could either sue on the note, or go right up to the court and make criminal complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">It is immaterial that there \u201cwas no evidence that Putnam, or Stevens, or Bullard, or any representative of the Flanders Company saw or communicated with the tenant ... or with her husband . . . about these forgeries, or the giving of the mortgage in question.\u201d The jury well could say that such communications were unnecessary, as counsel for the company acting within the scope of his general retainer to obtain payment or security for the payment of the forged notes, intended and proposed during his conversation with him, that Mr. Jackson in some way would cause the tenant to be informed of the attitude and demands of the company, or of Stevens who could be found on his own evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>dence to have had full charge of the settlement, including the procurement of the mortgage. The evidence also was sufficient to warrant a finding of knowledge, and acquiescence in, the negotiations conducted by their counsel. <em>Beacon Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Souther, </em>183 Mass. 413, 417. And that no arrangement for an adjustment of the indebtedness to be secured by a mortgage of her real property and home could be effected unless she was informed of the material facts. The tenant, whose evidence the jury could accept as true, said, that she was present at a conversation between her husband and Mr. Jackson concerning the signing of. the mortgage, where it was said, \"That we were obliged to sign it or my son would go to jail.\u201d And when asked, \u201cWhy did you sign that mortgage?\u201d she replied, \u201cI signed for fear of the consequences,\u201d which were stated to be, \u201cWell, the grievance it would cause in my home and the serious heart trouble of my husband. We could not tell how it would affect him if my son went to jail. ... Of course it would affect the family, and . . . my little grandson.\u201d It \u201cis of no consequence how the domination over the mind was acquired; it is enough that it was acquired.\u201d <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>203 Mass. 556, 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">We have referred sufficiently to the evidence which tended to show, and made the question one of fact for the jury, whether the tenant acted of her own free will or was influenced and induced by the company\u2019s demands and the precedent conditions whereby that demand could only be met and satisfied, to execute, and deliver the mortgage through a created fear of a threatened criminal prosecution and imprisonment of her son. If they came to this conclusion the mortgage was procured by duress. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Carmody, </em>131 Mass. 51, 55. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Woodworth, </em>155 Mass. 233, 250, 251. <em>Silsbee </em>v. <em>Webber, </em>171 Mass. 378, 380. <em>Anthony &amp; Cowell Co. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>214 Mass. 439, 442. <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Irving National Bank of New York, </em>116 N. Y. 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The demandant\u2019s request for a directed verdict was denied rightly, and the evidence as to private conversations between husband and wife although erroneously admitted, having subsequently been struck out and the jury instructed to disregard it, the exceptions must be overruled. <em>Dempsey </em>v. <em>Goldstein Brothers Amusement Co. </em>231 Mass. 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
