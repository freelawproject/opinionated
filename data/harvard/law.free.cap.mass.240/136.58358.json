St. 1911, c. 751, and amendments thereto; now G. L. c. 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The member upon the reported evidence warrantably found as a fact and ruled as a matter of law within the meaning of St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 7; G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 32, that the claimant Mary Resse lived with her father, William Ressi, when he received an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment on January 22, 1920, and when, as a result of the injury, he died on November 13, 1920. The evidence further supports the finding that the father was a widower and that the claimant was under the age of eighteen years at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-11\">Upon the above findings the member made a further finding and ruling that the claimant \u201cis conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent upon him [[the father] for support and is entitled to a weekly compensation of $10 for a period of four hundred weeks, subject to the provisions of the act.\u201d This last finding and ruling manifestly overlooks the testimony of the claimant and the admitted fact that Mary Resse became eighteen years of age on April 18, 1920, and consequently was over the age of eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>years at the time of the father\u2019s death on November 13, 1920; and in so doing disregards the provision of St. 1911, c. 751, Part II, \u00a7 7 (see now G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 32), which reads: \u201cThe following persons shall be conclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee: <em>...(c)... </em>children under the age of eighteen years . . . upon the parent with whom . . . they are living at the time of the death of such parent, there being no surviving dependent parent. ... In all other cases questions of dependency, in whole or in part, shall be determined in accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury; . . .\u201d It follows that the member and the Industrial Accident Board should have found as a fact the degree of the claimant\u2019s dependency \u201cin accordance with the fact, as the fact may be at the time of the injury,\u201d and should not have ruled on the facts reported that the claimant was within the statute, or one of the class of persons by statute \u201cconclusively presumed to be wholly dependent for support upon a deceased employee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Acn\">The decree of the Superior Court must be reversed and the case remanded to the Industrial Accident Board for a determination of dependency in accordance with the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
