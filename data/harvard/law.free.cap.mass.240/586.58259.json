The parties derived their titles through mesne conveyances from a common grantor. His convey.ance to one Sayre, through whom the plaintiff derived title, was made in 1888, and preceded that to the defendant\u2019s predecessor in title. Sayre, at different dates in October, 1918, conveyed to the immediate predecessor in title of the plaintiff three parcels which divided his tract longitudinally. In December, 1918, only the most easterly portion of the tract was conveyed to the plaintiff. The parties were agreed as to the position of the northwesterly corner and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the westerly boundary line of the tract described in the deed of 1888, and that its northwesterly corner was at a certain point \u201con the southerly side of Main Street.\u201d The eastern and western boundaries of the tract were of equal length, its southern boundary line was \"in a line parallel with said Main Street\u201d and its northerly boundary was \u201calong said Main Street.\u201d In 1888 Main Street was straight. In 1895, the municipality made it a curved street with a uniform convexity projecting southerly in part across the former straight line of the street, and it was so in 1918. Bach of the three deeds to the plaintiff\u2019s immediate predecessor in title in October, 1918, gave as the point designated as the point of beginning from which their boundary lines were delineated, either a point of the same description as that of the northwestern point of the tract in the deed of 1888 or a point measured a certain distance from that point \u201cin the southerly side [or \u201c bounds \u201d3 of Main Street; \u201d the northern boundaries of these lots were in \u201cthe southerly bounds\u201d of Main Street; their southerly boundaries all were \u201cin a line parallel with said Main Street;\u201d their easterly and westerly boundaries all measured the same length as those of the deed of 1888; and the first parcel was described as the \u201cwesterly portion,\u201d the second as \u201ca portion\u201d and the third as \u201cthe easterly portion\u201d of the property described in the deed of 1888, to which specific reference was made in each of the deeds. The lot conveyed to the plaintiff was described as bounded northerly by a line \u201crunning . . . along the southerly line of\u201d Main Street, and the deed, after a surveyor\u2019s description, contained the statement, \u201cMeaning and intending to convey the easterly portion of the Sayre property, so-called.\u201d It was agreed that, if the northerly boundaries were to be measured on the southerly line of Main Street as it was in 1888, the defendant was a trespasser, and that, if they were to be measured on the curved line of the street as it was after 1895, he was not a trespasser. <em>Held, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-5\">(1) The intention of the parties to the deeds as expressed by all the terms of the grant is the true canon of interpretation;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-6\">(2) All the deeds might be read together;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-7\">(3) The references to the deeds to Sayre in 1888 were a part of the conveyances in 1918;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-8\">(4) The deeds of Sayre in October, 1918, included all the land conveyed to Sayre in 1888; <em>'</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-10\">(5) The measurements of the northern boundaries in the 1918 deeds should be on the straight line of Main Street as it was in 1888;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b609-11\">(6) The iron pipes and wires placed by the defendant were on land of the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-12\">Tort for trespass <em>quare clausum fregit. </em>Writ in the District Court of Northern Berkshire dated August 22, 1919.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-13\">On appeal to the Superior Court, the action was tried before <em>Irwin, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b609-14\">The alleged trespass consisted of the driving of pipes of iron and the stringing of wire connecting same for, approximately, a distance of thirty feet, extended southerly from Main Street in the village of Blackinton in North Adams.

The defendant admitted driving the iron pipes and stringing the wire, but contended that title to the locus was not in the plaintiffs but was in the defendant.

Sayre Tract, Blackinton, Mass.; Scale 10 feet to an inch; W. N. Tuller, C. E.,\u201d was introduced in evidence by the plaintiffs and marked Exhibit \u201cH.\u201d The essential features of this plan, not drawn to scale, are reproduced above. The iron pipes driven by the defendant near the boundary between his land and the plaintiffs\u2019 are shown at the easterly side of the plan. The amount of curve of Massachusetts Avenue (formerly Main Street) and the distance between the spike and the iron pipe at the northeastern corner are exaggerated to permit adequate reproduction here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-9\">The northeastern corner of the land of James R. Reynolds, shown on the plan, was located by a spike driven in the southerly side of the sidewalk of Main Street, and its location was not in dispute. The easterly line of Reynolds\u2019 land also was not in dispute. Main Street, West Main Street and Massachusetts Avenue are different names of the same highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b610-10\">It was admitted by the defendant that a straight line drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>between the two iron pipes driven by the defendant at the northeast and southeast corner of Sayre land, which the plaintiffs contended constituted a trespass upon their land, would not be parallel with the easterly line of land of James R. Reynolds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-5\">The plaintiffs introduced evidence tending to show that in 1888 and from that time to 1895, Main Street, as then used between those dates, was a straight street, that in the year 1895, its course was changed from a straight street to a curved street and that it has so existed and been so used continuously from 1895 to the present time.. The defendant contended and introduced evidence tending to show that Main Street at the place indicated had always been curved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-6\">It \u201cwas conceded and not in dispute\u201d that, if the three hundred and seventeen feet which constituted the sum of the measurements on Main Street called for in the descriptions in the three deeds of Sayre to Reed, as given in the opinion, were measured easterly from the northeast corner of land of James R. Reynolds along the southerly line of the sidewalk of Main Street as it was curved and had been used since 1895, the locus of the alleged trespass would not be on the plaintiff\u2019s land; but that, if that three hundred and seventeen feet were measured from the northeast corner of land of Reynolds along a straight line and a straight street, as the jury found the street to be in 1888, the locus of the alleged trespass would be on the plaintiffs\u2019 land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-7\">It further was \u201cconceded\u201d that, if the southerly line of Main Street, as found by the jury to have been straight in 1888, is the monument which controls the construction and fixes the extent of the grants in the various deeds from the S. Blackinton Woolen Company to Alice P. Sayre and from her to Emily M. Reed and by Emily M. Reed to the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs own the land where the alleged trespass was committed; but that, if the curved Main Street, as used continuously since 1895, is the monument which controls the construction and fixes the extent of the grants from Alice P. Sayre to Emily M. Reed and from Emily M. Reed to the plaintiffs, then the alleged trespass was not committed on land of the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-8\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant asked for the following rulings:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b611-9\">\u201c1. That upon the evidence the plaintiffs can not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>That the northeast corner of plaintiffs\u2019 land is fixed by starting at the northeast corner of land of Reynolds, on the southerly side of \u2018Main Street,\u2019 as it existed and was used in 1918, at the time of plaintiffs\u2019 deed, and measuring easterly along said southerly side of said Main Street, as then used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-5\">\u201c3. The easterly line of plaintiffs\u2019 land was located by their deed at a point westerly of the place where it is alleged the trespass was committed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-6\">\u201c4. The place where it is claimed the trespass was committed, was by construction of the deeds introduced in evidence, upon land of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-7\">\u201c5. The place of the alleged trespass was easterly of the easterly line of plaintiffs\u2019 land.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b612-8\">The judge refused to rule as requested, and submitted the following special question to the jury: \u201cWas the line of the highway upon which the land conveyed to Alice P. Sayre by Blackinton Woolen Company by deeds dated January 23, 1888, and February 28, 1888, straight, or was it at that time curved as represented on a plan marked \u2018H\u2019\u201d? The jury answered that the line of the street in the year 1888 was straight. Upon the return of the jury\u2019s answer to the special question, the judge ordered the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiffs and to assess damages in the sum of $1. The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b612-9\">The case was submitted on briefs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b612-10\"><em>M.

Blackinton Woolen Company. But the duly recorded deeds dated January 23 and February 28, 1888, from the company to Alice P. Sayre under whom the plaintiffs claim, having antedated the deed of July 22, 1902, to Thomas Fleming, who conveyed to the defendant, the questions for decision are, whether the description in the deeds to Sayre included the strip, title to which is in controversy, and, if included, whether this title has passed to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-13\">It appeared that, the deed of January 23, 1888, having contained misdescriptions, the quitclaim deed of February 28, 1888, was given to correct the errors. The description in this deed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>so far as material is as follows: \"Beginning at the northeast corner of land of James R. Reynolds, on the southerly side of Main Street, running through the village of Blackinton, from . . . North Adams to Williamstown, . . . thence running southerly, one hundred thirty-nine (139) feet to the bank of the Mill Pond, so called, of the grantor, thence in a line parallel with said Main Street, three hundred and seventeen (317) feet, to a stake and stones, thence running northerly, one hundred thirty-nine (139) feet, to said Main Street, thence westerly along said Main Street, to the place of beginning.\u201d While the description is free from ambiguity, it is plain that \"Main Street\u201d is a boundary or monument within the rule stated in <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Benson, </em>213 Mass. 128, 132, and cases there collated, and paroi evidence was admissible to show, and the jury could find, \u201cthat in 1888 and from that time to 1895 Main Street, as then used between those dates, was a straight street and that in the year 1895, the course of said street was changed from a straight street to a curved street and that it has so existed and been so used continuously from 1895 .to the present time.\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Munyan, </em>22 Pick. 410, 416. <em>Temple </em>v. <em>Benson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The defendant however \u201cclaimed that . . . Main Street at the place indicated had always been curved, continuously from 1888 to the present time and introduced evidence tending to sustain said claim.\u201d The trial judge without objection or exception submitted the following question to the jury: \u201cWas the line of. the highway upon which the land conveyed to Alice P. Sayre by Blackinton Woolen Company by deeds dated January 23, 1888, and February 28, 1888, straight, or was it at that time curved as' represented on a plan marked \u2018H\u2019?\u201d And the jury answered\u00a1 \u201cthat the line of the street, in the year 1888 was straight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The alteration of Main Street in 1895 by the municipality whereby it was changed from a straight line to a slight curve without any land being taken could not deprive Alice P. Sayre of the premises conveyed by the grant of the company. It is obvious that, the line being straight when she acquired title, she was seised in fee of the strip. The northeast corner of the land of James R. Reynolds and \u201cthe easterly line of\u201d Reynolds\u2019 land were not in dispute, and the words \u201cMain Street,\u201d \u201cWest Main Street\u201d and \u201c Massachusetts Avenue \u201d are different names of the same highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>The descriptions in the deeds of Alice P. Sayre to Emily M. Reed, dated respectively October 7, 1918, and October 8, 1918, and October 22, 1918, read as follows: \u201cBeginning at the northeast corner of land of James R. Reynolds, on the southerly side of Main Street, running through the village of Blackinton from said North Adams to Williamstown, in said county of Berkshire, thence running southerly on the easterly line of said Reynolds, one hundred thirty-nine feet (139 ft.) to the bank of the Mill Pond, thence easterly in a line parallel with said Main Street, eighty-three feet (83 ft.) to a stake and stones, thence running northerly in a line parallel with said Reynolds\u2019 east line, one hundred thirty-nine feet (139 ft.) to the southerly bounds of said Main Street, thence westerly on the southerly bounds of said Main Street, eighty-three feet (83 ft.) to the place of beginning. Being westerly portion, as herein described of land deeded to me by S. Blackinton Woolen Company ... to which reference is had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\u201cBeginning at a point in the southerly side of Main Street, in the village of Blackinton, said point being eighty-three feet (83 ft.) easterly from James R. Reynolds\u2019 northeast corner, thence southerly in a line parallel with said Reynold\u2019s east line, one hundred thirty-nine (139 ft.) to a stake and stones, thence easterly in a line parallel with said Main Street, forty-three feet (43 ft.) to a stake and stones, thence northerly one hundred thirty-nine feet (139 ft.) to the southerly bounds of said Main Street, thence westerly on the southerly bounds of said Main Street, forty-three (43 ft.) to the place of beginning. Being a portion, as herein described, of land deeded to me by deed of S.

Reynolds, thence southerly in a line parallel with said Reynolds\u2019 easterly line, one hundred thirty-nine feet (139 ft.) to a stake and stones, thence easterly in a line parallel with said Main Street, one hundred ninety-one feet (191 ft.) to stake and stones, thence northerly one hundred thirty-nine feet (139 ft.) to the southerly bounds of said Main Street, and thence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>westerly one hundred ninety-one feet to the place of beginning. Meaning and intending to convey the easterly portion, as herein described, of land conveyed to me by S. Blackinton Woolen Company. Refer to Northern Berkshire Registry of Deeds, book 169 page 546.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">It being undisputed that at the date of these deeds Main Street had become a curved street, the defendant contends as matter of law that the reference in these deeds to Main Street must be held to be Main Street as it contemporaneously existed unless there is something to control the presumption. But Alice P. Sayre by the first deed conveyed the \u201cwesterly portion, as herein described of land deeded to me by S. Blackinton Woolen Company ... to which reference is had.\u201d And by the second deed \u201ca portion, as herein described, of land deeded to me by deed of S. Blackinton Woolen Company, to which reference is had, at the Northern Berkshire Registry of Deeds.\u201d The third and last deed recites in the granting clause, \u201cMeaning and intending to convey the easterly portion, as herein described, of land conveyed to me by S. Blackinton Woolen Company. Refer to Northern Berkshire Registry of Deeds, book 169 page 546.\u201d If the defendant\u2019s contention is sound, the grantor by these deeds conveyed all the land granted to her by the company except the strip in dispute. It is settled that the intention of the parties as expressed by all the terms of the grant is the true canon of interpretation. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>194 Mass. 533. The deeds may be read together. <em>Clap </em>v. <em>Draper, </em>4 Mass. 266. <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Boylston, </em>5 Mass. 411, 417. <em>Lipsky </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>199 Mass. 310, 315. And the references to the title deed of Alice P. Sayre were a material part of each conveyance. It had the same effect as if the entire description in that deed had been copied into each conveyance, and not being inconsistent with the particular descriptions, the grant should be held to include all the land. <em>Foss </em>v. <em>Crisp, </em>20 Pick. 121. <em>Hopkins </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>111 Mass. 176. <em>Pollard </em>v. <em>Ketterer, </em>221 Mass. 317, 322. It cannot be assumed that she intended to retain title to a strip of land which on the record is apparently so infinitesimal in area as to have no actual value. We are therefore of opinion that the grantor intended to convey without reservation all her land and that under all the language used by her in the granting clause of each deed, and her intention not being inconsistent with the rides of law, Emily M. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Reed, the grantee, acquired title accordingly. <em>Frost </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>19 Pick. 445, 446. <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Proprietors of Locks &amp; Canals, </em>5 Met. 15, 28. <em>Crocker </em>v. <em>Cotting, </em>166 Mass. 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The deed of December 9, 1918, from Emily M. Reed to the plaintiffs has this description: \u201cBeginning at a stake lying in the southerly line of Massachusetts Avenue, it also being at the northwest corner of the within described land; thence running easterly along the southerly line of Massachusetts Avenue, sixty-four and seventy-three hundred feet (64.73 ft.) to a stake; thence turning an interior angle of eighty-seven degrees and two minutes and running southerly one hundred thirty-nine and three tenths feet (139.3 ft.) to an iron pipe; thence turning an interior angle of ninety-one degrees and forty-five minutes and running westerly sixty-four and seventy-five hundredths feet (64.75 ft.) to a stake; thence turning an interior angle of eighty-eight degrees and fifteen minutes and running northerly one hundred thirty-seven and seven tenths feet (137.7 ft.) along land of the grantor to the place of beginning. The last mentioned line falling about midway between the two houses and making an interior angle of ninety-two degrees and fifty-eight minutes with the first mentioned line. Meaning and intending to convey the easterly portion of the Sayre property, so called.\u201d The recital \u201cMeaning and intending to convey the easterly portion of the Sayre property so called,\u201d shows in this deed as in the previous deeds the intention of the grantor to convey her title to this portion vested in her by the deed of Alice P. Sayre of October 22, 1918. The plan moreover 'put in evidence by the plaintiffs shows that the easterly line of their land as described in the deed to them is parallel with the undisputed easterly line of the Reynolds land, and the northeast corner of the plaintiffs\u2019 land measured in a straight line from the northeast corner of the Reynolds land gives the same distance as that shown in the deed to Alice P. Sayre. The defendant argues that this plan is unreliable; but whether it was inaccurate when compared with the plans, two in number, introduced by the defendant, which he claimed showed title in him, was a question of fact which the jury have settled adversely to his contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The result is, that the defendant\u2019s requests were rightly denied and that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
