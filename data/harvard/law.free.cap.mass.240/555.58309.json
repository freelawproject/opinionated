Material evidence appearing on the record is described in the opinion. He ruled that the decision appealed from was upon a pure question,of fact and by his order a decree was entered, in accordance with the decision of the Industrial Accident Board,, dismissing the claim.

The findings of fact are conclusive if supported by the evidence. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The decedent employed as a baker was preparing to put dough into an oven when he slipped and fell. \u201cHis head struck a stone on the floor and he cried out \u2018Oh, my head.\u2019\u201d It could be found that the cement floor in front of the oven was wet, \u201cthe same as it is always,\u201d and that the temperature was high \u201cbecause the three ovens are going all the time.\u201d A' fellow employee also \u201cheard a fall and cry \u2018my head.\u2019\u201d While the decedent did not become entirely unconscious and \"kept crying about his head and saying that he felt badly,\u201d and died within fifteen minutes at the hospital to which he was immediately removed, he made no reference to the cause of his fall; nor did it appear that the fall caused any external physical injuries. The record of the hospital properly received in evidence showed that the patient was admitted in a state of collapse from cerebral hemorrhage. <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Fitchburg &amp; Leominster Street Railway, </em>236 Mass. 526, 540. And the certificate of death stated as the cause \u201cNatural causes, probably cerebral hemorrhage.\u201d It was the opinion of the claimant\u2019s medical expert who had read the hospital report, that \u201cA man could sustain an epidural or a subdural hemorrhage by reason of slipping and falling and suddenly striking his head upon a cement or stone flooring when there was a loud report or a heavy thud from striking the floor.\u201d The decedent however having been fifty-seven years of age, he also testified that in a man of that age it is usual to find hardening of the arteries, and that extreme heat might \"induce cerebral hemorrhage.\u201d To the question, \u201cAssuming that in this case the deceased was a man fifty-seven years of age and working in a bakery with a temperature very high, would you say that would probably cause a cerebral hemorrhage?\u201d he answered, \u201cYes, it is probable that the high temperature produced an intracerebral hemorrhage. It was an intracerebral hemorrhage in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The claimant\u2019s counsel contends this evidence warranted a finding that the employee suffered an injury as a natural incident of his work, the effect of which caused his death. <em>McNicol\u2019s Case, </em>215 Mass. 497, 499. But the causal connection was a question of fact, involving also the credibility of the witnesses, and the decision of the Industrial Accident Board, rested upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the ground that the claimant had failed to sustain the burden of proving \u201cthat the death of her husband was due to a personal injury which arose out of and in the course of his employment\u201d cannot be reversed. <em>Fitzgibbons\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 473, 474. <em>Sanderson\u2019s Case, </em>224 Mass. 558, 563. <em>Pass\u2019s Case, </em>232 Mass. 515. <em>Bolden\u2019s Case, </em>235 Mass. 309, 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">The evidence that the decedent and two of the witnesses for the claimant were members of the baker\u2019s union, to the admission of which in cross-examination the claimant objected, cannot affect the result. No prejudicial error is shown. <em>Pigeon\u2019s Case, </em>216 Mass. 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
