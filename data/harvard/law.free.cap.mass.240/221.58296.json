In the declaration in an action by the corporation against the trustees for the value of such merchandise it was alleged that one of the trustees agreed with the plaintiff to pay to it the amount of its claim against the contractor \u201cfrom such funds as might be in his hands due . . . [the contractor] for the building of the garage\u201d and that the plaintiff had agreed to look to the defendants for payment of its claim and not to prosecute its claim against the contractor and that it had discharged the contractor from liability. An officer of the corporation testified that the trustee told him \"that he would take care of my account.\u201d The attorney for the plaintiff testified that the trustee said to him \u201che would take care of the account\u201d and on a later occasion \u201cDo not worry about that, I will take care of it; you will get your money\u201d and still later \u201cnot to worry about it, he would take care of the account.\u201d At the close of the evidence the defendants filed a motion that a verdict be ordered for the defendants, which was denied.

The case was heard by an auditor who found for the defendants. Afterwards a jury in the Superior Court made specific findings of fact and a verdict was returned for the plaintiff for the full amount of its claim. The case was submitted to the jury solely on the third count of the declaration, and is before this court on exceptions to the refusal of the trial judge to give certain requests for rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">The plaintiff sold to one Blakeley lumber and materials amounting to $1,478.63 to be used by the latter in building a garage for the defendants. There was evidence to show that Blakeley failed to complete his contract with the defendants according to its terms. The plaintiff contends, and offered evidence to show, that the defendant Apsey entered into an agreement with it and promised to pay the amount of its claim against Blakeley; that the plaintiff thereafter agreed to look to the defendants for such payment, and discharged Blakeley from liability. The defendants contend that there was no evidence of a novation as alleged in the third count, that the promise alleged was a promise to pay the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>debt of another and therefore within the statute of frauds; that there was a variance between the allegations and the proof; and that upon these and other grounds the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The third count in substance alleges that by the terms of the agreement between the plaintiff and the defendants the defendant Apsey agreed to pay the plaintiff the amount of the claim against Blakeley \"from such funds as might be in his hands due the said Blakeley.\u201d One Marion, an officer of the plaintiff corporation, testified that Mr. Apsey told him \u201cthat he would take care of my account;\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s attorney testified that Apsey said to him, \u201che would take care of the account;\u201d that on November 12 Apsey said to the attorney \u201cDo not worry about that, I will take care of it; you will get your money;\u201d that in December, 1917, Apsey again told him \u201c not to worry about it, he would take care of the account.\u201d The foregoing is the substance of all the evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s promise to pay the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">While the defendant\u2019s promise set forth in the count relied on is conditional, being a promise to pay \"from such funds as might be in his hands due the said Blakeley,\u201d the promise actually proved is absolute and unconditional; there is plainly a material variance between the allegation and the proof. It is manifest that there was no misapprehension at the trial respecting the conditional promise set up in the third count. The court stated to the jury that \u201c The plaintiff does not claim in this case that there was any absolute promise to pay. The plaintiff does not claim that the defendants made any absolute promise to pay regardless of the state of the account between the defendants and Blakeley. The plaintiff says that what Apsey agreed to do was to pay the plaintiff if anything was due from the defendants to Blakeley. That is its statement and allegation in the declaration, and that is a fact, of course, which they must prove.\u201d As the proof did not sustain the allegation it follows that the defendants\u2019 first and second requests should have been given. <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Totman, </em>204 Mass. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">There was evidence from which the jury could have found that the parties mutually agreed that the defendants should pay the plaintiff what Blakeley owed it, and that the plaintiff accepted the defendants as its debtor in the place of Blakeley and released <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>the latter. If the jury so found, the contract would be valid. <em>Call </em>v. <em>Calef, </em>4 Cush. 388. <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Fellows, </em>110 Mass. 52. <em>Trudeau </em>v. <em>Poutre, </em>165 Mass. 81. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Cunningham, </em>183 Mass. 505.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The unconditional promise of the defendants to pay the plaintiff\u2019s debt would be an original and not a collateral one and would not be within the statute of frauds. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>Cunningham, supra. Miles </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>201 Mass. 318. <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Felt, </em>206 Mass. 472.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">There was evidence that the plaintiff released Blakeley in consideration of the defendants\u2019 promise to it. Such a release would constitute a sufficient consideration for the defendants\u2019 promise to the plaintiff. There was also evidence from which it could have been found that in consideration of the promise the plaintiff agreed not to bring an action against Blakeley and summon the defendants as trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">As there was a material variance between the allegations and the proof, it is unnecessary to consider the exceptions to the third and fourth requests; the fifth has not been argued and is treated as waived; the exception to the refusal to give the first and second is sustained. The motion that a verdict be ordered for the defendants should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
