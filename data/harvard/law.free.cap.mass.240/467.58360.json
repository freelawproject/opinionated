No payment or offer of payment ever was made by the defendant. In an action by the publisher against the merchant begun in September, 1920, for the $100 payment, the defendant testified, subject to an exception by the plaintiff, that on the day after the contract was signed an agent of the plaintiff had stated to the defendant that the reference book could not be delivered on July 1, \u201cso you wouldn\u2019t have to pay in advance for that book; you have got time to pay from July up to January.\u201d A motion by the plaintiff that a verdict be ordered in his favor was denied and the jury found for the defendant. <em>Held, </em>that</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-11\">(1) Assuming, without deciding, that the modification of the contract delaying the payment by the defendant to, January, 1920, was authorized by the plaintiff, the defendant still was required to make the payment before performance could be required of the plaintiff;</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-12\">(2) A verdict should have been ordered for the plaintiff.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b489-13\">At the trial of the action above described, there was uncontradicted evidence tending to show that the plaintiff had attempted to deliver the reference book to the defendant at an address placed under his signature on the contract, and it <em>was stated </em>that such a delivery by the plaintiff was performance by him of the provisions of the contract as to delivery of the book, and, in the circumstances, judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $100 and interest was ordered by this court under G.

Mills, a witness for the plaintiffs, testified \u201cthat he called on the defendant.and that the defendant signed the contract in his presence, that 786 Washington Street, the address which appears under defendant\u2019s signature at the bottom of the contract, was the address given him by Mussman, the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>and that afterwards he handed the contract into the Boston office of the plaintiffs.\u201d Donald McNiven, cashier at the plaintiffs\u2019 Boston office and in charge of contracts, testified \u201cthat the plaintiffs were ready and willing between July 1, 1919, and July 1, 1920, to carry out the terms of the contract and that the defendant did not at any time ever furnish the plaintiffs with any other address than 786 Washington Street and that the plaintiffs never received payment from the defendant of the $100.\u201d David H. Hunter, a witness called in behalf of the plaintiffs, testified \u201cthat he had charge for the plaintiffs of the receiving, distributing and keeping a record of the reference books delivered to subscribers; that some time in July, 1919, he directed a book of the plaintiffs .to the defendant at 786 Washington Street and delivered it to the teamster who had that route to deliver and that the book which was sent in July, 1919, to the defendant at 786 Washington Street was the eastern edition reference book of the plaintiffs as called for in the contract, that he called at the defendant\u2019s place of business in November, 1919, and found it closed, and that he got the reference book back from J. Gordon &amp; Company, who had a place next door to the defendant at 786 Washington Street.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A8M\">Other material evidence and exceptions saved by the plaintiffs are described in the opinion. There was a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiffs alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-6\"><em>F. D. Healy, </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-7\">No argument or brief was submitted for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b491-8\">DeCourcy, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYk\">By the terms of the written agreement signed by the defendant, he was to receive a reference book containing ratings of business men, and reports concerning the mercantile standing and credit of merchants, manufacturers, etc. within a certain territory, on request. The contract was signed May 14, and dated July 1, 1919; and the defendant agreed thereby to pay in advance $100 for the year beginning July 1. This action was brought on September 21, 1920, to recover such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">Under the exception of the plaintiffs the trial judge allowed the defendant to testify that on the day after the contract was signed, one Wills, an employee of the plaintiffs, said to him over the telephone: \"Mr. Mussman I believe that I won\u2019t be able to deliver you the book in time July first, so you wouldn\u2019t have to pay in advance for that book; you have got time to pay from July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>up to January.\u201d We find it unnecessary to consider the extent, of Wills\u2019s authority to bind his employers. Even assuming that the above telephone' conversation was binding on the plaintiffs, (see <em>McNicholas </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, </em>196 Mass. 565, 570, 571), its effect at most was to extend the time for payment of the $100 from July 1, 1919, to January 1, 1920. As we construe the contract and conversation the money was then payable in advance, and delivery of the book was not required until such payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Moreover on the uncontradicted evidence the plaintiffs had then complied with all the requirements of the contract. They had sent the reference book in July, 1919, to 786 Washington Street, the address appearing under the defendant\u2019s signature on the contract. This action was not begun until the following September.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The motion that a verdict be directed for the plaintiffs should have been granted: and in accordance with G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 123, judgment is to be entered in their favor in the sum of $100 with, interest from the date of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>So </em>ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
