Under such circumstances, we do not interfere with the judgment of the trial court: Simmons-Boardman Pub. Co. v. American B. P. Co., 282 Pa. 521; Duaine v. Gulf Ref. Co., 285 Pa. 81, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">Appellant\u2019s second contention, that plaintiff failed to produce evidence sufficient to sustain a verdict in his favor and, therefore, the court below abused its discretion in granting him a new trial, has no proper place in this appeal. Here, we are not asked to pass upon a judgment n. o. v., but an order for a new trial; and, under such circumstances, we will not review the whole body of the evidence, as appellant would have us do in the present instance, particularly where there is nothing on the record to show that the court below was asked to pursue this course when that tribunal had before it the motion for a new trial. In the Simmons-B oardman Case, supra, this court recently said: \u201cBefore we Avill proceed to review [an order for a new trial], it must appear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>testimony is not to be passed on by us unless purely as to its legal effect in some isolated and all-controlling particular wherein its verity is admitted. This court will not review an order granting a new trial unless the court below states it would have refused to grant the new trial but for reasons distinctly set forth, which, in its opinion, control the whole case; and then we will review the reasons given only when they do not involve the consideration of oral evidence further than as previously noted.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"ANp\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
