On August 15th defendant appeared by attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">The Act of May 8, 1901, P. L. 142, as amended by the Act of June 12, 1919, P. L. 478, provides that \u201cthe several courts of this Commonwealth shall have power, by general rule or special order, to fix the time within which the defendant shall file his abstract of title; Provided, that the court may, on rule, enter such judgment on the pleadings in favor of either party as it may appear to the court the party is entitled to.\u201d Pursuant to the power thus conferred, the court below adopted the following rules for actions of ejectment: \u201cA copy of plaintiff\u2019s declaration and abstract of title shall be served upon the defendant or his attorney of record, and, within thirty days after such service, defendant shall file his plea, answer and abstract of title and serve copy of each thereof on plaintiff or upon his attorney of record. Upon defendant\u2019s failure to so file and serve said plea, answer and abstract, the plaintiff, upon five days\u2019 notice to defendant or his attorney, shall be entitled to such judgment as shall be warranted upon the facts set out in his declaration and abstract of title. Upon cause shown, the court may allow additional time for filing any declaration, answer, plea or abstract.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Defendant failed to file his plea, answer and abstract within the thirty days named in the rules, and, on October 25, 1924, plaintiff sent the following notice, delivered to defendant October 28th: \u201cYou will take notice that within five days after the service hereof on you, judgment will be taken against you upon plaintiff\u2019s declaration and abstract of title.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">On November 1, 1924, defendant filed his plea, answer apd abstract of title. This was done, however, without asking for an extension of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">November 10, 1924, plaintiff presented his petition setting forth substantially the facts recited above; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>whereupon a rule was allowed to show cause why defendant\u2019s plea, answer and abstract of title should not be stricken from the record, and why judgment should not be entered in favor of plaintiff. After the return day of this rule, an answer was filed, signed by the attorney for defendant, but not verified by affidavit as required by rule of the court below. In this answer defendant made no denial of the material allegations of the petition, nor did he offer any excuse for his failure to comply with the rules of court; he asked no indulgence, but contented himself with a bald averment that \u201cthe plea, answer and abstract of title filed in this case is a sufficient answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and with the assertion that \u201cdefendant has a right to file an answer at any time before judgment is actually entered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AfrC\">The Act of 1901, supra, expressly authorizes the before-quoted general rules of the court below, which, being \u201cestablished under the direction and by authority of an act of the legislature, have all the force and effect of a positive enactment\u201d (Cassidy v. Knapp, 167 Pa. 305, 307); hence the regulation therein, as to time, required \u201cexplicit obedience\u201d (Wise v. Cambridge Boro., 262 Pa. 139, 143-4) unless, in the words of the rule, <em>\u201cupon cause shown \u201d </em>the court allowed additional time. The court below, in the present case, held that, if such indulgence is desired, the one in default must ask for it within the five-day notice from his opponent provided for in the rules, and, should no extension of time be granted, judgment may be taken by the plaintiff at the expiration of the five-day period. In other words, the five-day notice is not for the purpose of giving, automatically, additional time to defendant; rather, it is a prelude to the entry of judgment, and, like a motion for judgment by default, has the effect of bringing forbearance to an end. It advises defendant that, at the expiration of five days, judgment will be entered against him by right because of his existing default, in not filing his abstract of title within the thirty-day period; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>such judgment can be prevented only by asking for and, in the words of the rule, \u201cupon cause shown,\u201d obtaining from the court an extension of time. This is not an unreasonable construction, and since it is an interpretation by the court below of its own rules, it will not be departed from here. Under regulations such as those contained in these rules, it no doubt would be within the power of the court which formulated them to extend the period for filing defendant\u2019s plea, answer and abstract of title, even though the original time prescribed for that purpose had already expired (Dolan v. Boott Cotton Mills, 185 Mass. 576, 70 N. E. 1025; and see Lance v. Bonnell, 105 Pa. 46, 47); but appellant asked no such indulgence, and, under the circumstances, the court was within its right in striking off the pleadings, \u2014 filed long after the thirty-day period named in its rules had expired, \u2014 and in entering judgment against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">After proceeding as above stated, the court below treated appellant\u2019s answer as though it were a petition to open judgment by default, and considered the case from that standpoint; we shall do likewise. But since appellant expressly stood in the court below, and stands here, on the averments of his answer as written, not suggesting any desire to amend, his rights must be judged accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The common source of title to the land in dispute is James Keiper, who, with his wife, conveyed the property to plaintiff, on June 8, 1923, by a deed duly recorded. Defendant, who admittedly is in possession of the land, averred in his answer that, \u201con or about April 2, 1912,\u201d James Keiper gave the property to him \u201cby parol,\u201d and that he, \u201cat the request of the said James Keiper, went into possession of said tract and has continued in possession since, made improvements on said land, repairing and improving the dwelling house and outbuildings, clearing the land, planting trees, at great expense to the defendant, the value of which cannot now be accurately computed.\u201d He averred also that, on February 3, 1920, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>\u201cpending improvements to the said land,\u201d Keiper, \u201cin consideration of the improvements to be made at that time,\u201d executed and delivered to defendant his, the said James Keiper\u2019s, will, providing, inter alia, as follows: \u201cI devise to my son, Rufus Keiper and his wife, Mary, the farm......on which they now reside [being the premises here in controversy] in fee simple.\u201d Finally, appellant averred that the \u201cconsideration of said gift was natural love and affection and that the improvements were made in reliance on the said parol gift and on the said will.\u201d It should be noted that James Keiper is still alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">When examining the above answer, we must bear in mind that judgment by default was properly entered against defendant, and the answer is looked upon as though it were a petition to open the judgment; its averments are to be considered in this light, \u2014 not as though they were contained in an ordinary pleading, which the court should give an opportunity to amend before entering judgment. So viewing them, the court below concluded that they did not present facts which, if proved, would entitle defendant to judgment in his favor. In its opinion disposing of the case, the court, in substance, correctly states: There are no facts in dispute, so far as the pleadings indicate; they show a legal title in the plaintiff, prima facie entitling him to recover. Defendant avers, and thereby offers to prove, a prior parol gift, forbidden by the statute of frauds, with possession taken and held for twelve years, but not alleged to have been taken under the contract of gift, immediately after it was made, or to be exclusive; although these qualities are essential to his case: Hart v. Carroll, 85 Pa. 508, 510; Wright v. Nulton, 219 Pa. 253, 257; Wells v. Potts, 230 Pa. 6, 8. On this point, the answer contains nothing more than a statement that \u201cdefendant, at the request of the said James Keiper, went into possession of said tract, and has continued in possession since\u201d; not only is the averment silent as to the charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>ter of the possession, but the will of defendant\u2019s father, which is the only evidence tendered to show the character of possession contemplated by the parties to the alleged gift, purports to devise the land to defendant and his wife by the entireties, thus contradicting the idea of a continued exclusive possession by defendant. Defendant avers improvements made by him, but not alleged to be permanent and of a nature which would add to the value of the land; though both of these features are required to take a case out of the statute of frauds: Wack v. Sorber, 2 Whart. 387, 392. Again, he fails to aver that these improvements are of a kind which cannot be compensated for in damages, though that also is an essential item of proof (Postlethwaite v. Frease, 31 Pa. 472, 474; Lord\u2019s App., 105 Pa. 451, 459); and there is no averment that they are of a kind for which an occupant could not be reimbursed through profits derived from the land, though this likewise is required by the authorities to take a case out of the statute: Hart v. Carroll, 85 Pa. 508, 510; Lord\u2019s App., supra; Wright v. Nulton, 219 Pa. 253, 257. To meet these last-mentioned requirements, the answer alleges simply that defendant \u201cmade improvements on said land, repairing and improving the dwelling house and outbuildings, clearing the land, planting trees, at great expense to defendant, the value of which cannot now be accurately computed.\u201d As to this, the court below well says: \u201cRepairing and improving a dwelling house or outbuildings are such improvements as any tenant for a term of years might make, and do not in anywise add to the permanent value of the land\u201d; and, quoting from McKowen v. McDonald, 43 Pa. 441, 444, it added: \u201cThe clearing and fencing land, the erection of farm buildings, the planting of an orchard \u2014 these are very common and familiar objects of valuation. What his labor was worth beyond the fair rental of the place, would be an easier question for a jury than many questions habitually committed to them.\u201d True, defendant shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>the written memorandum in form of a will, but this, as before said, devises the land to two persons as tenants by entireties, thus contradicting his prior averment of a parol gift to himself, alone, in fee, \u2014 a feature of the case which will be discussed at greater length toward the end of this opinion. Defendant does not state where the gift was made, or that the parties were together at the time of the alleged contract; which latter is an essential item of proof in such cases: Ackerman v. Fisher, supra; Dill v. Westbrook, 226 Pa. 217, 225. Finally still viewing defendant\u2019s averments as though they were offers of proof, the court below rightly remarks: \u201cWhile in the case of a valid gift perfected by delivery, want of consideration is immaterial (Smith\u2019s Est., 144 Pa. 428, 435), even a father does not, as a rule, divest himself of his property without some terms or conditions [Breniman v. Breniman, 281 Pa. 304, 306; Ackerman v. Fisher, 57 Pa. 457; Wright v. Nulton, 219 Pa. 258].\u201d The court then very properly concludes its opinion with the statement that, even though all the averments of the answer were sustained by proper evidence showing the facts alleged therein, it would, nevertheless, \u201chave to say to the jury defendant had not established his claim of a parol gift\u201d; for, in order to take a parol contract for the transfer of land out of the operation of the statute of frauds, on the grounds here relied on, many things would have to be shown which are lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-4\">While the improvements made by defendant may entitle him to recover damages in a proper proceeding, to the extent of their value, \u201cless a fair rental for occupancy\u201d (McKowen v. McDonald, 43 Pa. 441, 444; Bentfield v. Hastenteufel, 283 Pa. 264, 269), they, as already stated, are not of a character to take this case out of the statute. As said in the McKowen Case, supra, \u201cThe maintenance of the statute of frauds as a rule of property is a matter of great public concern; in upholding it with a firm hand, we are sometimes grieved to be obliged to disappoint the expectations of a [member of a] fam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ily, but, when we reflect that the law does not suffer labor spent in improvements to go unrewarded, and that its demand for some note in writing to evidence a bargain for real estate is not an unreasonable or oppressive exaction, the [apparent] hardship [of such cases] dwindles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">To return to the subject of the alleged will and its efficacy as a memorandum in writing under the statute of frauds: In the words of the court below, \u201cApparently recognizing the weakness or want of title in himself under the parol gift of April 2, 1912, defendant...... sets up an entirely new and different claim,\u201d alleging that James Keiper, in consideration of improvements to be made, executed and delivered to defendant, on February 3, 1920, a will devising to him and his wife the land in question. There are instances where a will may be irrevocable, sufficient to vest an equitable title in the devisee, and may be \u201cdeemed a contract in writing within the statute of frauds\u201d (Johnson v. McCue, 34 Pa. 180); such a will is \u201cadmissible in evidence during the lifetime of the testator\u201d: Smith v. Tuit, 127 Pa 341. To come within the rule of these authorities, however, the will must be shown to be a part of a contract between the testator and the devisee (Johnson v. McCue, supra, 182; Wright v. Nulton, 219 Pa. 253) and must conform to the terms of the alleged agreement: Fuller v. Fuller, 219 Pa. 163. In the present case, as already pointed out, the facts averred by appellant are not sufficient to prove such a contract as he relies on. Moreover, since appellant avers a parol gift of the land in controversy to him, which he states took place \u201con or about the second day of April, 1912,\u201d a memorandum in writing showing a gift to him and his wife, as tenants by the entireties, not to take effect until the death of the testator, at which time appellant himself may not be alive, is insufficient either to prove the contract alleged or to satisfy the statute of frauds: see Whitehead v. Carr, 5 Watts 368; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>McCue v. Johnston, 25 Pa. 306; Smith v. Tuit, supra; see also Wright v. Nulton, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">When, as here, defendant sets up a parol contract of gift to defeat his alleged donor\u2019s subsequent deed to plaintiff, and depends upon the will of a living man and on other facts to prove his claim and take it out of the statute of frauds, the facts offered for these purposes must be such as to meet the requirements laid down in our cases. After considering the relevant authorities, some of which are cited in this opinion, we agree with the court below that, should defendant prove all the facts alleged in his answer, he could not defeat plaintiff\u2019s title by deed from James Keiper; hence this appeal can, not succeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
