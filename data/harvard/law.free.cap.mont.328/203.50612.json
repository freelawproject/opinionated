We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in upholding a final administrative decision which concluded that the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services (DPHHS or Department) was entitled to repayment of $4,593.96 in fees that had been paid to Kirchner by the Montana Medicaid Program (Medicaid).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b228-12\">\u00b63 Kirchner is a licensed professional counselor who has been providing services for Medicaid clients since 1992. After providing such services, Kirchner seeks payment from the Montana Medicaid Program which is administered by the DPHHS. Medicaid providers must follow specific billing procedures when submitting claims to the Department for payment. Kirchner does not dispute that she is required to bill for her services in accordance with the specific billing procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">\u00b64 One element of the billing process requires providers to identify each medical procedure they perform for each patient by assigning a pre-determined \u201ccode\u201d number to the procedure. For example, for the type of work Kirchner performs, there is a specific code number for individual therapy and a different code number for group therapy. Prior to July 1, 1999, Medicaid providers were required to bill using \u2018local codes.\u201d Local codes were billed in 15-minute increments, meaning a provider could bill multiple units to a single patient in a given day depending upon the amount of time spent with the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>\u00b65 On July 1, 1999, new DPHHS rules were implemented. These rules required Medicaid providers seeking payment for services to begin using a national coding system. These national codes describing different kinds of medical procedures were published in a manual entitled Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT. All Medicaid providers were supplied with a Medicaid Provider Handbook that explained how to process a claim. Significantly, the new CPT codes relevant to Kirchner\u2019s practice were designated as \u201cper visit\u201d as opposed to per 15-minute intervals, as before. Thus the new codes categorized billing by the specific procedure performed, and <em>not </em>the amount of time spent performing it. The Department therefore maintains that under the new codes, only one unit of service could be billed per patient per day, regardless of the amount of time the provider spent with the patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b66 Kirchner asserts that when the system changed, she did not understand how to bill under the CPT codes for sessions that ran more than one hour. She states that she called Consultec (later renamed ACS), the fiscal agent for DPHHS to whom she submitted her claims, and requested assistance. Kirchner maintains that a representative of Consultec instructed her to bill one unit for an hour-long session, and bill a second unit if the session lasted more than an hour, even if it did not run a full two hours. Subsequently, Kirchner billed the Medicaid Program in accordance with Consultec\u2019s instructions. At times she billed two units of service for the codes in questions, and at other times, as many as four and five units of service per patient per day, based on the amount of time she spent with the patient. In January 2001, Kirchner stopped billing for more than one unit of service per patient per day because she learned that the Department considered such multiple unit billing to be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b67 During the relevant time period, Kirchner submitted her claims and was paid by DPHHS. DPHHS typically pays claims on an \u201cas submitted\u201d basis and later audits those payments for correctness. <em>See Juro\u2019s United Drug v. Public Health, </em>2004 MT 117, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 167, \u00b6 20, 90 P.3d 388, \u00b6 20. Subsequently, during the Department\u2019s audit of Medicaid provider claims submitted between July 1, 1999, through June 30, 2002, the Department discovered Kirchner\u2019s improperly billed claims and notified her that she had erroneously overbilled the Montana Medicaid Program in the amount of $4,593.96. \u00b68 Kirchner did not contest the Department\u2019s calculations, but rather disputed the DPHHS\u2019s position that her billing was wrong. She requested an Administrative Review which was held by telephone in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>mid-January 2003. The subsequent Administrative Determination upheld the DPHHS\u2019s demand for repayment. In accordance with applicable regulations, Kirchner then sought a Fair Hearing which was held on March 18, 2003. At the conclusion of the hearing and after reviewing the parties\u2019 proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Hearings Officer upheld the Department\u2019s determination that Kirchner had overbilled the Medicaid Program. In his Decision, the Hearings Officer failed to make certain factual findings requested by Kirchner, leading Kirchner to request review with the Montana Board of Public Assistance (BPA). In August 2003, the BPA adopted the Hearings Officer\u2019s May 5,2003, Decision. Kirchner then sought review of the decision by the District Court. On May 5, 2004, the District Court affirmed the BPA\u2019s Decision. Kirchner filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b69 The relevant portion of the applicable standard of review is set forth in the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA) at \u00a72-4-704, MCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">(2) The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-8\">(iv) affected by other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-9\">(v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-10\">(b) findings of fact, upon issues essential to the decision, were not made although requested.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-11\">\u00b610 This Court will review a state agency\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation of law is correct. <em>Seven Up Pete Venture v. Mont., </em>2005 MT 146, \u00b6 58, 327 Mont. 306, \u00b6 58, 114 P.3d 1009, \u00b6 58 (internal citations omitted). Likewise, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>State v. Tichenor, </em>2002 MT 311, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 95, \u00b6 18, 60 P.3d 454, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-12\">\u00b611 Kirchner argues, pursuant to \u00a7 2-4-704(2)(b), MCA, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>District Court erred by not overturning the Hearings Officer\u2019s Decision for his failure to adopt certain of Kirchner\u2019s proposed findings. Additionally, she maintains that the District Court misapplied the holding in <em>State v. Vainio, </em>2001 MT 220, 306 Mont. 439, 35 P.3d 948. Lastly, Kirchner avers that the District Court erred in upholding the Hearings Officer\u2019s admission of Consultec\u2019s telephone logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b612 The crux of Kirchner\u2019s argument is that she should not be responsible for the overbilling because: 1) there was nothing in writing from the DPHHS or Consultec notifying her that billing more than one hour under the codes was not permitted; and 2) the Department should be estopped from seeking repayment because an employee of Consultec orally advised her she could bill more than one hour per patient per day and she received a letter from Randy Poulsen, Chief of the Department\u2019s Mental Health Services Bureau, stating that nothing expressly prohibited a therapist from spending more than one hour with a patient under the CPT codes.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b613 At her Fair Hearing, Kirchner cross-examined three of the State\u2019s witnesses: one DPHHS employee and two Consultec employees. She elicited testimony that during the period in question, there was nothing in writing from the Department or its agent, Consultec, to state that billing more than one hour under these codes was impermissible. As a result of this testimony, Kirchner proposed the following Findings of Fact, among others, to the Hearings Officer:</p>\n<p id=\"AP2U\">\u00b614 5. On cross-examination, Ms. Higgins [Compliance Specialist for DPHHS], testified that for the period in question from July, 1999 through January, 2001, there was nothing in writing from the State or its agent, Consultec, to state that billing more than one hour under these codes was impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b615 7. On cross-examination, Ms. Brandt [Registered Health Information Administrator for ACS] testified that for the period in question July, 1999 through January, 2001, there was nothing in writing from the State or its agent, Consultec, to state that billing more than one hour under these codes was impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"A6_\">\u00b616 12. On cross-examination, Ms. Hance [Deputy Accounts Manager for Consultec/ACS] testified that for the period in question July, 1999 through January, 2001, there was nothing in writing from the State or its agent, Consultec, to state that billing more than one hour under these circumstances was impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b617 Kirchner maintains that because there was no evidence in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>record to contradict the above-recited testimony of witnesses Higgins, Brandt and Hance, the Hearings Officer should have adopted these findings and failure to do so was reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b618 The Hearings Officer, however, determined that the more relevant testimony presented by the Department\u2019s expert, Ms. Brandt, was the Department\u2019s <em>interpretation of </em>the relevant CPT codes. Brandt explained that, with the exception of one unrelated code, the relevant codes were \u201cper visit\u201d codes and could only be properly billed for one unit of service per patient per day. In his Decision, the Hearings Officer noted that Brandt\u2019s interpretation was supported by an article in the Summer 1992 issue of\u2018CPT Assistant,\u201da guide published by the American Medical Association, that discussed and clarified coding issues and answered provider questions regarding proper use of CPT codes. Observing that Kirchner had provided no expert testimony to refute this interpretation, the Officer concluded that the Department\u2019s interpretation was a \u201creasonable\u201d one. As a result, he sustained the Department\u2019s ruling in accordance with <em>State Personnel v. Investigators, </em>2002 MT 46, 308 Mont. 365, 43 P.3d 305. In <em>State Personnel, </em>we held that an agency\u2019s interpretation of its rule is afforded great weight, and the court should defer to that interpretation unless it is \u201cplainly inconsistent\u201d with the spirit of the rule. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the rule will be sustained so long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b619 Kirchner argued to the District Court that the Department should have put its agency interpretation in writing. She relied for this argument upon our decision in <em>Vainio. </em>However, <em>Vainio </em>is inapposite. At issue in that case were certain informal Medicaid \u201cpolicies\u201d that the defendant had been criminally convicted of violating. Vainio successfully argued on appeal that a criminal conviction could not be based upon the violation of these \u201cpolicies\u201d because they had never been formally promulgated pursuant to MAPA. Here, by contrast, the national DPHHS billing rules under which Kirchner was assessed for reimbursement have not been challenged. Thus, the rules themselves are presumptively valid. The question Kirchner presents, and which the District Court rejected, is whether the Department\u2019s <em>interpretation of </em>the CPT codes should have been in writing and adopted pursuant to MAPA. This issue was not before us in <em>Vainio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">\u00b620 As to Kirchner\u2019s assertion that a Departmental <em>interpretation </em>must be in writing, the State notes that under \u00a72-4-102(13)(b), MCA, an agency <em>may </em>adopt an interpretive rule under MAPA but is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>required to do so. Additionally, the State counters that the absence of written instructions expressly informing Kirchner that she could not be reimbursed for billing more than one unit of service under a particular code for a given client on a given day is irrelevant. This is so, the State argues, because the Department is statutorily entitled to recover overpayments \u201cregardless of whether the incorrect payment was the result of Department or provider error or other cause.\u201d Section 53-6-lll(2)(a)(i), MCA; Rule 37.85.406(10)(a), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b621 Section 53-6-lll(2)(a)(i), MCA, unequivocally states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-5\">(2) (a) The department is entitled to collect from a provider, and a provider is hable to the department for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-6\">(i) the amount of a payment under this part to which the provider was not entitled, regardless of whether the incorrect payment was the result of department or provider error or other cause; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b622 Montana Administrative Rule 37.85.406(10)(a) further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj3\">The department is entitled to recover... any payment to which the provider was not entitled, regardless of whether the payment was the result of department or provider error, or other cause, and without proving that the provider submitted an improper or erroneous claim knowingly, intentionally, or with intent to defraud.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-8\"><em>See also Juro\u2019s United Drug, </em>\u00b6 21, quoting verbatim \u00a753-6-lll(2)(a)(i), MCA, and holding that Juro\u2019s must reimburse the Department for overpaid \u201cdelivery fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">\u00b623 In <em>Juro\u2019s, </em>as in the case at bar, after paying Juro\u2019s submitted claims, the Department subsequently conducted an audit and determined that Juro\u2019s had improperly billed the Program and was erroneously paid under the relevant Medicaid code. The DPHHS sought repayment of approximately $10,000.00. The Department\u2019s conclusion was based on regulatory language the meaning of which was a matter of dispute between Juro\u2019s and the Department. The District Court affirmed the decision of the Hearings Officer and the BPA, concluding that the Department\u2019s interpretation of the rule was \u201creasonable and not inconsistent with\u201d the applicable rule. We affirmed the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">\u00b624 Kirchner argues that <em>Juro\u2019s </em>is inapplicable because it stands for the proposition that an individual cannot profit from a payment to which he or she is not entitled. She maintains that the State has not argued that she did not do the work for which she was paid, but only that she billed incorrectly for the work performed; therefore she is \u201centitled\u201d to payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>\u00b625 Section 53-6-lll(2)(a)(i), MCA, Rule 37.85.406(10)(a), ARM, and <em>Juro\u2019s </em>all expressly indicate that the Department may seek reimbursement from a provider who Vas not entitled\u201d to a Medicaid payment. Therefore, Kirchner\u2019s argument against the applicability of <em>Juro\u2019s </em>likewise would apply to the applicability of the statute and the regulation. \u2018Entitled\u201d simply means \u201cto furnish with a right or claim to.\u201d American Heritage Dictionary, Fourth Edition, 2000. Under the Department\u2019s interpretation of its rule, providers are authorized to bill the Medicaid Program under the medical codes relevant to Kirchner\u2019s claim for only one unit of service per patient per day. Therefore, such providers are \u201centitled\u201d to payment from the DPHHS for only one unit of service per patient per day. Kirchner accurately states that there is nothing in writing to prohibit her from spending more than one hour with a patient per day. She is, of course, free to do so. However, under the Department\u2019s interpretation of its rules, she may be paid by the Medicaid program for only the amount of time considered to be \u201cone unit\u201d of service per patient per day. As stated above, the District Court concluded that the DPHHS\u2019s interpretation of the CPT codes was \u201creasonable and not inconsistent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b626  This Court has long held that an \u201cagency\u2019s interpretation of its rule is afforded great weight, and the court should defer to that interpretation unless it is \u2018plainly inconsistent\u2019 with the spirit of the rule. The agency\u2019s interpretation of the rule will be sustained so long as it lies within the range of reasonable interpretation permitted by the wording.\u201d <em>Easy v. Dept. of Natural Res. &amp; Conserv. </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 306, 309, 752 P.2d 746, 748 (internal citations omitted). In the case at bar, both the Hearings Officer and the District Court concluded that the Department\u2019s interpretation of its rule was \"reasonable and not inconsistent with\u201d the applicable rule. Kirchner has presented nothing to convince us that a contrary conclusion should be reached. Because the Department\u2019s interpretation of the CPT codes was reasonable, Kirchner is not entitled to payment for the overbilled services under \u00a7 53-6-111(2)(a)(i), MCA, and Rule 37.85.406(10)(a), ARM, and is liable to the Department for reimbursement of the overpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b627  Under these circumstances we conclude that the factual findings proposed by Kirchner were irrelevant in light of the applicable law, and the Hearings Officer\u2019s failure to adopt them was not error. From the record provided us, we further conclude that the factual findings that were adopted by the Hearings Officer were adequately supported by the evidence, and were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u00b628 Finally, Kirchner maintains in the alternative that the Department should be estopped from seeking reimbursement from her because she justifiably relied upon an oral instruction from a Consultec employee that she could bill more than one unit per patient per day. In this connection, she asserts that the Hearings Officer improperly admitted and considered evidence, and improperly shifted the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\"><em>\u00b629 </em>At Kirchner\u2019s Fair Hearing, the Hearings Officer analyzed the merits of Kirchner\u2019s estoppel claim. In doing so, the Officer admitted over Kirchner\u2019s objection the telephone logs of Consultec, which had been offered to refute Kirchner\u2019s claim that a Consultec representative had authorized her by phone to bill in the manner she did. Kirchner argues on appeal that the admission of the telephone logs was error, as was the Hearings Officer\u2019s and the ensuing District Court\u2019s conclusion that the doctrine of equitable estoppel did not apply. We decline to disturb these conclusions because ultimately they were unnecessary to the District Court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b630 At the core of Kirchner\u2019s estoppel claim is her contention that the Department\u2019s Consultec agent gave her false information, upon which she relied to her detriment. However, the fact remains that \u00a7 53-6-lll(2)(a)(i), MCA, and Rule 37.85.406(10)(a), ARM, expressly authorize the Department to collect from a provider an unentitled payment, <em>regardless of whether the incorrect payment was the result of department or provider error, or other cause. </em>See \u00b6\u00b6 21-22 above. Even if Kirchner could establish that the information given to her was incorrect, this amounts at best to Department error, and Department error is not a bar to a claim for reimbursement. Because Kirchner would be unable to avoid either the plain meaning or the consequences of the statute and administrative rule even if she succeeded in proving she was given bad information, it was unnecessary for the Hearings Officer or the court to reach the merits of the estoppel argument, and it is likewise unnecessary for us to review those merits here.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b631 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b235-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
