The District Court appointed Tim Elizabeth\u2019s temporary guardian by Order issued on the same day. Shortly thereafter, Elizabeth and Deane Sadler (Deane), Elizabeth\u2019s brother, both filed written objections to Tim\u2019s appointment as temporary guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">\u00b66 The parties eventually entered into a settlement agreement, dated July 11, 2000, by which they agreed to the establishment of a guardianship and two limited conservatorships for Elizabeth. In particular, the parties agreed that Deane would serve as her limited guardian, with powers and duties as specified pursuant to \u00a772-5-321, MCA, and would also serve as the conservator of that portion of her assets which were located outside the State of Montana. Tim, for his part, would serve as the conservator of her Montana property. The District Court approved the agreement by Order issued on the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-14\">\u00b67 Conflict between the parties continued, however, now centering around what Elizabeth and Deane claimed to be Tim\u2019s failure to disclose certain financial documents related to his administration of Elizabeth\u2019s Montana estate. This conflict eventuated in the aforementioned \u2018Petition for Removal of Conservator of the Montana Property of Elizabeth Saylor and Appointment of Successor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Conservator and Complaint for Breach of Fiduciary Duty,\u201d which Elizabeth, her estate, and Deane<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> caused to be filed on July 5, 2002. Elizabeth and Deane alleged that Tim had failed to keep Elizabeth reasonably informed concerning his administration of Elizabeth\u2019s Montana estate in response to her reasonable request, in violation of \u00a7 72-34-124 and 125, MCA, fiduciary duties imposed upon him by \u00a7 72-5-423, MCA. They further alleged that Tim had breached his duties to administer the conservatorship solely in Elizabeth\u2019s interest, \u00a772-34-103, MCA; to avoid a conflict of interest in administering the conservatorship, \u00a772-34-105, MCA; to take reasonable steps under the circumstances to take and keep control of and to preserve the conservatorship property, \u00a7 72-34-107, MCA; to make the conservatorship property productive, \u00a7 72-34-108, MCA; and to properly administer the estate pursuant to \u00a7 72-34-114(1) and (2), MCA (2001), all duties which \u00a7 72-5-423, MCA, likewise made incumbent upon him. Tim filed a response to the petition on July 23, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">\u00b68 The District Court conducted a hearing on the petition on September 4, 2003, and dismissed it by Order dated November 12, 2003. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">\u00b69 We will introduce further facts as they become relevant to the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">\u00b610 We review a trial court\u2019s determinations of law <em>de novo. Matter of Conservatorship of Kovatch </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 323, 326, 896 P.2d 444, 446. We typically review a trial court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Kovatch, </em>271 Mont. at 326, 896 P.2d at 446. A finding of fact is clearly erroneous if substantial evidence does not support it, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if, after reviewing the record, this Court is left with a firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Eschenbacher v. Anderson, </em>2001 MT 206, \u00b6 22, 306 Mont. 321, \u00b6 22, 34 P.3d 87, \u00b6 22 (citing <em>Interstate Production Credit v. DeSaye </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 320, 323, 820 P.2d 1285, 1287). However, we refined the clearly erroneous test when considering accountings submitted for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>conservatorships by holding that an accounting must be accurate, complete, and verifiable. <em>Matter of Estate of Clark </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 179, 184, 772 P.2d 299, 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">\u00b611 <em>Did the District Court err by holding that Tim. had not breached his fiduciary duties as conservator of Elizabeth\u2019s Montana property ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">\u00b612 We first address Tim\u2019s argument that Elizabeth has failed to assert proper grounds for removing him as conservator. Tim claims that she has not argued according to the standard for removal of a conservator, set forth at \u00a772-5-414, MCA, despite alleging breaches on his part of the aforementioned fiduciary duties. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">\u00b613 Section 72-5-414, MCA, reads, in relevant part: \u2018The court may remove a conservator for <em>good cause\u201d </em>(emphasis added). The statute itself does not define \u201cgood cause\u201d for the specific purpose of conservator removal, nor have we had occasion to interpret the phrase expressly in our previous opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">\u00b614 [1] Section 72-5-423, MCA, provides that, \u201c[i]n the exercise of his powers, a conservator is to act as a fiduciary and shall observe the standards of care applicable to trustees.\u2019Tn <em>Redies v. Cosner, </em>2002 MT 86, \u00b6 37, 309 Mont. 315, \u00b6 37, 48 P.3d 697, \u00b6 37, we interpreted the phrase \u201cstandards of care applicable to trustees\u201d in \u00a772-5-423, MCA, as meaning \u201cduties of trustees\u201d as set forth in Title 72, Chapter 34, Part 1, Montana Code Annotated. We also interpreted \u00a7 72-5-423, MCA, as imposing these duties on conservators. Conservators are thus under the same duties as trustees.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">\u00b615 Section 72-33-618(2)(a) through (d), MCA, provides four specific grounds on which a court may remove a trustee. Section 72-33-618(2)(e), MCA, then provides in the alternative that the court may remove the trustee \u2018for <em>other </em>good cause\u201d (emphasis added). Thus, the legislature has defined \u201cgood cause,\u201d at least for the purposes of trustee removal, as including grounds (a) through (d) of \u00a772-33-618(2). Ground (a) is \u2018if the trustee has committed a breach of the trust[.]\u201d Section 72-33-618(2)(a). Thus, \u201cgood cause\u201d exists for a court to remove a trustee if it finds that the trustee has breached the trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">\u00b616 \u2018Except to the extent that the common law rules governing trusts are modified by statute, the common law as to trusts is the law of this state.\u201dSection 72-33-103, MCA. According to the Restatement (Second) of Trusts, an authoritative summary of the common law of trusts, \u201c[a] breach of trust is a violation by the trustee of any duty which as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>trustee he owes to the beneficiary.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 201 (1959). As noted above, these duties are set forth in Title 72, Chapter 34, Part 1, Montana Code Annotated. Thus, by breaching any of these duties, the trustee provides good cause for a court to remove him. <em>See </em>\u00a7 72-33-618(2)(a); Restatement (Second) of Trusts \u00a7 201 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\">\u00b617 Since conservators are under the same duties as trustees, and since the nature of their responsibilities is cognate with that of trustees, we conclude likewise that when a conservator breaches the duties, set forth by Title 72, Chapter 34, Part 1, Montana Code Annotated (Duties of Trustees), which \u00a772-5-423, MCA, imposes upon him, he gives a court good cause to remove him as conservator. Therefore, by alleging the various breaches of fiduciary duties, <em>see </em>\u00b6 7 above, Elizabeth has alleged (though, as we hold, not established) good cause for Tim\u2019s removal as conservator.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">\u00b618 Specifically, Elizabeth claims that Tim has breached his fiduciary duties by leasing certain real property, part of Elizabeth\u2019s Montana conservatorship assets, to his brother Pat Saylor (Pat) on terms which yield Elizabeth and her estate no financial benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">\u00b619 As the settlement agreement of July 11,2000, established Deane\u2019s powers and duties as limited guardian, so also did it specify Tim\u2019s powers and duties as conservator of Elizabeth\u2019s Montana estate, among which powers was the power to lease the real property for agricultural purposes. This property, approximately 690 acres in Teton County, is known to the parties as \u2018Glen Willow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">\u00b620 The lease which Tim entered into with Pat for Glen Willow provides in relevant part for a five-year lease term, with annual rent of $14,960.00, calculated by multiplying 220 head of cattle by $17.00 per animal-unit-month. Pat agreed to till and farm in a good and husband-like manner according to the best farming practices, and to furnish all equipment, seed, fertilizer, labor, and all the other costs of farming operations. In return, Pat was entitled to 100% of the crops, and to graze cattle on the land once the crop has been removed. Furthermore, the lease required Pat to maintain the property, pay all the taxes owing thereon, and keep insurance totalling no less than $500,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">\u00b621 The rent owing was subject to two offsets. For use of the irrigation system which Pat had purchased and installed on the property, he was to receive $12,000.00 annually. Pat also was to be compensated in the amount of $3,000.00 per year for maintaining the residence in a condition suitable for Elizabeth\u2019s return. These two offsets together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>eliminated the rent which Pat nominally owed under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">\u00b622 All parties agree that the irrigation system has not been used for several years, but that Pat nonetheless continues to receive the associated $12,000.00 annual credit towards his rental obligation. Thus, not only does the lease provide no material benefit to the estate Elizabeth claims, but actually costs Elizabeth $12,000.00 each year that it is in effect. Tim admitted during testimony, furthermore, that the credit amounts were essentially fabricated <em>ex nihilo </em>in order to cancel Pat\u2019s monetary obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">\u00b623 Tim justifies the lease, in part, on the grounds that it memorialized the less formal arrangement for the upkeep and maintenance of Glen Willow which dated to 1977, when Pat began tending to the property for his father Fred Saylor (now deceased) and Elizabeth, Fred\u2019s wife. The District Court so found, and based its conclusions of law, in part, on this finding of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u00b624 Were this the only, or even the chief, basis upon which the District Court affirmed the lease, as Elizabeth claims it to be, our case law would constrain us to rule that the District Court had committed clear error. <em>Clark </em>stands, <em>inter alia, </em>for the principle that any arrangement between a present conservator and the protected person which subsisted prior to the imposition of the conservatorship does not necessarily determine the standard of care which the conservator owes, particularly if the continuance of such arrangement under the new regime would cause detriment to the estate which it is the conservator\u2019s duty to preserve and to make productive. <em>Clark, </em>237 Mont. at 184-85, 772 P.2d at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">\u00b625 The District Court ruled, rather, that the lease relieved the estate of the expense of maintaining the property, and reflected the economic reality that Glen Willow was unprofitable as an agricultural endeavor. Supporting this determination is substantial testimony which tended to establish that leafy spurge, a controllable but virtually ineradicable noxious weed, has infested the property for at least the last forty years. The District Court also heard substantial testimony to the effect that the gravelly nature of the soil renders the property difficult to irrigate, thus further reducing the land\u2019s potential crop yield.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\u00b626 [2] Elizabeth\u2019s expert proferred a model lease which he had formulated after a survey of the property, which estimated its lease value to the estate at approximately <em>$31,500.00per annum. </em>Given the aforementioned testimony, we hold that the District Court did not err in finding that this model lease was unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">\u00b627 We do not, moreover, find in Pat\u2019s admission that he profits from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>his operations at Glen Willow the sinister import which Elizabeth does. It was established during Pat\u2019s testimony that, though he cannot market the hay which he grows on Glen Willow due to the infestation of leafy spurge, he is able to sell more of the hay which he grows on his own property because he feeds his own cattle with the Glen Willow hay. Leasing conservatorship real property is a prime method of deriving profit from it, and procuring maintenance for it, to the benefit of the estate. As one noted commentator has observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-4\">The power to lease is generally a necessary incident of the management of trust real property. If the trustee is to hold real estate and has the usual duty to make the trust property productive, he can generally obtain profits from it only by leasing it to others, since he would not normally be permitted or expected to engage in business and obtain profit from the land directly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AC9\">George T. Bogert, Trusts \u00a7 139 (6th ed. 1987). It would be difficult to attract lessees of trust, or, as here, conservatorship, property if the courts denied them the right to take profit from the property which they lease. The fact that Glen Willow could not yield the estate in excess of what was reasonably necessary to recompense Pat is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">\u00b628  Thus, on the facts here, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it concluded that Tim exercised reasonable judgment regarding the lease arrangement, and did not breach his duty as conservator so as to require his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">\u00b629 As we noted in \u00b6 22 above, however, Tim conceded during testimony that the sums with which the lease credited Pat as offsets to his rent obligation answered to no actual calculation. We simply cannot countenance such a course of action. Though we accept the District Court\u2019s essential determination, that this lease arrangement is the best that could be obtained for the estate, given the realities of the situation, and that Tim has not abused his position as conservator to Elizabeth\u2019s detriment, the formalities imposed on the conservatorship must be respected. The conservator must shun even the appearance of impropriety, an appearance which the procedure followed in the present case could not help but foster in Elizabeth\u2019s mind. We therefore remand to the District Court, with the instruction that it order an audit of the lease arrangement to be performed. This will enable the District Court to require the lease to be reformed in such a way that its figures will conform more closely to actualities. This will also subject the lease arrangement, the crux of this dispute, to the more searching scrutiny of the District Court, which will be free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>to revise its prior determinations should such scrutiny bring to light facts which do not appear in the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">\u00b630 The Chief Justice, dissenting, questions our authority to order relief which was not requested of the District Court. We trace our authority to order an audit of the lease to two prime sources: law and equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">\u00b631 Section 72-5-421(3), MCA, vests the District Court with all the powers over Elizabeth\u2019s estate and affairs, except the power to make a will, which she could exercise were she not a protected person. Section 72-5-421(3)(d), MCA, furthermore, provides that those powers include the power to \u201center into contracts.\u201d A lease is a contract. <em>Riis v. Day </em>(1980), 188 Mont. 253, 258, 613 P.2d 696, 699; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 898 (7th ed. 1999). As the District Court can make a lease on behalf of a protected person, so can it order that the lease be audited, as the greater power includes the lesser. In this case, the District Court has chosen to exercise its powers through the conservator, Tim. Section 72-5-421, MCA. As such, the court has the \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to determine how the estate of the protected person which is subject to the laws of this state shall be managed, expended, or distributed to or for the use of the protected person or any of his dependents.\u201d Section 72-5-405(2), MCA. Under the facts of this case there is certainly no legal prohibition for the trial court ordering an audit-indeed, again, given the circumstances in this case, good management would require such an initial step toward requiring Tim to better account of his stewardship and better enable the court to supervise Tim\u2019s discharge of his fiduciary obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\u00b632 Moreover, legal authority aside, equity favors this approach. By claiming that Tim had breached his fiduciary duties, Elizabeth invoked the District Court\u2019s equity jurisdiction, \u00a73-5-302(c), MCA, and, thus, our own on appeal, \u00a73-2-203, MCA. \u201cA court of equity has jurisdiction over an alleged breach, abuse, or betrayal of a duty or obligation arising out of fiduciary ... relations[.]\u201d 30A C.J.S. <em>Equity </em>\u00a759 (1992) (\u2018Fiduciary Rights and Obligations\u2019). This is a point which the Chief Justice fails to acknowledge, as her list of cases, none of which we decided as a court of equity, makes clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">\u00b633 An equity court has the power to grant complete relief. As we held in <em>Blaine Bank of Montana v. Haugen </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 29, 35, 858 P.2d 14, 18: \u2018Courts sitting in equity are empowered to determine all the questions involved in the case and to do complete justice; this includes the power to fashion an equitable result.\u201d We also stated in <em>Reickhoff v. Consolidated Gas Co. </em>(1950), 123 Mont. 555, 568-69, 217 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>P.2d 1076, 1083, that an equity court with jurisdiction over a controversy \u201cmay render final judgment in relation to all matters involved and growing out of that controversy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b634 The core of Elizabeth\u2019s argument was that Tim had granted to his brother Pat a lease which did not reflect the true value of her property, thereby abusing his conservatorship to Pat\u2019s benefit, and her detriment. As support for her argument, she cited Tim\u2019s admission that he made up some of the figures in the lease in order to negate Pat\u2019s rental obligation. This fact became a central question involved in the case, and reflected Tim\u2019s apparent failure to treat the formalities of the fiduciary relationship with the requisite seriousness. Although we affirm the District Court in its finding that Tim has not abused his office, nevertheless, as a court of equity, the trial court, and, in turn this Court, must fashion an equitable remedy-one which, here, is also fully authorized by statut&amp;which resolves all matters involved in and growing out of the controversy between Elizabeth and Tim. We would be remiss in doing less.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b635 Asa practical matter, requiring an audit now with a view to better financial management in the future will head off further litigation. The District Court has continuing jurisdiction over this conservatorship. Section 72-5-405(2), MCA. The lease, with its imaginary figures, will naturally arouse suspicion and invite conflict each time Tim presents his annual accounting. We think it better to lance this boil than to let it fester.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">\u00b636 That the Chief Justice would refuse to do so based on an overly formalistic approach to these sorts of cases is her prerogative. We simply do not agree with that approach.</p>\n<judges id=\"b431-7\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b425-8\"> Deane\u2019s powers and duties as limited guardian were set forth in the Order that established his limited guardianship. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 72-5-305(3) and 316(2), MCA.

I respectfully dissent, however, from the Court\u2019s remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">\u00b638 In this case and most others, the appellant asks this Court to reverse the District Court. Similarly, in this case and most others, the respondent asks us to affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-12\">Here, we properly affirm the District Court on the issue presented by the appellant. That should be the end of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-13\">\u00b639 Instead, the Court decides that it \u201csimply cannot countenance\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>certain other matters it has noted in the record. As a result, it steps outside any relief requested by any party to this appeal and remands to the District Court with instructions that an audit of the lease arrangement be ordered so the District Court can \u201crequire the lease to be reformed in such a way that its figures will conform more closely to actualities\u201d so as to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\">subject the lease arrangement, the crux of this dispute, to the more searching scrutiny of the District Court, which will be free to revise its prior determinations should such scrutiny bring to light facts which do not appear in the record before us.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">As is generally the case when this Court decides that it-rather than the parties or the District CourtTs the appropriate \u201ccase manager\u201d of the case, by stepping away from issues actually before us and making determinations neither sought nor briefed, I strenuously dissent. Moreover, the Court\u2019s action here is even more egregious than is sometimes the case. It not only remands to require the trial court to order an audit, it then clearly expects that court to revisit and revise its prior determinations should the \u201cnew\u201d record suggest the propriety of such a course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b640 I need not discuss at length my reasoning in dissenting from the Court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>and, in my view, inappropriate actions here. I have written far too many concurring and dissenting opinions on this subject over the years to believe I can influence the Court to stop such practices. <em>See, e.g., Arrowhead Sch.

Schell, </em>1999 MT 40, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49-55, 293 Mont. 323, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49-55, 975 P.2d 820, \u00b6\u00b6 47, 49-55 (Gray, J., dissenting); <em>State v. Santos </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 125, 139, 902 P.2d 510, 518 (Gray, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u00b641 Stated briefly, my view of such an action as the Court takes here is that it oversteps our proper role, at least verges on depriving a party of due process, and ignores the important role of the trial courts. Sadly, these actions also, in my view, decrease public trust and confidence in our Court and subject us to oft-stated and sometimes appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>attacks from lawyers, Legislators and others. I simply cannot join in such an action here.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">\u00b642 Have I ever participated in such inappropriate actions by this Court? I may have, although I cannot recall a specific instance. I do recall that, in Worrall, the author of the Court\u2019s opinion there (and here) and I exchanged views about the propriety of this Court raising and resolving issues <em>sua sponte. </em>There, I expressed again my concerns on this subject and observed his statement in concurrence in <em>State v. Zabawa </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 307, 318, 928 P.2d 151, 158, that \u2018\u201c[i]t is our obligation to decide the cases filed in this Court on the basis of the issues and arguments raised by the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6 63 (Gray, J., concurring and dissenting). His response was Tt]hat concurrence still correctly sets forth my view.\u201d <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6 72 (Nelson, J., concurring). He went on, however, to discuss the justification for departing from that \u201cgeneral rule.\u201d <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 72-82 (Nelson, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b643 The problem with looking for exceptions to and justifications for departing from the general rule-that we are an appellate court which is obligated to decide the cases as they come to us-is that it is likely possible to locate such a justification in nearly any case. Indeed, it is not at all uncommon for us-in reviewing cases-to think, \u201cthe lawyer had a winner here but didn\u2019t raise the right issues or arguments.\u201d Nor is it uncommon for us to read transcripts and locate additional issues which, in our view, should have been raised and argued to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"Aes\">\u00b644 It is our practice, however, and appropriately so, to decide the cases before us on the issues properly preserved in the trial courts, and raised and briefed on appeal. To the extent we do so only selectively, we leave ourselves open to the all too common accusation that we are being result-oriented. Under such circumstances, it is an unanswerable accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">\u00b645 The Court\u2019s response to my dissent is simply wrong. First, the Court states that I question this Court\u2019s \u201cauthority\u2019to order relief not requested in the District Court. This is not true. I do not question whether this Court <em>can </em>exercise such authority. It can. As many are aware, this Court <em>can </em>do almost anything a majority of its members decide to do. Indeed, on some occasions, this approach has been called the \u201cgorilla\u201d Court approach. Authority is not at issue here. This dissent (and others before it) questions the wisdom of the Court\u2019s <em>exercise </em>of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b646 Next, the Court cites to various statutes which come nowhere near supporting its decision here to raise and decide an issue <em>sua sponte. </em>The statutes clearly grant <em>district courts </em>certain powers. I have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>quarrel with the statutes; the statutes, however, do not vest those powers in <em>this </em>Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b647 Moreover, I agree with the Court that there is \u2018ho legal prohibition for the trial court ordering an audit....\u201d The problem, of course, is that the <em>trial court </em>in this case did not order an audit. <em>This Court </em>orders the District Court to do so. Two entirely different concepts, indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">\u00b648 As to the Court\u2019s statement that \u201cequity favors this approach,\u201d I could not disagree more. Section 3-2-203, MCA, invoked by the Court in this regard, merely states that the \u201cappellate jurisdiction of the supreme corut extends to all cases at law and in equity.\u201d The statute speaks to our <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction. It does not in any way authorize us to take on the role of a <em>trial </em>court in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">\u00b649 Similarly, while the Court correctly quotes from 30A C. J.S. <em>Equity </em>\u00a759, the quote has no application here. The C. J.S. <em>Equity </em>title has 156 sections. The very first, \u00a7L, is entitled Scope of Title. It states clearly and without equivocation that \u2018tsjubjects which are treated in other titles and <em>not </em>treated in this title include <em>appeals </em>from decrees or orders in equity!.]\u201d 30A C.J.S. <em>Equity </em>\u00a7 1 (emphasis added). Thus, while the Court accuses me of failing to acknowledge some distinction between our proper appellate approach in equity cases, I might suggest that the Court apparently just fails to understand the differences between a trial court\u2019s role and this Court\u2019s role.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\u00b650 Nor do <em>Haugen </em>or <em>Reickhoff </em>provide support for the Court\u2019s action here. No rational person would disagree with the Court\u2019s statement that an equity court has power to grant complete relief. We said so clearly in <em>Haugen, </em>260 Mont. at 35, 858 P.2d at 18. However, <em>Haugen </em>involved our <em>appellate </em>review of a remedy fashioned by a trial court sitting in equity, as raised and argued by the parties to the appeal. We ultimately concluded that the trial court\u2019s remedy was not erroneous. <em>See Haugen, </em>260 Mont. at 35, 858 P.2d at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">\u00b651 Likewise, the Court correctly quotes our statement from <em>Reickhoff </em>to the effect that an equity court may render final judgment with regard to all involved matters. Again, however, the Court fails to notice the context in which we made that statement, which was that both parties to a trial court decision in equity appealed to this Court. <em>Reickhoff, </em>123 Mont. at 556, 217 P.2d at 1077. After addressing the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirmed one portion of the trial\u2019s decree and reversed another, remanding to the trial court only for the entry of judgment in favor of the prevailing party on the reversal. <em>Reickhoff, </em>123 Mont. at 570, 217 P.2d at 1083-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u00b652 The Court may, in its prerogative, perceive my distinction between a trial court and an appellate court, and my urging of restraint, as an \u201coverly formalistic approach to these sorts of cases[.]\u201d If so, so be it.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">\u00b653 I concur in the Court\u2019s opinion on the legal issue before us. I vigorously dissent from its decision to go beyond the issue presented in order to reach what it believes to be a more \u2018fair\u201d result. I would affirm the District Court and end the opinion there.</p>\n<judges id=\"b435-5\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing concurring and dissenting Opinion of CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b435-6\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AID\">concurs and dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\u00b654 I also agree with the Court\u2019s opinion insofar as it addresses the issues before us. I dissent to the order remanding this matter to the District Court for continued proceedings that the parties did not ask for, do not want, are costly, and are wasteful of the time and money of both the conservatorship estate and the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b655 This appellate Court should know better than to unleash the dogs of war. This Court should have the judgment, and the humility, to know that its function is not to decide what people need, or what they want. They are perfectly capable of deciding such for themselves. I join the vigorous dissent of Chief Justice Gray for the reasons she has stated. It is indeed folly to force people to retain lawyers and accountants, and send them into a battle they do not want.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
