We reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Whether the District Court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to try Brockway for Partner or Family Member Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">\u00b63 On May 7,2003, the State charged Brockway by Information with four counts of Partner or Family Member Assault in violation of \u00a745-5-206, MCA (2001). Three of the assaults were alleged to have been committed against Brockway\u2019s girlfriend in December 2002, and one in March 2003. The Information identified the first two counts as misdemeanors and the subsequent counts as felonies.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-10\">\u00b64 Brockway filed a Motion to Sever the charges and a brief in support wherein he argued that having to defend against the felonies at the same time as the misdemeanors violated his constitutional right to due process. He also argued that the misdemeanors should first be tried in Justice Court so that he would have the opportunity to appeal to the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\">\u00b65 A hearing on Brockway\u2019s motion was held on January 14, 2004. Following the hearing, both parties filed briefs. Brockway argued in his brief that original jurisdiction over all misdemeanors lies solely with the justice or city courts. The State argued in its brief that joinder of the charges in this case was proper and that the District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a73-5-302(2)(c), MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-12\">(2) The district court has concurrent original jurisdiction with the justice\u2019s court in the following criminal cases amounting to misdemeanor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b30-13\">(c) misdemeanors resulting from a finding of a lesser included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>offense in a felony or misdemeanor case tried in district court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b31-4\">\u00b66 On March 15, 2004, the District Court issued an Order wherein it concluded that it lacked jurisdiction under \u00a73-5-302, MCA, because the four Partner or Family Member Assault charges were not felonies and the court could not presume convictions on the first two counts of Partner or Family Member Assault to raise the third or fourth count to a felony. Hence, the District Court granted Brockway\u2019s Motion to Sever and remanded the case to Park County Justice Court. In its Order, the District Court also noted its concerns that Brockway would be prejudiced by a joint trial on the charges because the jury would conclude that Brockway was a \u2018bad guy,\u201d especially since the State wanted to introduce evidence of other \u2018bad acts\u201d and an expert on Battered Women\u2019s Syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">\u00b67 The same day the District Court issued its Order granting Brockway\u2019s Motion to Sever, the State filed a Motion to Reconsider, which the District Court denied. The State now appeals the District Court\u2019s Order granting Brockway\u2019s Motion to Sever as well as its Order denying the State\u2019s Motion to Reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">\u00b68 Although the motion before the District Court was entitled a Motion to Sever, in effect, what the District Court granted was a Motion to Dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law and this Court reviews a district corut\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>State v. Tichenor, </em>2002 MT 311, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 95, \u00b6 18, 60 P.3d 454, <em>\u00b6 18 </em>(citing <em>State v. Hocevar, </em>2000 MT 157, \u00b6 115, 300 Mont. 167, \u00b6 115, 7 P.3d 329, \u00b6 115; <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, \u00b6 43, 290 Mont. 58, \u00b6 43, 964 P.2d 713, \u00b6 43).</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">\u00b69 <em>Whether the District Court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to try Brockway for Partner or Family Member Assault. </em>\u00b610 The State argues on appeal that the District Court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to try Brockway for Partner or Family Member Assault because district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with justice courts in misdemeanor cases such as Brockway\u2019s. Hence, the State asks this Court to vacate the District Court\u2019s March 15, 2004 Order which had the effect of dismissing the charges against Brockway.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-10\">\u00b611  While justice courts have jurisdiction of all misdemeanors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>punishable by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or imprisonment not exceeding six months or both, district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with justice courts of all misdemeanors punishable by a fine exceeding $500.00 or imprisonment exceeding six months or both. Sections 3-10-303(l)(a) and (l)(c), MCA. The maximum fine for a first conviction of Partner or Family Member Assault is $1,000.00 and the maximum term of imprisonment is one year. Section 45-5-206(3)(a)(i), MCA. Hence, under \u00a7 3-10-303(l)(c), MCA, district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with justice courts over misdemeanor charges of Partner or Family Member Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">\u00b612 Brockway claims this was a legislative oversight that failed to take into account that the Legislature had increased the maximum amount of fines in nearly all misdemeanors over its past three sessions and, at the same time, it was increasing justice and city court jurisdiction over civil matters to help clear the clutter of civil cases being brought originally in district court. Brockway asserts that the Legislature did not intend to increase the number of original misdemeanor criminal filings in the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">\u00b613 The State responds that Brockway\u2019s speculation that the Legislature did not intend that district courts exercise jurisdiction over misdemeanors with fines exceeding $500.00 is irrelevant. The State correctly points out that the first step in determining legislative intent is to look at the plain language of the statute. \u2018If it is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is necessary.\u201d <em>Merlin Myers Revocable Trust v. Yellowstone County, </em>2002 MT 201, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 194, \u00b6 19, 53 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). In this case, because the language of the statute is clear, we need not look at what the Legislature may or may not have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">\u00b614 The State also points out that the parties and the District Court overlooked \u00a7 3-5-302(l)(d), MCA, which the State argues confers original jurisdiction on the District Court to try both misdemeanor and felony offenses of Partner or Family Member Assault. Section 3-5-302(l)(d), MCA, provides that the district court has original jurisdiction in \u201call cases of misdemeanor not otherwise provided for....\u201d <em>\u00b615 </em>Brockway argues that the State\u2019s characterization of Partner or Family Member Assault as a \u201cmisdemeanor not otherwise provided for\u201d is misplaced and does not confer original jurisdiction with the District Court. Brockway maintains that the jurisdictional grant in \u00a73-5-302(l)(d), MCA, is a reference to specific misdemeanors and was not intended to include original jurisdiction on misdemeanor criminal actions where jurisdiction lies with the Justice Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>\u00b616 Because we have already determined that district courts have concurrent jurisdiction with justice courts on misdemeanor charges of Partner or Family Member Assault pursuant to \u00a73-10-303(l)(c), MCA, we need not reach this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b617 [2] Brockway also argues that the State\u2019s position would violate his rights under \u00a746-17-311(1), MCA, which gives him the opportunity to have a new trial in the District Court in the event he is convicted in Justice Court. The State points out that \u00a746-17-311(1), MCA, provides that all cases appealed from a justice court that is not a court of record must be tried anew in district court. There is no right to a trial <em>de novo </em>from district court or from a justice court established as a court of record. Brockway has the right to one jury trial in a court of record, which he will receive in the District Court. If he is convicted, he may then exercise his right of appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b618 [3] Accordingly, we hold that the District Court erred in concluding that it lacked jurisdiction to try Brockway for all four charges of Partner or Family Member Assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b33-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
