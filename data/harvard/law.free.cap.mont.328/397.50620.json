At the time, Muhammad was twenty-two years old and the girl was fourteen. The parties met at a house party which Muhammad was hosting. On April 30, 1998, Muhammad was arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty. The District Court set trial for October 19, 1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-12\">\u00b64 Immediately following his arraignment, Muhammad began sending letters directly to District Court Judge Marge Johnson (Judge Johnson), asserting therein that the victim was a liar and that her accusations were for attention. He also complained of\u2018lack of support\u201d from his lawyer. Judge Johnson initially responded by forwarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>copies of these letters to counsel. Later, on June 22,1998, she issued an order directing Muhammad to refrain from further <em>ex parte </em>communications with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b65 On August 26,1998, Muhammad entered into a plea agreement wherein he agreed to plead guilty to sexual intercourse without consent in exchange for a commitment by the State to recommend that the court impose a ten-year suspended sentence. Pursuant to the agreement, Muhammad signed an Acknowledgment of Waiver of Rights by Plea of Guilty, acknowledging, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\">This plea is being voluntarily made and not the result of force or threats or promises. I acknowledge that my attorney has explained to me and advised me of the following [trial rights and waiver thereof].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">I acknowledge that I am satisfied with the services of my attorney and that there has been ample time to prepare a defense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">I am not suffering any emotional or mental disability from any cause including mental disease or defect and am not impaired from taking any drugs, alcohol, or prescription medication. I fully understand what I am doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-8\">I am satisfied that my lawyer has been fair to me and has represented me properly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">In response, the court set a change of plea hearing for September 24, 1998. However, on September 9, 1998, Muhammad, despite Judge Johnson\u2019s order, forwarded another letter to her professing his innocence and requesting the court\u2019s permission to withdraw his guilty plea, presumably, meaning to withdraw from his plea agreement. Judge Johnson, in compliance with her earlier order, did not respond directly to Muhammad, but forwarded copies of his letter to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AJh\">\u00b66 On September 24, 1998, Muhammad appeared with his counsel and for the purpose of entering a guilty plea to the charge. As he had done when he signed the Acknowledgment of Waiver of Rights by Plea of Guilty, Muhammad acknowledged to the court on the record, prior to entering his guilty plea, that: (1) he was not threatened with or promised anything outside of the written plea agreement; (2) he was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol; (3) he was not suffering from any disability; (4) he understood the action being taken against him; (5) he was pleading voluntarily; and (6) he was satisfied with his counsel\u2019s assistance. Upon questioning by counsel, Muhammad admitted the facts of the offense. Judge Johnson questioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>Muhammad about his letters and whether he was waiving his defenses, to which he responded affirmatively. She then accepted his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">\u00b67 Following the District Court\u2019s reduction of his bail, Muhummad posted bail and was released from jail on November 6, 1998. The sentencing hearing was postponed and different dates were set, but was ultimately held on May 17, 1999, about eight months after Muhummad had entered his plea, and six months after he was released from jail. Following the hearing, the court sentenced Muhammad to a six-year deferred sentence, contingent on numerous conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">\u00b68 On January 18, 2000, the State petitioned the District Court for revocation of Muhammad\u2019s deferred sentence for alleged violations of the conditions of his sentence. Following a hearing on June 5,2000, the court revoked Muhammad\u2019s six-year deferred sentence and sentenced Muhammad to the Montana Department of Corrections for twenty years, with fifteen years suspended. Muhammad appealed this sentence to this Court. On March 18, 2002, this Court affirmed his sentence in part, reversed in part and remanded for further proceedings. <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, \u00b6 52, 309 Mont. 1, \u00b6 52, 43 P.3d 318, \u00b6 52 <em>(Muhammad I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">\u00b69 However, on September 12, 2001, while Muhammad\u2019s case was pending on appeal, the State filed a second petition to revoke the suspended sentence based upon further alleged violations of conditions, and a second revocation hearing was held on April 17, 2002, shortly after the Court\u2019s remand in <em>Muhammad I. </em>Muhammad entered a \u201ctrue\u201d answer to one of the alleged violations, and on April 24, 2002, the District Court, instead of imposing a prison sentence as it had done upon the first revocation sentencing, re-imposed a six-year deferred sentence similar to the sentence originally imposed on May 17, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b610 However, on May 17, 2002, the State filed a third petition for the revocation of Muhammad\u2019s deferred sentence, again for alleged violations of sentencing conditions. Muhammad answered \u2018hot true\u201d to the alleged violations, and the District Court scheduled a hearing on the matter. However, before the scheduled hearing, Muhammad, on November 13,2002, over four years after entering his guilty plea to the charge, filed a motion to withdraw his plea. Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court entered an order on April 10,2003, denying the motion. From this denial, Muhammad appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">\u00b611 Thereafter, on April 30, 2003, following his third revocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>hearing, Muhammad entered a \u201ctrue\u201d answer to violating several conditions of his deferred sentence. On May 13, 2003, the District Court then sentenced him to twenty years in the Montana State Prison with ten years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b612 We review Muhammad\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea to determine if the guilty plea was voluntary. Our determination of whether a plea was voluntary is a mixed question of law and fact, which we review <em>de novo. State v. Warclub, </em>2005 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 327 Mont. 352, \u00b6 23, 114 P.3d 254, \u00b6 23; <em>State v. Lone Elk, </em>2005 MT 56, \u00b6 10, 326 Mont. 214, \u00b6 10, 108 P.3d 500, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\n<em>DISCUSSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">\u00b613 Did the District Court err in denying Muhammad\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea?</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u00b614 [1] Section 46-16-105(2), MCA (1997), authorizes a district court to permit the withdrawal of a guilty plea upon a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d By entering a guilty plea, a defendant waives numerous afforded constitutional rights and protections, and therefore the plea \u201cmust be a knowing and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Ereth, </em>1998 MT 197, \u00b6 26, 290 Mont. 294, \u00b6 26, 964 P.2d 26, \u00b6 26. The defendant, before entering the plea, must be \u2018fully aware of the direct consequences, including the actual value of any commitments made to him by the court, prosecutor, or his own <em>counsel...\u201d Brady v. United States </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 742, 755, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 1472, 25 L.Ed.2d 747, 760 (quoting <em>Shelton v. United States </em>(5th Cir. 1957), 246 F.2d 571, 572 n.2 (en banc), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 356 U.S. 26, 78 S.Ct. 563, 2 L.Ed.2d 579 (1958)). To determine whether a defendant entered a plea voluntarily, and further, whether the district court erred in denying a defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw a plea, we may examine \u201ccase-specific considerations,\u201d including the \u201cadequacy of the district court\u2019s interrogation and [whether there was a] dismissal of another charge via plea bargain.\u201d <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">\u00b615 Muhammad argues that the District Court erred in denying his motion to withdraw his guilty plea because his plea was entered involuntarily. He cites to several factors which led him to enter a guilty plea which demonstrate that his plea on September 24, 1998, was not voluntary. Specifically, he contends that he signed the plea agreement out of \u2018fear\u201d and alleges that he was traumatized as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>prisoner in the Cascade County Jail, asserting that he experienced \u201cracism\u201d and \u2018fighting with other prisoners because of the charges filed against him.\u201d He claims that he just \u201cwanted to get back to the outside where I could breathe, and at least research it, research some of the legal issues in this case, as opposed to being [in jail] ....\u2019\u2019Further, he contends that the colloquy before he entered his plea had serious shortcomings, first, because the court had knowledge that his guilty plea was involuntary from the letters he forwarded to Judge Johnson complaining about his attorney\u2019s representation (\u201cI\u2019m being kicked to the curb by my lawyer\u201d), and requesting the court\u2019s permission to \u201cwithdraw his guilty plea\u201d prior to the change of plea hearing. Secondly, Muhammad asserts that the colloquy failed to establish a sufficient factual basis to support a guilty plea to the charge, as he never specifically admitted to knowing the victim\u2019s age at the time of the incident. Muhammad argues that he would not have pled guilty to the charges had his attorney advised him of the defense available to him under \u00a7 45-5-511, MCA (1997), of proving \u2018that he reasonably believed the child to be above\u201d sixteen years of age. Lastly, Muhammad contends that Judge Johnson misled him about the statutory defense. During the hearing on his motion to withdraw plea, he testified that \u20181 still said the same thing to the Judge, that I didn\u2019t know her age, and I certainly didn\u2019t rape her, and she told me at that hearing that it didn\u2019t matter that I said I didn\u2019t know her age because she claimed that I had raped her.\u201d Thus, Muhammad claims that Judge Johnson instructed him that knowledge of the victim\u2019s age was not a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"A3j\">\u00b616  First, addressing Muhammad\u2019s argument that he was \u201cfearful,\u201d we have previously noted that \u201ca defendant\u2019s belief in his innocence or his fear of going to trial do not preclude him from making a voluntary and intelligent choice between possible alternative courses of action.\u201d <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 25. As we noted in <em>Lone Elk, </em>where the defendant feared the possibility of sexual offender treatment, \u2018[f]ear of the legal consequences of one\u2019s actions lies central to the criminal law purpose of deterrence.\u201d <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 25. Neither is Muhammad\u2019s claim convincing that the conditions of his confinement made him physically fearful to the point of entering a guilty plea. Muhammad acknowledged repeatedly that he was not entering a plea under any threat and was doing so voluntarily. He was released from jail and was free for some six months prior to sentencing, and yet, even outside the environment of incarceration, he made no effort to withdraw his plea before the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b617 Muhammad\u2019s release on bail while waiting sentencing also belies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>his contention that he merely pled guilty to obtain a release from jail to be able to \u201cresearch\u201d his case. (Tf I were on the other side I would be able to fight with vigor....\u201d) Muhammad was free from incarceration from November 6,1998, through his sentencing on May 17,1999, and continued to be free thereafter under his deferred sentence until arrested for violation of his probationary conditions. At a minimum, Muhammad had six months \u201con the other side\u201d in which to research the matter and to raise the voluntariness of his plea as an issue prior to his sentencing. Indeed, the conditions of his release on bail included a requirement that he contact his attorney <em>at least </em>once a week. However, no motion to withdraw was filed before sentencing, nor immediately thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b618 Muhammad contends that he requested his attorney's assistance in filing a withdrawal motion, but that his attorney failed to do so. However, Muhammad filed no claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, and further, his testimony at the hearing on his withdrawal motion appears inconsistent with his claim that nothing was done:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">Q. Did you ask Mr. Jensen [Muhammad\u2019s attorney] ... to do something, to study or to do something about the fact that you had entered a plea which you felt was inappropriate?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Q. And did Mr. Jensen, as far as you understand, raise that issue before the Court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">A. Well, he didn\u2019t make any strong argument about it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">Despite his current complaints, Muhammad acknowledged repeatedly in his plea agreement and in the colloquy at the change of plea hearing that his attorney had adequately represented him.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">\u00b619 Muhammad\u2019s assertions that his attorney failed to advise him of an available defense under \u00a745-5-511, MCA (1997), and that Judge Johnson advised him that he had no defense to the charge are also contradicted by the record. First, Muhammad testified during the colloquy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-11\">[The court]: ... I understand from statements you have made, either in court or in letters, that you claim that you did not know the victim was under the age of 16.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-12\">[Defendant]: At that point, I didn\u2019t actually know her age. But I don\u2019t make excuses about drinking alcohol. I would have known if I wasn\u2019t drinking that night.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-13\">[The court]: Okay. So you are waiving any defense based on that? [Defendant]: Correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Under oath, Muhammad admitted to having sexual intercourse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>without consent with an underage female as defined by \u00a745-5-503(1) and (3)(a), MCA (1997), and also waived any defenses under \u00a745-5-511, MCA (1997), when the court specifically discussed this issue with him and referenced the statements he had made in his letters that he did not know the victim was under age sixteen. His claim that his attorney failed to advise him of this defense rings hollow in light of the District Court\u2019s reference to his letters in which he had discussed this issue, and his specific waiver of any defenses based upon his knowledge of the victim\u2019s age. Muhammad was obviously aware of the defense and was prepared to waive it when he entered his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b620 Further, our review of the record reveals no evidence that would support Muhammad\u2019s statement that Judge Johnson instructed him during the change of plea hearing that his knowledge of the victim\u2019s age was not a defense to the charge filed against him. The only evidence is to the contrary. Judge Johnson specifically inquired about Muhammad\u2019s claim of knowledge of the victim\u2019s age, to which Muhammad replied that T would have known [her age] if I wasn\u2019t drinking\u201d and then waived any defense based thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b621 Resolution of the above contentions also undermines Muhammad\u2019s claim that the plea colloquy was inadequate because the District Court knew from his letters that he pled guilty involuntarily and that the issue of the age of his victim, as part of the proper Tactual basis\u201d for his plea required by \u00a7 46-12-212, MCA (1997), was not established. Despite the claims in his letters that he had enter\u00e9d the plea agreement by mistake, was not being represented properly and that he did not know the age of the victim, he abandoned all of these assertions under oath in the change of plea hearing. There, he affirmed the work of his counsel, waived his defenses to the victim\u2019s age and affirmed his agreement to plead guilty. Had Muhammad been dissatisfied with any of these matters, he had the full opportunity to raise them at that time. Though Muhammad had already proved that he was not \u201cshy\u201d about communicating with the court, he nonetheless failed to do so, and, to the contrary, asserted he was entering his plea voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b622  Muhammad contends that the District Court\u2019s plea colloquy was inadequate for the additional reason that it failed to establish his understanding of the charges filed against him and that he was pleading guilty to each element of the crime. For the reasons discussed above, we believe the colloquy was adequate to establish the elements of the crime, but, even so, we have determined that a district court\u2019s colloquy \u201cneed not extract an admission from the defendant of every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>element of the crime in order to establish a factual basis for the guilty plea.\u201d <em>State v. Schaff, </em>1998 MT 104, \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 421, \u00b6 22, 958 P.2d 682, \u00b6 22. After a review of the record here, we conclude the colloquy adequately addressed the elements of the offense and laid the factual basis for acceptance of the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b623 Muhammad\u2019s citations <em>to State v. Lance </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 30,651 P.2d 1003, and <em>State v. Huttinger </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 50, 595 P.2d 363, on this issue are unavailing. In <em>Lance, </em>we concluded that [t]he record is <em>void of any indication </em>that defendant was aware of the available defense as contained in section 45-5-304, MCA.\u201d <em>Lance, </em>201 Mont. at 33, 651 P.2d at 1004 (emphasis added). As discussed above, that is not true here. Nor are there the serious inadequacies in the colloquy which we found in <em>Huttinger, </em>where the defendant did not actually admit to committing any crime, let alone to the charge of deliberate homicide, nor was any information identifying the particular crime entered in the record or defendant asked about the services of his counsel. <em>Huttinger, </em>182 Mont. at 58, 595 P.2d at 368.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b624 Lastly, Muhammad received the \u201cbenefit of the bargain\u201d from his plea agreement. The agreement required Muhammad\u2019s admission of guilt and required the State to recommend a ten-year suspended sentence. Muhammad received the benefit of that bargain, with the State recommending a ten-year suspended sentence, and the court imposing a six-year deferred sentence. Indeed, he received that sentence a second time following remand by this Court. The benefits obtained under a plea bargain \u201cmay bear on the question of voluntariness.\u201d <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 19. It was not until four and one-half years after receiving his initial deferred sentence-when it became apparent that he faced the loss of his freedom-that Muhammad filed a motion to withdraw his plea. Though we no longer look to timeliness in isolation as a factor to assess the voluntariness of a plea, <em>Lone Elk, </em>\u00b6 15, the delay in this matter, when viewed in context of Muhammad\u2019s situation when it was filed-facing prison-and the other matters of record, is a \u201ccase-specific consideration\u201d which further reflects on the lack of credibility of Muhammad\u2019s claims. <em>Warclub, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b625  We conclude that Muhammad\u2019s guilty plea to the charges under \u00a745-5-503(1) and (3)(a), MCA (1997), entered after signing an Acknowledgment of Waiver of Rights by Plea of Guilty, and after engaging in a proper colloquy with his attorney and the court, was voluntary. Muhammad testified that he understood the charges against him, that he was pleading voluntarily, and that he was satisfied with the assistance of his counsel. He admitted to the crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>and waived his defenses based upon the age of the victim. Muhammad well understood the repercussions of his decision and the resulting risks inherent in choosing the alternative of pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b626 We therefore conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Muhammad\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b627 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-6\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b406-13\"> At various places, the District Court record indicates that Muhammad was charged and pled guilty to a violation of \u00a745-5-403(1) and (3)(a), MCA (1997), an incorrect code citation. The correct citation is \u00a745-5-503(1) and (3)(a), MCA (1997), but this discrepancy is not an issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
