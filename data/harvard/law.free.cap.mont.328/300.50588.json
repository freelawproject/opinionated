Cheryl appeals various evidentiary decisions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">\u00b62 The State filed an information charging Cheryl with four offenses. Count One charged Cheryl with tampering with or fabricating physical evidence in violation of \u00a7 45-7-207, MCA (1995), because she sent letters to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (the Church) and others intending to mislead law enforcement officers in their investigation. The State filed the second, third, and fourth charges against Cheryl for threats and other improper influence in official and political matters in violation of \u00a745-7-102(l)(a)(ii), MCA (1999). Count Two charged Cheryl with placing posters in East Helena, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Montana, intending to influence East Helena Police Department (EHPD) chief, Mac Cummings, by threatening to harm persons at Capital High School; residents at 302 Clark Street, East Helena; and EHPD officials. Count Three charged Cheryl with sending .38 Special cartridges to the EHPD intending to influence Cummings. Count Four charged Cheryl with sending a letter to Officer Deborah Drynan to improperly influence her by threatening her and her children. The jury found Cheryl not guilty of the second and third counts, but guilty of the first and fourth counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b63 In 1991, Cynthia Hurst and her three children, Daniel, Kalina, and Wesley, moved from New Mexico to East Helena. During the next year, some missionaries from the Church came proselytizing to her door. By May 1992, she had joined the Church. Cheryl and Larry Clifford were also members. Cheryl was a process server and private investigator, and Larry was an officer at the EHPD. The Cliffords had two living children, Megan and Lance.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b64 While the missionaries were encouraging Hurst to join the Church, Hurst began leaving her children with her friend, Charles Scott. Charles Scott lived with his twenty-four-year-old son, Michael Scott. At first, Hurst took the children to Charles\u2019s house because they had chicken pox, and could go neither to school nor to daycare. Later, the children wanted to go over there to \u201cplay Nintendo.\u201d Charles and Hurst would let them stay the night. Over the course of a year and a half, the children went to Charles\u2019s house about a dozen times.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b65 In 1994, Hurst\u2019s son, Daniel, called Hurst from school and cried as he told her that Michael Scott had been molesting him. Hurst filed charges with the EHPD, where Larry was on duty. During the investigation phase, Cheryl called Hurst and told her the police were going to charge Hurst because Hurst knew that Michael Scott was a child molester when Hurst left her children with him. In November 1995, the court sentenced Michael Scott to forty years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b66 Larry was upset that the Deputy County Attorney would not charge Hurst for failing to protect her children. That November, in his capacity as a police officer, Larry filed a complaint against Hurst for negligent endangerment under \u00a745-5-208, MCA (1995). The Church helped Hurst hire a lawyer, who successfully moved the court to dismiss the charges because the statute of limitations had run.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">\u00b67 For the present case, the District Court admitted over seventy letters, but many more were received. Bradley Peterson was a Bishop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>in the Church. In October 1996, the first letter arrived at his personal residence. During the next four years, letters bearing the same scrawling script arrived at the homes of members of the Church and the Cliffords, the Helena Independent Record newspaper, the EHPD, the Montana Highway Patrol, and Officer Drynan\u2019s office. The letters were vicious and lascivious, gory and disturbed, and twisted and disgusting. Some of the letters contained adult pornography and sexually explicit and threatening messages reminiscent of horror films. <em>Inter alia, </em>the letters threatened the defendant, Cheryl; her daughter, <em>Megan; </em>Bishop Peterson of the Church; and the police. If the sender had licked the envelopes or the stamps, authorities could have used DNA testing on the saliva, but the perpetrator sealed the envelopes with tape and used self-adhesive stamps. These methods led law-enforcement officers to believe that the sender may have been especially sophisticated about forensic techniques.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b68 In early March 2000, William Cordes was working for the Criminal Investigation Bureau (CIB). The United States Secret Service had given him questioned-documents-examination training, and he had worked on document investigation cases in the past. The CIB chief had assigned him to this case. After bringing himself up to speed and reading the reports, Cordes decided to interview Cheryl and Larry. The Cliffords showed Cordes two fairly recent letters they said they had received in the mail. One of the envelopes had a postmark with a small \u201ctx\u201d constituting the only legible word on the postmark. The other had a <em>\u201c2 </em>JAN\u201d postmark from \u201cLYkES\u201d \u2018SC.\u201d Both of the envelopes had the suspicious writing similar to the writing that appeared on the other letters. Instead of giving the letters to Cordes, the Cliffords made copies for him on their fax machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\u00b69 In his application for a search warrant of the Cliffords\u2019 house, Cordes testified that three of the letters contained references to the Cliffords, Cheryl claimed to have seen <em>Hustler </em>magazine pages in the ditch along a major Helena street while she was driving at 6:30 p.m. during the winter, a search warrant executed at the Hurst residence revealed no evidence connecting the Hursts to the letters, and the Cliffords had been extremely vocal in accusing Daniel and his parents of writing the letters. The Cliffords had an envelope from \u201cLYkES, SC.\u201d Upon contacting the nearest post office, Cordes discovered that Lykes is an abbreviation for Lykesland, which is the name for an unincorporated voting district. Neither \u2018Lykes\u201d nor Lykesland have post offices. The Cliffords had told Cordes that Daniel was in Army training in South Carolina at the time the letter was mailed. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>this evidence, Cordes contended that probable cause existed to search the Cliffords\u2019 residence. A district court issued a search warrant for the Cliffords\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">\u00b610 On March 14, 2000, Cordes and three other agents searched the Cliffords\u2019 house. Inside, one of the agents found two stamp kits with individual rubber characters for making stamps. One of the kits had all the characters still glued and connected. The other had all the characters still glued together, except: \u00a3L,\u2019 \u2018Y,\u2019 \u2018k,\u2019 \u2018E,\u2019 \u2018S,\u2019 \u20182,\u2019 \u2018 J,\u2019 \u2018A,\u2019 \u2018N,\u2019 \u2018X,\u2019 and',\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">\u00b611 Following the search of the Cliffords\u2019 house, only one more letter arrived. A year after the search, in March 2001, a churchgoer received a letter marked 'Return to Sender\u201d with the same scrawled handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\u00b612 The Lewis and Clark County Sheriffs Office first contacted James Blanco about this case in December 1998. Blanco is one of about 150 experts in the United States and Canada certified by the American Board of Forensic Document Examiners. This is the only certification recognized by crime laboratories in the majority of governmental agencies, including the United States Secret Service; the Internal Revenue Service; and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. In his first of five reports, Blanco could neither identify nor eliminate Cheryl, Larry, or Daniel as writers of the anonymous letters. After the search of the Cliffords\u2019 house, Cordes sent Blanco another batch of documents to analyze for the writer\u2019s identity. This time, Blanco had more success. He identified Cheryl as the author of the Lykes envelope and the author of the \u201ctx\u201d envelope. In his final three reports, Blanco identified Cheryl as having written even more of the suspicious letters and envelopes.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b613 To support the motion to file the information, the State\u2019s affidavit set forth, <em>inter alia, </em>Cheryl\u2019s and Larry\u2019s occupations and membership in the Church, details about the Michael Scott sexual molestation case, Larry\u2019s issuance of the negligent endangerment complaint, and the subsequent commencement of the letters. The affidavit described Cordes enlisting Blanco and Blanco\u2019s conclusions that Cheryl authored many of the letters. Further, it recited that John Wardell, who was also a member of the Church, had been delivering a small cargo container to the Hurst residence when he saw a vehicle driving by that looked exactly like a vehicle the Cliffords owned. Two days later, Wardell\u2019s daughter received a handwritten mailing referencing Wardell\u2019s trip to the Hurst residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b614 The affidavit asserts that the Lewis and Clark Sheriffs Office had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>searched the Hurst residence years earlier, when they suspected Daniel, but had found no incriminating evidence there. It recounts the many instances in which Blanco identified Cheryl as having written various letters including the ones sent to the Montana Highway Patrol, the Lewis and Clark County Sheriffs Office, and the Helena Independent Record newspaper. The affidavit also states that, in April 1999, Larry found a greeting card and a flower on Megan\u2019s car windshield, and the Helena Police Department traced the card to Van\u2019s Thriftway. Owner-clerk Paula VanderJagt picked Cheryl out of a six-woman lineup as the card\u2019s purchaser. Based on these allegations, the District Court granted leave to file informations against Cheryl and Larry Clifford in May 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b615 In November 2001, Cheryl\u2019s and Larry\u2019s lawyers took Blanco\u2019s deposition. Blanco came prepared to give representative details of the methods of analysis by which he concluded that Cheryl had authored various letters, but he was not prepared to explain every detail of every comparison between the letters. At trial, Blanco had overhead projections and blown-up trial exhibits comparing the distinctive elements of the characters in the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b616 After the State rested, Cheryl moved for a directed verdict, contending that Blanco\u2019s testimony was the only concrete evidence, and it was insufficient as a matter of law to convict her. The District Court denied the motion. In presenting her defense, Cheryl intended to call Mark Denbeaux as a handwriting expert. The State objected, and the District Court excluded him.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\u00b617 We restate the issues Cheryl raises as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">\u00b618 1. Whether Rule 702, M.R.Evid., required a <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, hearing before admitting Blanco\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">\u00b619 2. Whether the affidavit accompanying the motion to file the information had inadequate probable cause upon which to file the information.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">\u00b620 3. Whether the State failed to provide Blanco\u2019s reasons for concluding that Cheryl authored the documents so a continuance became necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">\u00b621 4. WTiether Blanco\u2019s opinion testimony was sufficient as a matter of law to connect Cheryl and the questioned documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">\u00b622 5. Wftiether Rule 702, M.R.Evid., requires the admission of expert testimony that handwriting evidence lacks reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">\u00b623 6. WThether Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., requires the admission of particular evidence linking Daniel Hurst to the threatening letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u00b624 7. Whether Cordes misrepresented the facts in his search warrant application for the Cliffords\u2019 house, so <em>Franks v. Delaware </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667, required suppression of the evidence obtained in that search.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">\u00b625 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 51, \u00b6 14, 106 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 14. This Court reviews district court decisions on motions to continue to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v.

This Court reviews district courts denials of motions to suppress to determine whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law is correct. <em>State v. Minez, </em>2004 MT 115, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 148, \u00b6 16, 89 P.3d 966, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AYh\">I. Rule 702, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u00b626 Cheryl argues that, since Blanco, in his deposition, could explain neither how nor why he concluded that Cheryl authored the documents, the District Court should have held a hearing pursuant to <em>Daubert </em>and <em>Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">\u00b627 Rule 702, M.R.Evid., provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Testimony by experts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">\n<em>A. Daubert I Kumho Tire Co. Hearing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AZ0\">\u00b628 Questions concerning expert testimony\u2019s reliability are threefold under Rule 702, M.R.Evid.: (1) whether the expert field is reliable, (2) whether the expert is qualified, and (3) whether the qualified expert reliably applied the reliable field to the facts. First, the district court determines whether the expert field is reliable. Second, the district court determines whether the witness is qualified as an expert in that reliable field. If the court deems the expert qualified, the testimony based on the results from that field is admissible-shaky as that evidence may be. Third, the question whether that qualified expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>reliably applied the principles of that reliable field to the facts of the case is not a question for the trial court to resolve. Instead, \u201c[vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. at 2798, 125 L.Ed.2d at 484; <em>contra </em>Fed. R. Evid. 702(3) (giving trial courts the decision whether the qualified expert witness reliably applied the reliable field to the facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b629 The <em>Daubert </em>test helps determine the reliability of a field of expert methods. 509 U.S. at 592, 113 S.Ct. at 2796, 125 L.Ed.2d at 482; <em>accord State v. Moore </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 20, 41, 885 P.2d 457, 470. In <em>Daubert, </em>the United States Supreme Court adopted a four-factor test, of which the factors are neither necessary nor sufficient to determine whether the field of scientific evidence that the expert is proposing is reliable. 509 U.S. at 592-95, 113 S.Ct. at 2796-98, 125 L.Ed.2d at 482-84; <em>accord Moore, </em>268 Mont. at 41, 885 P.2d at 470-71. The Supreme Court expanded this test to cover technical or other specialized expert testimony. <em>Kumho Tire Co., </em>526 U.S. at 141, 119 S.Ct. at 1171, 143 L.Ed.2d at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">\u00b630  The <em>Daubert </em>test does not require a district court to determine whether the expert reliably applied expert methods to the facts. Rather, if the witness is a qualified expert in the field, he may testify. Under <em>aDaubert </em>analysis, the reliability of Blanco\u2019s application of his expert field to the facts is immaterial in determining the reliability of that expert field. Rule 702, M.R.Evid., did not require the District Court to hold a <em>Daubert </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\n<em>B. Handwriting Expert\u2019s Opinion on an Ultimate Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AAa\">\u00b631 Cheryl argues, under Rule 702, M.R.Evid., that, although the District Court properly allowed Blanco to testify to similarities and dissimilarities between documents of unknown authorship and documents that Cheryl had written, it should not have allowed Blanco to testify to the ultimate conclusion that Cheryl authored the documents in question. Cheryl cites <em>United States v. Paul </em>(11th Cir. 1999), 175 F.3d 906, <em>United States v. Hines </em>(D. Mass. 1999), 55 F.Supp.2d 62, and two other federal district court cases for the proposition that, because the jury could have come to the ultimate conclusion without help from Blanco, Blanco need not have testified to that ultimate conclusion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u00b632  Rule 704, M.R.Evid., provides that \u2018[t]estimony in the form of an opinion or inference otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d This rule allows Blanco to testify to the ultimate conclusion of who wrote the letters.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\n<em>C. Qualifying a Witness as an Expert</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Axib\">\u00b633  Cheryl argues that, because Blanco, in his deposition, could not state the basis for his conclusion that Cheryl authored the letters, he had no scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge under Rule 702, M.R.Evid. Cheryl misapprehends the force behind Rule 702, M.R.Evid. To restate this rule, <em>if </em>a reliable field helps the trier of fact, <em>and </em>the court deems the witness qualified as an expert, <em>then </em>he may testify. Whether the witness has scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge bears on the question whether the witness qualifies as an expert. Although the District Court did not specifically rule that Blanco qualified as an expert, Cheryl did not object to his testimony for lack of qualification. This Court does not address issues raised for the first time in this Court. <em>State v. White Bear, </em>2005 MT 7, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 337, \u00b6 10, 106 P.3d 516, \u00b6 10. We decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">II. Adequate Probable Cause Upon Which to File an Information and</p>\n<p id=\"AWx\">IV. The Legal Sufficiency of Blanco\u2019s Opinion Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">\u00b634 Cheryl asserts, without much coherent argument, that the affidavit in support of the information lacked probable cause. Cheryl fails to provide even the statute requiring probable cause to file an information. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires an appellant, in her brief, to cite to the authorities, statutes, and pages of the record she relied upon in her arguments to this Court. Absent such citation, we decline to consider the argument. <em>In re Marriage of Hodge, </em>2003 MT 146, \u00b6 10, 316 Mont. 194, \u00b6 10, 69 P.3d 1192, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">\u00b635 Cheryl also argues that Blanco\u2019s testimony was the only concrete evidence against her, and it was insufficient as a matter of law to convict her. Cheryl did nothing more in her brief than raise the argument. She fails even to cite a case. We decline to consider this argument, also. <em>In re Marriage of Hodge, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">III. Blanco\u2019s Reasoning</p>\n<p id=\"b332-11\"><em>\u00b636 </em>Cheryl argues the District Court erred in refusing to continue the trial because the State had not provided Blanco\u2019s subjective judgments upon which he relied to conclude Cheryl wrote the documents. She cites \u00a746-15-322(l)(c), MCA (2001), for the proposition that the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>must produce the \u201cresults of physical examinations, scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons ....\u2019\u2019Although the State provided Cheryl with Blanco\u2019s five reports in which he related his conclusions, Cheryl claims that Blanco did not reveal his \u201cresults.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b637 During his deposition, Blanco made some comparisons for the benefit of the attorneys. He compared Cheryl\u2019s known writings to the unknown writings for similarities. He showed them how he compared Cheryl\u2019s voluntary statement to the Helena Police Department with the \u2018LYkES\u2019Tetter. For example, the writings both had distinctive k\u2019s. Further, Blanco provided almost twenty documents on which he had made notations next to specific characters. The notations indicated that those characters had similarities with characters from other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">\u00b638 In January 2002, shortly after the deposition, the prosecution provided Blanco\u2019s eighteen-page affidavit in which he reiterated many of his deposition statements and reorganized many of those statements into a clear outline to show his methods. During trial, he testified in more detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">\u00b639 Experts should explain their reasoning, so the opposing party can prepare for trial. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a746-15-322(l)(c) and 323(3) to (5), MCA (2001). With that information, the opposing party can attack the expert\u2019s reasoning as defective instead of merely attacking his conclusions as defective. At his deposition, Blanco provided fourteen of the documents of unknown origin on which he had made notations next to specific characters indicating those characters had similarities with characters from other documents that Cheryl had written. From the volume of similarities, he concluded that Cheryl had written the documents of unknown authorship. This explanation was sufficient for Cheryl\u2019s experts to understand Blanco\u2019s reasoning and methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">\u00b640 Cheryl also asserts that the District Court erred by denying a continuance so her handwriting expert, Lloyd Cunningham, could recover from an illness so he could testify in person rather than through video depositions. Cheryl did nothing more in her brief than raise the argument. She fails to develop the argument or cite any authority. Accordingly, we decline to address it. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P.; <em>In re Marriage of Hodge, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">V. Allowing Denbeaux to Testify</p>\n<p id=\"AqP\">\u00b641 Mark Denbeaux is a law professor at Seton Hall Law School in Newark, New Jersey, who specializes in evidence law. He co-authored an article criticizing handwriting evidence. Denbeaux claims that, after many years of study, he has identified the defects and limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>of forensic handwriting -witnesses\u2019 opinions and the reasons that handwriting analysis is unreliable. Cheryl argues that the District Court erred by refusing to recognize Denbeaux as a qualified expert and prohibiting him from testifying. She asserts that Denbeaux\u2019s testimony would have cast doubt on Blanco\u2019s testimony, the reliability of handwriting expert testimony in general, and the weight of that evidence. The Federal Circuit Courts have disagreed on whether to allow Denbeaux\u2019s testimony. <em>Compare United States v. Velasquez </em>(3d Cir. 1995), 64 F.3d 844, 852 (refusing to admit Denbeaux\u2019s testimony <em>was </em>an abuse of discretion), <em>with Paul, </em>175 F.3d at 912 (refusing to admit Denbeaux\u2019s testimony <em>was not </em>an abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b642 First, arguably, Denbeaux is not an expert in the field of handwriting analysis; rather, he is an evidence professor who has, historically, criticized handwriting analysis evidence. It was within the District Court\u2019s discretion to conclude that Denbeaux did not qualify as an expert in handwriting analysis. <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 48, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 48, 980 P.3d 3, \u00b6 48. Moreover, Cheryl presented the testimony of her own handwriting expert, and performed a thorough cross-examination of Blanco. Thus, even if Denbeaux\u2019s testimony might have cast doubt on Blanco\u2019s testimony, Cheryl was able to accomplish that task through the testimony of her expert and cross-examination. Under these circumstances, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in precluding Denbeaux\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">VI. Identity Evidence Linking Daniel Hurst to the Threatening Letters</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">\u00b643 Cheryl contends that the District Court made numerous evidentiary rulings that violated her rights to present a defense. Specifically, she alleges the District Court erred by excluding Daniel\u2019s (1) prior sexual activity, (2) psychological problems, (3) behavioral problems, (4) discharge from the U.S. Army for psychological reasons, (5) commitment to a mental health institution, and (6) conviction of vandalism in East Helena. Cheryl alleges this evidence qualifies under the seldom-used \u201creverse 404(b)\u201d theory to identify Daniel as the author of the letters. By excluding that evidence, Cheryl contends the District Court violated Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., her right to present a defense under due process, and the right to confront witnesses against her under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">A. <em>Reverse 404(b) Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">\u00b644 Cheryl sought to admit Daniel\u2019s prior sexual history and psychological profile to show that he, and not Cheryl, wrote the letters. On occasion, a defendant will use Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., to introduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>evidence to inculpate another person, thus exculpating himself. Courts call evidence introduced for this purpose \u2018(reverse 404(b) evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Stevens </em>(3d Cir. 1991), 935 F.2d 1380, 1401-02. Since the defendant is offering the reverse 404(b) evidence, courts applying the Rule 403, M.R.Evid., balancing test cannot consider the risk of unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>Stevens, </em>935 F.2d at 1404-05 (\u201c[T]he admissibility of\u2018reverse 404(b)\u2019 evidence depends on a straightforward balancing of the evidence\u2019s probative value against considerations such as undue waste of time and confusion of the issues.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><em>\u00b645 </em><em> </em>Although the State raises the specter of prejudice to the government, it fails to develop that theory. Unfair prejudice against the government is rather rare. \u201c \u2018Unfair prejudice\u2019 within its context means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\u201d Fed. R. Evid. 403 advisory committee\u2019s note; <em>see Southern, </em>\u00b6 67. Thus, the only possible unfair prejudice against the government occurs when the evidence tends to make the jury more likely to find a defendant not guilty <em>despite </em>the proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See, e.g., Old Chief v. United States </em>(1997), 519 U.S. 172, 185 n.8, 117 S.Ct. 644, 652 n.8, 136 L.Ed.2d 574, 591 n.8. By proving that someone else committed the crime, reverse 404(b) evidence is not likely to generate that risk of jury infidelity, and thus does not generate unfair prejudice. Only in the rarest circumstances will the district court be presented with unfair prejudice to the State in determining the admissibility of reverse 404(b) evidence. Those circumstances are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><em>B. The Modified </em>Just <em>Rule</em></p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">\u00b646 The District Court excluded six categories of evidence that pointed toward Daniel. Cheryl argues that this evidence of misidentification was admissible as reverse 404(b) evidence tending to show that Daniel, and not Cheryl, wrote the letters. The District Court granted the State\u2019s motion in limine to exclude evidence of Daniel\u2019s other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Under Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., the District Court decided the modified <em>Just </em>rule, articulated in <em>State v. Matt </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 136, 814 P.2d 52, allowed it to exclude evidence of Daniel\u2019s specific acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">\u00b647 Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">To be admissible under Rule 404(b), the modified <em>Just </em>rule requires that the other crimes, wrongs, or acts (1) must be similar and (2) not remote in time. <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. Such evidence (3)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; but may be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\"><em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. Finally, (4) although relevant, a court may exclude evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading of the jury, considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence substantially outweighs its probative value. <em>Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">\n<em>C. Propensity Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">\u00b648 \u201c\u2018The difference between the proper use of other acts evidence to prove identity and the improper use of such evidence to prove propensity is a subtle matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Sweeney, </em>2000 MT 74, \u00b6 32, 299 Mont. 111, \u00b6 32, 999 P.2d 296, \u00b6 32 (quoting <em>United States v. Luna </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 21 F.3d 874, 882). Indeed, this classification forms the crucial distinction at the basis of the third prong of the modified <em>Just </em>test. Specifically, if the proponent for admissibility offers the evidence solely to show propensity, Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., prohibits courts from admitting that evidence. \u201cWhen evidence of prior bad acts is offered, the proponent must clearly articulate how that evidence fits into a chain of logical inferences, no link of which may be the inference that the defendant has the propensity to commit the crime charged.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Himelwright </em>(3d Cir. 1994), 42 F.3d 777, 782 (interpreting Rule 404(b), Fed. R. Evid.); <em>People v. Zackowitz </em>(N.Y. 1930), 172 N.E. 466 (Cardozo, C. J., delivering the opinion of the court).</p>\n<p id=\"AIG\">\u00b649 Of the six categories of evidence that Cheryl offers, four of them (psychological problems, behavioral problems, discharge from the U.S. Army for psychological reasons, and commitment to a mental health institution) provide only propensity evidence. Cheryl contends that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>Daniel has psychological problems, so he acted in conformity with those problems by writing the letters; he has behavioral problems, so he acted in conformity \"with those problems by writing the letters; etc. These chains of inferences clearly implicate propensity evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b650 Someone vandalized the Cliffords\u2019 car by spray-painting profanities in pink. Cheryl sought to admit evidence that Daniel had been convicted for vandalizing cars in East Helena. That evidence also creates a chain of inferences implicating propensity evidence: Daniel vandalized cars in East Helena, therefore he is a vandal, therefore he acted in conformity with that character trait when he vandalized the Cliffords\u2019 car. Evidence in this category is clearly inadmissible propensity evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">\u00b651 The more difficult question arises when considering the admissibility of specific, prior sexual activities in which Daniel, willingly or unwillingly, participated. At various points, Cheryl wanted the court to admit evidence of or allow examination into various experiences including the specific acts of sodomy to which Michael Scott subjected Daniel, the presence of two other men while Michael Scott molested Daniel, the specifics of Daniel being molested when he was very young, and the specific acts of incest. The District Court admitted references to the acts, but excluded the specific activities. Evidence proving these specific facts is relevant to the identity of the author, Cheryl argues, because the letters refer to specific acts of sodomy, a \u201cbuttfuck party,\u201d and specific incestuous acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">\u00b652 The District Court excluded these categories of evidence under the modified <em>Just </em>rule. Unfortunately, we cannot discern which rationale the court used to exclude the evidence. The fourth prong of that test repeats Rule 403, M.R.Evid. <em>Compare </em>Rule 403, M.R.Evid., <em>with Matt, </em>249 Mont. at 142, 814 P.2d at 56. Generally, we review a district court\u2019s discretionary Rule 403, M.R.Evid., decisions for abuse of discretion, but we agree with the <em>Himelwright </em>court that when a district court rules on a Rule 403, M.R.Evid., question, but its reasons are not apparent from the record, we cannot review its discretion. <em>Himelwright, </em>42 F.3d at 781. In such cases, we may examine the record and balance the factors ourselves. <em>Himelwright, </em>42 F.3d at 781. Accordingly, we will balance the Rule 403 factors de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">\u00b653 Rule 403, M.R.Evid., provides that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>presentation of cumulative evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u2018The greater contains the less.\u201d Section 1-3-227, MCA. The District Court admitted copious amounts of evidence that Michael Scott had molested Daniel. No fewer than six witnesses testified that Michael Scott had molested Daniel, and that theme pervaded the case. As stated earlier, because these categories of evidence constitute reverse 404(b) evidence, this Court may not consider the danger of unfair prejudice in its balancing. Nevertheless, the jury need not have heard the multiple, graphic details painstakingly recounting the horrors through which Michael Scott put Daniel. The jury\u2019s imagination could quickly fill in the gaps without such detailed evidence. Thus, the probative value is very low. Taken together, the waste of time and needless presentation of cumulative evidence from such technical, detailed, and vivid explanations substantially outweigh the low probative value of that evidence. A similar analysis shows the District Court properly excluded specific evidence of Daniel\u2019s molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">\u00b654 In addition, the District Court allowed questions as to whether Daniel committed incest, but did not allow questions as to the specific acts. As above, the waste of time and needless presentation of cumulative evidence substantially outweigh the probative value of dwelling upon the specific instances. The District Court properly excluded this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u00b655 Finally, the District Court also admitted evidence that other boys participated in the molestations at Michael Scott\u2019s home. Given this evidence that Daniel experienced a \u2018buttfuck party,\u201d evidence that two other men were present at other times amounts to needless presentation of cumulative evidence. The needless presentation of that cumulative evidence substantially outweighs the negligible probative value. Because these evidentiary items fail one prong of the modified <em>Just </em>test, we need not address the remaining prongs for admissibility. The District Court did not err by excluding this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">\n<em>D. Right to Put on a Defense</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">\u00b656 Cheryl cites <em>State v. Johnson, </em>1998 MT 107, 288 Mont. 513, 958 P.2d 1182, for the proposition that the reliable nature of the \u201cidentity\u201d evidence was sufficient to tip the scales in favor of Cheryl\u2019s constitutional right to present a defense. <em>Johnson </em>addresses the balance between the defendant\u2019s right to present a defense and the victim\u2019s rights under the rape shield statute. \u00b6 18-34. Cheryl\u2019s argument is very sparse and she fails to identify even the two interests on the scales. \u201cA defendant\u2019s right to present relevant evidence is not unlimited, but rather is subject to reasonable restrictions.\u201d <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>States v.

Cheryl has not shown that these evidentiary restrictions are unreasonable, so we hold that they do not violate her right to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">VII. Cordes Facts in the Application for the Search Warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">\u00b657 Cheryl asserts that the application for a search warrant for the Cliffords\u2019 residence contained nothing more than the subjective beliefs of Cordes. Cheryl argues that the whole affidavit in support of the application for the search warrant contains only subjective beliefs, false statements, and misrepresentations. Cheryl cites <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 155-56, 98 S.Ct. at 2676, 57 L.Ed.2d at 672, for the proposition that a court must excise false statements and consider the remaining statements to determine whether probable cause existed for the issuance of the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\u00b658 [5] In her argument, Cheryl fails to recognize that <em>State v. Worrall, </em>1999 MT 55, \u00b6\u00b6 29-34, 293 Mont. 439, \u00b6\u00b6 29-34, 976 P.2d 968, \u00b6\u00b6 29-34, requires her to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the statements in the affidavit were false. <em>Franks, </em>438 U.S. at 164-65, 98 S.Ct. at 2681, 57 L.Ed.2d at 677-78; <em>Worrall, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-35. Without providing any evidence, Cheryl merely claims that the assertions were subjective beliefs, false statements, and misrepresentations. Because Cheryl did not establish falsity as required under <em>Worrall </em>or <em>Franks, </em>the District Court did not err by refusing to exclude the evidence obtained in the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">\u00b659 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b331-7\"> Cheryl preserved this issue for appeal in her January 2,2002, motion to prohibit Blanco from making ultimate conclusions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b336-9\"> The Third Circuit, here, refers to \u201cprior bad acts,\u201d but Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., has no requirement that the other acts be \u2018bad.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid.

The Federal Trilogy</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">\u00b661 In 1993, the United States Supreme Court decided the first of what was to be a trilogy of cases dealing with the admissibility of expert testimony. In <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharm., Inc. </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 579, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469, the Court held that Federal Rule of Evidence 702 requires that expert scientific evidence be subject to a reliability test, rather than the common law \u201cgeneral acceptance\u201d test of <em>Frye v. United States </em>(D.C. Cir. 1923), 293 F. 1013, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>1014. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589-90, 113 S.Ct. at 2794-95. <em>The Frye </em>test was superseded by Rule 702. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 589, 113 S.Ct. at 2794. Accordingly, the Court required that, when faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony, the trial judge, pursuant to Rule 104(a), must make a preliminary assessment of whether the testimony\u2019s underlying reasoning and methodology is scientifically valid and can be properly applied to the facts at issue. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796. This is referred to as the courts\u2019 \u201cgatekeeping\u201d function. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 597, 113 S.Ct. at 2798.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b662 The Court set forth various, flexible considerations that will bear on this inquiry, including, whether the theory or technique in question can be (and has been) tested; whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication; its known or potential error rate and the maintenance of standards controlling its operation; and whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within the relevant scientific community. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 593-94, 113 S.Ct. at 2796-97. The Court observed that the inquiry is to be a flexible one, focusing solely on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions they generate, and being mindful of other applicable Rules. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 594-95, 113 S.Ct. at 2797. Finally, the Court stated that cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof, rather than wholesale exclusion under an uncompromising general acceptance standard, is the appropriate means by which evidence based on valid principles may be challenged. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. at 2798.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b663 The second case in the trilogy was <em>General Electric Co. v. Joiner </em>(1997), 522 U.S. 136, 118 S.Ct. 512, 139 L.Ed.2d 508. In <em>Joiner, </em>the Court clarified <em>Daubert </em>in two respects. First the Court noted that trial courts could scrutinize the reliability of a proffered expert\u2019s reasoning process as well as his or her methodology. The Court stated that \u201cnothing in either <em>Daubert </em>or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence that is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert.\u201d <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. at 519. Second, <em>Joiner </em>made clear that abuse of discretion is the proper standard by which an appellate court should review a district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude expert scientific evidence. <em>Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">\u00b664 The final of the three cases was <em>Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v. Carmichael </em>(1999), 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238. In this case the Court applied <em>Dauberts </em>gatekeeping obligation to not only expert scientific evidence, but, as well, to all expert testimony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number><em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 141, 119 S.Ct. at 1171. Furthermore, the Court emphasized the importance of the gatekeeping requirement, noting that \u201c[t]he objective of that requirement is to ensure the reliability and relevancy of expert testimony [and] to make certain that an expert, whether basing testimony upon professional studies or personal experience, employs in the courtroom the same level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.\u201d <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. at 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">B. Montana\u2019s Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b665 Montana did away with the <em>Frye </em>general acceptance test before <em>Daubert. In Barmeyer v. Mont. Power Co. </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 185, 193, 657 P.2d 594, 598, we rejected the <em>Frye </em>test as not being \u2018in conformity with the spirit of the new rules of evidence.\u201d We adopted the reasoning of <em>United States v. Bailer </em>(4th Cir. 1975), 519 F.2d 463, 466, wherein the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals held that \u2018It is better to admit relevant scientific evidence in the same manner as other expert testimony and allow its weight to be attacked by cross-examination and refutation.\u201d <em>Barmeyer, </em>202 Mont. at 193-94, 657 P.2d at 598. Nearly twelve years later, we adopted <em>Daubert, </em>concluding that \u2018before a trial court admits scientific expert testimony, there must be a preliminary showing that the expert\u2019s opinion is premised on a reliable methodology.\u201d <em>State v. Moore </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 20, 42, 885 P.2d 457, 471.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b666 Unfortunately, we also stated that the <em>Daubert </em>guidelines were consistent with <em>Barmeyer </em>concerning the admission of\u2018hovel scientific evidence.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>268 Mont, at 42, 885 P.2d at 471. I say \u201cunfortunately\u201d because, as it turns out, we have, since, essentially done away with the <em>Daubert </em>standards by limiting the requirements of that case and the courts\u2019 gatekeeping obligation to proffered expert testimony <em>of \u201cnovel\u201d scientific evidence </em>only. <em>See State v. Cline </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 46, 55, 909 P.2d 1171, 1177; <em>Hulse v. State, </em>1998 MT 108, \u00b6\u00b6 55-69, 289 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 55-69, 961 P.2d 75, \u00b6\u00b6 55-69; <em>State v.

The proposition that \u201cA implies B\u201dis not the equivalent of \u201cnon-A implies non-B,\u201d and neither proposition follows logically from the other.

In <em>Cline, </em>we committed this error when we essentially reasoned that if\u2018hovel\u201d scientific evidence requires a <em>Daubert </em>hearing, then non-\u2018hovel\u201d scientific evidence does not require a <em>Daubert </em>hearing. <em>Cline, </em>275 Mont. at 55, 909 P.2d at 1177. Therefore, if the proffered scientific evidence is not \u2018hovel,\u201d our approach, based on <em>Barmeyer, </em>is to admit relevant scientific evidence in the same manner as other expert testimony, and to allow its weight to be attacked by cross-examination and refutation. <em>Moore, </em>268 Mont. at 41-42, 885 P.2d at 470-71. <em>See also Hulse, </em>\u00b6 69, <em>Southern, </em>\u00b6 59, <em>Hocevar, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 56-61, and Ayers, \u00b6\u00b6 37-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b668 While, arguably, the DNA evidence considered in <em>Moore </em>was \u2018hovel\u201d in 1994, as far as Montana was concerned, and while <em>Daubert </em>was consistent with <em>Barmeyer </em>(without applying <em>Daubert\u2019s </em>various standards,per se), our \u201cconsistency\u2019observation grew into an exception which has effectively now swallowed <em>Daubert. </em>Worse, as I will discuss later, in imposing this limitation we have not only turned the <em>Daubert </em>approach on its head, unreasonably constraining, in the process, the trial judge\u2019s gatekeeping function, but we have rejected <em>Kumho Tire</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>and have paved the way for the admission of \u201cscientific\u201d evidence whose reliability and methodology have never been subject to any level of intellectual rigor. <em>Contra Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at 152, 119 S.Ct. at 1176. Indeed we have, as this case demonstrates, fallen in to the trap of admitting expert scientific opinion that is connected to existing data only by the <em>ipse dixit </em>of the expert, <em>contra Joiner, </em>522 U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. at 519-the only exception being for that scientific evidence which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>is not \u2018hovel.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have come to accept the notion that certain disciplines, techniques, methods, \u201csciences\u201d and even some presumptions are grounded in scientific principle; are not \u2018hovel;\u201d and are, therefore, presumptively reliable without more. It is to that problem that I now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">C. The Error of our Ways</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">\u00b669 I start with two relatively simple examples.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">\u00b670 Conventional wisdom declares that eyewitness testimony is reliable. Notwithstanding, this Court has acknowledged that a large body of research and scholarship exists which demonstrates that eyewitness testimony can be unreliable and that, in appropriate cases, the trial court must, therefore, allow expert testimony on the reliability of eyewitness testimony. <em>State v. DuBray, </em>2003 MT 255, \u00b6\u00b6 36-44, 317 Mont. 377, \u00b6\u00b6 36-44, 77 P.3d 247, \u00b6\u00b6 36-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u00b671 Similarly, \u00a726-1-302, MCA, states that a witness is \u201cpresumed to speak the truth.\u201d In civil cases the jury is so instructed. Montana Pattern Jury Instruction (Civil) 1.02. Montana is one of a few jurisdictions that still instructs civil juries that witnesses are presumed to speak the truth. Tom Singer, <em>To Tell the Truth, Memory Isn\u2019t That Good, </em>63 Mont. L. Rev. 337,349 (Summer 2002) (hereinafter <em>Singer). </em>Most courts, including the federal courts, do not so instruct juries because scholarship and research have shown that the presumption is not reliable. <em>See Singer, </em>at 349-57. Absent outright confabulation or perjury, witnesses will testify to what they <em>believe </em>is the truth. <em>See Singer, </em>at 360-63. However, any witness\u2019s view of the \u201ctruth\u201d is filtered through that person\u2019s life experiences, biases and preconceptions along with his or her powers of observation, ability to retain and recall-processes which are highly dependent upon a host of psychological and physiological factors-and on one\u2019s ability to communicate. <em>See Singer, </em>at 358-64. The \u201ctruth\u201dmay be the witness\u2019s perceived, subjective understanding of what he or she saw or heard, or it may be the \u201ctruth\u201d in some larger or more objective and absolute sense. <em>See Singer, </em>at 355-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">\u00b672 Many times each year, we somberly intone the mantra: \u201ccredibility and weight given to the evidence is within the province of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>the jury and will not be disturbed unless the jury\u2019s findings are inherently impossible to believe.\u201d <em>Papich v. Quality Life Concepts, Inc., </em>2004 MT 116, \u00b6 29, 321 Mont. 156, \u00b6 29, 91 P.3d 553, \u00b6 29. If we really believe that, we should not require the trial court to invade the province of the jury by instructing jurors that they must presume the truthfulness of the witnesses they hear testify. Ultimately it is up to them who and what to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">\u00b673 Criminal cases have the potential for generating even more serious evidentiary problems. Professors David E. Bernstein and Jeffrey D. Jackson state that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\">the admission of forensic evidence in criminal cases remains relatively routine. Legal commentators agree that the <em>Daubert </em>trilogy has had far less of a constricting effect on forensic science evidence compared with its effect on evidence in torts cases, most likely because defense attorneys in routine criminal cases lack the resources and expertise to challenge the admission of scientific evidence. Moreover, because all three cases in the <em>Daubert </em>trilogy arose in the civil context, lower courts seem more inclined to overcome their traditional inertia about admitting scientific evidence in that context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">David E. Bernstein &amp; Jeffrey D. Jackson, <em>The </em>Daubert <em>Trilogy in the States, </em>44 Jurimetrics J. 351 n.17 (Spring 2004). This potential for the routine admission of \u201cscientific\u201d evidence is precisely what Justice Patricia O. Cotter criticized in <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, 328 Mont. 276, 119 P.3d 1194, (Cotter, P., dissenting), where she predicted that \u2018ttjrial courts will admit the PBT [or, preliminary breath test] evidence because we have said it is admissible, its scientific validity having now been decreed as a matter of law. That is all that will matter.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">\u00b674 And, unfortunately, the case <em>sub judice </em>presents another example of the results of a \u201cscientific\u201d discipline being admitted through expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>testimony without application of a rigorous <em>Daubert </em>approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b675 In her article, <em>Scripting Expertise: The History of Handwriting Identification Evidence and the Judicial Construction </em>ofReliability, 87 Va. L. Rev. 1723 (2001) (hereinafter <em>Mnookin), </em>Professor Jennifer L. Mnookin argues for the application of <em>Daubert </em>standards to expert forensic evidence in criminal cases in various sciences and disciplines that have been and are considered presumptively reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">\u00b676 Professor Mnookin observes that some long-accepted forensic science evidence has recently received greater public scrutiny not only because the \u201cexperts\u201dproffering the evidence were either astonishingly inept or downright corrupt,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but also because of recent scientific developments such as DNA tests which have revealed the limitations of forensic techniques such as hair identification analysis. <em>Mnookin, </em>at 1725. Additionally, Professor Mnookin observes that several of the forensic sciences, including expert handwriting identification and fingerprint analysis, are now being criticized by historians, forensic watchdogs, and law professors who claim that these forensic techniques are not grounded in good science, that they have been inadequately tested, and that their methods have been insufficiently scrutinized. <em>Mnookin, </em>at 1725-26. She states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-6\">Credible arguments have been leveled that these forms of evidence, though routinely used in courtrooms for a century or so, do not withstand scrutiny under <em>Daubert. </em>While no judge has yet excluded fingerprinting evidence on reliability grounds, courts are beginning to rein in handwriting experts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-7\"><em>Mnookin, </em>at 1726-27.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u00b677 It is beyond the scope of this concurrence to exhaustively plumb the reliability (or unreliability) of handwriting comparison analysis. Professor Mnookin and the authorities she cites do an admirable job of that. Rather, a defense attorney must take this issue head on in an actual case, present the expert testimony on the reliability of handwriting comparison analysis, and write and argue the motion <em>in limine. </em>And it will take a trial court that is willing to listen to the evidence and rule on something more of a basis than that upon which courts have admitted handwriting identification testimony for years.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">D. The Case <em>Sub Judice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">\u00b678 This should have been that case, but Clifford\u2019s request for a <em>Daubert </em>hearing on Blanco\u2019s testimony was denied. Under a correct application <em>o\u00ed Daubert </em>the court\u2019s ruling would have been error. But the trial judge followed Montana law. And that brings me back to how we have jurisprudentially and improperly limited <em>Daubert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">\u00b679 In the case at bar there was no showing that handwriting analysis is a \"novel\u201d science or discipline-even though Clifford had problems with how Blanco <em>conducted </em>his analysis. Although <em>Daubert </em>unmistakably covers not only the question of \u201cfield validity\u201d-!.e., whether the expert information is within a valid category of expertise and whether there is a field of knowledge that has credible tools to produce valid answers to questions-Daubert also requires \"method validity.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796. Method validity assumes the validity of the field, but answers the question of whether the methods used in the case were capable of producing valid answers. <em>Daubert </em>and <em>Kumho Tire </em>make method validity a prerequisite for the admission of expert evidence. Expert scientific testimony is admissible under <em>Daubert </em>only if it is the product of reliable principles and methods. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796. In fact, <em>Daubert, Joiner, </em>and <em>Kumho Tire </em>all were concerned with method validity. <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 592-93, 113 S.Ct. at 2796; <em>Joiner, 522 </em>U.S. at 146, 118 S.Ct. at 519; <em>Kumho Tire, </em>526 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>152, 119 S.Ct. at 1176.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b680 Under the trilogy of cases, Clifford was entitled to a <em>Daubert </em>hearing on Blanco\u2019s testimony as to method validity. She, of course, did not get such a hearing because handwriting comparison is not deemed to be \u2018hovel\u201d scientific evidence, inasmuch as it has been admitted in court rooms in this State (and in other states) for years on the assumption it was a valid and reliable discipline.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A1n\">\u00b681 Because of the limitations we have jurisprudentially placed on <em>Daubertdimitmg </em>its application to \u2018hovel\u201dscientific evidence-Clifford\u2019s concern that Blanco\u2019s methodology did not produce valid results could not be the subject of a rigorous <em>Daubert </em>hearing. Rather, under Montana law her concerns would have to be addressed via <em>BarmeyerA.e., </em>through cross-examination and refutation; something she attempted to do with Mark Denbeaux\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b682 And there\u2019s the anomaly. Since the field validity of handwriting comparison, as a discipline, was presumedfi.e., since it was deemed reliablfrthe court effectively determined that expert scientific evidence <em>attacking </em>the validity of Blanco\u2019s methods was \u2018hovel\u201d and, therefore subject to <em>Daubert. </em>Thus, under Montana law, it would have been improper for the trial court to admit Denbeaux\u2019s testimony in front of the jury without a pre-trial <em>Daubert </em>hearing. We\u2019ve turned <em>Daubert </em>on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">E. Summary</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b683 In summary, under a correct application of <em>Daubert, </em>Clifford would have been entitled to a pre-trial <em>Daubert </em>hearing on the validity of Blanco\u2019s methodology. However, because of the manner in which we have limited <em>Daubert </em>(to \u2018hovel\u201d scientific evidence), we placed Clifford in the anomalous position of having to request <em>&amp; Daubert </em>hearing on Denbeaux\u2019s testimony attacking Blanco\u2019s methodology-it was Denbeaux\u2019s theories that were, after all, \u2018hovel.\u201d Since handwriting analysis has long been recognized by courts as generally reliable and admissible, we forced upon Clifford the obligation to demonstrate that handwriting analysis, as a science or disciplinewersus the methodology involved-is unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b684 As noted, Montana\u2019s case law holds that subjecting expert testimony to the rigors of <em>Daubert </em>is necessary only when the science <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>or discipline at issue is \u2018hovel.\u201d We have erred in so limiting <em>Daubert. </em>We live in a world where scholarship and research are, in many cases, debunking conventional wisdom and assumptions about tests, analyses, disciplines and presumptions that the courts have long relied upon, have assumed are grounded in bedrock science and are, therefore, generally reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b685 If a litigant wants to challenge one of these tests, analyses or disciplines via <em>Daubert-be </em>it handwriting analysis, fingerprint analysis, or hair comparison-he or she should have the ability to do so, regardless of whether the test, analyses or discipline is \u2018hovel.\u201d Our limitation on the use of <em>Daubert </em>has put the onus on the challenger-like Clifford^\u00bb prove that a test, analyses, discipline or presumption which is presumed reliable-often for no other reason than that it has been in use or in the courts for a long period of time-is not, in fact, reliable; that it is invalid as a field. Indeed, under our approach, a litigantlike Cliffordhs precluded from attacking the methodology of one of these fields without first successfully attacking the reliability of the field itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b686 This approach turns <em>Daubert </em>on its head; it severely constrains the trial court\u2019s gatekeeping function; and it puts us out of sync with the federal courts. <em>See Sterup, </em>at 479-87. It is time we reconsider our application of <em>Daubert </em>and <em>Barmeyer </em>to expert testimony. The case at bar is a perfect example of why.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">F. Recommendations</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b687 Specifically, we should overrule our case law to the extent that it limits the application of <em>Daubert </em>to \u2018hovel\u201d scientific evidence. <em>Barmeyer, </em>while consistent with <em>Daubert </em>as far as it goes, does not require the sort of rigorous pre-trial standards that should apply when expert evidence is proffered. <em>Barmeyer </em>may be appropriate for non-expert testimony. However, in my view, expert evidence is different than non-expert evidence. We all-jurors included-tend to trust experts, and if there are legitimate questions as to whether the field itself is bogus or whether the methods used by experts do not produce reliable results, then that testimony and evidence should be subject to challenge pre-trial. Many cases involve battles of experts. Neither side should have to contend with \u201cexpert\u201d testimony that is unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b688 Moreover, litigants who wish to challenge some of forensic science\u2019s mainstays-handwriting comparison being the one at issue here-and the intellectual rigor of the \u201cexperts\u201d who testify in those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>fields, should have the ability to do so using <em>Daubert. </em>It may just turn out that handwriting comparison is not any more reliable than eyewitness testimony or the presumption that witnesses speak the truth. Our limitation of <em>Daubert </em>constrains the trial court\u2019s gatekeeping function, and, as noted above, turns <em>Daubert </em>on its head.</p>\n<p id=\"AL9\">\u00b689 We also need to adopt <em>Kumho Tire </em>in the appropriate case. There is no reason that, in Montana, <em>Daubert </em>should not also apply to all expert testimony, not just that involving expert scientific evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AeY\">\u00b690 Finally, we need to amend Rule 702, M.R.Evid. Federal Rule 702, regarding expert testimony, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-4\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, <em>if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMT\">(Emphasis added). Montana\u2019s Rule 702, ends at the word \u201cotherwise,\u201d right before the italicized portion of the Federal Rule 702. We need to amend Montana\u2019s rule to conform to the federal rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b691 I concur because the trial court followed Montana law. It is that law that needs to be changed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-6\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b342-5\"> We have not had occasion to consider <em>Joiner, </em>but our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s evidentiary rulings has historically been that of abuse of discretion. <em>Moore, </em>268 Mont. at 36, 885 P.2d at 467. Whether that standard, or, where expert evidence is involved, a <em>de novo </em>standard of review is better, I leave to another day and another case. Furthermore, I leave to another case the question of whether the gatekeeper should focus its inquiry on simply the proffered scientific evidence at issue or on that evidence taken in the context of the totality of evidence offered.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b343-9\"> In fairness, I cannot claim too much moral high ground here, as I wrote <em>Moore </em>and authored and participated in other cited cases <em>limitingDaubert </em>to \u201cnovel\u201d scientific evidence. In so doing, I will simply admit my error, having researched this issue further, and urge that we undo the mess we have collectively created.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\"> It bears mentioning that the underlying \u201cscience\u201d involved in PBT instruments is not the problem. Rather, it is the lack of training, the failure to set rigorous calibration and testing standards and the actual field use of these instruments that contributes to their being unreliable for substantive evidence purposes. Unfortunately, it will now be a cold day in a hot place before any trial court in Montana refuses to accept PBT evidence in cases after <em>Damon. </em>We\u2019ve declared such evidence reliable as a matter of law and underpaid, overworked and in many cases ill trained and unsophisticated defense attorneys are often not going to do the rigorous job of calling the witnesses and doing the cross-examination necessary to attack, not the science, but the methodology of PBT use. As Justice Cotter predicts, trial judges are simply going to admit PBT results as substantive evidence routinely; and, I predict, will just as routinely deny motions for <em>Daubert </em>hearings on PBT method validity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"pA1O\"> There are numerous examples in the literature but, to cite just a few, there is Fred Zain, a West Virginia forensic serologist who misstated or altered results in more that 130 cases. <em>See In re an Investigation of the </em>W.
