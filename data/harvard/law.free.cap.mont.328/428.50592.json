(Mother), the biological mother of T.H. and C.D.F., appeals from the orders entered by the Fourth Judicial District Court, Missoula County, terminating her parental rights and from subsequent orders. The Department of Public Health and Human Services (Department) moves to dismiss this appeal as untimely or barred by laches. We deny the motion to dismiss and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">\u00b62 We address the following restated issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">\u00b63 1. Is Mother\u2019s appeal untimely or barred by laches?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">\u00b64 2. Given the undisputed findings of fact, did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights based on abandonment?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">\u00b65 3. Did the proceedings comport with relevant statutory and constitutional due process requirements?</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">\u00b66 Mother and L.H. are the biological parents of T.H., and Mother and C.F. are the biological parents of C.D.F. On August 2, 2001, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>District Court entered an order terminating the parent-child legal relationship between Mother and T.H., withdrawing its previous orders regarding L.H. and holding the Child and Family Services Division of the Department financially responsible for the costs of placing T.H. in Washington state with her maternal aunt. The August 2 order included findings and conclusions that the Department failed to provide Mother with an appropriate treatment plan or necessary services, a finding that Mother had abandoned T.H. and a Conclusion-Conclusion #34;hat her parental rights to T.H. should be terminated pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(l)(b), MCA (1999), based on abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b67 On August 7, 2001, the District Court amended its order regarding T.H., including an amended Conclusion #17 that reads, \u2018[Mother\u2019s] parental rights should not be terminated, pursuant to \u00a741-3-604(l)(b), MCA, in as much as [the Department] has not provided the services considered necessary for the date return of [T.H.].\u201d The amendment did not alter any of the court\u2019s findings or Conclusion #3 about the propriety of termination due to abandonment. Also on August 7, the court entered a separate order terminating Mother\u2019s and C.F.\u2019s parental rights to C.D.F. That order included a finding that Mother abandoned C.D.F. and a conclusion that her parental rights should be terminated based on abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b68 The Department appealed with regard to issues not involving Mother. We reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in an unpublished opinion, <em>In re T.H. and C.D.F., </em>2002 MT 293N. On remand, the District Court entered an amended order in April of 2003 which, in pertinent part, retained from the 2001 order both the finding of abandonment of T.H. by Mother and Conclusion #3, that termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights to T.H. based on abandonment was appropriate. The order on remand also replaced the above-referenced Conclusion #17 regarding \u00a7 41-3-604(1)(b), MCA, with a conclusion that reads \u2018[a]s noted abvoe [sic], but for her abandonment of [T.H.], [Mother\u2019s] parental rights could not be terminated.\u201d C.D.F.\u2019s foster parents have since adopted her, and T.H.\u2019s maternal aunt has guardianship of her and plans to adopt her. The record reflects that no one served Mother with notice of entry of judgment regarding the termination of her parental rights to either child at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">\u00b69 On November 18, 2003, Mother filed a verified petition to terminate planned permanent living arrangements, in which she requested the District Court to vacate or void its previous orders placing the children away from her, granting the Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>temporary legal custody (TLC) and terminating her parental rights. The District Court denied the petition. Mother then moved the court to vacate its order denying her petition, set aside the termination order regarding T.H. and hold a new hearing regarding C.D.F. or, alternatively, certify its order as a final determination from which she could appeal. The District Court also denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b610 In May of 2004, Mother filed a notice of appeal from the District Court\u2019s orders terminating her parental rights and denying her subsequent petition and motion. The Department moved to dismiss the appeal as untimely or barred by laches, and Mother responded. We took the motion under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b611 <em>Is Mother\u2019s appeal untimely or barred by laches?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b612 The Department moves to dismiss Mother\u2019s appeal on grounds that it is untimely pursuant to \u00a7 42-2-620, MCA, or, alternatively, barred by the doctrine of laches. Section 42-2-620, MCA, provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq_l\">[s]ubject to the disposition of a timely appeal, upon expiration of 6 months after an order terminating parental rights has been issued, the order may not be questioned by any person, in any manner, or upon any ground, including fraud, misrepresentation, failure to give any required notice, or lack of jurisdiction of the parties or the subject matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b613 In the usual situation where the Department serves a parent whose parental rights have been terminated with notice of entry of judgment, a parent\u2019s appeal long after the termination order is issued is untimely. Rule 5(a)(1), M.R.App.P., requires a party to a civil case to file a notice of appeal within 60 days of service of notice of entry of judgment when such service is required by Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., and the State of Montana is a party. Thus, Rule 5(a)(1), M.R.App.P., ordinarily would preclude an appeal such as Mother\u2019s. The Department properly concedes, however, that Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., mandates our conclusion that the.prevailing party in a child abuse and neglect case must serve notice of entry of judgment on other parties. It further concedes it did not serve notice of entry of judgment on Mother at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">\u00b614 The Department maintains, however, that the relationship between \u00a7 42-2-620, MCA, and the rules of civil and appellate procedure applicable to child abuse and neglect proceedings is analogous to the postconviction relief context. It urges that our analysis in a case involving a petition for postconviction relief, <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number><em>Garner, </em>1999 MT 295, 297 Mont. 89, 990 P.2d 175, also \u201cshould hold true for abuse and neglect cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b615 In <em>Garner, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-25, we determined the 60-day period for appeal from the entry of an order on a petition for postconviction relief, as set forth in \u00a746-21-203, MCA, is a specific statutory requirement which controls over the general provision in Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., requiring service of notice of entry of the judgment or order. We also noted that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201(1)(c), MCA, civil procedure rules apply in postconviction proceedings only if not inconsistent with postconviction statutes. <em>Garner, </em>\u00b6 26. On those bases, we concluded Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., does not apply in postconviction proceedings. <em>Garner, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"AZXp\">\u00b616 [1] Here, unlike in <em>Garner, </em>it is undisputed that Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., applies. Moreover, unlike the statute at issue in <em>Garner, </em>\u00a742-2-620, MCA, does not alter the filing period for timely appeals; it merely sets a 6-month time limit for all other challenges to orders terminating parental rights-a time limit, which, by its terms, is \u201csubject to the disposition of a timely appeal.\u201dPursuant to Rule 5(a)(1), M.R.App.P., Mother\u2019s 60-day time limit for appeal does \u2018hot begin to run until service of notice of entry of judgment.\u201d As a result, the \u00a742-2-620, MCA, 6-month limit on other challenges does not apply to Mother\u2019s timely appeal from the District Court\u2019s orders terminating her parental rights and the underlying proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b617 As a final matter regarding \u00a7 42-2-620, MCA, we address our recent opinion in <em>In re P.D.L., </em>2004 MT 346, 324 Mont. 327, 102 P.3d 1225. There, we recognized \u00a742-2-620, MCA, \u201cattempts to provide finality to the termination of parental rights proceedings so that a child may be safely adopted without the threat of the adoption being set aside at some future date.\u201d We concluded \u00a7 42-2-620, MCA, rendered an order terminating a father\u2019s parental rights \u2018immune to any collateral attacks\u201dmade more than six months after the order was issued, including the father\u2019s Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion for relief from judgment. <em>P.D.L., </em>\u00b6 14. Here, Mother\u2019s appeal from the termination orders is not a collateral attack. It is the direct appeal to which she is entitled pursuant to Rule 5, M.RApp.P., as well as the \u2018timely appeal\u201d recognized in \u00a742-2-620, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b618 We conclude \u00a742-2-620, MCA, does not bar Mother\u2019s appeal from the District Court\u2019s orders terminating her parental rights. For that reason, we need not address Mother\u2019s appeal from the court\u2019s later orders on her petition and motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b619 The Department also contends, however, that the equitable doctrine of laches bars Mother\u2019s appeal. It relies on <em>In re Marriage of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number><em>Deist, </em>2003 MT 263, \u00b6 17, 317 Mont. 427, \u00b6 17, 77 P.3d 525, \u00b6 17, and <em>Cole v. State ex rel. Brown, </em>2002 MT 32, \u00b6 24, 308 Mont. 265, \u00b6 24, 42 P.3d 760, \u00b6 24, for the proposition that laches applies when a party is actually or presumptively aware of his or her rights and fails to act until such a delay has occurred as to render enforcement of the asserted right inequitable. The Department asserts letters from the District Court to Mother indicate she was aware in 2002 that her parental rights had been terminated, and she took no action until November of 2003. The letters from the District Court first appeared in the record as attachments to Mother\u2019s motion to vacate the denial of her post-termination petition. Having concluded we need only address Mother\u2019s appeal from the court\u2019s orders terminating her parental rights to T.H. and C.D.F., we further conclude the District Court\u2019s letters are outside the scope of the record relevant to Mother\u2019s direct appeal from the termination orders and, therefore, we decline to consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b620 Were we to consider post-termination matters, however, we observe the Department advances no authority for applying the equitable doctrine of laches in a child abuse and neglect case involving a timely appeal. Moreover, we note laches is an equitable doctrine, and \u201cparties must not expect relief in equity, unless they come into court with clean hands.\u2019\u201d <em>Cowan v. Cowan, </em>2004 MT 97, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 13, \u00b6 16, 89 P.3d 6, \u00b6 16 <em>(quoting Kauffman-Harmon v. Kauffman, </em>2001 MT 238, \u00b6 19, 307 Mont. 45, \u00b6 19, 36 P.3d 408, \u00b6 19) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Department\u2019s hands are hardly pristine in the present case, since it failed on several occasions to discharge its simple affirmative duty under Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., to serve notice of entry of judgment on Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b621 The Department further argues the best interests of the child are paramount and ^Mother\u2019s] legal right to appeal does not discharge her affirmative duty to act in the best interests of her child.\u201d This argument is wholly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b622  Unlike the Department, which had an affirmative duty to serve Mother with notice of entry of judgment, Mother had no \u201caffirmative duty\u201d under the law to file a notice of appeal before receiving service of notice of entry of judgment. Further, a parent\u2019s right to the care and custody of a child is a fundamental liberty interest which must be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. <em>See, e.g., In re V.F.A., </em>2005 MT 76, \u00b6 6, 326 Mont. 383, \u00b6 6, 109 P.3d 749, \u00b6 6 (citation omitted). The best interests of the child are paramount in child abuse and neglect cases, but the Department may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>not simply void a parent\u2019s fundamental liberty interest by forgoing required procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b623 Finally, the Department asserts this case is similar to <em>In Interest of E.H. </em>(Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1992), 591 So.2d 1097, 1098-99, in which a Florida appellate court denied a mother\u2019s request for a belated appeal after her counsel filed a notice of appeal one day late. The issue here is not whether this Court should grant a \u2018belated\u201d appeal; Mother\u2019s appeal is timely due to the Department\u2019s failure to serve her with notice of entry of judgment. Furthermore, the intermediate appellate court in <em>E.H. </em>certified the issue to the Florida Supreme Court, which granted the belated appeal based on \u201cthe significant policy interest in ensuring that a parent and child are not separated without a thorough review of the merits of the case.\u201d <em>In Interest of E.H. </em>(Fla. 1992), 609 So.2d 1289, 1291. Thus, the Florida Supreme Court essentially reversed the intermediate court\u2019s ruling, and the State\u2019s reliance on it is misplaced for that reason as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b624  We conclude Mother\u2019s appeal from the termination of her parental rights is timely and is not barred by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b625 <em>2. Given the undisputed findings of fact, did the District Court abuse its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights based on abandonment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">\u00b626 In reviewing a district court\u2019s termination of parental rights, we determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous, whether the conclusions of law are correct and whether the court abused its discretion in ordering termination. <em>In re J.B.K., </em>2004 MT 202, \u00b6 13, 322 Mont. 286, \u00b6 13, 95 P.3d 699, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\u00b627 As a prehminary matter, the Department asserts this appeal should be dismissed because Mother has not provided an adequate record for review, as required by Rule 9, M.R.App.P. In response, Mother states she is contesting the District Court\u2019s conclusions, not its findings. Consequently, we will address Mother\u2019s issues in that limited context.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">\u00b628 Highlighting Finding #72 of the August 2, 2001 order, Mother asserts she was \u2018frustrated\u201d in her attempts to visit her children and contends her difficulties with visitation cannot \u2018be used to sustain a finding of\u2018abandonment.\u2019 \u201d As just stated, however, Mother does not challenge any findings. In any event, we note Finding #72 does not concern her visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">\u00b629 The District Court found Mother stipulated to the TLC in August of 2000, left Missoula in late November or early December of 2000, had not been located in any out-of-state treatment facility, contacted T.H. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>only twice between March of 2000 and April of 2001, and did not contact C.D.F. or Department workers after late November of2000. In each of its termination orders, the court also made an ultimate finding that Mother abandoned the child and a conclusion that her parental rights should be terminated based on abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">\u00b630  Section 41-3-102(1), MCA (1999), defines abandonment to include \u2018leaving a child under circumstances that make reasonable the belief that the parent does not intend to resume care of the child in the future.\u201d Section 41-3-609(l)(b), MCA (1999), authorizes a court to terminate parental rights upon finding the parent has abandoned the child. We conclude the District Court\u2019s unchallenged findings support its conclusions that Mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated based on abandonment and, therefore, those conclusions are not incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">\u00b631 Mother asserts, however, that the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding abandonment are inconsistent with its findings and conclusions that her treatment plan was not appropriate, the Department had not made reasonable efforts to address her addiction and the parties did not file an agreement regarding T.H.\u2019s placement. We disagree that such an inconsistency exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">\u00b632 A district court may terminate parental rights pursuant to \u00a741-3-609(1)(b), MCA (1999), upon finding the parent has abandoned the child or, pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA (1999), upon finding the child is an adjudicated youth in need of care, the parent has not successfully completed an appropriate court-approved treatment plan and the parent\u2019s conduct or condition rendering him or her unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Here, the District Court\u2019s findings about the treatment plan and the Department\u2019s actions relate to the propriety of terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(f), MCA (1999). Mother\u2019s parental rights were terminated based on abandonment, pursuant to \u00a741-3-609(1)(b), MCA (1999), a separate and independent basis for termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">\u00b633  Having determined the District Court did not err in concluding Mother\u2019s parental rights should be terminated based on abandonment, we hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion in terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">\u00b634 <em>3. Did the proceedings comport with relevant statutory and constitutional due process requirements ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">\u00b635 Mother contends the proceedings did not satisfy relevant statutory requirements and violated her constitutional right to due process. We review a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>statutes for correctness. <em>State ex rel. Montana DOT v. Asbeck, </em>2003 MT 337, \u00b6 10, 318 Mont. 431, \u00b6 10, 80 P.3d 1272, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted). Our review of questions of constitutional law is plenary. <em>In re A.S., </em>2004 MT 62, \u00b6 9, 320 Mont. 268, \u00b6 9, 87 P.3d 408, \u00b6 9 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">\u00b636 Mother first asserts the District Court neither properly adjudicated the children as youths in need of care nor found they were abused or neglected. We addressed a similar argument in <em>Matter of M.J.W., </em>1998 MT 142, 289 Mont. 232, 961 P.2d 105, another case involving termination of parental rights based on abandonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u00b637 In <em>M.J.W., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-14, we first determined the district court erred in terminating a father\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a741-3-609(1)(c), MCA (1995), the statutory predecessor to \u00a741-3-609(1)(f), MCA (1999), because that statute required the court to find, among other things, that the child had been adjudicated a youth in need of care, and the record reflected no such adjudication. Then, however, we concluded the court properly terminated the father\u2019s parental rights pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(1)(b), MCA (1995), based on abandonment, without a prior adjudication of the child as a youth in need of care. <em>M.J.W., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-22. In so doing, we determined the father failed to establish error in the district court\u2019s findings or conclusion regarding abandonment. <em>M.J. </em>W., \u00b6\u00b6 15-18. Then, after tracing relevant statutes, we concluded the district court\u2019s determination that the father abandoned the child satisfied \u00a741-3-602, MCA (1995), which required a determination that the child is \u201cabused or neglected.\u201d <em>M.J.W., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u00b638  In <em>M.J.W., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-18, we implicitly recognized that \u00a741-3-609(1)(b), MCA (1995), did not, by its terms, require a youth in need of care adjudication before termination of parental rights based on abandonment. Section 41-3-609(1)(b), MCA (1999), is identical to \u00a741-3-609(1)(b), MCA (1995), except that the 1995 version cross-referenced a statutory definition of \u201cabandon\u201d and the 1999 version does not. With respect to the \u201cabused or neglected\u201d determination issue, the 1995 statutes traced in <em>M.J.W., </em>\u00b6 20, are also substantially similar to the 1999 statutes applicable here. Given the similarity between the 1995 and 1999 statutes, we conclude our analysis in <em>M.J.W. </em>applies here. Thus, we further conclude the District Court was not required to adjudicate the children as youths in need of care before terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights based on abandonment, and its findings of abandonment in the termination orders constituted the required \u201cabused or neglected\u201d determinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">\u00b639 Having concluded an adjudication of the children as youths in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>need of care was not required to support termination based on abandonment, we need not determine whether such an adjudication actually occurred. For the same reason, we also need not address Mother\u2019s argument that the District Court Tacked jurisdiction to approve any treatment plan or to proceed whatsoever and under Montana law, the children should have been returned to [Mother] immediately.\u201d In any event, however, we note Mother does not challenge the District Court\u2019s statement in its TLC order that Mother\u2019s counsel \u201cadvised that her clients had no objections to the treatment plans ... or the granting of the [TLC].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b640 Mother next argues the District Court violated statutory requirements by awarding TLC to the Department without first holding a hearing and making required findings. Contrary to Mother\u2019s assertion, the District Court held a hearing on the petition for TLC on August 11,2000, with Mother and her counsel in attendance. Further, as stated above, Mother\u2019s counsel expressly did not oppose the grant of TLC and, thus, Mother has waived this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u00b641 Mother also asserts the TLC exceeded the six-month statutory time limit set forth in \u00a741-3-406(5), MCA (1999). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">\u00b642 The District Court granted TLC in an order dated August 23, 2000. Section 41-3-406(5), MCA (1999), provides, in part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">[a]n order for [TLC] may be in effect for no longer than 6 months. Before the expiration of the order for [TLC], the county attorney ... shall petition for one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-10\">(b) termination of the parent-child legal relationship[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">The Department petitioned for termination of Mother\u2019s parental rights on February 7, 2001, which was within six months of District Court\u2019s TLC order. We conclude the order for TLC did not exceed the time limit in \u00a741-3-406(5), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">\u00b643 Mother also asserts the guardian ad litem failed to perform certain statutory duties prior to the termination and this failure denied her the ability to present evidence and argument that reunification was in her children\u2019s best interests. However, she does not advance any authority, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., for her position that a guardian ad litem\u2019s performance of his or her duties has any bearing on a parent\u2019s ability to present evidence or argument at a hearing. Thus, we need not address this assertion further.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">\u00b644 Next, relying on \u00a741-3-412, MCA (1999), Mother asserts she did not receive proper notice of the April 23, 2001, hearing on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Department\u2019s petition to terminate her parental rights. She asserts she was not personally served, although her attorney, the public defender \u201cand/or\u201d her probation officer allegedly knew her whereabouts. She also contends service by publication was faulty because the District Court allegedly did not receive the affidavit of publication until one week after the hearing and, despite the social worker\u2019s belief that Mother was in Pierce County, Washington, the service by publication appeared in <em>The Seattle Times, </em>which is based in King County. Finally, she notes the District Court ordered service by publication in the \u2018Montana Independent,\u201d a newspaper that she asserts does not exist. \u00b645 Section 41-3-412, MCA (1999), on which Mother relies, does not relate to notice of hearings. A district court\u2019s decision is presumed correct, and the appellant bears the burden of establishing error. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00b6 18 (citations omitted). Mother has not met her burden of establishing error regarding notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u00b646 Mother also asserts that the April 23,2001 hearing on the petition to terminate did not meet the time requirements set forth in \u00a741-3-412, MCA (1999). She is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b647 Section 41-3-412(1), MCA (1999), authorizes a permanency plan hearing to be combined with another required hearing-in the present case, a hearing on the petition to terminate-and requires that the hearing take place \u201cno later than 12 months after the initial court finding that the child has been subjected to abuse or neglect or 12 months after the child\u2019s first 60 days of removal from the home, whichever comes first[.]\u201dHere, the children were removed from Mother in March of 2000. Sixty days later was in May of 2000, and 12 months after that was in May of 2001. Because the hearing occurred in April of 2001, we conclude it was timely under \u00a741-3-412(1), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"A0N\">\u00b648 Mother also argues the District Court violated \u00a741-3-412(3), MCA (1999), by terminating her parental rights to T.H. in its 2003 order on remand from this Court without first providing her with notice of a permanency plan hearing at which she could submit an informational report about the children\u2019s placements and best interests. Underlying this argument is Mother\u2019s assertion that the District Court terminated her parental rights to T.H. on August 2, 2001, \u201cunterminated\u201d those rights in the August 7, 2001 amendment to the August 2 order, and then \u2018ire-terminated\u201d them in the 2003 order on remand from the Department\u2019s appeal. We observe that the District Court\u2019s 2004 post-termination orders-which, as noted above, are beyond the scope of the record for purposes of this appeal-undoubtedly contributed to Mother\u2019s confusion in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>\u00b649 In the August 7 amendment, the court corrected three errors which were essentially clerical in nature: (1) changing the word \u2018inappropriate\u201dto \u201cappropriate\u201d; (2) capitalizing a witness\u2019s name; and (3) changing the word \u2018terminate\u201d to \u2018terminated\u201d in Conclusion #17, as set forth above. These amendments in no way affected the District Court\u2019s finding that Mother abandoned T.H., its conclusion that Mother\u2019s parental rights to T.H. should be terminated based on abandonment, or that portion of the August 2, 2001 order which terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights to T.H.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b650 In the 2003 order on remand, the District Court properly altered its findings and conclusions relating to the issues raised in the Department\u2019s appeal-namely, L.H.\u2019s parental rights to T.H. and the propriety of T.H.\u2019s placement in Washington. The court retained from the 2001 order the findings regarding Mother\u2019s abandonment of T.H., the conclusion that her parental rights should be terminated based on abandonment and the order terminating her parental rights. As noted above, the court replaced Conclusion #17 from the 2001 order with a conclusion that, \u2018but for\u201d the abandonment, her parental rights could not be terminated. This clarification did not constitute a substantive change which would warrant Mother\u2019s participation in a hearing. Thus, we conclude the 2003 order on remand did not violate \u00a741-3-412(3), MCA (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b651 Mother next argues that certain aspects of the proceedings discussed above violated her constitutional right to due process. She relies on <em>In re D.V., </em>2003 MT 160, \u00b6 14, 316 Mont. 282, \u00b6 14, 70 P.3d 1253, \u00b6 14 (citation omitted), in asserting parental rights constitute a fundamental liberty interest to be protected by fundamentally fair procedures. Other than this general citation to <em>D.V., </em>however, Mother advances only statutory authority. Since we have concluded Mother has not established error in the asserted statutory violations addressed above, we decline to address this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b652 Finally, relying on <em>A.S., </em>Mother asserts her due process rights were violated because she allegedly did not have adequate representation once her retained counsel withdrew after the 2001 orders and the District Court appointed a public defender without notifying the defender. In A.S., \u00b6 12 (citations omitted), we recognized due process requires that a parent not be placed at an unfair disadvantage during termination proceedings, and fundamental fairness requires that a parent be represented by counsel at proceedings to terminate parental rights. Analogizing to <em>In re Mental Health </em>of K.G.F., 2001 MT 140, 306 Mont. 1, 29 P.3d 485, we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the constitutional basis for the right to effective assistance of counsel in termination proceedings is the due process clause. <em>A.S., </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b653  As discussed above, the District Court terminated Mother\u2019s parental rights to both T.H. and C.D.F. in 2001, and the order on remand in 2003 did not substantively alter either of the 2001 orders with respect to Mother. Mother had counsel through the time of the termination orders in August of 2001, and she has counsel on direct appeal from those orders. Thus, her contention that she has been denied her right to adequate counsel, resulting in a due process violation, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b654 We hold Mother has not established that the proceedings did not comport with relevant statutory and constitutional due process requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b655 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b448-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
