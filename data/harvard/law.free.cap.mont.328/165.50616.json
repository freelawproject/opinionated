The State alleged that Garrett altered two checks received by her former employer, Chester Brown (Brown), while Garrett was employed by Brown as a live-in housekeeper. One check had been altered from $50 to $5,000 and the other from $100 to $100,000. The State also alleged that Garrett had forged Brown\u2019s signature on an account transfer slip which caused $100,000 to be transferred from Brown\u2019s saving account to his checking account with Norwest Bank in Great Falls, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b65 Garrett entered not guilty pleas to the charges, and a jury trial ensued on October 13,1998. The jury found Garrett guilty of all three forgery counts. On November 30,1998, Garrett was sentenced to three concurrent ten-year sentences, with eight years suspended on each. \u00b66 Garrett appealed to this Court, asserting that her trial counsel, Joseph Gilligan (Gilligan), had rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. This Court determined that the ineffective assistance of counsel issues raised in the appeal involved non-record factual issues and dismissed the appeal on August 9, 2001, without prejudice to the filing of a petition for postconviction relief. <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b67 On September 4, 2001, Garrett filed a petition for postconviction relief. The State responded by requesting a summary dismissal of the petition, which was denied by the District Court on December 11,2002. On July 14, 2003, an evidentiary hearing on the petition was held wherein both Garrett and Gilligan testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b68 On September 29, 2003, the District Court denied Garrett\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. Garrett appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">\u00b69 Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are mixed questions of law and fact, and are therefore reviewed <em>de novo. State v. Lucero, </em>2004 MT 248, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 42, \u00b6 12, 97 P.3d 1106, \u00b6 12. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are analyzed under the two-prong test adopted from <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674, which includes: (1) that the defendant bears the burden of showing that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient or fell below the objective standard of reasonableness; and (2) the defendant must show that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s deficient performance. <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15. We note that there is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6 70, 315 Mont. 452, \u00b6 70, 69 P.3d 1162, \u00b6 70 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief by determining whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Morgan, </em>2003 MT 193, \u00b6 7, 316 Mont. 509, <em>\u00b6 </em>7, 74 P.3d 1047, \u00b6 7. A petitioner seeking to reverse a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief \u2018bears a heavy burden.\u201d <em>State v. Cobell, </em>2004 MT 46, \u00b6 14, 320 Mont. 122, \u00b6 14, 86 P.3d 20, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in denying Garrett\u2019s postconviction relief petition, alleging that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by:</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b612 (a) Lack of preparation and deficient presentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\u00b613 The defense theory offered by Gilligan at trial was that the checks had been altered, but that Brown had authorized the alterations. Garrett argues that Gilligan failed to effectuate this defense theory because he made several pre-trial and trial errors, including failing to: (1) carefully investigate and analyze the facts; (2) establish a theory for the defense; and (3) make an opening statement. Garrett asserts that the defense theory was not \u2018judiciously repeated\u201d or properly developed during voir dire, opening statement, witness examination and summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">\u00b614 The State first notes that Gilligan has over twenty years experience as a criminal defense attorney, and that his decisions regarding trial presentation were made pursuant to and consistent with a strategy designed to show that Brown authorized the alterations. The State offers that Gilligan furthered the defense theory by at least previewing the theory with the jury in voir dire, by proposing jury instructions covering agency principles, challenging the circumstances under which Brown signed forgery affidavits for his bank, and by furthering the theory in closing argument. Moreover, the State offers that Gilligan prepared an opening statement, but, for strategic reasons, decided to reserve the statement, opting to respond to the prosecution\u2019s opening statement in his closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">\u00b615  This Cotut has previously concluded that \u201c[t]he decision whether to make an opening statement and when to make it is ordinarily a matter of trial tactics and strategy which will not form the</p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Dawson v. State, </em>2000 MT 219, \u00b6 99, 301 Mont. 135, \u00b6 99, 10 P.3d 49, \u00b6 99. Further, we conclude from the record that Gilligan\u2019s theory of defense was communicated to the jury throughout his trial presentation. As such, his assistance did not fall \u2018below the objective standard of reasonableness\u201d required to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15. Because Garrett failed to meet the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test, we need not address the second prong. <em>State v. Osterloth, </em>2000 MT 129, \u00b6 33, 299 Mont. 517, \u00b6 33, 1 P.3d 946, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"Ame\">\u00b616 (b) Failure to make timely hearsay objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b617 On day two of Garrett\u2019s trial, the State moved for admission of its proposed exhibits 7, 8, and 9-three forgery affidavits which Brown\u2019s bank required that he execute to obtain reimbursement. The State called witnesses to describe the contents of the exhibits, which testimony included Brown\u2019s statements about the exhibits, because Brown had died prior to trial. Garrett argues that this foundational hearsay testimony was \u201cparticularly damning,\u2019\u2019and that Gilligan failed to: (1) timely object on the basis of hearsay to prevent Brown\u2019s words and reactions from being discussed; (2) perpetuate Brown\u2019s testimony prior to trial through a deposition, even though he knew Brown was terminally ill; (3) interview or depose any of the State\u2019s witnesses before trial, even though discovery revealed the potential subject of their testimony; and (4) research the law regarding hearsay statements from decedent witnesses prior to trial, a failure Garrett contends resulted in a violation of Garrett\u2019s constitutional right to confront witnesses. Thus, Garrett argues that Gilligan\u2019s decisions were made on the basis of \u201cneglect and ignorance,\u201d violating <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aq6\">\u00b618 The State replies that Gilligan sought to undermine the prosecution\u2019s efforts to lay a foundation for the forgery affidavits. The State explains that Gilligan established, through cross-examination of one of the witnesses, that the witness never saw Brown sign the affidavits, that they were merely form documents, and that Brown needed to execute them to get the money back from the bank. Further, the State notes that Gilligan\u2019s objection to admission of the affidavits was ultimately granted on the grounds that the affidavits violated Garrett\u2019s constitutional right of confrontation. The State also offers that the District Court\u2019s decision to allow testimony from witnesses as to Brown\u2019s excited utterances in connection with the forgery affidavits was not prejudicial because it was cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b619  This Court has previously held that \u201cdecisions regarding the timing and number of objections lie within counsel\u2019s tactical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>discretion.\u201d <em>Watson v. State, </em>2002 MT 329, \u00b6 22, 313 Mont. 209, \u00b6 22, 61 P.3d 759, \u00b6 22. Though he may not have handled the issue in the manner which Garrett now believes was preferable, it is clear that Gilligan made objection on the basis of hearsay regarding the forgery affidavits. Gilligan\u2019s objection succeeded in convincing the District Court to exclude the affidavits and give a cautionary instruction to the jury that it should ignore testimony regarding the contents of exhibits 7, 8, and 9. Because such objections involve strategic decisions on the basis of counsel\u2019s discretion, we will not analyze whether such decisions were, in hindsight, reasonable, or whether they were sufficient in number. Thus, we conclude that Gilligan\u2019s performance did not fall \u2018below the objective standard of reasonableness\u201d required to establish ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b620 (c) Failure to obtain a defense expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b621 Garrett argues that Gilligan\u2019s representation was ineffective because he failed to retain a handwriting expert for the defense. Garrett notes that she urged Gilligan to hire a defense expert and offered to advance $1,500 to obtain one. Garrett also asserts that Gilligan failed to interview the State\u2019s handwriting expert Beverly Medved (Medved). Garrett contends that Gilligan\u2019s cross-examination was \u2018hot effective enough\u201d to undermine Medved\u2019s opinion, which prejudiced the outcome of the trial. The State replies that Gilligan prepared for Medved\u2019s testimony based upon Medved\u2019s written report, anticipated her testimony, and effectively cross-examined Medved at trial by limiting the scope of her testimony to certain exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b622  In her civil deposition, Garrett admitted to making alterations to the documents at issue, and she did not deny that alterations were made in her criminal trial. Thus, both sides acknowledged the alterations by Garrett, and, therefore, a handwriting expert was not needed to establish that Garrett had not altered the documents. Moreover, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Gilligan could have engaged an expert with contrary opinions to the State\u2019s expert. Consequently, we conclude that it is not established that Gilligan\u2019s performance fell \u2018below the objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b623 (d) Failure to offer adequate jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b624 Garrett argues that Gilligan\u2019s proposed jury instructions were insufficient because Gilligan did not offer a \u201ctheory of the case\u201d instruction and failed to request instructions related to possible affirmative defenses. Garrett argues that Gilligan\u2019s performance in this regard was ineffective pursuant to this Court\u2019s holding in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number><em>Rogers, </em>2001 MT 165, 306 Mont. 130, 32 P.3d 724, wherein we held that the \u201cfailure to offer [a] potentially beneficial instruction, when that failure is not part of counsel\u2019s trial strategy, is an error so serious that it falls outside the range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases.\u201d <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b625 The State responds that Gilligan submitted ten proposed jury instructions, including three instructions on agency, which were tailored to the theory of the defense. Of the ten instructions Gilligan requested, five were given by the District Court, including all three agency instructions. The State contends that Garrett\u2019s reliance on <em>Rogers </em>is misplaced because, in contrast to the defense counsel in <em>Rogers, </em>Gilligan consciously and tactically chose to offer instructions adapted to the theory of the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b626  This Court will not \u201csecond guess tactical decisions made by defense counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Weaver, </em>2001 MT 115, \u00b6 12, 305 Mont. 315, \u00b6 12, 28 P.3d 451, \u00b6 12. Gilligan offered ten proposed jury instructions, including those which furthered the chosen defense theory. Thus, we conclude that Gilligan\u2019s performance was well within strategical parameters and did not fall below an \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b627 (e) Failure to assert affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b628 Garrett argues that her trial counsel failed to assert affirmative or statutory defenses, specifically mentioning one-the defense of consent, pursuant to \u00a745-2-211(1), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garrett asserts that because the two altered checks were intended as gifts and that Brown instructed her to alter the checks to reflect larger amounts, she acted with his consent. Garrett argues that Gilligan failed to assert this affirmative defense, which constituted deficient representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b629 The State responds that the defense\u2019s theory was not that Brown consented to the forgeries, but that no forgeries occurred. That is, the State explains that, in order to convict Garrett of forgery, it had to prove that she acted \u201cwithout authority\u201d when she altered or delivered documents \u201cwith [the] purpose to defraud\u201d Brown. Section 45-6-325(l)(a) and (b), MCA. Thus, the State argues that Gilligan\u2019s proposed jury instructions regarding certain agency principles adequately presented the defense that Garrett, acting as Brown\u2019s agent, altered the documents with Brown\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b630 As mentioned, this Court will not second guess trial tactics and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>strategy. <em>Weaver, </em>\u00b6 12. Though Garrett may now object to Gilligan\u2019s method or approach, the theory that Garrett had acted with Brown\u2019s approval was furthered by Gilligan throughout the trial. We cannot conclude that a failure to offer a \u201cconsent\u201d defense instead of or in addition to Gilligan\u2019s other efforts under such circumstances fell below an \u201cobjective standard of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b631 (f) Failure to call witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b632 Garrett testified at the postconviction evidentiary hearing that she had wanted to testify in her defense at the criminal trial, but that Gilligan told her it was not in her best interest to testify. She claimed she was angry over this issue, but followed Gilligan\u2019s advice. Garrett also claimed that Vernon Sumner (Sumner), who had lived with Garrett and Brown for a month or so, witnessed Brown creating the $100,000 check and withdrawal slip and had told Gilligan he was willing to testify. However, Gilligan did not call either as a witness, which Garrett contends was critical to an effective defense, and did not interview any other potential defense witnesses, and, therefore, did not put on a case-in-chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b633 Contrary to Garrett\u2019s version of events, Gilligan testified at the postconviction hearing that he discussed with Garrett her right to testify in the criminal trial, but that she refused to testify. Gilligan also explained that he chose not to call Sumner as a defense witness because Garrett decided she did not want Sumner to testify and, farther, that Gilligan had concerns regarding Sumner\u2019s effectiveness as a witness, due to memory problems. About these factual disputes, Garrett argues that \u201c[i]t is not credible to believe that [she] would refuse to testify when her testimony was so critical to her defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AOV\">\u00b634 The State notes the testimony that Gilligan had several conversations with Garrett regarding her anticipated testimony; however, after the prosecution rested its case, Garrett informed Gilligan that she did not want to testify. Moreover, Garrett was unable to provide Gilligan with names of any possible defense witnesses who had personal knowledge about Brown\u2019s inclination of gifting $105,000 to Garrett, with exception of one, Sumner, and there was evidence that both Garrett and Gilligan had agreed that Sumner would not make a good witness. Even though Garrett contends she was adamant about testifying and that Gilligan did not let her do so, the State argues that Gilligan\u2019s testimony was a sufficient basis for the District Court to reject Garrett\u2019s contention. The State argues that Garrett lacked credibility, which explains her \u201coutrageous\u201d accusations against Gilligan, and that the District Court properly accepted Gilligan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>testimony explaining his actions and inactions during trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b635  \u2018The weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are exclusively within the province of the trier of fact.\u201d <em>State v. Pitzer, </em>2002 MT 82, \u00b6 13, 309 Mont. 285, \u00b6 13, 46 P.3d 582, \u00b6 13. Garrett\u2019s version of the events at trial was implicitly rejected in favor of Gilligan\u2019s version by the District Court, which concluded that \u2018[cjonsideration of the testimony of Joseph Gilligan at the July 14 hearing, answering the why of his actions or inaction\u201d was sufficient to reject Garrett\u2019s claims as failing to \u201crebut the \u2018strong presumption\u2019 that Joseph Gilligan rendered adequate assistance to Defendant and made all decisions \u2018in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u2019 \u2019\u2019Though the District Court did not enter a finding on this specific factual contention, this Court relies upon, in postconviction matters, the \u201cdoctrine of implied findings which states that where a court\u2019s findings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the judgment, are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Wright, </em>2001 MT 282, \u00b6 9, 307 Mont. 349, \u00b6 9, 42 P.3d 753, \u00b6 9. The District Court, after reviewing the trial court record, determined that Gilligan adequately answered and explained his actions and inactions in light of the claims against his representation and denied Garrett\u2019s petition. We conclude that Gilligan\u2019s decisions regarding potential witnesses did not fall below an objective standard of reasonableness required to find ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Lucero, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b636  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous and its conclusions of law were correct.
