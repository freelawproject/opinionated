We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">\u00b62 We consider the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">\u00b63 1. Whether the Order refusing to hold Rodney in contempt is an appealable order under \u00a73-1-523, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court blatantly abused its discretion in refusing to hold Rodney in contempt for his failure to pay the VA disability benefits, in light of Montana and federal authority preempting state courts from including VA disability benefits in the equitable division of a marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-16\">\u00b65 Cynthia and Rodney divorced on October 29, 1997, when the District Court entered a Decree of Dissolution. The Decree incorporated a Property Settlement Agreement and an Addendum thereto (together the \u201cAgreement\u2019), executed on September 12,1997, and October 7, 1997, respectively. The Agreement provided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>Cynthia would receive a portion of Rodney\u2019s Air Force retirement benefits and a portion of Rodney\u2019s VA disability benefits as a part of the equitable distribution of their marital estate. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Department of Defense was to pay the share of retirement benefits directly to Cynthia and Rodney was to pay the share of VA disability benefits to Cynthia on a monthly basis. Neither the Agreement nor the Decree provided for any maintenance or child support payments, and custody and visitation were not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b66 Rodney first failed to make a number of the VA disability payments to Cynthia in 2002. He made only partial payments of the VA disability benefits through the rest of 2002 and all of2003, and he stopped making those payments altogether in 2004. Rodney remained current on all other payments under the Agreement. Cynthia brought this action in the District Court, seeking to hold Rodney in contempt for failing to make the VA disability payments pursuant to the Agreement. The District Court held a hearing at which the parties presented evidence and made oral arguments. The District Court denied the request for contempt and Cynthia appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b67 Contempt orders in family law cases may be appealed \u201conly when the judgment or order appealed from includes an ancillary order that affects the substantial rights of the parties involved.\u201d Section 3-1-523(2), MCA. Where we review a district court\u2019s decision <em>not </em>to find a party in contempt, we will not reverse the decision absent a blatant abuse of discretion. <em>In Re Marriage of Baer, </em>1998 MT 29, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 287 Mont. 322, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 954 P.2d 1125, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo, </em>seeking to determine whether the court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Marriage of Strong v. Strong, </em>2000 MT 178, \u00b6 11, 300 Mont. 331, \u00b6 11, 8 P.3d 763, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Barker </em>(1994), 264 Mont. 110, 113, 870 P.2d 86, 88).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b68 We first determine whether the Order denying the request for contempt is an appealable order. This analysis requires us to determine whether the court\u2019s Order denying the Motion for Contempt includes an ancillary order affecting the substantial rights of the parties. Section 3-1-523(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b69 The District Court denied Cynthia\u2019s Motion for Contempt because the District Court, following our decision in <em>Strong, </em>did not have \u2018the authority to enforce the Property Settlement Agreement between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>parties as it concerns the division of [Rodney\u2019s] military disability benefits.\u201d In <em>Strong </em>we recognized that federal law, specifically the Uniformed Services Former Spouses\u2019 Protection Act, 10 U.S.C. \u00a71408 (USFSPA), and 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5301 (providing that VA benefits are exempt from the claims of creditors), preempts the state from distributing VA benefits as a part of the marital estate. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 27 (following <em>Mansell v. Mansell </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 581, 109 S.Ct. 2023, 104 L.Ed.2d 675); <em>see also In re Marriage of Murphy </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 363, 862 P.2d 1143.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b610  We generally reject the direct appeal of a contempt order in a dissolution of marriage case that goes purely to the district court\u2019s contempt power and does not \u201cadjudicate any ancillary matters falling within [the court\u2019s] continuing jurisdiction over the rights of the parties ....\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Grounds v. Coward, </em>2000 MT 128, \u00b6 9, 300 Mont. 1, \u00b6 9, 2 P.3d 822, \u00b6 9. Direct appeal of a contempt order is appropriate only where \u201ca court in a single judgment, issues an order of contempt ... and an ancillary order within its jurisdiction in determining the rights of the parties ....\u201d <em>Grounds, </em>\u00b6 6 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b611  Here the District Court ruled on Cynthia\u2019s request for contempt and in so doing adjudicated additional matters relating to federal preemption of the division of VA disability benefits in the Agreement and Decree. The District Court\u2019s determination affects the substantial rights of the parties under the Agreement and Decree, most significantly Cynthia\u2019s, as the Order refusing to hold Rodney in contempt does not stand as a mere lone contempt order.\u201d <em>See Lee v. Lee, </em>2000 MT 67, \u00b6 37, 299 Mont. 78, \u00b6 37, 996 P.2d 389, \u00b6 37 (a lone contempt order\u201d may not be reviewed on direct appeal). Instead, the District Court\u2019s denial of the contempt depends on, or is \u201cancillary\u2019to, the District Court\u2019s ruling on federal preemption affecting the enforceability of the Agreement and Decree. We therefore conclude that the District Court\u2019s Order denying Cynthia\u2019s Motion for Contempt is appealable, as it includes an ancillary order affecting the parties\u2019 substantial rights. <em>Grounds, </em>\u00b6 6; <em>Lee, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b612 We next must determine whether the District Court\u2019s refusal to hold Rodney in contempt constituted a \u2018blatant abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Baer, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-45. We evaluate whether the trial court acted arbitrarily or exceeded the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice. <em>State v. Kearney, </em>2005 MT 171, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 485, \u00b6 12, 115 P.3d 214, \u00b6 12. The District Court\u2019s Order denying the request for contempt hinges on its legal conclusions regarding federal preemption and our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>decision in <em>Strong. </em>Ultimately, then, we must determine <em>de novo </em>the legal question of whether the District Court correctly interpreted <em>Strong, </em>as the refusal to hold Rodney in contempt turns on whether federal law preempts the division of VA disability benefits as a part of the marital estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b613 The evidence shows that the Agreement and Decree required Rodney to pay VA disability benefits as a part of the equitable distribution of the marital estate. The evidence shows that Rodney entered into such Agreement and Decree voluntarily, and willingly made those payments for several years. The evidence further shows that Rodney stopped making those payments. On these facts alone, the refusal to hold Rodney in contempt might appear to be a blatant abuse of discretion. As it turns out, however, the federal preemption trumps the District Court\u2019s authority to enforce Rodney\u2019s obligation to pay the VA disability benefits as part of the equitable distribution of the marital estate under the Agreement and Decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b614  As we noted above, the District Court denied Cynthia\u2019s Motion for Contempt based on <em>Strong, </em>in which we held that federal law preempts the state from distributing VA benefits as a part of the marital estate. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 27. We agree. Therefore, although the evidence showed that Rodney had violated the terms of the Agreement, and hence the Decree, by withholding payment of Cynthia\u2019s share of his VA disability benefits, federal law preempts the District Court from enforcing the Decree in regard to division of those benefits. Given the weight of authority here, we must conclude that the District Court acted within its discretion in refusing to hold Rodney in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"AGUz\">\u00b615 Cynthia argues nevertheless that Rodney should be held in contempt because he voluntarily entered into the Agreement to pay the VA disability benefits and he should, therefore, be forced to honor the Agreement and be estopped from attacking it. Relying primarily <em>on In re Marriage of Stone </em>(1995), 274 Mont. 331, 908 P.2d 670, Cynthia argues that the federal preemption found in <em>Strong </em>does not extend to preempt enforcement of Rodney\u2019s obligation to pay VA disability benefits under the Agreement and Decree in this case. Cynthia\u2019s reliance on <em>Stone </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b616 The District Court concluded that our decision in <em>Strong </em>effectively overruled <em>Stone. </em>We agree. <em>Stone </em>involved a property settlement agreement whereby the parties agreed to use the proceeds from the husband\u2019s VA disability benefits to pay maintenance. In upholding the District Court\u2019s denial of the husband\u2019s motion to modify his maintenance obligations based upon the provisions of the USFSPA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>we concluded in <em>Stone </em>that the voluntary contractual agreement between the parties did \u201cnot purport to assign [husband\u2019s] veterans\u2019 disability benefits to [wife].\u201d <em>Stone, 274 </em>Mont. at 335, 908 P.2d at 673. We held that though federal law \u201cprohibits state courts ... from dividing veterans\u2019 disability benefits, neither the Act nor the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Mansell </em>clearly preempt the parties\u2019 ability to contract.\u201d <em>Stone, 274 </em>Mont. at 335-36, 908 P.2d at 673. In <em>Strong, </em>however, we concluded that the district court did <em>not </em>have the authority to enforce a property settlement agreement provision the object of which was to distribute VA benefits as part of the marital estate. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6 27. We said that \u2018federal law preempts state courts from exercising jurisdiction in a dissolution proceeding over any military benefit that is not \u2018disposable retired pay.\u2019 \u201d <em>Strong, \u00b6 </em>23 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b617  We made no distinction in <em>Strong </em>between the exercise of jurisdiction in cases involving maintenance and cases involving the division of the marital estate. While we did not explicitly state in <em>Strong </em>that we were overruling <em>Stone, </em>that conclusion is inescapable. In the wake of <em>Strong, </em>a district court may not order the division or allocation of VA benefits to satisfy any marital obligation, be it maintenance or division of the marital estate, regardless of whether the parties previously agreed to do so in a property settlement agreement. We therefore now expressly hold that <em>Stone </em>was overruled by <em>Strong.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b618 Cynthia further argues on appeal that Rodney should be estopped from claiming the invalidity of the Agreement. She failed, however, to present this argument to the District Court. A party who wishes to rely on an estoppel argument must plead it; failure to do so deems the argument waived. <em>Williard v. Campbell </em>(1932), 91 Mont. 493, 503, 11 P.2d 782, 786. This Court will not address issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State v. Wetzel, </em>2005 MT 154, \u00b6 13, 327 Mont. 413, \u00b6 13, 114 P.3d 269, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b619 While we conclude here that federal preemption precludes the state from treating Rodney\u2019s VA disability benefits as part of the marital estate, it is worth noting what else we said in <em>Strong. </em>At \u00b6 40, quoting <em>In re Marriage of Kraft </em>(Wash. 1992), 832 P.2d 871, 877, we said that \u201ca trial court in a marriage dissolution action may consider military disability retirement pay as a source of income in awarding spousal or child support, or generally as an economic circumstance of the parties justifying a disproportionate award of [marital] property to the nonretiree spouse.\u201d Today, however, on the narrow review of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>order denying contempt, we stand in no position to undo or redo the court\u2019s Order dividing the marital estate to comport with the intent of this proviso.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b620 For the foregoing reasons, the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b504-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b504-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"A6a\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u00b621 I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b622 In <em>In re Marriage of Strong, </em>2000 MT 178, \u00b6 16, 300 Mont. 331, \u00b6 16, 8 P.3d 763, \u00b6 16, we held that federal law preempts the State from distributing V.A. benefits \u201cas part of a marital estate.\u201d The Court reasons that <em>Strong </em>\u201ceffectively overruled <em>Stone\u201d </em>and goes on to rationalize that Tw]e made no distinction in <em>Strong </em>between the exercise of jurisdiction in cases involving maintenance and cases involving the division of the marital estate.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 16 and 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b623 First of all, that <em>Strong </em>did not expressly overrule <em>Stone </em>suggests that the Court implicitly recognized that the maintenance issue in <em>Stone </em>was distinguishable from a division of the marital estate. Secondly, whether or not the Court in <em>Strong </em>drew a distinction between maintenance and division of the marital estate, the federal precedent as well as the Montana statutes do draw such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"ASl\">\u00b624 The federal precedent, <em>Mansell v. Mansell </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 581, 109 S.Ct. 2023, 104 L.Ed.2d 675, relied upon in <em>Strong, </em>preempts a state from distributing federal benefits \u201cas marital property.\u201d <em>Mansell, </em>490 U.S. at 588-89. In <em>Strong, </em>as in <em>Lutes, </em>the issue is whether the court can distribute benefits as part of the marital estate. The answer is no, it cannot. In <em>Stone, </em>however, the Court did not purport to divide the benefits as part of the marital estate. Rather, the parties agreed that the husband would pay maintenance and that he would obligate himself to pay such maintenance from his benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">\u00b625 <em>Stone </em>is premised on the fact that maintenance is separate and distinct from the division of marital property-which is the subject of the <em>Mansell </em>preemption. This distinction is bourne out by the Montana statutes which provide that, in determining the amount of maintenance, the court must consider the financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, \u2018including marital property apportioned to him ....\u2019\u2019Section 40-4-203(2)(a), MCA. In other words, the amount of maintenance is determined <em>after the marital property has been divided. </em>Since maintenance is separate and distinct from the distribution of the marital estate, it is not subject to the preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-11\">\u00b626 Not only did <em>Strong </em>not overrule <em>Stone, </em>it in fact recognized the distinction between division of property and an award of maintenance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>by holding that, although the court could not consider the V. A. benefits for purposes of dividing the marital estate, it could consider post-dissolution V.A. benefits in determining the amount of maintenance. <em>Strong, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 29-\u00b640. <em>Stone </em>is entirely consistent with <em>Strong </em>in that it recognizes that the parties can voluntarily contract to pay the maintenance with the very same benefits that the court itself can \u201cconsider.\u201d Such an agreement as to maintenance does not mean that the V.A. benefits have been distributed \u201cas part of the marital estate.\u201d \u00b627 In needlessly overruling <em>Stone, </em>the Court has obliterated the distinction between maintenance and division of the marital property. The Court reads more into the preemption doctrine than is necessary and does so at the expense of the constitutionally-protected right to contract.</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE MORRIS join in the dissent of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b505-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"Ar3\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b628 I join in Justice Leaphart\u2019s dissent. In particular, I expressly second his statements that <em>Strong </em>not only did <em>not </em>overrule <em>Stone, </em>but that the two are entirely consistent. In any event, however, it is important to point out that even if the Court were correct, this case points out the necessity that we either harmonize a prior decision, properly distinguish it or explicitly overrule it. The failure to do so creates the very kinds of problems encountered here by litigants, legal practitioners, trial courts and this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b629 I write separately with regard to an issue Cynthia raises but the Court, quite properly, does not address. The Court notes at \u00b618 that Cynthia did not present her estoppel argument to the District Court and, for that reason, we do not address it because it is raised for the first time on appeal. This result should not, in my view, necessarily be interpreted to mean that Cynthia is now without any avenue of relief regarding the correct-but unfortunate-result in this case. Relief may be available to her via such means as a motion to reopen the property disposition pursuant to \u00a7 40-4-208(3)(b), MCA, or some appropriate action pursuant to Rule 60(b), M.R.Civ.P., with regard to the Property Settlement Agreement incorporated into the Decree here. I am not advising that Cynthia take any further action or follow either of these potential avenues of redress; nor, of course, can anyone know whether or to what extent actual redress might be forthcoming. I merely write to express my view that Cynthia is not necessarily at the \u201cend of the road\u201d with regard to the issues in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
