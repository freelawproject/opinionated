(MRL), in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. The District Court initially dismissed Winslow\u2019s claim for lack of jurisdiction, which was reversed by this Court in <em>Winslow v. Montana Rail Link, Inc., </em>2000 MT 292, \u00b6 27, 302 Mont. 289, \u00b6 27, 16 P.3d 992, \u00b6 27 <em>(Winslow I). </em>After remand, the case went to trial and the jury concluded that MRL had acted negligently and awarded Winslow compensatory damages. The jury further determined that punitive damages should be assessed, but specifically found that MRL had not acted with malice regarding its termination of Winslow\u2019s employment, an apparent inconsistency. The District Court then ruled that, pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA, a finding of malice is a prerequisite for imposition of punitive damages, and dismissed the jury without allowing deliberation on punitive damages. Winslow appeals from the rulings of the District Court, but does not challenge the jury\u2019s verdict on his negligence claim and the damages awarded thereunder. He seeks only \u201ca new trial limited to a determination of the amount of punitive damages.\u201d Additionally, Winslow asks this Court to grant attorney fees and sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b62 Given this posture of the case, we conclude it is unnecessary to address a number of issues Winslow has raised on appeal, as they are directed to the trial and the unchallenged verdict on Winslow\u2019s negligence claim, including whether MRL: (1) made misrepresentations to the jury; (2) inteijected collateral sources; (3) presented an unlawful defense that its compliance with the grievance procedure under the collective bargaining agreement absolved it of liability; and whether the District Court: (4) deprived Winslow of his right to present evidence that MRL had an ongoing hidden business plan designed to discourage the reporting of work-related injuries; and (5) failed to instruct the jury that an award of interest could be awarded pursuant to \u00a727-1-212, MCA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b63 MRL cross-appeals from the District Court\u2019s denial of its summary judgment and Rule 50(b), M.R.Civ.P., motions. We affirm all issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>\u00b64 The following issues are dispositive on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b287-4\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in denying MRL\u2019s summary judgment and Rule 50(b) motions by incorrectly concluding that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, provides Winslow with a statutory cause of action?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">\u00b66 Did the District Court err in denying MRL\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its subsequent Rule 50(b) motion on the merits of Winslow\u2019s negligent management claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u00b67 Did the District Court err by not allowing the jury to deliberate on the amount of punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\u00b68 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in concluding that MRL properly responded to discovery and should not be subject to sanctions?</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">\u00b69 Winslow, who is a member of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers (BLE) labor union, obtained employment at MRL as a switchman in 1988. The terms of Winslow\u2019s employment agreement were governed by a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between BLE and MRL. The CBA provided that Winslow, after completing the probationary period, could not be dismissed absent just cause and without an impartial fact-finding hearing, which included mandatory procedures concerning the assessment of discipline and subsequent internal appeals. In addition, MRL required its employees to be honest, and to report all information related to on-duty and off-duty injuries affecting job performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">\u00b610 On March 13,1992, Winslow\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Earl Book (Dr. Book), diagnosed Winslow with a left femoral hernia. On March 24, 1992, Winslow filed an injury report with MRL claiming that he \u201cstrained something,\u201d but did not disclose that a hernia had been diagnosed two weeks earlier. Winslow claimed that he did not think he had to inform MRL about the hernia diagnosis because it did not interfere with his ability to work. Even though Dr. Book recommended hernia-repair surgery, Winslow opted to not seek farther treatment at that time because the pain dissipated. However, between 1992 and 1995 Winslow experienced increasing pain in his groin area.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">\u00b611 On September 7,1995, Winslow attempted to \u2018throw\u201d a railroad switch, and as a result felt a hot, burning pain in his groin, inhibiting his ability to walk. Winslow filed an MRL injury report describing the pain, and signed a written authorization allowing MRL to obtain medical information from \u201cany physician ... who has examined or treated [Winslow] in regard to the injury.\u201dThe following day, Dr. Book examined Winslow and concluded that the groin pain was related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the hernia he had originally diagnosed in 1992. Upon the advice of Dr. Book, Winslow decided to have hernia-repair surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u00b612 On September 8, 1995, Winslow informed his supervisor, Tim VanOrden (VanOrden), that he had a hernia and was making arrangements to have it repaired. MRL\u2019s claims manager, Mark Bjorlie, commenced an investigation and obtained Winslow\u2019s medical records which disclosed that his hernia was first diagnosed in 1992. Although Winslow would claim that he never represented to anyone that the hernia was caused by the throwing of the switch on September 7, 1995, MRL asserted in later proceedings that Winslow led VanOrden to believe that his hernia initially appeared on September 7,1995, and that the hernia-repair surgery was first recommended by Dr. Book the following day.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">\u00b613 After Winslow\u2019s hernia-repair surgery, he submitted his medical bills to MRL for payment. In October Winslow was briefly re-hospitalized to be tested for possible blood clots, which further increased medical costs. Thereafter, Winslow attempted to pay the medical expenses through Blue Cross/Blue Shield (Blue Cross), which administers MRL\u2019s self-insured medical plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">\u00b614 Winslow returned to work in October 1995 and began to receive notices from Blue Cross that indicated it was not paying Winslow\u2019s medical bills. Winslow gave the notices to VanOrden. MRL subsequently sent Winslow a written order requiring him to attend a fact-finding hearing to address his \u201cfailure to provide factual information regarding [his] injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u00b615 The MRL fact-finding hearing commenced on January 10, 1996, the purpose and effect of which were contested at trial. Winslow attended, but was not represented by counsel. At the hearing, VanOrden stated that Winslow led him to believe that the hernia first appeared on September 7, 1995, and that surgery was first recommended at that time. MRL noted that Winslow initially denied having knowledge of the hernia in 1992, but finally admitted that he was aware of it when confronted with his medical records, and argued that Winslow\u2019s failure to report that he had a hernia three years earlier rendered his claim fraudulent. Winslow countered by arguing that MRL presented no evidence at the hearing that he had represented that his hernia was as a direct result of the switch incident, that he had not been dishonest with VanOrden, and that his injury report was accurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u00b616 On January 19, 1996, MRL notified Winslow that he was being terminated from employment because Winslow had been repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>dishonest, and had failed to report all of the facts to MRL surrounding his hernia in violation of MRL rules. MRL further concluded that Winslow\u2019s hernia was not work-related, and informed Winslow\u2019s medical providers to this effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">\u00b617 Following the termination of his employment, and after MRL denied Winslow\u2019s internal appeal, Winslow submitted his case to arbitration before the Special Board of Adjustment (SBA) as provided in the CBA. The SBA met on December 20,1996, affirmed Winslow\u2019s termination, and concluded that Winslow received a fair and impartial fact-finding hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u00b618 On August 29, 1997, Winslow filed a complaint in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, claiming that MRL \u201cnegligently mismanaged its investigation\u201dand that he was wrongfully discharged. Winslow argued that, pursuant to \u00a739-2-703(1), MCA, MRL\u2019s termination constituted \u201cmismanagement and neglect.\u201dSection 39-2-703(1), MCA, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-6\">Every person or corporation operating a railway or railroad in this state is liable for all damages sustained by any employee of such person or corporation in consequence of the neglect of any other employee thereof or by the mismanagement of any other employee thereof and in consequence of the willful wrongs, whether of commission or omission, of any other employee thereof when such neglect, mismanagement, or wrongs are in any manner connected with the use and operation of any railway or railroad on or about which he is employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">\u00b619 The District Corat initially dismissed Winslow\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction on MRL\u2019s Rule 12(h), M.R.Civ.P., motion, concluding that Winslow\u2019s claim \u201crequires interpretation of the CBA and is therefore preempted\u201d by the Railroad Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7 151-188. <em>Winslow I, </em>\u00b6 26. However, this Court reversed, concluding that the plain language of Winslow\u2019s complaint properly invoked the mismanagement provisions of \u00a739-2-703, MCA, made no reference to the CBA, and therefore was not preempted by the RLA. <em>Winslow I, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\u00b620 After remand, the case proceeded to jury trial on Winslow\u2019s claims that MRL was liable for negligent mismanagement and retaliatory discharge. On June 11, 2003, the jury returned a verdict concluding that each party was negligent, allocating 61.25 percent liability to MRL, and 38.75 percent liability to Winslow. Applying this determination to the damage award, the District Court entered a judgment against MRL in the amount of $384,328.43. After the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>were polled about the verdict, one of the jurors was excused to fulfill a commitment he had explained during jury selection. The next day, the parties met <em>in camera </em>to discuss the apparent inconsistency in the jury\u2019s special verdict, on punitive damages-that MRL had not acted with malice with respect to its termination of Winslow, but that punitive damages should nonetheless be assessed. After taking arguments, the District Court concluded that punitive damages could not be assessed under the verdict pursuant to \u00a727-1-221, MCA, which requires a finding of actual malice or actual fraud. Consequently, the District Court accepted the jury\u2019s verdict and released the eleven remaining jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b621 Throughout the proceeding, Winslow asserted that MRL engaged in discovery abuses which delayed and multiplied the proceedings and prevented him from receiving a fair and speedy trial. However, the District Court declined to impose sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b622 On July 7, 2003, Winslow filed a notice of appeal. On July 29, 2003, MRL filed a notice of cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b623 This Court reviews a district court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment <em>de novo. Wombold v. Assocs. Fin. Servs. Co. of Mont. </em>Inc., 2004 MT 397, \u00b6 29, 325 Mont. 290, \u00b6 29, 104 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 29. Thus, we apply the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria as applied by the district court. <em>Peyatt v. Moore, </em>2004 MT 341, \u00b6 13, 324 Mont. 249, \u00b6 13, 102 P.3d 535, \u00b6 13. Summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, \u00b6 16, 92 P.3d 620, \u00b6 16 (citing Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b624 A judgment as a matter of law entered pursuant to Rule 50(b), M.R.Civ.P., may be granted only when it appears, as a matter of law, that a party could not prevail upon any view of the evidence. <em>Massee v. Thompson, </em>2004 MT 121, \u00b6 25, 321 Mont. 210, \u00b6 25, 90 P.3d 394, \u00b6 25. Motions for judgment as a matter of law are proper only when there is a complete absence of evidence to warrant submission to a jury. <em>Kneeland v. Luzenac Am. Inc., </em>1998 MT 136, \u00b6 53, 289 Mont. 201, \u00b6 53, 961 P.2d 725, \u00b6 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b625  Prejudice is never presumed on appeal, and a judgment will not be reversed merely because the lower court erred. In order to reverse, it must affirmatively appear that the error has affected substantial rights of the defendant regarding the merits of the case. <em>State v. DeTienne </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 249, 257, 707 P.2d 534, 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u00b626  This Court generally will defer to the decision of a trial court regarding sanctions for failure to comply with discovery procedures because the trial court is in the best position to know whether parties are disregarding the rights of opposing parties in the course of litigation. <em>Lewistown Propane Co., v. Moncur, </em>2002 MT 349, \u00b6 22, 313 Mont. 368, \u00b6 22, 61 P.3d 780, \u00b6 22. We review discretionary district court rulings for abuse of discretion. <em>Anderson v. Werner Enter., Inc., </em>1998 MT 333, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 284, \u00b6 13, 972 P.2d 806, \u00b6 13. Moreover, the party assigning error to the trial court\u2019s discovery rulings must show prejudice. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b627 Did the District Court err in denying MRL\u2019s summary judgment and Rule 50(b) motions by incorrectly concluding that \u00a739-2-703, MCA, provides Winslow with a statutory cause of action?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b628 On cross-appeal, MRL argues that \u00a739-2-703, MCA, does not provide Winslow with a statutory \"mismanagement\u201d cause of action. MRL explains that this Court concluded, upon rehearing in <em>Dillon v. Great N. Ry. </em>(1909), 38 Mont. 485, 100 P. 960, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-7\">Upon further consideration ... we think there is not any room for doubt that in enacting sections 5251 and 5252, Rev. Codes [later codified as \u00a739-2-703, MCA], the Legislature did not intend to create any new right of action, but merely recognized a right of action existing at common law and sought to make that right available, notwithstanding the negligence of a fellow servant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ant\"><em>Dillon, </em>38 Mont. at 504, 100 P. at 966. MRL explains that the Legislature did not recognize, let alone codify, a common-law action for mismanagement of employee terminations. MRL argues that <em>Winslow I </em>did not precisely consider whether \u00a7 39-2-703(1), MCA, provides plaintiffs with a statutory cause of action, but merely \u201cassumed\u201d that it did, and, consequently, <em>Winslow I, </em>in contrast to <em>Dillon, </em>cannot be considered <em>stare decisis </em>on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b629 We reasoned in <em>Winslow I </em>that \u00a739-2-703, MCA, \u2018In very broad language,\u201dprovides that railways are \u201cliable for all damages sustained by any employee\u2019 as a consequence of the \u2018mismanagement\u2019 of any other employee when such mismanagement is \u2018connected with the use and operation\u2019 of any railway.\u201d <em>Winslow I, </em>\u00b6 19 (citations omitted). We concluded that \u00a7 39-2-703, MCA, is not limited to personal injuries caused by co-workers to the exclusion of mismanagement in the handling of an employee termination. <em>Winslow I, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>explained that \u201c[ although personal injury resulting from the neglect of a co-worker would be included within the ambit of the statute, so are damages which result from mismanagement connected with the operation of the railroad.\u201d <em>Winslow I, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b630  When this Court, in deciding a case presented, states a principle or rule of law necessary to the decision, such pronouncement becomes the law of the case and must be adhered to throughout its subsequent progress, both in the trial court and upon subsequent appeal. <em>Marie Deonier v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 297, \u00b6 75, 323 Mont. 387, \u00b6 75, 101 P.3d 742, \u00b6 75. The issue of whether \u00a739-2-703, MCA, provides Winslow with a statutory cause of action was sufficiently addressed in <em>Winslow I </em>to serve the purposes of law of the case and will not be revisited here. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying MRL\u2019s summary judgment and Rule 50(b), M.R.Civ.P., motions based upon the law of the case established in <em>Winslow I.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b631 Did the District Court err in denying MRL\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its subsequent Rule 50(b) motion on the merits of Winslow\u2019s negligent management claim?</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b632 Alternatively, MRL argues that the District Court erred when it denied its motion for summary judgment and its subsequent Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law on Winslow\u2019s negligent mismanagement claim. MRL explains that the holding in <em>Winslow I </em>was based upon a motion to dismiss and was determined solely upon the allegations of the pleadings. MRL therefore contends that the <em>Winslow I </em>Court did not substantively determine whether Winslow\u2019s claims were preempted by the RLA or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). In light of the evidentiary record, which was not reviewed in <em>Winslow I, </em>MRL contends that the issue of preemption must be reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b633 Regarding preemption under the RLA, MRL argues that Winslow\u2019s claim of negligent mismanagement is based directly on rights created by Winslow\u2019s CBA and therefore constitutes a \u201cmajor dispute\u201das defined under the RLA, and therefore subject to the RLA\u2019s mandatory arbitral mechanism for settlement. MRL explains that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>major dispute under the RLA relates to the formation or modification of the contractual rights provided for by a CBA, whereas minor disputes involve interpretation or application of agreements covering rates of pay, rules, or working conditions. MRL argues that Winslow challenged the grievance process and work rules thereby attempting to alter existing contractual rights which constitutes a \u201cmajor dispute.\u201d MRL contends that Winslow presented his state-law claim of negligent mismanagement in a manner that necessarily required the court or jury to interpret existing provisions of his CBA, and that this fact alone mandates preemption since claims \u2018founded directly on rights created by [CBAs]\u201d are preempted by the RLA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cramer v. Consol. Freightways, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2001), 255 F.3d 683, 689. Thus, in consideration of the evidence adduced, MRL argues that this Court must reverse the District Court\u2019s denial of MRL\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law because Winslow\u2019s negligent mismanagement claim is preempted by the RLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b634 Winslow responds that the RLA does not preempt his negligent mismanagement claim because the law of the case doctrine applies per <em>Winslow I, </em>and therefore the issue may not be re-litigated. Winslow also explains that other jurisdictions have recognized state law claims that are not preempted by the RLA. Moreover, Winslow argues that he continually objected to the relevancy and admissibility of evidence of the CBA\u2019s grievance process and decision that MRL offered, and that he therefore had a right to attack the validity and fairness of the grievance process, the decision against Winslow arising therefrom, and whether MRL had properly complied with the process. Consequently, Winslow asserts that MRL misrepresents that the CBA\u2019s presence in the case was due solely to Winslow\u2019s own claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b635 The United States Supreme Court has held that a state claim is independent of a CBA for preemption purposes so long as the state claim can be resolved without interpreting the CBA itself. <em>Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef </em>(1988), 486 U.S. 399, 410, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 1883, 100 L.Ed.2d 410, 421. In <em>Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. v. Norris </em>(1994), 512 U.S. 246, 257, 114 S.Ct. 2239, 2249, 129 L.Ed.2d 203, 214, the United States Supreme Court explained that \u201csubstantive protections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>provided by state law, independent of whatever labor agreement might govern, are not pre-empted under the RLA.\u201d <em>See also Missouri Pac. R. Co. v. Norwood </em>(1931), 283 U.S. 249, 51 S.Ct. 458, 75 L.Ed. 1010. The United States Supreme Court also held in <em>Terminal R.R. Assn. of St. Louis v. Trainmen </em>(1943), 318 U.S. 1, 6-7, 63 S.Ct. 420, 423, 87 L.Ed. 571, 578, that \u201cthe enactment by Congress of the [RLA] was not a preemption of the field of regulating working conditions themselves ....\u2019\u2019The United States Supreme Court further limited the scope of RLA preemption in <em>Andrews v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co. </em>(1972), 406 U.S. 320, 324, 92 S.Ct. 1562, 1565, 32 L.Ed.2d 95, 97, when it held that a state law claim of wrongful termination was preempted, <em>not </em>because the RLA broadly preempts state law claims based on discharge or discipline, but because the employee\u2019s claim was firmly rooted in a breach of the CBA itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b636  Winslow has consistently argued that his theory did not involve the CBA, but instead pertained to allegations that MRL used a false pretext to fire him in order to further a scheme designed to intimidate railroad workers so that they would not file injury reports. After review of the record, we conclude that Winslow\u2019s claims are not \u2018firmly rooted\u201d in a breach of the CBA itself, but instead are premised upon the provisions of \u00a739-2-703, MCA, which is a state law claim. <em>See Winslow I, </em>\u00b6 27. Thus, we conclude that the District Court properly denied MRL\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its subsequent Rule 50(b), M.R.Civ.P., motion as to RLA preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b637 As to ERISA, MRL argues that Winslow\u2019s state law claims about improper handling of medical benefits and negligent management of employee benefit plans are preempted by ERISA, which is a \u201ccomprehensive statute designed to promote the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefits plans.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 85, 90, 103 S.Ct. 2890, 2896, 77 L.Ed.2d 490, 497. Winslow responds that MRL did not properly raise its ERISA preemption argument on appeal and waived it as an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b638  Other jurisdictions have held that ERISA preemption in benefits-due actions \u201cmust be pleaded timely as an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Reliance Std. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1st Cir. 1995), 71 F.3d 444, 449-50. This Court has previously held that \u201can affirmative defense is waived if not set forth affirmatively.\u201d <em>Nitzel v. Wickman </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 284, 312, 940 P.2d 451, 456. Moreover, \u201can affirmative defense ... is waived if it is not raised in the answer to a claim.\u201d <em>Marias Healthcare Services, Inc. v. Turenne, </em>2001 MT 127, \u00b6 9, 305 Mont. 419, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>\u00b6 9, 28 P.3d 491, \u00b6 9. Because MRL failed to raise its ERISA argument until years after the commencement of the litigation, we conclude the District Court properly denied MRL\u2019s ERISA defense on the basis of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b639 Did the District Court err in disallowing the jury to deliberate on the amount of punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b640 The jury returned a verdict regarding punitive damages which determined that MRL did not act with malice with respect to its termination of Winslow, but that punitive damages should be assessed. Immediately after the verdict was entered, one of the twelve jurors was excused by the District Court, precluding further deliberations unless undertaken by \u2018less than twelve\u201djurors pursuant to \u00a73-15-106, MCA, which permits such deliberations only upon agreement between the parties and approval of the court. Subsequent to the dismissal of the juror, the following conversation occurred <em>in camera:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">THE COURT: The other issue is that I did release [the juror]. [The juror] told us when he started this three weeks ago that he had to be out of town ... on the 12th and I believe I said at that time we were going to be done by the 12th. We are still not done, although it may be that the jury will not be asked to do anything tomorrow. That remains to be seen as to what happens. But in any event, I did excuse him because he said he would not be available from the 12th on. I understand that could possibly cause a problem, but that\u2019s what I did. Go ahead, Mr. Conner, you wanted to make a record of that-Mr. Thueson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">MR. THUESON: No, Your Honor, we\u2019re okay with it<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">MR. CONNER: Just what is the defense position though? Did they consent to this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">MR. POTTER: We\u2019re going to take the Court\u2019s invitation and appear tomorrow morning and put our position on the - MR. CONNER: Are they going to consent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">MR. COX: We don\u2019t have to state that right now and we\u2019re not going to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">MR. POTTER: We were not consulted, and we don\u2019t take a position. We\u2019ll let you know in the morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">THE COURT: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">Although Winslow\u2019s counsel did not object to the dismissal of the juror, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>MRL took the position the following morning that it would not consent to a jury of eleven members and noted that it was not consulted in the matter prior to the juror\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b641 Winslow argues that MRL used \u201coffensive trial tactics\u201dby sitting on its hands when the District Court informed the parties that it had dismissed one of the twelve jurors and objecting to the dismissal only after the juror was no longer available, and therefore, the loss of a juror should not bar his claim to a new trial on punitive damages. MRL contends that it lost the benefit of a full jury through no fault of its own, and that an eleven-person jury could not validly consider punitive damages because the requirements of \u00a73-15-106(1), MCA, including MRL\u2019s consent in open court to deliberation by less than twelve jurors, had not been established.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b642 On appeal, Winslow does not take issue with the District Court\u2019s dismissal of the juror for the juror\u2019s pre-announced commitment. Although that position is consistent with his comments at trial, it would appear that Winslow had no timely opportunity to object because he learned of the dismissal only after it had occurred. That notwithstanding, we cannot accept Winslow\u2019s argument that MRL somehow waived its objection to the juror\u2019s dismissal by accepting the District Court\u2019s invitation to place its position on the record the next morning, when it objected. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that MRL either consented or acquiesced to the juror\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b643 Consequently, given the District Court\u2019s unchallenged dismissal of the juror, however troubling, the only way the trial could have continued was with less than twelve jurors pursuant to \u00a73-15-106(1), MCA. That provision requires the parties to agree in open court to deliberation by a lesser number of jurors. Such an agreement did not exist here, as MRL did not consent in open court to a jury of less than twelve persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b644  We must conclude that the District Court did not err by not allowing the jury to deliberate regarding punitive damages. Because, for this reason, deliberations on punitive damages could not have occurred in any event, we need not reach the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the verdict pursuant to \u00a727-1-221, MCA, or the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>issues Winslow raises relative to punitive damages, including challenges to the punitive damage instructions, the verdict form and the jury\u2019s determination of contributory negligence by Winslow.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b645 Did the District Court abuse its discretion in concluding that MRL properly responded to discovery and should not be subject to sanctions?</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b646 Winslow argues that MRL persistently engaged in discovery abuses that delayed the proceedings, prevented a fair trial, and precluded the admission of relevant evidence. Winslow contends that MRL should be sanctioned for obstructing witnesses, concealing information, and for improper use of boilerplate objections. MRL responds by arguing that the District Court, after thorough review, concluded that MRL properly responded to discovery, did not obstruct witnesses, did not conceal information, and did not improperly state objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b647 This Court has previously held that when litigants and their attorneys abuse the Montana Rules of Civil Procedure, they are subject to sanctions. <em>Bulen v. Navajo Ref. Co., Inc., </em>2000 MT 222, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 195, \u00b6 19, 9 P.3d 607, \u00b6 19. Furthermore, when litigants use willful delay, respond evasively, or disregard court directions as part and parcel of their trial strategy, they must suffer the consequences. <em>Bulen, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\u00b648 The lengthy litigation which marked this matter involved numerous unique questions of law leading to the first appeal in <em>Winslow I, </em>which addressed the legal validity of Winslow\u2019s claims after they had been dismissed by the District Court. On remand, the prosecution of Winslow\u2019s claims involved difficult issues of proof. Plaintiffs counsel skillfully established Winslow\u2019s claims in the face of resolute advocacy by defense counsel. It is in the context of this long and difficult litigation that the sanctions issues arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">\u00b649  We review a district court\u2019s sanction orders under the deferential abuse of discretion standard \u2018because the trial court is in the best position to know whether the parties are disregarding the rights of opposing parties in the course of litigation and which sanctions for such conduct are most appropriate.\u201d <em>Lewistown Propane, </em>\u00b6 22 (quoting <em>McKenzie v. Scheeler </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 500, 506, 949 P.2d 1168, 1172). Even so, we have reviewed each of the numerous motions to compel, for protective orders, and for sanctions and the orders issued by the District Court in response thereto. After that careful review, and in the context of this complex and groundbreaking litigation, we cannot conclude that the District Court abused its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>discretion, nor that Winslow has established that the trial court\u2019s discovery rulings caused \u201cprejudice\u201d or \u201cmaterially affected [his] substantial rights.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 13. We therefore affirm the District Court on these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b650 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b298-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b286-6\"> Within his extensive briefing, Winslow also offers a very brief request that the Court strike the jury\u2019s determination that he was contributorily negligent on the grounds that the jury\u2019s determination that punitive damages should be assessed makes contributory negligence irrelevant, and that contributory negligence is not mentioned by the mismanagement statute. We conclude that our resolution of the punitive damage issue herein resolves this request and that contributory negligence was a proper consideration herein. However, we reserve further judgment on these issues in some case when they have been fully briefed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\"> We further clarified the statutory interpretation of \u00a739-2-703, MCA, in <em>Haux v.

The Court, however, declines to conclude that the District Court erred by dismissing the juror <em>sua sponte, </em>because Winslow failed to specify on appeal that such action was error. So, the Court calls the court\u2019s dismissal of the juror \u2018troubling,\u201d and leaves it at that. I do not share the Court\u2019s reluctance to address whether error occurred, as I think an important component of our job is to identify error when we see it, so that the same error might be avoided in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">\u00b653 I would conclude that, in dismissing the juror without the advance consent of the parties, the District Court erred. By doing so, the court handed the party with the most to lose4n this case, MRL-a <em>fait accompli. </em>With the juror already excused and gone, all MRL had to do to escape consideration of the punitive damages conundrum was refuse to agree to a jury of eleven, which it did. This was both unfair to Winslow and inconsonant with the intent of \u00a73-15-106, MCA, which contemplates both approval of the court <em>and </em>agreement of the parties before a jury of fewer than twelve may proceed. I would hold that it is error for a district court to excuse a juror while questions remain as to the meaning and intent of a jury verdict, without first giving the parties a meaningful opportunity to consent or object.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">\u00b654 However, though I believe the District Court erred, I would nonetheless conclude that we can give Winslow no affirmative relief on appeal because Winslow does not seek or appear willing to accept a complete retrial on both liability and punitive damages. Winslow makes it clear that he wants to retain the benefits of the compensatory verdict (albeit unreduced for comparative fault), with remand for trial on punitive damages only. The statutes allowing for an award of punitive damages do not contemplate such relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">\u00b655 Section 27-1-220(1), MCA, provides, in pertinent part, that \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>judge or jury may award, <em>in addition to compensatory damages, </em>punitive damages for the sake of example and for the purpose of punishing a defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, \u00a727-1-221(6), MCA, provides that liability for punitive damages must be determined by the trier of f\u00e1ct. Thus, a fact-finder cannot assess punitive damages until it has first decided to give compensatory damages, and has decided that the proof supporting those damages also justifies, by clear and convincing evidence, an award of punitive damages. A punitive case cannot be heard in a vacuum, nor can one fact-finder assess compensatory damages and then leave to a wholly different fact-finder the question of whether the plaintiffs proof from the first case entitles him to punitive damages. The case cannot be split. Because Winslow has chosen to retain the benefits of the compensatory award-a logical decision in light of the difficulty of the case-I would conclude we cannot remand for trial on punitive damages alone. Therefore, I concur in the result reached by the Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b299-4\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the concurrence of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
