We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">\u00b62 Pierce raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether probable cause existed to support the warrantless seizure of Pierce\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether probable cause existed to support the issuance of a search warrant to search Pierce\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b58-13\">\u00b65 Highway Patrol Officer Scott Hoffman (Officer Hoffman) responded to a one-car accident site where he found Pierce sitting in his truck. Pierce got out of his truck and provided Officer Hoffman with his driver\u2019s license, proof of insurance, and registration demonstrating that he owned the truck. Officer Hoffman\u2019s call to the dispatcher revealed that Pierce had over $8,000 in outstanding warrants. Officer Hoffman arrested Pierce and placed him in the back of the patrol car at which time Pierce requested that Officer Hoffman retrieve a phone book from the dashboard of his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">\u00b66 Officer Hoffman opened the truck to retrieve Pierce\u2019s phone book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>and noticed a \u201cstrong odor of burnt marijuana.\u201d Officer Hoffman confronted Pierce about the odor and Pierce replied that someone had been smoking marijuana earlier in the truck, but that he did not smoke marijuana due to drug-testing requirements for his job. Pierce refused Officer Hoffman\u2019s request to search the truck. Officer Hoffman then asked dispatch to run a criminal history check on Pierce that uncovered earlier drug-related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b67 Officer Hoffman sealed the truck with evidence tape and called a tow truck to impound it while he sought to obtain a search warrant. The tow truck arrived and Officer Hoffman left the scene to take Pierce to jail. An unidentified woman arrived a short time later and asked the tow truck driver if she could retrieve items from the truck. The tow truck driver informed the woman that Officer Hoffman had left instructions that the truck was to remain sealed. The woman left abruptly when the tow truck driver called Officer Hoffman to report her request. An unidentified woman also later called the highway patrol dispatch asking to retrieve items from Pierce\u2019s truck. The woman hung up when the dispatcher informed her that her call would be transferred to Officer Hoffman.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b68 Officer Hoffman contacted the Missoula Police Department for assistance after Pierce\u2019s arrest. In response, Officer Ken Wickman from the Missoula Police Department brought his K-9 officer, Boaz, to sniff Pierce\u2019s truck. Boaz \u201calerted\u201d to the passenger side of the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq1\">\u00b69 Officer Hoffman obtained a search warrant for the truck two days after seizing and impounding Pierce\u2019s truck. Officer Hoffman based his application for the search warrant on the accident, Pierce\u2019s outstanding warrants, the smell of marijuana in the truck, Pierce\u2019s admission that someone recently had smoked marijuana in the truck, Pierce\u2019s denial of consent to search the truck, Pierce\u2019s earlier drug-related offenses, the unknown woman\u2019s attempts to remove property from the truck, and the K-9 sniff and \u201calert.\u201d District Court Judge Harkin concluded from Officer Hoffman\u2019s application that probable cause existed to justify issuing a warrant to search Pierce\u2019s truck. The search turned up an inventory of drugs and drug paraphernalia. The State charged Pierce with felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs and two other misdemeanor drug offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b610 Pierce filed a motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of his truck. He asserted that the State lacked probable cause to seize his truck and lacked probable cause to support the issuance of the warrant to search his truck. Officer Hoffman conceded at the suppression hearing that the information filed in his affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>concerning the number of Pierce\u2019s past drug-related offenses could have been wrong. He further conceded that the two days between impounding Pierce\u2019s truck and the search provided \u201cplenty of time\u201d to confirm Pierce\u2019s criminal history. Officer Hoffman admitted that he had failed to confirm it. Indeed Pierce had only one prior misdemeanor drug conviction approximately twenty-five years before his arrest. He did have prior convictions, however, for several other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b611 District Court Judge Larson denied the motion to suppress. Pierce pled guilty to all three counts pursuant to a plea agreement and reserved his right to appeal the court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. The District Court sentenced Pierce to five years to the Department of Corrections and suspended the entire sentence. Pierce now appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b612 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress to determine whether its findings of facts prove clearly erroneous and whether its interpretation and application of the law remains correct. <em>State v. Dewitt, </em>2004 MT 317, \u00b6 21, 324 Mont. 39, \u00b6 21, 101 P.3d 277, \u00b6 21. A court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or we are convinced by our review of the record that a mistake has been committed. <em>Dewitt, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b613 In reviewing a motion to suppress evidence discovered as a result of a search pursuant to a valid warrant, we normally review with deference a magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause in the search warrant. <em>State v. Tackitt, </em>2003 MT 81, \u00b6 11, 315 Mont. 59, \u00b6 11, 67 P.3d 295, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>State v. St. Marks, </em>2002 MT 285, \u00b6 14, 312 Mont. 468, \u00b6 14, 59 P.3d 1113, \u00b6 14). When information must be excised from the application for the search warrant, however, we review the warrant <em>de novo </em>for probable cause. <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 11. We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s conclusion of law when denying a motion to suppress. <em>Dewitt, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A1q\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">\u00b614 Whether probable cause existed to support the warrantless seizure of Pierce\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">\u00b615 Pierce contends that Officer Hoffman lacked probable cause to seize and impound his truck and thereby violated his right to be protected against unreasonable seizure. Officer Hoffman seized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Pierce\u2019s truck without a warrant, after arresting him based on his outstanding warrants, when he placed evidence tape around the truck and had it towed and impounded. Officer Hoffman did so, however, only after smelling burnt marijuana in the truck and Pierce admitted that someone had smoked marijuana in the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b616 This matter mirrors <em>State v. Broell </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 117, 122, 814 P.2d 44, 47, where Broell argued that the police unlawfully seized his car when they impounded it without a warrant before the issuance of a search warrant. We held that a warrantless seizure of a car fell under the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d to illegal searches and seizures and is permissible \u201cwhere there is probable cause to believe that such automobile\u2019s contents \u2018offend against the law.\u2019\u201d <em>Broell, </em>249 Mont. at 122, 814 P.2d at 47 (citing <em>State v. Evjen </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 516, 765 P.2d 708).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">\u00b617 Pierce contends that <em>Broell </em>should not control this matter as we have since rejected the \u201cautomobile exception\u201d and demands that \u201ca warrantless search of an automobile requires the existence of probable cause as well as a generally applicable exception to the warrant requirement such as a plain view search, a search incident to arrest, or exigent circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. Pierce claims that he maintained a privacy interest in his truck and invites us to apply Montana\u2019s fundamental right to privacy under Article II, Section 10, of the Montana Constitution to the seizure of his truck. He points to <em>State v. Martinez, </em>2003 MT 65, \u00b6 52, 314 Mont. 434, \u00b6 52, 67 P.3d 207, \u00b6 52, where we held that a traffic stop based on an unreliable tip constituted an unconstitutional infringement on Martinez\u2019s right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b618 Pierce seemingly again forgets, however, that Officer Hoffman smelled the burnt marijuana, not based on a tip, but because he requested that Officer Hoffman retrieve his phone book from the truck. Pierce apparently also has a memory lapse regarding his own admission, and not that of an informant\u2019s admission, that someone had committed the offense of smoking marijuana inside of the truck. We therefore reject Pierce\u2019s invitation to disallow the seizure of his truck under Article II, Section 10, and conclude that, for today, <em>Broell </em>controls the warrantless seizure. <em>See Elison, </em>\u00b6 54, n. 3. As we have noted, \u2018the seizure at issue in <em>Broell </em>was lawful regardless of exigent circumstances because \u2018there was sufficient probable cause under the facts of this case to believe that illegal drugs were located in Broell\u2019s car.\u2019\u201d <em>Elison, </em>\u00b6 54, n. 3 <em>(quoting Broell, </em>249 Mont. at 123, 814 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>47).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b619 Similar to <em>Broell, </em>we will base our analysis on Officer Hoffman\u2019s probable cause to conduct the warrantless seizure solely on the information that Officer Hoffman received before towing and impounding the truck. <em>Broell, </em>249 Mont. at 122, 814 P.2d at 47. We agree with the State that Officer Hoffman possessed sufficient facts before towing the truck, including the smell of burnt marijuana, Pierce\u2019s admission that someone had smoked marijuana in the truck, and the dispatch report that Pierce had earlier drug-related convictions, upon which to conclude that the contents of Pierce\u2019s truck \u201coffended against the law.\u201d <em>Broell, </em>249 Mont. at 122, 814 P.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"A0Q\">\u00b620 Pierce attempts to eliminate Officer Hoffman\u2019s reliance on Pierce\u2019s criminal record as justification to seize the truck because his only prior drug offense had been a 25 year-old misdemeanor possession of drugs conviction. Pierce points to <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 6, where we concluded that a seven-year-old misdemeanor drug citation proved insufficient to serve as corroboration for an anonymous tip to establish particularized suspicion to order a canine sniff. <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 41. We first note that <em>Tackitt </em>is not controlling given that the issue here involves a seizure of a truck based upon the owner\u2019s admission that an offense had taken place inside it and not whether the required particularized suspicion existed, based on stale information, to conduct a dog sniff. <em>Tackitt, </em>\u00b6 41. Officer Hoffman relied on the information that the dispatcher provided at that time, which was that Pierce had several earlier drug-related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b621  We agree with the State that even if Officer Hoffman improperly considered Pierce\u2019s earlier drug-related offenses in deciding to seize the truck, sufficient facts upon which Officer Hoffman could conclude that the contents of the truck \u201coffended the law\u201d remained. Officer Hoffman still smelled burnt marijuana and Pierce admitted that someone had smoked marijuana in the truck earlier that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b622  Pierce next argues that the odor of marijuana is insufficient to establish probable cause for the warrantless seizure of his truck. <em>State v. Schoendaller </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 376, 382, 578 P.2d <em>730, 734, followed by State v. Olson </em>(1979), 180 Mont. 151, 155, 589 P.2d 663, 665. These cases do not control here. <em>Schoendaller </em>concerned the issue of probable cause to conduct a warrantless search based on the odor of marijuana alone. <em>Olson </em>concerned probable cause to obtain a search warrant again relying exclusively on the odor of marijuana. We agree with the State\u2019s assertion that throughout his argument, Pierce continually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>glosses over the fact that he admitted that a crime - marijuana smoking -had been committed in the truck, and that this fact cannot be ignored. Officer Hoffman used the odor <em>in conjunction with </em>Pierce\u2019s admission to establish probable cause to seize the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b623 We conclude that Officer Hoffman had probable cause to support the warrantless seizure of Pierce\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b624 Whether probable cause existed to support the issuance of a search warrant to search Pierce\u2019s truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b625 Pierce argues that much of the information reported in Officer Hoffman\u2019s affidavit and upon which Judge Harkin relied on to issue the search warrant must be thrown out. He contends that when the Court disregards certain elements such as the K-9 alert, Officer Hoffman\u2019s erroneous belief that Pierce had several past drug convictions, and the unknown woman\u2019s attempts to enter the truck and retrieve items, the remaining facts are inadequate to establish probable cause to justify the issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">\u00b626 A search warrant may be issued upon an application made under oath or affirmation that: (1) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed; (2) states facts sufficient to support probable cause to believe that evidence, contraband, or persons connected with the offense may be found; (3) particularly describes the place, object, or persons to be searched; and (4) particularly describes who or what is to be seized. Section 46-5-221, MCA; <em>State v. Griffin, </em>2004 MT 331, \u00b6 20, 324 Mont. 143, \u00b6 20, 102 P.3d 1206, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b627 We have adopted the totality of the circumstances tests set forth in <em>Illinois v. Gates </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527, to determine whether probable cause existed to issue a search warrant. <em>State v. Kuneff, </em>1998 MT 287, \u00b6 22, 291 Mont. 474, \u00b6 22, 970 P.2d 556, \u00b6 22. Probable cause exists if all of the relevant facts and circumstances within a trained law enforcement officer\u2019s knowledge are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that someone has committed an offense. <em>Griffin, </em>\u00b6 21 (citing <em>State v. Frasure, </em>2004 MT 242, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 1, \u00b6 15, 97 P.3d 1101, \u00b6 15). We review the issuance of a search warrant to ensure that the issuing judge had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d to determine probable cause existed. <em>State v. Reesman, </em>2000 MT 243, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 408, \u00b6 19, 10 P.3d 83, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). We give a judge\u2019s determination of probable cause great deference and we will draw every reasonable inference possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>to support that determination. <em>Reesman, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b628 Pierce asserts that \u201ca mere affirmance or belief or suspicion by a police officer, absent any underlying facts or circumstances, does not establish probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.\u201d <em>Griffin,</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZF\">\u00b6 23 (citation omitted). In <em>Griffin, </em>we concluded that \u201c[j]ust because a person has a pipe in his pocket with untested white residue on it, does not mean his vehicle will contain evidence of a drug offense.\u201d <em>Griffin,</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0X\">\u00b6 24. Pierce argues that similar to <em>Griffin, </em>in this case, just because somebody earlier in the day had smoked marijuana inside Pierce\u2019s truck did not mean his truck would contain evidence of a drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"Axg\">\u00b629 Throughout this appeal, Pierce attempts to separate out each bit of information from the totality of the circumstances surrounding Officer Hoffman\u2019s application for a warrant. We agree that each bit of information presented by itself may not produce sufficient probable cause for the issuance of a warrant, but Officer Hoffman\u2019s application for a warrant included several pertinent pieces of information which, taken as a whole, constitute sufficient probable cause to issue the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b630  We look solely to the information given to the impartial magistrate and to the four corners of the application when reviewing the sufficiency of the application for the search warrant. <em>State v. Crowder </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 169, 173, 810 P.2d 299, 302. Officer Hoffman smelled the marijuana only because Pierce requested that Officer Hoffman retrieve a phone book from the dashboard of the truck. Pierce then admitted that someone had smoked marijuana inside of the truck earlier in the day. The smell of marijuana and Pierce\u2019s admission alone are sufficient evidence to warrant a reasonable person to believe Pierce\u2019s truck would contain evidence of an offense. Officer Hoffman additionally knew shortly after impounding the truck that an unidentified woman twice had attempted to retrieve items from the truck. As such, we safely may set aside the questionable K-9 search and Officer Hoffman\u2019s erroneous belief that Pierce had several past drug convictions. We still may conclude that Officer Hoffman\u2019s affidavit contained sufficient information to support a reasonable person\u2019s belief that the offense of possession of dangerous drugs had been committed and that evidence or contraband may be found within the truck. The District Court therefore properly denied Pierce\u2019s motion to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b631 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-7\">JUSTICES WARNER, COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
