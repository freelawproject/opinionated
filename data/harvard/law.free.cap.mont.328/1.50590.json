We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b26-10\">\u00b63 Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Hofeldt\u2019s mistrial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b26-12\">\u00b64 On the morning of January 25, 2003, Hofeldt entered the kitchen of his mother and stepfather\u2019s house. He and his stepfather, Ben Alexander, proceeded to exchange some choice words. What next ensued is contested. At trial, Alexander testified that Hofeldt approached him when Alexander\u2019s back was turned and began punching him on his head and body. Next, Alexander claims that he grabbed onto Hofeldt\u2019s waist in an attempt to defend himself. After Hofeldt\u2019s mother sought to stop the altercation, Hofeldt disengaged from Alexander. Hofeldt himself testified that Alexander had attacked him and tried to choke him.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-13\">\u00b65 Alexander called the police to the scene. They observed that Alexander\u2019s face had been bloodied and he had received bruises to his body. They observed no injuries to Hofeldt. Hofeldt is over six feet tall and significantly larger than Alexander. The police determined that they should arrest Hofeldt and charge him with assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-14\">\u00b66 After a trial in City Court, Hofeldt appealed and received a trial <em>de novo </em>in District Court. Prior to trial Hofeldt moved <em>in limine </em>to forbid testimony relating to prior assaults. The District Court granted the motion and stated to the parties, \u201cJust please tell the witnesses to avoid saying any prior incidence [sic] comments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b26-15\"><em>\u00b67 </em>In Alexander\u2019s testimony the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-16\">Q. After this, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b26-17\">A. I clinched. He was swinging at my head. I had already received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>several blows to the head, so I grabbed him around the waist and held on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-4\">Q. Did you leam that any place special-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV\">MR. YELLIN: Objection, relevance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-5\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-6\">A. <em>I had been attacked numerous times before in this manner.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ac\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">After Alexander made this statement, Hofeldt moved for a mistrial, arguing that the statement violated the order <em>in limine </em>and prejudiced his defense. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that the prosecution had not provoked the statement, and that the jury could have interpreted it as referring to prior attacks on Alexander by people other than Hofeldt.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-8\">\u00b68 Later, Officer Kuka, one of the police officers at the scene, testified to what Alexander had told him at that time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-9\">Q. Who did you speak to then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-10\">A. I spoke with Ben [Alexander] at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-11\">Q. What did you leam?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b27-12\">A. He advised me that Mr. Hofeldt had punched him <em>and that he was not going to take that anymore. </em>He then advised me that he was up in the kitchen when Mr. Hofeldt came upstairs. Mr. Alexander advised me he did say good morning to Mr. Hofeldt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b27-13\">After this comment Hofeldt renewed his motion for a mistrial, arguing that Officer Kuka\u2019s comment referred to prior actions taken between Hofeldt and Alexander. Once again the District Court denied Hofeldt\u2019s motion. It reasoned that the prosecutor had not sought to elicit any references to prior actions, and that the statement could have been interpreted merely to mean that Alexander did not want a repeat of that particular incident. Hofeldt did not request the court to give the jury a cautionary instruction regarding the two statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-14\">\u00b69 The jury found Hofeldt guilty of family member assault. He now appeals and requests us to reverse the District Court\u2019s decision to deny his request for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-15\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b27-16\"><em>\u00b610 </em>We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a mistrial for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Partin </em>(1997), 287 Mont. 12, 17-18, 951 P.2d 1002, 1005. In turn, when the defendant moves the district court to declare a mistrial, the court bases its decision on whether the defendant has received a fair and impartial trial. <em>Partin, </em>287 Mont. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>16-17, 951 P.2d at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Hofeldt\u2019s mistrial motions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b612  Hofeldt contends thatthe two statements of his stepfather and of Officer Kuka were inadmissible and contributed to his conviction. \u2018In determining whether a prohibited statement contributed to a conviction, we consider the strength of the evidence against the defendant, the prejudicial effect of the testimony and whether a cautionary jury instruction could cure any prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Scarborough, 2000 MT 301, \u00b6 81, 302 Mont. 350, \u00b6 81, 14 P.3d 1202, \u00b6 81 (citing <em>Partin, </em>287 Mont. at 18, 951 P.2d at 1005-06). A motion for a mistrial should be denied for \u201cdefects that do not affect the substantial rights of the defendant\u201d when \u201cthe record is sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201dState <em>v. Brady, </em>2000 MT 282, \u00b6 14, 302 Mont. 174, \u00b6 14, 13 P.3d 941, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. Berosik, </em>1999 MT 238, \u00b6 20, 296 Mont. 165, \u00b6 20, 988 P.2d 775, \u00b6 20).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-7\">\u00b613  Taking these factors into account, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hofeldt\u2019s motions for a mistrial. First, the evidence was strongly on the side of the State. An officer on the scene immediately after Hofeldt\u2019s and Alexander\u2019s altercation noted that Alexander was freshly cut and bruised, whereas Hofeldt had received no visible injuries. Hofeldt is significantly larger than Alexander and therefore his argument that Alexander initiated the attack and choked him is suspect. In addition, in light of the State\u2019s evidence, and because both statements were ambiguous, we simply cannot conclude that they had a prejudicial effect by denying Hofeldt a fair and impartial trial. Furthermore, Hofeldt did not ask for a jury instruction regarding the statements. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Hofeldt\u2019s motions for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b614 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b28-10\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
