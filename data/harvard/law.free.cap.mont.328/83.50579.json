We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b62 We address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court had the power to impose a servitude forbidding building on parts of the partitioned property.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are sufficient to support the imposition of building restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b108-15\">\u00b65 This action involves a tenancy in a rural valley-the Joslin Basin-in Lewis and Clark County. Kellogg and Dearborn own the property as tenants-in-common, having purchased it from the late Bruce Nelson in October 2000. A married couple, Joe Campbell and Tani Converse, own Dearborn. At one time Nelson owned much of the land in the valley, which he carved-up into haphazardly shaped small holdings. Nelson sold a great number of these holdings, creating a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>community of dozens of summer and permanent homes in the pristine valley. This hodgepodge of properties, and the difficulties that arose in recording them and locating easements to the various properties, created what the Referees characterized as a \u2018Title Company\u2019s nightmare.\u201d The tenancy at issue is what Dearborn aptly describes as \u201ca swiss-cheese like remainder parcel\u201d of a little over 600 acres and 25 tracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b66 Kellogg and Dearborn jointly purchased the tenancy with the intention of dividing it between themselves. Both live in homes on, or surrounded by, the property. Negotiations between the neighbors quickly broke-down and relations soured. In this acrimonious context, Kellogg brought suit against Dearborn in November 2001, requesting that the District Court partition the property. The District Court thereafter appointed referees pursuant to \u00a7 70-29-202(1), MCA, and ordered the Referees to survey the property and make a report recommending how best to divide it between the two tenants-in-common.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b67 Surveying the property proved to be quite an undertaking as many of the public records describing it turned out to be incorrect. After a great deal of effort in establishing exactly what land was, and was not, a part of the property, the Referees settled on a plan of division. Most of the details of the plan are not relevant to this opinion. The dividing line between the two halves of the property for the most part follows Joslin Creek, which runs through a meadow separating the two parties\u2019 residences. The one recommendation that Kellogg objects to on appeal is the Referees\u2019 proposal to impose \u2018ho build\u201d zones on sections of each half, including much of the aforementioned meadow. In their report the Referees stated the following regarding the \u2018ho build\u201d zones: \u2018No residential structures nor permanent agricultural structures (excepting fences, corrals or stock water facilities) should be built in these areas. These restrictions should appear in the deeds to these tracts and should be clearly identified in new Certificates of Survey and/or retracement Surveys.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The Referees\u2019 stated reasons for the \u2018ho build\u201d zones are that they should \u201creduce the need for any new permanent service roads and alleviate future discord.\u201d As to the effect the restrictions will have on the value of the property, the Referees stated that they \u201cconcurred that neither party\u2019s ownership would be significantly diminished in value through such prohibitions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b68 Kellogg challenged the \u2018ho build\u201d restrictions, asking the court to reject the Referees\u2019 recommendation. He argued that the Referees do not have the power to recommend such a restriction in a partition action. The District Court disagreed and adopted the Referees\u2019 report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>in its entirety. Kellogg now appeals the court\u2019s imposition of the \u2018ho build\u201d zones.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b69  When the referees in a partition action submit their report to the district court, the court \u201cmay confirm, change, modify, or set aside the report....\u201d Section 70-29-212, MCA; <em>Tillett v. Lippert </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 1, 6, 909 P.2d 1158, 1160. This Court reviews the district court\u2019s findings of fact in a partition action to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Troglia v. Bartoletti </em>(1994), 266 Mont. 240, 244, 879 P.2d 1169, 1171. A finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the evidence leaves this Court with the firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Troglia, </em>266 Mont. at 244, 879 P.2d at 1171. We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct. <em>Flood v. Kalinyaprak, </em>2004 MT 15, \u00b6 14, 319 Mont. 280, \u00b6 14, 84 P.3d 27, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AxgO\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b610 <em>Whether the District Court had the power to impose a servitude forbidding building on parts of the partitioned property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">\u00b611 Kellogg asserts that the District Court did not have the power to impose \u2018ho build\u201d zones on the partitioned property. He points out that neither he nor Dearborn requested such a servitude in their pleadings. Additionally, he argues that the only statutory power given to referees (and thus to the district court) to impose a servitude on a party to a partition proceeding is the power to create roads. Section 70-29-205(2), MCA, allows referees to \u201cset apart a portion of the [partitioned] property for a way, road, or street....\u201d Since the servitude in question here is not a \u201cway, road, or street,\u201d Kellogg reasons that neither the Referees nor the court possesses the power to impose a \u2018ho build\u201d zone.</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">\u00b612  In addition to \u00a770-29-205(2), MCA, however, stands \u00a770-29-209, MCA. That statute states that when a partition cannot be made equally-that is, when it is not feasible to award each tenant-in-common an equal section of the propertydhe court \u201cmay adjudge compensation to be made by one party to another on account of the inequality ....\u2019\u2019This refers to the ancient practice of owelty, through which a court avoids ordering a partition by sale when a property cannot be equally divided. <em>See Kravik v. Lewis </em>(1984), 213 Mont. 448, 455, 691 P.2d 1373, 1376. Section 70-29-209(2), MCA, grants the court broad powers in making this adjustment: \u2018In all cases the court has power to make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>compensatory adjustment between the respective parties according to the ordinary principles of equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">\u00b613  Although owelty often arises in the form of a monetary award, historically these \u201cordinary principles of equity\u201d have included the power to impose servitudes. For example, one partition case from Massachusetts involved a court granting an air and light easement to one tenant-in-common, thus imposing a servitude on another. <em>Bornstein v. Doherty </em>(Mass. 1910), 90 N.E. 531, 532, <em>cited in Matter of Marta </em>(Del. 1996), 672 A.2d 984, 987. In justifying this grant, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court stated, \u2018There is no doubt of the jurisdiction of the court, in [partition] proceedings, to annex reasonable easements to one part of the land, and impose reasonable servitude upon another part....\u201d A few years previous, the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals squarely held: \u201c\u2018Where lands are incapable of exact or fair division, the court has power to compensate by a charge upon the land by way of rent, servitude, or easement.\u2019\u201d <em>Martin v. Martin </em>(Va. 1897), 27 S.E. 810, 811 (quoting <em>Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence </em>\u00a71389). Given this expansive understanding of a court\u2019s equitable powers, and given that \u00a7 70-29-209(2), MCA, grants such powers to the district court, we conclude that it is within the court\u2019s powers to impose a servitude such as a \u2018ho build\u201d zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b614 Kellogg argues that, since neither party sought to impose a \u2018ho build\u201d zone, the court exceeded its powers in imposing one. In seeking to have the property partitioned, Kellogg did not seek to have the property divided along a particular line. That was left to the discretion of the court. Likewise, even though neither party sought to impose \u2018ho build\u201d zones, the court, in exercising its equitable powers, had the discretion to adopt the Referees\u2019 recommendation in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b615 The dissent states that the issue of the \u2018ho-build zone\u201d arose at \u201cthe end of the litigation <em>by way of judgment,\u201d </em>thereby inferring that Kellogg was caught off guard and should not be faulted for failing to raise constitutional objections. Such was not the case. When the referees\u2019 report recommending a \u2018ho-build zone\u201d was filed, the District Court ordered the parties to file objections thereto before the Court decided whether to adopt the recommendations. Although Kellogg had advance notice that the District Court was entertaining adoption of the no-build zone and filed an objection contending that the recommendation exceeded statutory authority, he did not argue that the no-build zone constituted an unconstitutional taking of his property. Thus, in arguing that the judgment herein interferes with the fundamental constitutional right of \u2018[possessing and protecting property\u201d under Article II, Section 3, of the Montana Constitution and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>amounts to an unconstitutional \u201ctaking\u201d of Kellogg\u2019s property, the dissent addresses theories which were neither raised in nor addressed by the District Court. A party may not raise new arguments or change his legal theory on appeal because it is unfair to fault the trial court on an issue that it was never given an opportunity to consider. <em>State v. Gouras, </em>2004 MT 329, \u00b6 26, 324 Mont. 130, \u00b6 26, 102 P.3d 27; <em>State v. Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 427, \u00b6 13, 114 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\n<em>Whether the District Court\u2019s findings of fact are sufficient to support the imposition of building restrictions.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b616 Even assuming that the court has the equitable power to impose building restrictions, Kellogg contends that the court\u2019s findings of fact are insufficient to support such restrictions. The \u2018ho build\u201d zones of this case are different from the servitudes in the above-cited partition cases because they have been imposed on <em>both </em>parties. This is permissible so long as the court imposes the servitudes in order to equitably divide the property. <em>See </em>above discussion of \u00a770-29-209, MCA. However, Kellogg argues that the Referees recommended the \u2018ho build\u201d zones, not in order to equitably divide the property, but for the purpose of alleviating acrimony between neighbors. He contends that such a purpose is outside of the court\u2019s equitable powers in a partition action and is thus illegitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">\u00b617 Although Kellogg is correct in arguing that the Referees relied, in part, on the rationale of alleviating neighborly tension, that was not the Referees\u2019 only stated reason for recommending the \u2018ho build\u201d zones. As mentioned earlier, another reason was to \u201creduce the need for any new permanent service roads.\u201d Given the \u201cswiss cheese\u201d nature of the tenancy and neighboring properties, there is already a large problem in the Joslin Basin with accommodating every structure with vehicular access. The Referees were obviously addressing the concern that either Kellogg or Dearborn would sell some of the land on the meadow separating their homes and that the new owners would then build structures on that land and seek access through Dearborn\u2019s and/or Kellogg\u2019s property. In order to head-off such a demand for future easements, the Referees thought it wise to ban future building on these areas of land.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With the ban in place, the division of the properties is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>more equitable because there will be less demand for new disruptive service roads. The Referees\u2019 recom-mendation, adopted by the District Court, adheres to the \u201cordinary principles of equity\u201d referenced in \u00a770-29-209, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">\u00b618  We conclude that the court\u2019s imposition of the \u2018ho build\u201d zone is supported by the Referees\u2019 recommendations as adopted by the District Court and the resulting concern with reducing the need for new permanent service roads as well as the concern with reducing potential friction between the litigants.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b619 We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b113-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AzW\">JUSTICE RICE dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b620 \u2018That alone is a just government,\u201d wrote James Madison, \u201cwhich impartially secures to every man, whatever is his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\"><em>Kelo v. City of New London </em>(2005), 162 L.Ed.2d 439, 468, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 2677 (Justice Sandra O\u2019Connor, dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">\u00b621 Believing that the judgment interferes with the fundamental constitutional right of \u201cpossessing and protecting property,\u201d <em>see </em>Article II, Section 3, Montana Constitution, I would reverse the District Court\u2019s imposition of the \u201cno-build zone\u201d on the property involved in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">\u00b622 TI]n order to be fundamental, a right must be found within Montana\u2019s Declaration of Rights or be a right \u2018without which other constitutionally guaranteed rights would have little meaning.\u2019\u201d <em>MEIC v. Dept. of Environmental Quality, </em>1999 MT 248, \u00b6 56, 296 Mont. 207, \u00b6 56, 988 P.2d 1236, \u00b6 56 (citing In <em>the Matter of C.H. </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 184, 201, 683 P.2d 931, 940). Found within the Declaration of Rights, the right of property is a fundamental one, dictating that the standard of review applied to governmental action affecting this interest is \"the most stringent standard, strict scrutiny.\u201d <em>MEIC, </em>\u00b6 60 (citing <em>Wadsworth v. State </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 287, 302, 911 P.2d 1165, 1174).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\u00b623 Kellogg argues that the court\u2019s imposition of the no-build zone upon the subject property equates to a \u2018taking\u201d of his private property interests without due process. He asserts that, by seeking partition of the property, he did not surrender use rights to the property or waive due process. Kellogg\u2019s takings construct is appropriate; many of the cases which have analyzed the kinds of property interests which can be impinged by government action fall within our takings jurisprudence. \u00b624 In <em>Knight v. City of Billings </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 165, 642 P.2d 141, deed restrictions were imposed on residential properties pursuant to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>city\u2019s approval of nearby commercial development. Although noting the unique circumstances of the case, we nonetheless recognized the constitutional issue raised by the imposition of a servitude upon property, and our holding reversed the District Court\u2019s approval of such imposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-4\">Though no physical taking has occurred, the result of the City\u2019s actions has been to impose a servitude, a limitation upon the use and marketability of plaintiffs\u2019 properties as residential. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">... [T]he City of Billings, although exercising its police power validly, and validly refusing to amend its zoning ordinance on plaintiffs\u2019 petition, nonetheless thereby interfered with the private property interests of the plaintiff so as to constitute a \u201ctaking\u201d by inverse condemnation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><em>Knight, </em>197 Mont. at 173-74, 642 P.2d at 145-46. In <em>Galt v. State Dept. of Fish, Wildlife </em>(1987), 225 Mont. 142, 731 P.2d 912, which analyzed property rights vis-a-vis the public trust doctrine, we invalidated statutes which authorized use of private property adjacent to state waters for recreational purposes, such as for portage, declaring that Tw]e reaffirm well established constitutional principles protecting property interests from confiscation.\u201d <em>Galt, </em>225 Mont. at 148, 731 P.2d at 916. We thus concluded that, despite the lack of a physical taking, regulation of the use of private property was nonetheless \u201cconfiscation.\u201d Likewise, in <em>Knight v. City of Missoula </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 232, 827 P.2d 1270, we concluded that a taking could occur by way of \u2018Increased traffic and the resultant increase in noise, dust, and fumes, etc., when no physical taking has occurred.\u201d <em>Knight, </em>252 Mont. at 241, 827 P.2d at 1275. These cases establish that the imposition of a restriction or servitude upon property, such as imposed here, is as much a taking of a property right as the physical capture of property in a direct condemnation action, and the same constitutional principles must apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">\u00b625 The question then becomes whether a servitude may be imposed upon property by a court within a partition action when the statute authorizing the proceeding does not provide for such impositions. Respondents frame the issue to the contrary, urging that \u201c[t]he issue is not whether the District Court violated Montana\u2019s statutes by imposing a remedy that was not expressly provided for in the statutes\u201d but, rather, \u201cwhether the Court\u2019s equitable discretion permitted it to adopt a Referee\u2019s Report that included \u2018no-build\u2019 zones as an integral part of a complex land division.\u201dThe Court sides with Respondents, concluding that there are \u2018broad powers\u201d within \u00a770-29-209(2), MCA, which allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>the imposition of servitudes as a matter of equity. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">\u00b626 The fundamental right of property and the concomitant constitutional standards of review do not simply vanish under the exercise of equity. Neither can a court grant relief by equity which exceeds statutory authorization. \u2018In Montana, an action for partition is a special statutory proceeding. \u2018We must therefore look to the statute for the authority to bring the action, and for the procedure to be followed both in bringing the action and after it is instituted.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawrence v. Harvey </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 314, 319, 607 P.2d 551, 555 <em>(citing Hurley v. O\u2019Neill </em>(1905), 31 Mont. 595, 79 P. 242, 243). Similarly, in <em>Fernandes v. Rodriguez </em>(Conn. 2000), 761 A.2d 1283, the Supreme Court of Connecticut discussed the history of partition and, under statutes giving the trial court broad equitable powers, noted that remedies were nonetheless limited by statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">Due to the frequent impracticality inherent in actual division, however, all states, except Maine, have, by statute, expanded the right to partition to permit a partition by sale under certain circumstances. See Restatement, 2 Property c. 11, pp. 658-61....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-5\">On the basis of the history of the right to partition, and in light of the legislative treatment of that right, we have held repeatedly that in resolving partition actions, the <em>only </em>two modes of relief within the power of the court are partition by division of real estate and partition by sale. \u2018tA] court is limited to rendering a judgment of either partition in kind or by sale of the real property; <em>Klaus </em>v. <em>Klaus, </em>143 Conn. 218, 221, 121 A.2d 283 (1956); thus terminating the ownership relationship between the parties.\u201d [Citations omitted.] Accordingly, remedies that fall outside the realm of partition in kind or partition by sale are not \u2018legally permissible\u201d: <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>Willard Shopping Center Associates, </em>supra, 324, 544 A.2d 1207; and a \u201ccourt is precluded from substituting its own ideas of what might be a wise provision in place of a clear expression of legislative will.\u201d <em>Penfield </em>v. <em>Jarvis, </em>supra, at 474-75, 399 A.2d 1280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-6\"><em>Fernandes, </em>761 A.2d at 1288-89 (italics in original; underlining added). \u00b627 Our statute requires as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-7\">[I]f it appear by the evidence ... to the satisfaction of the court that the property or any part is so situated that the partition cannot be made without great prejudice to the owners, the court may order a sale thereof; otherwise, upon the requisite proofs being made, <em>it must order a partition according to the respective rights of the parties </em>as ascertained by the court....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Section 70-29-202, MCA (emphasis added)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b628 This Court has not hesitated to overturn partition orders which exceed statutory parameters. In <em>Lawrence, </em>we stated that the partition court may \u2018brake an equitable adjustment of the cotenants\u2019 interests,\u201d but reversed the judgment at issue, noting that the equities within a partition suit \u201care <em>limited to such as arise from the partition of the land.\u201d Lawrence, </em>186 Mont. at 323, 607 P.2d at 557 (citing 4 Thompson on Real Property \u00a7 1829, 1830 at 331 (1979)) (emphasis added). We also emphasized from the statute that the purpose of a partition action was \u201c\u2018to divide among the co-owners land held by them either as joint tenants or as tenants in common <em>according to their respective interest.\u2019\u201d Lawrence, </em>186 Mont. at 319, 607 P.2d at 555 (quoting Emery <em>v. Emery </em>(1948), 122 Mont. 201, 200 P.2d 251, 265) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b629 The Court today attempts to stretch this statutory authority by relying on the reference in \u00a7 70-29-209(2), MCA, to \u201cprinciples of equity,\u201d which it describes as \u2018broad powers.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 12. However, this section addresses the court\u2019s authority to \u201cadjudge compensation to be made by one party to another\u201d when \u201ca partition cannot be made equal between the parties according to their respective rights.\u201d Here, no compensatory award pursuant to this section was made and, in any event, the reference to \u201cprinciples of equity\u201d in a provision addressing such awards does not authorize the court to impose new servitudes on the property. The Court also relies on two turn-of-the-last-century cases from other states which approve imposition of \u201creasonable easements,\u201d \u201creasonable servitudes,\u201d\u2018bents,\u201d and \u201ccharges\u201din partition actions, but which bear no relation to either our statutes or to our constitutional jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">\u00b630 That the District Court exceeded its authority under our statutes can be readily seen: under the partition order, the parties have \u201clesser\u201d property interests separately than they had together. That is, the property now bears a servitude, or restriction on use, that did not previously exist. The District Court has thus rendered the sum of the parts as less than the whole. To the contrary, property owners cannot <em>lose </em>property in a partition action: \u201cthe court... must order a partition <em>according to </em>the respective rights of the parties ....\u2019\u2019Section 70-29-202, MCA (emphasis added). If the property is to be divided \u201caccording to\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the owners\u2019 property rights, such division cannot reduce those property rights. \u201cA court\u2019s function when deciding a partition action is not to create new interests in property held by tenants in common, but is merely to sever the unity of possession owned by the tenants.\u201d <em>Martinez v. Martinez </em>(Colo. App. 1981), 638 P.2d 834, 836 (citing <em>Johnson v. Ford </em>(Ark. 1961), 345 S.W.2d 604).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">\u00b631 Allowing a partition court to impose servitudes not authorized by statute<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> turns the judge into a glorified land planning officer for purposes of the subject property. However, a partition action is not a subdivision and platting task in which the court can impose restrictions upon property over the owner\u2019s objection, regardless of how convenient or beneficial such authority would be. The flexibility which the trial court enjoys when acting in equity is necessarily circumscribed by the statutes governing that process. To allow courts to go beyond the statute invites what occurred here: a loss of property interests, for purposes of a convenient division, which violated a fundamental constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b632 The Court responds that this dissent \u201caddresses theories which were neither raised in nor addressed by the District Court.\u201d Under the circumstances, this is entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">\u00b633 The central premise for the constitutional violation is that the District Court restricted property rights by exceeding its statutory authority-a premise which the Court does not rebut. When the referees\u2019 report was filed in the District Court, Kellogg filed objections thereto, arguing that the no-build zone Vas beyond the scope of a partition action or the authority of the referees or the Court.\u201dKellogg argued that the referees\u2019 recommendation violated the statute and requested the District Court to remand the matter to the referees for a redetermination without the offending building restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">\u00b634 The District Court rejected that request and, without further proceedings, decreed that the no-build zone be imposed. It was this error by the District Court which violated the Constitution. Unlike other litigation, where parties seek remedies for past grievances, there was no constitutional violation here until the District Court rejected Kellogg\u2019s correct argument that the referees had exceeded their statutory authority, and ordered the imposition of a no-build zone on the property. Thus, the constitutional violation occurred at the end of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>the litigation <em>by way of the judgment-^with </em>the District Court as the state actor. As such, it was entirely appropriate for Kellogg to argue on appeal that the judgment itself violated due process, and for this Court to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b635 I would reverse.</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY joins in the dissent of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> The Referees also recommended imposing a \u2018ho build\u201dzone on a separate section of Dearborn\u2019s land, wholly removed from Kellogg\u2019s. Since Dearborn does not object to this zone, it is not addressed in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\"> Section 70-29-205, MCA, imposes the same requirement upon the referees: \u2018In making partition, the referees must divide the property and allot the several portions thereof to the respective parties, quality and quantity relatively considered, <em>according to the respective rights of the parties </em>as determined by the court, pursuant to the provisions of this chapter ....\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\"> The statutes specifically provide that a portion of partitioned property may be set aside for a road under the conditions set forth therein. <em>See </em>\u00a770-29-205(2), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
