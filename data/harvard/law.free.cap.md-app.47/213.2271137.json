J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AmV\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The appellant, Robert Edward Lee, was convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of various violations of the Maryland Controlled Dangerous Substances Act. <em>See </em>Md. Ann. Code art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 276-303 (1976 Repl. Vol.). Following conviction, Lee was sentenced to a period of 15 years incarceration, but a sentence review panel reduced the time to be served to five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Lee has appealed to this Court where he advances a pentad of reasons why the judgment of the circuit court should be reversed. Because we hold that the trial court erred in refusing to grant appellant\u2019s motion to suppress physical evidence, we find it unnecessary to consider the other four issues raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">We set forth briefly the factual situation from which this matter arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">From the record it is apparent that Officer Michael Garvey of the Montgomery County Police Department applied for and obtained a search warrant on December 19, 1978 for the premises known as Apartment 9, 12309 Braxfield Court, Rockville, Maryland. Lee was apprehended in that particular apartment on that same date when the warrant was executed at 9:10 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">As a result of the search, the police seized in the premises approximately 33V2 pounds of marijuana, 510 methaquadone tablets, 742 capsules of amphetamine, a scale, miscellaneous personal papers belonging to Lee, $7,266 in United States currency, of which $1,415 were in Lee\u2019s pocket, a quantity of glass vials, two cutting boards, plastic \"baggies,\u201d and other paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Prior to trial, Lee moved to suppress the evidence for want of probable cause in the issuance of the warrant. Additionally, Lee asked for a hearing pursuant to <em>Franks v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number><em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154 (1978). The court heard argument on both motions and denied them.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">When the matter went to trial before the judge who issued the warrant, Lee, through his counsel, asked the court to rehear the motion to suppress the evidence. The rehearing was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Lee contends that the application for the warrant shows on its face that the information relied upon by the issuing judge was stale and did not establish probable cause. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In <em>Peterson v. State, </em>281 Md. 309, 379 A.2d 164 (1977), <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 945 (1978), the Court of Appeals addressed the issue, for the first time, of stale probable cause. Judge Orth, writing for the Court, summarized the rules governing probable cause in the issuance of a search warrant. He quoted from <em>State v. Edwards, </em>266 Md. 515, 518-19, 295 A.2d 465, 466-67 (1972), where it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">\"The finding of 'probable cause,\u2019 while demanding more than mere suspicion, <em>Draper v. U.S., </em>358 U.S. 307, 311-12, 79 S. Ct. 329, 3 L. Ed. 2d 327 (1959), requires less evidence than would justify conviction, <em>Locke v. U.S., </em>7 Cranch 339, 348, 3 L. Ed. 364 (1813), and less than would justify an officer in making a search without a warrant, <em>Johnson v. U.S., </em>333 U.S. 10, 15, 68 S. Ct. 367, 92 L. Ed. 436 (1948). The evidence itself need not be legally competent in a criminal trial, <em>Draper v. U.S., supra, </em>358 U.S. at 311, and may in fact be hearsay, <em>Jones v. U.S., </em>362 U.S. 257, 272, 80 S. Ct. 725, 4 L. Ed. 2d 697 (1960), so long as the judicial officer issuing the warrant is informed of some underlying circumstances supporting the affiant\u2019s conclusions and his belief that any informant involved was credible or his information reliable, <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 114, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964), and such judicial officer is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts contained in the affidavit based on his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>experience in such matters. <em>Irby v. U.S., </em>114 U.S. App. D.C. 246, 314 F.2d 251, 253 (1963), <em>cert. denied, </em>374 U.S. 842 (1963).\u201d <em>Peterson v. State, supra </em>at 313, 379 A.2d at 166.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Judge Orth, for the <em>Peterson </em>Court, went on to declare:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-7\">\"Our concern in determining whether a warrant necessary to the reasonableness of a search and seizure has been issued upon an affidavit supporting probable cause is only with the question <em>'\"whether the affiant had reasonable grounds at the time of his affidavit and the issuance of the warrant for the belief that the law was being violated on the premises to be searched; </em>and if the apparent facts set out in the affidavit are such that a reasonably discreet [sic] and prudent man would be led to believe that there was a commission of the offense charged, there is probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant.\u201d \u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>266 Md. at 519, quoting <em>Dumbra v. United States, </em>268 U.S. 435, 441, 45 S. Ct. 546 (1925). It follows that if the facts set out in the affidavit are 'stale,\u2019 the affiant would not have reasonable grounds at the time of his affidavit and the issuance of the warrant for the belief that the law was being violated on the premises to be searched. The question is what constitutes 'stale probable cause.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Id. </em>at 313-14, 379 A.2d at 166-67.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">The <em>Peterson </em>Court adopted the rule regarding stale probable cause as stated in <em>Garza v. State, </em>120 Tex. Crim. 147, 149, 48 S.W.2d 625, 626 (1932), which \"properly states the law and embodies the holdings of the Court of Special Appeals,[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] the more persuasive teachings of the courts in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>other jurisdictions, and the general opinions of text writers and commentators.\u201d <em>Peterson v. State, supra </em>at 315, 379 A.2d at 167. The Texas Court articulated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">\"The affidavit for a search warrant on probable cause, based on information and belief, should in some manner, by averment of date or otherwise, show that the event or circumstance constituting probable cause, occurred at the time not so remote from the date of the affidavit as to render it improbable that the alleged violation of law authorizing the search was extant at the time the application for the search warrant was made.\u201d <em>Garza v. State, supra </em>at 149, 48 S.W.2d at 626.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">In the instant case, the warrant was issued, as we have said, on December 19, 1978. The affidavit in support of the warrant contains 24 numbered items. A careful review of its contents shows that many of the statements made by the affiant are merely conclusory, and although several different informants are relied upon by the affiant, only one was properly established as a reliable source.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">Items one (1) through five (5), seven (7), nine (9), eleven (11), twelve (12), and fifteen (15) relate information received by various anonymous persons. No attempt was made, however, to establish that those persons were credible or reliable sources. Singularly, item 10 relates information received by affiant from an informant whose reliability is adequately established. <em>See Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U.S. 108, 84 S. Ct. 1509, 12 L. Ed. 2d 723 (1964). The affidavit in pertinent part stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">\"10. On January 26, 1978, Cpl. R. Ricucci, Montgomery County Department of Police, Vice-Narcotic Division, received information from a confidential reliable informant. The confidential reliable informant will be referred to as Confidential Reliable Informant #2. Confidential Reliable Informant #2 told Cpl. Ricucci that he had been in Robert Lee\u2019s apartment during the week of January 12, 1978 and had observed in the apartment three ounces of cocaine, $1,000.00 worth of Quaaludes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>1,000 Black Beauties and 10 lbs. of Marihuana. Confidential Reliable Informant #2 stated that Robert Lee makes trips to Florida to obtain drugs. Confidential Reliable Informant #2 has in the past supplied information which was [sic] been reliable to the Narcotic Section of the Vice-Narcotic Division of the Montgomery County Department of Police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">A) Between November of 1976 and December of 1976, Confidential Reliable Informant #2 provided information which led to the execution of a search warrant and the seizure of a large quantity of pharmaceutical drugs along with two arrests which resulted in convictions in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">B) Between December 1976 and January 1977, this Confidential. Reliable Informant #2 provided information which led to the arrest of one adult for burglary in Montgomery County and the recovery of stolen property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-7\">C) Between May 1976 and June 1976, this Confidential Reliable Informant #2 set up a buy-bust arrest which resulted in the seizure of nineteen (19) pounds of marihuana and a conviction of the subject in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-8\">D) In February of 1976, this Confidential Reliable Informant #2 provided information which led to the arrest of a subject wanted for Distribution of Heroin by the Montgomery County Department of Police.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">E) In July of 1977, this Confidential Reliable Informant #2 set up a buy-bust arrest of a subject which resulted in the seizure of twenty-five (25) pounds of marihuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">F) In July of 1977, this Confidential Reliable Informant #2 provided information which led to the arrest of a subject wanted for daytime housebreaking and forgery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">G) In February of 1978, this Confidential Reliable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>Informant #2 provided information which led to the arrest of a subject wanted for Assault with Intent to Murder and Escape in Montgomery County, Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-5\">H) During the month of January 1978, this Confidential Reliable Informant #2 provided information which led to the execution of a search warrant and a seizure of a quantity of controlled dangerous substance along with one arrest which resulted in a conviction in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">The quoted passages would be sufficient to establish probable cause, notwithstanding the inadequacy of the information supplied in the affidavit as obtained from other sources. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 721, 725, 288 A.2d 622, 625, <em>cert. denied, </em>266 Md. 738, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 1039 (1972). The remoteness of the informant\u2019s observations as disclosed in the affidavit, however, leads us to conclude that the information was stale.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The informant allegedly observed the unlawful drugs in Lee\u2019s apartment during the week of January 12, 1978. The warrant was issued on December 19, 1978, eleven months later. There are no facts asserted to indicate any continuing activity between January and December of 1978 which would link the appellant to illegal drugs. It has been held that \"where the affidavit recites facts indicating activity of a protracted and continuo\u00fas nature, or a course of conduct, the passage of time becomes less significant, so as not to vitiate the warrant. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>See Peterson v. State, supra </em>at 317-18, 379 A.2d at 168-69. No such facts are presented in the affidavit utilized in the matter now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Items thirteen (13) through twenty-three (23) of the affidavit primarily concern observations made by the affiant through surveillance of the appellant\u2019s residence. The officer said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b241-9\">\"13.

Persons purchasing controlled dangerous substances often park their vehicles not directly in front of a residence used for drug trafficking. Vehicles from different jurisdictions frequent the residence used for the trafficking of controlled dangerous substances. Packages go in and out of residences used for the trafficking of controlled dangerous substances.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">A careful reading of the officer\u2019s recitations of his observations will disclose that the surveillance does not satisfy any of the officer\u2019s stated criteria \"common to drug trafficking.\u201d Nothing in those observations, as related by the affiant, indicated that there were unlawful drugs in Lee\u2019s apartment or that Lee was involved in any criminal activities. That the surveillance revealed persons arriving and leaving Lee\u2019s apartment does not support a rational inference that drug sales were taking place at the residence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>There is nothing alleged that suggests any unusual activity nor are there facts sufficient to show that any of the persons observed during the surveillance were known users or dealers in the illegal sale of drugs. Moreover, the affiant did not observe any actual purchases or sales of proscribed controlled dangerous substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Item eighteen (18) simply tells of an unsuccessful attempt by an informant, whose reliability is not established, to purchase narcotics from the appellant on December 8, 1978. The item alleges that the informant went to Lee\u2019s apartment but could not obtain drugs because Lee did not have them.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Applying the <em>Peterson </em>standards to the affidavit in support of the warrant issued in the instant case leads us to conclude that there <em>were </em>insufficient facts to pass muster on \"reasonable grounds\u201d at the time of the making of the affidavit and the issuance of the warrant thereon to believe that Lee\u2019s apartment contained controlled dangerous substances. At best the affiant\u2019s observations do not rise above the level of suspicion. <em>Cuff\u00eda v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 521, 525, 287 A.2d 319, 322 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The information related by the only informant whose reliability was adequately established was \"stale.\u201d The happenings related were so remote in time as to be virtually worthless. That an event occurred in January 1978 does not support a conclusion that it is still happening eleven months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In our view, a reasonably prudent person could not determine from the affidavit that Lee\u2019s apartment probably contained contraband on the date the warrant was issued. Because the affidavit in support of the warrant failed to demonstrate probable cause, the warrant itself was invalid and in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Accordingly, Lee\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by Montgomery County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b238-9\">.
