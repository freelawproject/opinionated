Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. (1980 Repl. Vol.) Code Ann. \u00a7 3-801 (e).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The disagreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>resulting in this appeal has arisen over which institution, public or private, is to furnish that assistance, and of more importance to the parties, just who is to pay for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">On March 13, 1980, by order of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (sitting as a juvenile court), Linda G. was placed in the custody of the appellant, the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH).* 1<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court further directed the appellant to pay the cost of Linda\u2019s care at Taylor Manor, a privately owned hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">For approximately two years prior to the order, Linda had been receiving inpatient treatment at Taylor Manor. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>expenses were paid by her parents.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> By March of 1979, Linda\u2019s parents\u2019 insurance coverage expired and they turned to the State for help. A petition was filed in the juvenile court for Prince George\u2019s County to have Linda declared to be a child in need of assistance,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and to obtain an order from the court that the appellee, the Prince George\u2019s County Department of Social Services (PGDSS), assume the financial responsibility for Linda\u2019s treatment at Taylor Manor. The juvenile court judge, by order of April 26, 1979, placed Linda in the custody of both PGDSS and DHMH. The judge directed that PGDSS and DHMH were each to pay Taylor Manor $1,500 per month for Linda\u2019s care and treatment. Interestingly, DI1MH was not even a party to the case when the order directing it to pay was passed. A motion for reconsideration was granted at which time the appellant, together with the Maryland Department of Human Resources and the Prince George\u2019s County Board of Education, were joined as party defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">A hearing was held on March 13, 1980. All the parties to the hearing except the DHMH were dismissed. The appellant \"or ... [its] appropriate agents ... [were ordered by the court to] undertake the financial responsibility for the care and treatment of Linda [G.] at the Taylor Manor Hospital [a private facility] ... in the amount of ... $3,100.00 per month....\u201d Foreseeing all sorts of financial and budgetary problems that might arise should the juvenile court\u2019s order be allowed to stand, DHMH appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">We shall reduce the many issues raised by the appellants to their least common demoninator.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Once that is done, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>question before us becomes: May a juvenile court judge order the Secretary of the DHMH to assume the obligation to pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the costs of maintaining a CINA in a private hospital,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> notwithstanding that no funds have been budgeted or, more importantly, have been appropriated for that purpose by the legislature?</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u2014 <em>THE HOLDING \u2014</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Predicated on the doctrine of separation of powers, coupled with the legislative scheme for juvenile mental health services, we hold that the hearing court was without jurisdiction to direct DHMH to shoulder the financial responsibility for Linda\u2019s care and treatment at Taylor Manor. We further hold that <em>no </em>juvenile court has the authority to direct the Secretary of DHMH to pay the cost of treatment of a CINA in a private institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">\u2014 <em>THE LAW \u2014</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">A. <em>The Legislative Intent of Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Article \u00a7 3-820.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The judicial procedure for the adjudication and disposition of juveniles in need of health or mental hygiene care, or both, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>is found in the Juvenile Causes Act, codified in Courts Art. \u00a7 3-801 through 3-834.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">Juvenile court jurisdiction is triggered by the filing of a petition with the court by any interested party, in which petition the court is asked to adjudicate a child as 1) delinquent, 2) in need of supervision, or 3) assistance.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Parojinog </em>v. <em>State, </em>282 Md. 256, 384 A.2d 86 (1978). Thereafter, an adjudicatory hearing, unless waived, shall be held. Courts Art. \u00a7 3-819.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Once the allegations are proven, a separate disposition hearing must be held. Under the authority of Courts Art. \u00a7 3-820, the child may be committed to several alternative persons or agencies. Section 3-820 provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\"(a) After an adjudicatory hearing the court shall hold a separate disposition hearing, unless the petition is dismissed or unless such hearing is waived in writing by all of the parties. The disposition hearing may be held on the same day as the adjudicatory hearing, if notice of the disposition hearing, as prescribed by the Maryland Rules, is waived on the record by all of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">(b) The overriding consideration in making a disposition is a program of treatment, training, and rehabilitation best suited to the physical, mental, and moral welfare of the child consistent with the public interest. The court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">(1) Place the child on probation or under supervision in his own home or in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>custody or under the guardianship of a relative or other fit person, upon terms the court deems appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">(2) Commit the child to the custody or under the guardianship of the Juvenile Services Administration, a local department of social services, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, or a public or licensed private agency; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">(3) Order the child, parents, guardian, or custodian of the child to participate in rehabilitative services that are in the best interest of the child and the family.\u201d [<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">When a child is committed to the custody of DHMH, the statutory provisions governing DHMH, as well as those agencies embraced within the Department, are applicable. Designated in Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 2A (1978 Repl. Vol., 1980 Cum. Supp.) as a \"principal department of the executive branch\u201d of the State government, the DHMH \"is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>responsible for carrying out the Governor\u2019s policies in the areas of health and mental hygiene.\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 41, \u00a7 206 (b). Section 206 (e) of Art. 41 enumerates those agencies that are included within the ambit of DHMH. Among those listed agencies are the State Department of Mental Hygiene and the State Department of Juvenile Services.</p>\n<p id=\"Asu\">As a major department of the Executive Branch, section 206 (g) confers upon the Secretary of DHMH the responsibility for the budget of DHMH, while Maryland Constitution Art. Ill, \u00a7 52 (11) requires the Secretary to report to the Governor that amount of money needed to operate DHMH so that the Governor may include that sum or an adjusted amount within the budget he submits to the Legislature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">The extent of a court\u2019s authority to commit a child to the care of the appellant can be ascertained from a review of the legislative scheme for the provision of juvenile mental health services in Maryland as well as a recent Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion closely analogous to the factual situation in the case at hand. In <em>In Re Appeal No. 653, September Term, </em>1975, 277 Md. 212, 352 A.2d 845 (1976), a juvenile court had committed twelve children to the custody of DHMH. Each child had been adjudicated, pursuant to Md. Cts. and Jud. Proc. (1980 Repl. Vol.) Code Ann. \u00a7 3-820, a CI\u00d1A. The court, in ordering DHMH to place the children in facilities separate from adults, reasoned that if section 3-823 prohibited the cohabitation of adults and juveniles in jails and other detention facilities, then the Legislature must have intended for them to be housed in separate mental facilities, notwithstanding that there was no express provision to that effect. DHMH was <em>not </em>a party to the adjudicatory proceeding, and it filed a motion to set aside or modify the juvenile court\u2019s order. Claiming that the court had exceeded its statutory authority, DHMH maintained that there were not enough State adolescent facilities to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>accommodate the court\u2019s order, \" 'rendering it impracticable and/or impossible for the Secretary [of DHMH] to comply with the orders.\u2019 \u201d 277 Md. at 215, 352 A.2d at 847. Thereafter, a hearing was held to consider the DHMH\u2019s position, \"at which several expert witnesses testified concerning the feasibility ... of separating adolescent patients from adult patients in mental health facilities. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>The juvenile court was apparently unimpressed by DHMH\u2019s arguments inasmuch as it reiterated its original order.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Judge Eldridge, speaking for a unanimous Court, held that the legislature did <em>not </em>intend juveniles to be placed in mental health facilities separate from adults. The Court, in comparing the different subsections under section 3-820 (b) which enumerates the alternative persons or agencies to which a child may be committed, noted that subsection (b) (1) enables the juvenile court to \"|p]lace the child on probation or under supervision in his own home or in the custody or under the guardianship of a relative or other fit person, <em>upon terms the court deems </em>appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.). Subsection (b) (2), which authorizes commitment to DHMH, does not, however, contain the phrase <em>\"upon terms the court deems appropriate. \u201d </em>Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that the legislature did not intend to authorize the juvenile courts \"to specify whatever terms it deems appropriate [for commitment to DHMH].\u201d 277 Md. at 217, 352 A.2d at 848. A juvenile court, it was held, could not order DHMH to place children in separate facilities from those of adults. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\"><em>In re Appeal No. 653, supra, </em>is a clear instruction to this Court to hold that the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as a juvenile court, lacked the authority to order DHMH to pay for Linda\u2019s care at Taylor Manor. Section 3-820 (b) (2) empowers the court to commit a child to the custody of DHMH; it does not confer upon the court any right to mandate the specific terms of the commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">B. <em>Additional Evidence of Legislative Intent.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">The recurring theme permeating the pertinent statutory provisions concerning juvenile mental health services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>referred to in Courts Art. \u00a7 3-820 (b) (2) is the broad discretion in implementing programs and expending appropriated funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">We are mindful of a basic tenet of statutory construction, that a statute and other complementary provisions must be read as a whole in order to give effect to legislative intent. <em>State v. Fabritz, </em>276 Md. 416, 348 A.2d 275, <em>cert. denied, </em>425 U.S. 942 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Md. Ann. Code art. 43, which governs the general operations of DHMH, vests the Secretary with the <em>discretionary </em>authority, if the State budget so permits, to contract with outside doctors and hospitals should the Secretary believe that an <em>area </em>is substantially deficient in medical care. Md. Ann. Code art. 43, \u00a7 IF (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">Section IF (h) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\"In the event of the failure of a cooperative effort by and between the Secretary and local community or voluntary organizations to establish medical or health care facilities ... or services for substantially deficient <em>areas, </em>to provide such facilities or services by way of contract with a doctor, groups of doctors, hospitals, or other authorized medical groups or personnel for the provision of necessary medical or health care facilities. Medical or health care facilities may be provided as authorized by the capital budgets of State or local governments.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">We think any fair reading of the above-quoted statute will disclose that in using the word <em>areas, </em>the Legislature meant <em>geographical areas </em>of the State wherein the medical or health services are deficient. The word <em>areas </em>does not mean, nor was it ever intended to be a synonym for, a branch of medical or mental health or hygiene or a specialized discipline thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Section 1J (b) instructs the Secretary that he \"may make grants from State . . . [appropriated] funds or enter into agreements for the use of such funds to assist public or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>nonprofit organizations____\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Turning to Article 52A \u2014 Juvenile Services \u2014, section 7 provides that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-5\">\"Department [of Juvenile Services] <em>may </em>designate existing public or private agencies or organizations within the State as its agents as, in its discretion, seems desirable or necessary for the purposes of this article. The Department <em>may </em>expend funds for aiding such agencies or organizations or for purchasing services therefrom.. ..\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">If such funds are not available, Art. 43, \u00a7 IF (e) permits the Secretary of DHMH to reassign funds from one department to another. Significantly, the General Assembly used the word <em>may </em>as opposed to <em>shall, </em>thereby strongly suggesting that the statutory instructions to the Secretary of DHMH are permissive, not mandatory. The use of <em>may </em>bestows a discretion in the Secretary. See <em>Resetar </em>v. <em>State Board of Education, </em>284 Md. 537, 547, 399 A.2d 225, 230 (1979); <em>Maryland Medical Services, Inc. </em>v. <em>Carver, </em>238 Md. 466, 480, 209 A.2d 582, 589-90 (1964). It is, therefore, within DHMH\u2019s discretion to expend appropriated funds, <em>cf. </em>Md. Education (1980 Cum. Supp.) Code Ann. \u00a7 8-409, especially purchase of care funds.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> For the Court to interpret the statute so as to permit all juvenile courts *<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to direct the appellant to make payments in specified amounts to a specific private institution or person without regard to the appellant\u2019s budget would have disastrous effects on the State treasury.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Moreover, it would reduce the Secretary to the position of paymaster, with nothing more to do in such cases than to draw checks periodically and forward them to the court\u2019s designated recipient.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">The indiscriminate expenditure of State funds for private placement at the instruction of courts will undermine the State budget, imperil the State\u2019s financial structure, and defeat the Legislature\u2019s intent to promote and provide mental health services with impartiality to all citizens of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We adopt, with slight modification, the language of the New Jersey Superior Court in <em>State of New Jersey in the Interest of D.F., a Juvenile, </em>145 N.J. Super. 381, 387-88, 367 A.2d 1198, 1201 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>377 A.2d 665 (1977).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">\"[DHMH] must act not only with respect to the needs of the particular juvenile concerned but also in light of the needs of the thousands of other juveniles equally needy and as limited by available resources. It cannot perform this function if its budget is to be affected by the orders of. .. [all] ... Juvenile .. . court judges [in the State of Maryland] issued without respect to the realities of [DHMH\u2019s] fiscal problems.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-7\"><em>See In Re John Doe, a Juvenile, </em>390 A.2d 390 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">C. <em>Separation of Powers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">An integral part of the Legislature\u2019s giving to the appellant the discretion to use appropriated funds is the doctrine of the separation of powers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The doctrine is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>fundamental concept in the constitutional history of this State. <em>See Board of Supervisors of Election v. Todd, </em>97 Md. 247, 54 A. 963 (1903).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-4\">\"]T]he Legislative, Executive and Judicial powers of Government ought to be forever separate and distinct from each other; and no person exercising the functions of one of said Departments shall assume or discharge the duties of any other.\u201d [<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] Md. Const. Declaration of Rights, Art. 8 (1977 Repl. Vol.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The Court of Appeals, in <em>Wright v. Wright\u2019s Lessee, </em>2 Md. 429, 56 Am. Dec. 723 (1852), early identified the purpose of Article 8. The Court stated that the doctrine\u2019s purpose</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">\"is to parcel out and separate the powers of government, and to confide particular classes of them to particular branches of the Supreme authority. That is to say, such of them as are judicial in their character to the judiciary; such as are legislative to the legislature and such as are executive in their nature to the executive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">While the nature of judicial versus non-judicial actions is not well defined, <em>see Todd, supra </em>at 264, 57 A. at 965, the constitution does not allow the courts to usurp the discretionary functions of the Executive, and the administrative departments of that branch, whose duties and powers have been properly delegated by the Legislature. <em>Department of Natural Resources v. Linchester Sand &amp; Gravel Corp., </em>274 Md. 211, 228, 334 A.2d 514, 524 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">The order of the juvenile court, directing DHMH to pay for Linda\u2019s private placement is a substantial encroachment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>upon the Executive\u2019s authority to propose the budget and upon DHMH, as an administrative department of the Executive, to use its discretion as granted by the Legislature to expend the appropriated funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The people of Maryland have elected a Governor who is the Chief Executive Officer of the State. They have charged him with the task of preparing the State budget and have also made him responsible for the State\u2019s fiscal policies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The budget that the Governor submits to the Legislature for approval and funding \"contain[s] a complete plan of [the State\u2019s] proposed expenditures and estimated revenues.\u201d To fulfill his role of preparing the proposed budget, the Governor requires from \"all executive departments . . . applying for State moneys and appropriations, such itemized estimates and other information in such form and at such times as .. . [the Governor] shall direct... .\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Subsection (4) of Art. Ill, \u00a7 52 of the State Constitution mandates that the budget submitted to the Legislature by the Governor \"shall embrace an estimate of all appropriations ... (b) for the Executive Department .. . [and] (g) for such other purposes as are set forth in the Constitution or laws of the State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The historical development of the Executive\u2019s control over the preparation of the budget was discussed at length in <em>Maryland Action for Foster Children </em>v. <em>State, </em>279 Md. 133, 367 A.2d 491 (1977). In that case, the facts were that the Legislature had passed a bill requiring that the Social Services Administration\u2019s payment rate to foster care homes be equalized to the payment rates of the Juvenile Services Administration. The budget submitted by the Governor did not include appropriations which would equalize the two rates. Consequently, the Maryland Action for Foster Children sued to compel the State to pay all foster care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>parents the equalized sum.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court held that the Governor was not under a mandatory duty to include within his proposed budget funding so as to comply with the legislation. Judge Eldridge, writing for the majority of the Court, emphasized the Executive\u2019s almost exclusive domain over the budget as submitted to the General Assembly. Judge Eldridge observed that prior to 1916, the Legislature had been responsible for the preparation of the budget. Excessive appropriations and a growing deficit prompted reformers to find an alternative method for budget preparation. A commission was appointed in 1915 for the purpose of recommending changes in the budgetary system. It recommended that the Executive be solely responsible for preparing the budget.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That recommendation gained fruition when a Constitutional amendment incorporating it was adopted by the electorate on November 7, 1916.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the concept of the 1916 amendment remains basically intact. Although the Court of Appeals did not specifically address the separation of powers doctrine in the <em>Foster Children Case, </em>the Court pointed out that the preparation of the budget bill was completely within the discretion of the Governor, and any interference with his duty conflicted with the Maryland Constitution. The adoption by the voters of the amendment to the State Constitution Art. Ill, \u00a7 52 (11) and (12) placed a restriction on the Governor\u2019s theretofore absolute discretion. That restriction is not, however, applicable to this appeal, so we shall not dwell upon the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">Patently, no State program can operate without funds. The funds must be included in the Governor\u2019s budget and approved by the Legislature. Without that joint approval, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>State funds may be expended by any department of the State government.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">What the juvenile court order in the instant case did was to invade the Executive department by directing the Secretary of DHMH to pay out monies for a purpose not funded by the Legislature nor requested by the Executive. Furthermore, the court intruded on the Legislative Branch by directing the funding of Linda\u2019s private hospital confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Thus, the juvenile court committed a \"double play,\u201d by impinging upon the powers of the Executive and the Legislative Branches. The \"double play,\u201d however, is a \"double error.\u201d The order directing the infringement is null and void inasmuch as the court was without the authority to enter it.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\n<em>The order of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County (sitting as a Juvenile Court) is reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AY6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b459-13\">. The evidence concerning Linda\u2019s parents\u2019 ability to pay was entirely implied. There was no direct evidence of their financial inability to pay for Linda\u2019s care at Taylor Manor. Notwithstanding Courts Art. \u00a7 3-801 (e) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>\u00a7 3-819 (d), the trial court and the parties seem to have taken for granted that Linda fell within the definition of a child in need of assistance, and that the petitioner established that fact by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">On oral argument, the State acknowledged its oversight at the trial level. The failure of the record to disclose that Linda G. is a CINA raises a serious question of whether the appeal is properly before us. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that all parties and the trial court apparently \u201cassumed\u201d that Linda G. fell within the ambit of a CINA and further seemingly \u201cassumed\u201d her parents were \"unable\u201d to provide the necessary medical care because their insurance \"ran-out,\u201d we shall also make, for the purpose of this appeal, that assumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Courts Art. \u00a7 3-801 (e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-9\">\u201c(e) <em>'Child in need of assistance\u2019 </em>is a child who requires the assistance of the court because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-10\">(1) He is mentally handicapped or is not receiving ordinary and proper care and attention, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-11\">(2) His parents, guardian, or custodian are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and his problems provided, however, a child shall not be deemed to be in need of assistance for the sole reason he is being furnished nonmedical remedial care and treatment recognized by State law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">Section 3-819 (d) states: \"In all other cases [including a CINA adjudication] the allegations must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-13\">There was, however, testimony that the parents, before Linda\u2019s commitment to Taylor Manor, attempted to have her placed in Crownsville State Hospital and various private facilities, but that effort was rebuffed because no space was available. Spring Grove State Hospital did accept Linda on the basis of the statements of two physicians. <em>See </em>Md. Ann. Code art. 59, \u00a7 12 (b).

Not raised by the parties nor decided by us is the sublingual question of whether a judge of the juvenile court, or any court for that matter, has the power to commit a person to a private hospital, <em>but see </em>Courts art. \u00a7 3-820 (b) (2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b464-9\">. Section 3-804 (a) provides that \"[t]he court [the circuit court of a county, the district court of Montgomery County or Baltimore City sitting as a juvenile court] has exclusive original jurisdiction over a child alleged to be delinquent, in need of supervision, or in need of assistance.\u201d The petitioning process is set forth in section 8-310. The section states: \"Any person or agency having knowledge of facts which may cause a person to be subject to the jurisdiction of the court may file a complaint....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">Section 3-812 (a) instructs that the petition is to allege that \"a child is either delinquent, or in need of assistance, or in need of supervision.... If it alleges that the child is in need of assistance ..., the petition shall set forth in clear and simple language the alleged facts supporting that allegation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b465-8\">. Recently, the United States District Court of Maryland, in Johnson v. Solomon, 484 F. Supp. 278, 288 (D.C. Md. 1979), held that the commitment standards (or lack thereof) in section 3-820 (b) (to paraphrase, the best interests of the child) were unconstitutionally vague and \"directfed] that standards be adopted which satisfy constitutional prerequisites.\u201d In apparent response to that judicial mandate, the Maryland Legislature, by Laws 1980, ch. 697, enacted the following amendments to section 3-820, effective July 1, 1980:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">\"(f) The court may not commit a child to the custody of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene for inpatient care and treatment in a State mental hospital unless the court finds on the record based upon clear and convincing evidence that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-10\">(1) The child has a mental disorder;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">(2) The child needs inpatient medical care or treatment for the protection of himself or others;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-12\">(3) The child is unable or unwilling to be voluntarily admitted to such facility; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-13\">(4) There is no less restrictive form of intervention available which is consistent with the child\u2019s condition and welfare.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">The effect of the above amendment on the case at bar is nil. Also effective on July 1, 1980, was amended Md. Rule 915 (c) which was approved by the Maryland Court of Appeals in response to <em>Johnson. </em>Rule 915 (c) echoes the above amendment to section 3-820.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b466-6\">.

The record reveals that the appellee effectively argued that the appellant should have available purchase of care funds to expend upon Linda\u2019s care at Taylor Manor and if not, Md. Ann. Code art. 43, \u00a7 IF (e) enabled the Secretary of DHMH to reassign available funds from one department to another department which required such funds. During the March 1980 hearing, however, George Warner, an official in DHMH, testified that DHMH did not have purchase of care funds \"in which they are able to support or continue a placement outside of one of their own facilities.\u201d That testimony was unrebutted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\">.

If each of the 24 juvenile courts were to place a CINA in a private hospital and then direct the Secretary of DHMH to pay from his funds the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>necessary fees, the effect on the DHMH budget would be catastrophic. In the instant case, the Taylor Manor charges are $3,100 per month, or $37,200 per year. If all 24 courts did the same thing, the charges paid by DHMH would escalate to $892,800 per year. Should each of the courts order more than one such commitment, the sum might well reach astronomical figures.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b470-11\">.
