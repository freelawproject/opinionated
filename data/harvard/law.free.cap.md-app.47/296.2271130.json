The appellant raises here the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">1. Did the trial court err in ruling that appellant\u2019s amnesia did not preclude him from receiving a fair trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-8\">2. Did the trial judge err in denying appellant\u2019s request for a corrective instruction following the court\u2019s misstatement that prosecution witnesses testified as to the manner in which appellant\u2019s car was being driven?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">3. Was the evidence sufficient to sustain the conviction of manslaughter by automobile?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">At approximately 2:36 a.m. on October 7, 1978, Officer Frank Rongione, Jr. of the Baltimore County Police Department arrived at the scene of an auto accident on Belair Road, a four-lane highway running in a north-south direction. He observed that the collision involved a silver American Motors Pacer hatchback and a white Pontiac LeMans. The Pacer had come to rest facing east in the right lane on the northbound side. The appellant, who was seriously injured, was pinned behind the wheel. The officer testified that he detected the odor of alcohol on the appellant\u2019s breath.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the right lane on the opposite side of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>the road, facing southwest, was the Pontiac. Trapped in the front seat of that car was a woman identified as Constance Linn. Each vehicle was heavily damaged in front. Officer Rongione also observed the decedent, John Albert Hughes, Sr., who had apparently been thrown from the appellant\u2019s car by the impact, lying on the road in the right northbound lane, south of the Pacer. The officer testified that he later determined from gouges in the pavement that the point of impact had been in the left northbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">Officer Rongione read into evidence a statement obtained from the appellant following his arrest 12 days after the accident. In that statement, the appellant stated that he was driving his silver Pacer at approximately 2:25 a.m. on October 7, 1978 on Belair Road. He admitted leaving Pecora\u2019s Bar &amp; Restaurant, after consuming three or four rum and cokes, and proceeding south on Belair Road, with John Hughes as a passenger. He also admitted that he had consumed one beer at about 10:30 p.m. that night. The appellant stated that he could not remember what occurred after he left Pecora\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">Calvin M. Cason, along with his wife, was driving north on Belair Road in the right lane at the time of the collision. Ahead of Cason in the left lane was the Pontiac driven by Constance Linn. Cason testified that he saw the silver Pacer, which was southbound, cross over the double center line into the northbound lanes and collide head-on with the northbound Pontiac. The Pacer than struck the curb on the northbound side of the road while the Pontiac came to rest in the southbound lanes.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Several witnesses testified concerning their encounters, immediately prior to, the collision, with a car which resembled that driven by appellant. Wayne Dircks testified that he was northbound in the right lane on Belair Road on October 7, 1978, at approximately 2:15 a.m., when he was forced to swerve to the right to avoid a southbound vehicle which crossed over the center line. When he looked in his rearview mirror after the vehicle had passed, Dircks saw smoke or steam. He then turned his car around and observed that a silver Pacer had collided with a white LeMans some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>300 or 400 feet south of the point where he had been forced to swerve. Scott Williams, a passenger in the car driven by Dircks, also testified concerning the vehicle which had forced Dircks to swerve, describing it as a small car, silver in color. Neither Williams nor Dircks was certain that the car which forced them to the side of the road was the appellant\u2019s Pacer. Judith Gloria testified that, while driving north on Belair Road that morning at approximately 2:10 a.m., she was forced off the road and into a guardrail by a southbound vehicle which came over the center line and into the right northbound lane. She described the vehicle as a light-colored hatchback, \"a little bigger than a Pinto.\u201d Patricia McKenny recalled that, while traveling south on Belair Road that morning some time after 2:00 a.m., she was passed by a light-colored hatchback which crossed over into the northbound lanes. She testified that the vehicle was exceeding the speed limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">I Amnesia</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Prior to trial, a hearing was held to determine whether the appellant was competent to stand trial. He claimed that he suffered amnesia as a result of the head injuries which he sustained in the collision. At the hearing, he produced a psychiatrist, Dr. Chester Schmitt, Jr., who testified that the appellant \"had findings that were consistent with post-traumatic amnesia, that is, amnesia that follows head injury.\u201d Dr. Schmitt stated that the appellant had reported that he had no memory of events occurring between the time he left Pecora\u2019s Restaurant and the time he regained consciousness in the hospital later that morning. According to Dr. Schmitt, the appellant claimed that the police had been the source of the information contained in the statement he made 12 days after the collision. The doctor testified that the appellant understood the nature of the proceedings against him; he further agreed that the appellant would be able to consult with his attorney in the same manner as would any other defendant, except that he would be unable to answer questions concerning events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>which occurred during the period of memory loss. The trial court held that the appellant was competent to stand trial despite the amnesia. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">An accused is incompetent to stand trial if he \"is unable to understand the nature of the object of the proceeding against him or to assist in his defense.\u201d Md. Ann. Code art. 59, \u00a7 23 (1979 Repl. Vol., 1980 Cum. Supp.). The Court of Appeals has held that this requires \"that not only must the accused have 'a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him\u2019 but also he must at the trial have 'sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u2019\u201d <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 298, 372 A.2d 1069 (1977).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the instant case, the appellant\u2019s ability to understand the proceedings is undisputed; the issue is whether his amnesia rendered him incapable of assisting in his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">This issue is one of first impression in Maryland, <em>cf., James v. State, </em>31 Md. App. 666, 688 n.9, 358 A.2d 595, <em>cert. denied, </em>278 Md. 725 (1976); <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it has however been addressed by the courts in numerous other jurisdictions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Swanson, </em>572 F.2d 523 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>439 U.S. 849 (1978); <em>United States ex rel. Parson v. Anderson, </em>481 F.2d 94 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U.S. 1072 (1973); <em>United States v. Borum, </em>464 F.2d 896 (10th Cir. 1972); <em>United States v. Stevens, </em>461 F.2d 317 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 948 (1972); <em>United States v. Sullivan, </em>406 F.2d 180 (2d Cir. 1969); <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>129 U.S. App. D.C. 107, 391 F.2d 460 (1968); <em>Fajeriak v. State, </em>520 P.2d 795 (Alas. 1974); <em>State v. McClendon, </em>437 P.2d 421 (Ariz. 1968); <em>Reagon v. State, </em>251 N.E.2d 829 (Ind. 1969); <em>State v. Pugh, </em>283 A.2d 537 (N.J. Super. 1971); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Price, </em>218 A.2d 758 (Pa.), <em>cert. denied, </em>385 U.S. 869 (1966); <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>State, </em>548 S.W.2d 685 (Tx. Crim. App. 1977). <em>See, generally, </em>Annot., 46 A.L.R.3d 544 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Although \"there are no definitive judicial explanations\u201d of what constitutes the ability to assist in one\u2019s own defense, 27 Md. L. Rev. 182,186 (1967), it is clear that the cases without exception reject the notion that an accused possesses that ability only if he is able to remember the circumstances of the crime with which be is charged. <em>See, Jackson v. State, supra </em>at 691: (\"We find no case yet reported which has held that the inability to recall the event charged because of amnesia constitutes mental incapacity to stand trial.\u201d) Amnesia does not prevent an accused from exercising \"his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments: his right to challenge jurors, to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, to confront the witnesses against him, to summon witnesses in his favor and to have the assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Parson v. Anderson, </em>354 F. Supp. 1060, 1071 (D. Del. 1972), <em>aff'd, </em>481 F.2d 94 (1973). \"[Ajmnesia [does] not cause the accused to lie to his counsel, intentionally to hold out facts or hinder his defense; nor [does] it prevent him from understanding the nature of the oath, from truthfully answering all questions put to him on the stand, from answering questions rationally, or from comprehending the elements of the offenses with which he [is] charged and the facts set forth in the charges and specifications.\u201d <em>Amnesia: A Case Study in the Limits of Particular Justice, </em>71 Yale L.J. 109, 121 (1961). Amnesia does not prevent an accused from rationally discussing his defense with counsel, nor from making rational decisions with respect to his defense. Indeed, the amnesic defendant is \"denied only the ability to testify personally to certain facts, and this is a disability shared in greater or lesser degree by all defendants as a result of the normal attrition of memory or the lack of opportunity to observe important facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The practical effects of expanding the definition of incompetency to include amnesia must be considered. Several courts have indicated that they were unwilling to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>hold that limited amnesia was an adequate ground for a determination of incompetency because the effect of such a holding would be to free, without trial, persons against whom prima facie criminal cases had been established. <em>See, State v. Johnson, </em>536 P.2d 1035, 1036 (Ariz. 1975); <em>Commonwealth v. Price, </em>218 A.2d at 763. It has been noted that, if amnesia were held to render an accused incompetent then, if the amnesia were permanent, the accused would never be competent and could never be tried: at the same time, because limited amnesia cannot be considered a mental defect or disease, an amnesic accused could not be hospitalized or institutionalized. <em>See, Commonwealth v. Price, </em>218 A.2d at 763. Thus permanent amnesia as to the circumstances of the crime charged would be a permanent bar to the imposition of criminal responsibility. This is especially significant in light of \"the extreme difficulty \u2014 often impossibility \u2014 of distinguishing real from feigned amnesia.\u201d 71 Yale L.J. at 123. It has been noted that \"an attempt to verify all but the most patently phoney claims of amnesia is at best a difficult and time-consuming task; at worst it is a hopeless one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was these facts which led the Alaska Supreme Court to state that \"policy conjoins with precedent to oppose an expansion of the doctrine of incompetency to include amnesia. The potential for fraudulent allegations of memory loss is so great that we would for this reason alone be reluctant to follow amnesia as a ground for a finding of incompetency even if we were otherwise inclined to do so.\u201d <em>Fajeriak v. State, </em>520 P.2d at 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Turning to the instant case, at the time of his trial, the appellant was admittedly , normal except for his amnesia. The expert witness agreed that the appellant was able to communicate in a normal manner with his attorney, except that he was unable to state from personal knowledge how the collision occurred. We find that the appellant\u2019s claimed disability did not render him unable to assist in his defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>and he was not, therefore, incompetent to stand trial. We agree with the holding in <em>State v. Pugh, </em>283 A.2d at 542: \"Amnesia concerning the crime does not render a defendant unable ... to consult intelligently with counsel in the preparation of his defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The appellant also contends that his amnesia precluded him from receiving a fair trial. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">As \"the fundamental fairness of trying an amnesiac defendant may vary depending on the crime and the circumstances surrounding the claimed loss of memory, .. . the propriety of trying an amnesiac defendant is a question to be determined according to the circumstances of each individual case.\u201d (Footnote omitted). <em>United States v. Swanson, </em>571 F.2d at 526. While it is of course not determinative of the question in the case at bar, we believe it is significant that in no case yet reported has it been held that an accused\u2019s amnesia precluded a fair trial, i.e., constituted a denial of due process of law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Swanson, supra; United States v. Sullivan, supra; Jackson v. State, supra. Cf., Wilson v. United States, supra </em>(case remanded for more extensive post-trial findings concerning effect of accused\u2019s amnesia on fairness of trial); <em>State v. McClendon, </em>419 P.2d 69 (Ariz. 1966) (case remanded for determination of whether reasonable continuance and treatment would permit accused to recover memory).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">There have been a number of cases involving facts and contentions very similar to those in the instant case. We find persuasive the decision in <em>Reagon v. State, supra, </em>where the defendant was convicted of reckless homicide, manslaughter, and driving while intoxicated following a head-on collision caused by his attempt to pass another car while his vision was obstructed. Like the appellant, the defendant there suffered head injuries in the collision and claimed that he was unable to remember the facts relative to the accident. The court rejected his contention that he should not be tried, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-8\">\"Many times in a trial of a criminal case evidence is lost, a material witness dies, or, as in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the defendant has amnesia as to certain events or a time. Still, such handicaps from a defendant\u2019s point of view cannot prevent a trial from taking place eventually. Rarely would we find a case in which a defendant could not contend that he was deprived of some evidence and therefore he ought not to be tried. However, evidence which is never to be obtained because of the death of witnesses cannot prevent a criminal trial from taking place, and that must be said from the state\u2019s point of view as well as that of the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 831.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We note also the comment made by Judge Leventhal in his concurring opinion in <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>391 F.2d at 465: \"It is probably commonplace for a man to be convicted of negligent homicide although in fact his memory of the event is vitiated by drink, shock, or both, and I see nothing unconscionable in this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">In the instant case, we find nothing to indicate that the appellant\u2019s amnesia precluded a fair trial. As noted above, defendants are often tried under circumstances where less than all of the relevant facts are available. Witnesses die, witnesses forget, documents are destroyed or lost; nevertheless the courts must administer justice based on that evidence which is available. The evidence in this case is overwhelming. This is not an instance where the facts suggest the possibility of an alibi or other defense which has been locked away by the appellant\u2019s loss of memory. The appellant was provided with a list of witnesses to the collision; he had the same opportunity as did the State to interview, examine and cross-examine these witnesses. We find that, under these circumstances, the appellant\u2019s amnesia did not preclude him from receiving a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">II Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">During the course of his instructions to the jury, the trial judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-9\">\"You may also consider the manner of driving, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>wit; you have heard descriptions of how the Pacer was being operated, and you may consider its course southerly on the Belair Road. You may consider the testimony of such witnesses as Judith Gloria and Wayne Dircks, who were in cars that encountered the Pacer prior to the accident between the Pacer and the 1970 LeMans, driven by Constance Linn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">After the instructions were completed, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">\"[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, may I take exceptions to them, please, to two of the instructions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">The Court: I will let you read them into the record afterwards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">[Defense counsel]: That will be fine, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">The Court: All right. You can protect your record in that event, but I am sure everything I said was Horn Book.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-10\">[Defense counsel]: All right. Thank you, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-11\">The Court: Hold on a minute. Wait a minute. I want to be sure I didn\u2019t miss anything that was \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-12\">[Defense counsel]: Your Honor, the one I had in mind was the presumption instruction. I didn\u2019t hear that. Then I had one other, which I will be glad to save until after argument.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">The \"presumption instruction\u201d to which the defense counsel referred was an instruction that the appellant was to be presumed innocent, which the court below had in fact given. The exception which defense counsel chose to \"save\u201d until after the jury retired was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-14\">\"[Defense counsel]: I would take exception to the Court\u2019s instruction relating to Judith Mae Gloria and Constance Linn and any others to the effect that they testified as to how Mr. Morrow\u2019s car was being driven prior to the accident, and they did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>testify that the automobile was Mr. Morrow\u2019s and were barely able to identify the automobile, at all, and, therefore, I request an instruction to the effect that they were unable to identify Mr. Morrow\u2019s automobile as the automobile which was involved in the accident, and, therefore, the jury cannot conclude from their testimony that the same automobile they saw was Mr. Morrow\u2019s automobile.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Our review of the transcript indicates that the appellant\u2019s counsel was correct in his exception: the trial judge was mistaken when he stated that Judith Gloria and Wayne Dircks had testified that they had encountered the Pacer involved in the accident. Neither Gloria nor Dircks was certain whether the vehicle which forced them off the road was the same vehicle which was involved in the fatal collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">However, Md. Rule 757 f provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-7\">\"If a party has an objection to any instructions, to any omission therefrom, or to the failure to give an instruction <em>he shall make the objection </em>on the record <em>before the jury retires </em>to consider its verdict and shall state distinctly the matter or omission, or failure to instruct to which he objects and the grounds of his objection. Upon request of any party, the court shall receive objections out of the hearing of the jury.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">As this Court stated in <em>Vernon v. State, </em>12 Md. App. 157, 163, 277 A.2d 635 (1971), \"It is clear that the purpose and design of the rule is to correct errors while the opportunity to correct them still exists. Only thus is an error preserved for appellate review.\u201d In the instant case, the effect of defense counsel \"sav[ing]\u201d his exception was to deny the trial court the opportunity to correct the erroneous instruction, and thus the point has not been preserved for our review. <em>See also, Bruce </em>v. <em>State, </em>218 Md. 87, 145 A.2d 428 (1958); <em>Sine v. State, </em>40 Md. App. 628, 394 A.2d 1206 (1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>284 Md. 748 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Ill Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Appellant argues that the evidence summarized above was insufficient to support his conviction. We think the argument is so devoid of merit that we decline to discuss it.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AiFg\">\n<em>Appellant to pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-12\">. A blood test administered following the collision revealed that appellant had a blood alcohol level of .16 per cent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">.

The language contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4244 and in art. 59, \u00a7 23 is \"virtually identical.\u201d Raithel v. State, <em>supra </em>at 298.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b322-8\">. Although we stated in James that \"Amnesia <em>per se </em>does not bar prosecution,\u201d 31 Md.
