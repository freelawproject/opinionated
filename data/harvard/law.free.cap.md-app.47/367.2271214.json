State, </em>286 Md. 193, 406 A.2d 909 (1979), concerning the \"bad faith conduct\u201d of a prosecutor that causes a defendant to move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u2014 <em>THE LAW\u2014</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Writing for the Court in <em>Bell, </em>Judge Orth declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-8\">\"The teaching of the Supreme Court cases is clear. Retrial is not barred as violative of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment when a mistrial is declared at the behest or with the consent of the defendant unless such error or misconduct, sufficient to justify the declaration of a mistrial, was committed by either the prosecutor or the court with the intention of (1) forcing the defendant to move for or consent to a mistrial, or (2) prejudicing his prospects for an acquittal if the trial continued to a verdict. It is 'bad-faith conduct by judge or prosecutor\u2019 with such intent that prohibits retrials.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">The keystone of the test formulated and consistently followed by the Supreme Court is the requirement of 'intent.\u2019 And intent is implicit in 'bad-faith.\u2019 Thus, the test does not encompass negligence. <em>See Illinois vs. Sommerville, </em>410 U.S. 458, 93 S. Ct. 1066, [35 L.Ed.2d 4251 (1973). 'Intentional\u2019 and 'negligent\u2019 are mutually exclusive. It is true that the greater degree of negligence, the closer the error comes to being intentional. That is, an error by judge or prosecutor which appears to be 'gross negligence\u2019 may, of course, provide some evidence of intent. But if what seems to be negligent is so gross as to warrant a determination that the act was in fact intentional, it is not then negligent.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 204-05, 406 A.2d at 915.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The appellant in the instant case, Gillis Lee, concedes that \"the State . .. did not want or seek a mistrial.\u201d Hence, we need not and do not concern ourselves with <em>Bell\u2019s </em>other tine. Instead, we shall focus our attention strictly upon whether the State so acted, in the matter before us, as to prejudice appellant\u2019s \"prospects for an acquittal if the trial continued to verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><em>Bell </em>was never intended to address all situations in which evidence concerning the accused\u2019s criminality is offered. Indeed, the purpose of the State\u2019s proceeding to trial in the first place is to offer evidence demonstrating beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did what he did at the time and place alleged by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">We make explicit that <em>Bell </em>condemns those instances where the prosecutor intentionally forces a defendant into moving for a mistrial or prejudices the defendant\u2019s prospects for a fair verdict that is based upon the legally admissible evidence. Judge Moylan, in a concurring opinion in <em>Jones v. State, </em>44 Md. App. 417, 433, 409 A.2d 725, 733 (1979), <em>aff'd, </em>288 Md. 618 (1980), pointed out that when the SupremeCourt of the United States and the Court of Appeals of Maryland speak of intentionally forcing the defendant to move for a mistrial, the word \"intentional\u201d has a more narrow meaning than a \"mere <em>general intent.\u201d Jones </em>was recently affirmed by the Court of Appeals. <em>See Jones v. State, </em>288 Md. 618, 420 A.2d 1241 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The general intent to do something, which may at a later time be declared \"to be a foul, is almost always present.\u201d The use of prejudicial questions on direct or cross-examination \"or the introduction of tainted evidence represent! s] conscious and intended actions.\u201d What is meant by the <em>Bell </em>Court\u2019s use of \"intentional\u201d is \"overreaching,\u201d an act that \"contemplates a <em>specific intent </em>above and beyond the mere general intent.\u201d It is the specific intent to commit a foul, the deliberate \"hitting below the belt\u201d or the calculated \"personal foul\u201d performed with the thought in mind that the foul might well be detected for what it is. By borrowing from the game of football for an analogy, we liken that specific intent to force a mistrial to a defensive back\u2019s wilful and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>deliberate interference with the offensive team\u2019s down field pass receiver. The defense knows that by performing the illegal act that constitutes the foul, he will probably be caught and his team penalized. Nevertheless, the offender prefers to take the penalty rather than give up the touchdown that most likely would occur were the foul not committed. In football, commission of such a foul may be expedient, but in the trial of a case, it is a reprehensible specific intention that triggers the Double Jeopardy Clause protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">\u2014 <em>THE INSTANT CASE \u2014</em></p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">During the trial of appellant in the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Bell, J.) on a charge of robbery with a dangerous and deadly weapon, as well as other allied charges, a critical point arose during the testimony of the prosecutrix-victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The witness, Paulette Malloy, on direct examination by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, related that she based her identification of Gillis Lee, as the robber who held up the store in which she worked, on April 30, 1979, on what she saw that day. When asked if she had seen appellant since the April robbery, the witness said that she had seen the appellant in the store at another time, and at that time, the store was also robbed. The answer was not responsive. The \"other time, . .. the store was also robbed\u201d was prior to the April 1979 robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The appellant promptly moved for a mistrial, and the same was granted by Judge Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">Subsequently, the matter was called to trial before Judge James W. Murphy. Appellant, citing <em>Bell, </em>moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that any trial would be in derogation of appellant\u2019s constitutional protection against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Barbara Salkin, the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney at the aborted trial, testified before Judge Murphy that although she knew of Ms. Malloy\u2019s knowledge concerning the earlier robbery, she did not furnish that information to appellant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>counsel or to Judge Bell. Her reasons for not doing so were relatively simple. First, she had instructed Ms. Malloy on a number of occasions not to mention the first robbery. Second, the prosecutor knew the evidence, if used, would tend to prove guilt through another uncharged crime.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Ms. Salkin categorically denied that she purposely brought about a mistrial. Indeed, inasmuch as Ms. Malloy was the State\u2019s first witness, there was apparently nothing to be gained by the State as a result of a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Notwithstanding Ms. Salkin\u2019s disavowal of any underhanded or ulterior motive in dealing with the examination of Ms. Malloy, nor appellant\u2019s inability to point to any advantage the State might have reaped from the mistrial, appellant steadfastly argued that <em>Bell </em>dictates that the prosecution may not continue because the Double Jeopardy Clause acts as an insurmountable barrier to the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Appellant misconstrues <em>Bell. </em>As we noted at the outset, <em>Bell </em>is directed towards the purposeful causing, by the State, of a defendant\u2019s successful moving for a mistrial so as to afford the State the opportunity to try the defendant anew. \"Purposeful,\u201d as used in <em>Bell, </em>includes within its ambit such gross negligence that, when viewed impartially, amounts to intent. It is \"overreaching,\u201d irrespective of prosecutorial intent, to the point where the defendant is deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The prosecutor in the case now before us specifically cautioned the witness <em>not </em>to refer to the prior robbery. There is nothing within the record from which it can fairly be inferred that the prosecutor sought or wanted a mistrial, nor can it in all fairness be inferred that she endeavored to deprive the appellant of a fair trial. Having admonished the witness not to mention the earlier uncharged robbery, there was little the prosecutor could do to prevent either the \"blurt\u201d or the unresponsive answer given by the witness. About the only way of being absolutely certain that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>witness would not reveal the prior incident would be to keep the witness from the stand. That would be ideal for the defendant because the State would be without its principal witness. <em>Bell </em>does not require that drastic action on the part of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Moreover, even if the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney had notified the judge and the appellant\u2019s counsel of the prior robbery, that knowledge by them would not have prevented the witness from blurting appellant\u2019s alleged involvement in the prior robbery. Furthermore, no disclosure by the State to the defense was required inasmuch as the information can hardly be characterized as exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Judge Murphy did not err in refusing to dismiss the Criminal Information on the ground that the mistrial placed the defendant in double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\n<em>Order denying motion to dismiss afGrmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\">. Whether the evidence was properly admitted is <em>not an </em>issue in this case. We do not decide it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
