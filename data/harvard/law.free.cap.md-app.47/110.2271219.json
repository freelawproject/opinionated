Summary judgment was granted, after a hearing, upon the lower court\u2019s determination that appellant\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>had been satisfied under the principle in <em>Scheffenacker v. Hoopes, </em>113 Md. 111 (1910). On appeal, appellant argues that this venerable precedent has been misapplied, and that summary judgment was granted improperly. Alternatively, appellant argues that the court below failed to take proper account of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, Article 50, \u00a7\u00a7 16-24, Md. Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Elizabeth C. Loh, appellant, on March 31,1977, purchased a five ounce package of \"12 Beef Franks N\u2019 Blankets\u201d from a Safeway store on Ritchie Highway in Arnold, Maryland. The franks were produced by Garden State Kosher Provisions (hereinafter called Garden State) and sold to Safeway through Durkee Foods. Appellant went home and heated, for eating, her purchase. Instead of a choice morsel of delight, she \"felt a sharp pain in one of her teeth\u201d resulting from a \"bone or similar foreign substance\u201d contained in one of the \"Franks N\u2019 Blankets.\u201d Her tooth was broken. She retained counsel to seek compensation for her injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Counsel for appellant was in contact with the insurance carrier for Garden State. On November 21,1977, the insurer sent to appellant\u2019s counsel a check in the amount of $1,000 which the accompanying letter said was \"intended to be in full payment of Mrs. Loh\u2019s claim.\u201d The letter acknowledged that there was no mutually agreed upon settlement figure, but the insurer stated \"we want your client to have what we believe would be the full value of her claim.\u201d The insurer did not admit liability, but, rather, sought an \"amicable conclusion\u201d to Mrs. Loh\u2019s claim. The insurer\u2019s letter concluded with the comment that the check \"represents the maximum value to us for settlement of this claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Appellant\u2019s counsel deposited the $1,000 check and distributed its proceeds to appellant. On December 2, 1977, appellant\u2019s counsel wrote to the insurer\u2019s agent acknowledging receipt and deposit of the check. However, the letter stated that \"we must advise you that we do not consider the $1,000 payment to be in full settlement of Mrs. Loh\u2019s claim.\u201d Further, the letter recited the previous settlement negotiations. Appellant\u2019s counsel concluded the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>letter by reiterating that the deposit of the $1,000 \"does not constitute settlement or satisfaction of Mrs. Loh\u2019s claim, nor does it bar us from commencing suit in this matter.\u201d Gratuitously, appellant\u2019s counsel acknowledged that the $1,000 would be applied to whatever final judgment would be rendered in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Two weeks later, on December 13, 1977, appellant filed suit in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The declaration bore the denomination \"implied warranty\u201d and was brought solely against Safeway. Appellant alleged breach of warranty and recited, particularly, Sections 2-314 and 2-315, Commercial Article, Md. Code. The ad damnum clause was for $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Safeway filed a general issue plea and, subsequently, a third party claim against Garden State. The third party claim was stated in two counts. In the first count, Safeway, as third party plaintiff, demanded \"that it be indemnified from any liability or damages which may be assessed in favor of [Mrs. Loh] as against [Safeway] .. . [because] the product manufactured by [Garden State] was impliedly fit for consumption and free from any foreign matter or defect.\u201d The second count alleged that \"as a result of the negligence\u201d of Garden State \"in the manufacture of said food product,\u201d the plaintiff was injured without any contributory negligence of Safeway.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">On April 13,1978, Garden State filed a plea which, among other things,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> alleged that \"before the issuing of the summons, [it had] tendered to the plaintiff a sum of money in satisfaction of the plaintiffs demand.\u201d This reference, of course, was to the $1,000 check forwarded on November 21, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">On January 13, 1979, in response to a request from Safeway, Garden State admitted that \"it supplied the frankfurters which were sold to Safeway stores by Durkee\u201d and that \"it supplied the meat portion for the Durkee Beef N\u2019 Blankets.\u201d Garden State did not admit, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>\"there was any alleged foreign substance in the meat\u201d supplied.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">After trial was twice continued, a motion for summary judgment was filed by Garden State on July 2, 1979, and, thereafter, on August 3, 1979, by Safeway. Garden State\u2019s motion argued that the acceptance of the $1,000 check sent on November 21, 1977, \"constitutes a full accord and satisfaction to any debt which the Plaintiff would be entitled to receive from [Garden State].\u201d Safeway\u2019s Motion also sought to take advantage of the appellant\u2019s acceptance of the November 21, 1977 check. Safeway argued that it \"constituted a full accord and satisfaction of any claim which [appellant] claims as a result of the .breach of warranty.\u201d Further, Safeway contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\"[Appellant] having accepted the check in full accord and satisfaction of the dispute of her claim arising out of the allegedly unfit food product which was initially manufactured by [Garden State] necessarily results in a release of all alleged debtors or tort feasors in that it is a fundamental proposition of law that [appellant] is entitled to but one satisfaction of her claim and cannot after collecting money in settlement of a claim against one person allegedly responsible then, with impunity, proceed by Court action against another without even divulging the fact that [appellant] had received and put to her own use money received from the joint tort feasor or joint debtor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">After a hearing,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the learned judge below granted both motions. On the&lt;record, the court below stated that appellant had not rejected the November 21,1977 check, but deposited it and that act \"constituted the acceptance, irrespective of what [appellant] may have said.\u201d The court below believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>appellant\u2019s claim had been extinguished and that it was immaterial whether \"the defendants [i.e., Safeway and Garden State] have a right of contribution or indemnity between them.\u201d The lower court relied wholly upon <em>Scheffenacker </em>v. <em>Hoopes, </em>113 Md. 111 (1910) and its reasoning from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">In <em>Scheffenacker, </em>a printer sent a bill for $722.40 for printing certain catalogues. The consumer sent back a check for $361.20 with a letter stating that \"you know my dissatisfaction with your work\u201d and that the poor printing job had caused \"great damage and injury.\u201d The consumer, further, stated, among other things, that, rather than \"require [the printer] to make my loss good,\u201d he did \"not wish a controversy\u201d and, consequently tendered half payment \"in full settlement.\u201d The printer acknowledged the letter and check, made excuses for the job, and recited that \"I am positive that you do not intend to beat me out of the balance of my bill.\u201d The printer got the check certified. At trial and on appeal, it was held that the printer used the check and was barred, through accord and satisfaction, from recovering the remainder of the bill. The Court of Appeals, per Judge Urner, wrote, 113 Md. at 117:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">\"The plaintiffs expression of dissatisfaction with the defendant\u2019s proposal could not qualify the effect of his actual use of the check and appropriation of the defendant\u2019s money through its certification, in view of the terms of compromise under which alone it could be used. It was the <em>use </em>of the check that determined the question of the acceptance of the offer and not the verbal dissent by which it was accompanied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Chief Judge Bond, in <em>Hodgson </em>v. <em>Phippin, </em>159 Md. 97, 99-100 (1930) explained the holding in <em>Scheffenacker, </em>thusly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">\"The ordinary understanding of a tender of a portion of an amount claimed in full satisfaction of the whole seems to be that it constitutes a conditional offer, that acceptance of the money involves accep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>tance of the condition, and results in an accord and satisfaction of the whole claim, discharging the unpaid portion. <em>Hunt, Tender, </em>sec. 240. And this court has held that acceptance of such a tender has that result even though the claimant protests that he does not accept the terms attached, but takes the money only in part payment. <em>Scheffenaker v. Hoopes, </em>113 Md. 111, 117.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Compare 6 Corbin, Contracts, 1962, \u00a7 1279, p. 127. See also, <em>Stockton v. Frey, </em>4 Gill 406, 424 (1846); <em>Mercantile T. &amp; D. Co. v. Rode, </em>137 Md. 362, 377 (1921); <em>Eno Cotton Mills v. Mudge, </em>139 Md. 302 (1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In light of the authorities cited, we believe it is clear that, in Maryland, when one party tenders a check in settlement of a dispute, making clear that the tender will satisfy the claim against the tendering party if accepted, the party who accepts and uses the check, even though protesting against settlement, cannot make further claim against the tendering party. Here, Garden State\u2019s letter made clear that the $1,000 check tendered on November 21, 1977 was \"the maximum value to us for settlement of this claim.\u201d Appellant accepted the settlement by depositing the check, regardless of appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s protestations to the contrary. As between appellant and Garden State, there was an accord and satisfaction. In addition, strict application of the rule that there may be only one satisfaction for a single injury, see <em>Cox v. Maryland Elec. Rwys. Co., </em>126 Md. 300 (1915); <em>Berkley v. Wilson, 87 </em>Md. 219 (1898), would bar further recovery from any party for the injury to appellant\u2019s tooth here.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Appellant, however, seeks to avoid judgments in favor of Garden State and Safeway by reliance upon the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, Article 50, Sections 16-24, Md. Code. Prior to enactment of this legislation, a release of one joint tort-feasor, or satisfaction therefrom,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>extinguished a person\u2019s right to proceed against all others. As the Court of Appeals wrote in <em>Gunther v. Lee, </em>45 Md. 60, 67 (1876):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">\"All the cases, both English and American, maintain the doctrine that satisfaction from one joint tort-feasor, whether received before or after recovery, extinguishes the right as against the others. The plaintiff is not entitled to receive more than one satisfaction for and in respect of the same injury. As was said by the Court in <em>Lovejoy vs. Murray, </em>when the plaintiff has accepted satisfaction in full for the injury done him, from whatever source it may come, he is so far affected in equity and good conscience, that the law will not permit him to recover again for the same damages. * * * Here the release expresses the consideration on its face, which was received in full satisfaction of the wrong complained of. The proviso in the release, by which the right to recover for the same injury against the other two defendants was attempted to be reserved to the plaintiffs, is simply void, as being repugnant to the legal effect and operation of the release itself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">This rule was severely criticized by academic writers. See e.g., Prosser, Joint Torts and Several Liability, 25 Cal. L. Rev. 413, 421-5 (1937);* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Wigmore, Release to One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Joint-Tortfeasor, 17 111. L.R. 563 (1923).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> And, exceptions to the general rule were, at times, engrafted into the law. See, e.g., <em>Murphy v. Penniman, </em>105 Md. 453, 473 (1907); <em>McShane v. Howard Bank, </em>73 Md. 135, 153-4 (1890). The legislature first created a limited substantive right of contribution among joint tortfeasors in 1927,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, in 1941, enacted the Uniform Act. The Act applies only to joint tort-feasors.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> It established a right to contribution,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> expunged the common law rule of release,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and preserved rights of indemnification.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Appellant seeks to apply the Uniform Act to overturn the judgments in favor of Garden State and Safeway. Her refuge in the Act poses substantial issues of both a definitional and conceptual nature. To get benefit of the Act, appellant must fit the parties here into the definitions of \"joint tortfeasor\u201d and \"injured person\u201d found in the Act. Even if that hurdle is overcome, appellant must bring the accord and satisfaction which occurred by the use of Garden State\u2019s check within the concept of \"release\u201d under the Act in modification of the common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Under the Act, joint tortfeasors are defined as \"two or more persons jointly or severally <em>liable in tort </em>for the same injury to person ...\u201d [emphasis added], Art. 50, \u00a7 16 (a), Md. Code. Further, the Act defines an \"injured person\u201d as \"any person having a <em>claim in tort. \u201d </em>[Emphasis added], Art. 50, \u00a7 16 (b), Md. Code. The common law rule of release<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is abrogated, by Art. 50, \u00a7 19, Md. Code, when a \"release by the injured person [is] of one joint tort-feasor.\u201d The statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>provision from which appellant seeks succor, when read with the definitions applicable to the Act, appears limited, on its face, to \"tort\u201d actions. In the case on appeal, appellant\u2019s declaration was premised upon implied warranty <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and we must consider whether such a suit is a \"tort\u201d action susceptible of coverage by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Suit on implied warranty has been called \"a freak hybrid born of the illicit intercourse of tort and contract.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The parties have cited no Maryland case and our own research has disclosed none which has considered whether suit on an implied warranty is a tort action within the purview of the Act. In <em>Trieschman </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>224 Md. 111 (1961), the Court of Appeals made footnote reference to the issue b\u00fct did not find it necessary to decide the question.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Our research has disclosed, however, the opinion of Judge Miller in <em>Uppgren </em>v. <em>Executive Aviation Services, Inc., </em>326 F. Supp. 709 (D. Md. 1971), where the United States District Court for the District of Maryland considered whether, for choice of law purposes, a suit based on breach of implied warranty would be considered a tort or contract action by the Maryland courts. There, the parties urged the court to apply \"contract-conflict rules\u201d which Judge Miller found to be error, after extensive consideration of \"the nature and historical background of an action for personal ... injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>based upon breach of warranty.\u201d 326 F. Supp. at 714. Judge Miller thoroughly reviewed the writings of the leading authorities, primarily Dean Prosser, and found that \"the Maryland Court of Appeals has quoted the views of Prosser with approval relative to the origin of the action for breach of implied warranty and its close kinship to tort.\u201d 326 F. Supp. at 715.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, Judge Miller concluded, 326 F. Supp. at 716:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-5\">\"Earlier Maryland cases discussing the requirement of privity in an implied or express warranty action indicate that privity is necessary, not because the cause of action is bottomed in contract, but because a direct contractual relationship was deemed to be required to create the warranty and the concomitant duty, the breach of which constituted a tort. <em>State to Use of Bond v. Consolidated Gas, Electric Light and Power Company, </em>146 Md. 390, 396, 126 A. 105 (1924). * * * It is believed by this court that the highest court of Maryland, if faced with the necessity to decide the question, would determine that an action based upon an implied warranty (arising from a contract or sale made prior, of course, to the July 1, 1969 effective date of the amendment to Article 95B, \u00a7 2-318, Anno. Code of Md.) bears such a close relationship to one based upon tort that it should be subject to the rule of <em>lex loci delicti </em>for the same reasons as is a tort action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Subsequent Maryland decisions <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> holding that the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>the place of the sale governs the extent and effect of the warranties which attend the sale do not undercut the analysis made by Judge Miller. The essential fact remains that \"warranty is a matter of toit as well as contract.\u201d Prosser, The Assault Upon the Citadel (Strict Liability to the Consumer), 69 Yale L.J. 1099, 1127 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Although the Maryland cases continue to discuss products liability in terms of \"causes of action sounding in tort... land] claims based upon breach of warranty\u201d, <em>Frericks v. General Motors Corp., </em>274 Md. 288, 300 (1975), it is clear that, \"regardless of theory, a plaintiff must satisfy three product litigation basics from an evidentiary standpoint: (1) the existence of a defect, (2) the attribution of the defect to a 'seller\u2019, and (3) a causal relation between the defect and injury.\u201d Digges, Product Liability in Maryland Revisited, 7 U. of Blt. L.R. 1, 14 (1977). It must be recognized, therefore, that the warranty action, albeit a \"freak hybrid,\u201d differs little in fact in products cases from \"causes of action sounding in tort.\u201d <footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">For the purposes of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act, we conclude that appellant\u2019s suit for breach of implied warranty can be a 'claim in tort\u2019 which allows appellant to claim the role of an injured person under the Act. A determination that appellant had a 'claim in tort\u2019 under the Act does not end our inquiry. Safeway and Garden State must fall into the classification only of joint tortfeasors and they may be so classified if they are <em>'liable </em>in tort\u201d [emphasis added] to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Summary judgment below, predicated upon <em>Scheffenacker </em>v. <em>Hoopes, </em>113 Md. 111 (1910), precluded any judicial determination of liability of Safeway and Garden State in this case. In addition, it must be recognized that the correspondence accompanying the November 21,1977 check contained a denial of Garden State\u2019s liability and, although it admitted to supplying the meat portion of the \"frank\u201d alleged to have broken appellant\u2019s tooth, Garden State did \"not admit there was any alleged foreign substance in the meat portion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In this context, we review <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613 (1957), a case relied upon heavily by appellant. <em>Swigert </em>came to the Court of Appeals after the grant of summary judgment in favor of a third party defendant, Welk, who had been impleaded in a case involving a two-car collision in Baltimore City. There, the plaintiff, not a party to the appeal, had executed a release to Welk in consideration of a $3,500 payment. The release, however, denied that Welk was a tortfeasor. When impleaded by Swigert, Welk claimed that the release was a complete bar to the cause of action and the trial court, accepting the argument, granted summary judgment. In reversing, the Court of Appeals decided two points relevant to this case on appeal. First, the Court of Appeals addressed the effect the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act had on the common law and, second, the Court directed its attention to the definitions of \"joint tortfeasors\u201d and \"injured person.\u201d The Court wrote, 213 Md. at 619:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-6\">\"At common law, a release by the injured party of one of several joint tortfeasors released all. The Uniform Act, of course, changed this. But this Court has held both before and since the passage of the Uniform Act that if several persons be involved in an accident and one of those persons, who has been guilty of no negligence, obtains for himself alone a release from the injured party, it does not affect the liability of the others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>The act does not specify the test of liability. Clearly, something short of an actual judgment will suffice; we think it equally clear that a denial of liability will not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Welk had denied liability in the release obtained from plaintiff.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because Swigert claimed that Welk\u2019s negligence contributed to plaintiffs injuries, the Court held that Swigert was entitled to have Welk\u2019s motion for summary judgment denied regardless of Welk\u2019s freedom from further recovery against him. Only with the third party claim in the case, could Swigert have Welk\u2019s liability determined so that Swigert could reduce his liability under the contribution aspects of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The reasoning and holding in <em>Swigert </em>seem peculiarly relevant to the appeal from summary judgment in favor of Garden State in this case. Further, the <em>Swigert </em>opinion\u2019s reasoning on the effect of the Act on the common law would appear to point to reversal of the summary judgment in favor of Safeway. <em>Swigert, </em>therefore, gives the appearance of the terminal point of this opinion. There are, however, two critical distinctions between what the Court of Appeals had before it in <em>Swigert </em>and what we face in this appeal. First, in <em>Swigert, </em>there was a release with a denial of liability; here, application of the venerable rule of <em>Scheffenacker v. Hoopes, </em>113 Md. 111 (1910), required a finding of an accord and satisfaction between appellant and Garden State. Second, in <em>Swigert </em>the third party claim sought contribution; here Safeway sought indemnification from Garden State. These distinctions between what we have here and what was before the Court of Appeals in <em>Swigert </em>cause our discussion to proceed further.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The distinction between the effect of a release denying liability and the effect of an accord and satisfaction was one theme of the arguments presented below by Safeway and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Garden State. On appeal, Safeway relied upon the accord and satisfaction and, citing <em>Lanasa v. Beggs, </em>159 Md. 311 (1930), argued that appellant \"surely is not entitled to attempt a second collection from the retailers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In <em>Lanasa, </em>plaintiff, after accepting a $1,032.40 settlement from Yellow Cab, brought proceedings, seeking $25,000 as damages, against a truck driver who had collided with the cab in which he was a passenger. The Court of Appeals reversed the overruling of a demurrer filed on behalf of the truck driver, writing, 159 Md. at 319:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\". . . if as a matter of fact the wronged party has actually received satisfaction, or what in law is regarded as its equivalent, from one tort-feasor, he is barred from proceedings against the other tort-feasors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\"><em>Lanasa, </em>however, was decided a decade before the enactment in 1941 of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act. Although it was cited in <em>Maryland Lumber Co. v. White, </em>205 Md. 180, 199-200 (1954), an order of satisfaction entered by one party involved in \"conversion by misdelivery\u201d was said there to have no more effect than reducing the \"claim against the other tortfeasor ... by the amount of the consideration paid for the order of satisfaction.\u201d In addition, in dictum, the Court of Appeals in <em>Trieschman v. Eaton, </em>224 Md. 111, 116-118 (1961) called <em>Lanasa </em>an \"earlier\u201d case standing for the common law rule of release of tortfeasors and said that \"the Maryland Legislature did away with the rule as to joint tortfeasors by the passage of the [Uniform] Act.\u201d <em>Lanasa, </em>however, was cited with approval in <em>Grantham v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>251 Md. 28, 39 (1968) and <em>Bell v. Allstate Insur. Co., </em>265 Md. 727, 730 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">In <em>Grantham, </em>plaintiff had sued two doctors and the Board of County Commissioners of Prince George\u2019s County for malpractice alleging negligence, breach of warranty and breach of contract. Judgments totalling $60,000 were obtained against one doctor and the Board, but a motion for new trial was granted. Thereafter, settlement negotiations were commenced between the plaintiffs attorney and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>attorney representing the doctor. A figure of $31,802.98 was agreed upon and the docket was noted, according to a \"line\u201d or order of dismissal filed by the doctor\u2019s attorney which read: \"As to [the doctor] only, please enter this matter as dismissed, with prejudice, and the judgment paid and satisfied.\u201d Thereafter, the Board filed a motion for summary judgment on the ground that the satisfaction of the judgment against the doctor resulted in a release of the Board. The motion was granted and a plaintiffs motion to vacate was denied. On appeal, the Court of Appeals, per Judge Singley, affirmed the orders. The Court wrote that \"Our law is well settled that the satisfaction of a judgment entered against one or more joint tortfeasors releases all of them.\u201d 251 Md. at 37. Judge Singley\u2019s opinion, however, went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\"It should be emphasized that we are here dealing with a <em>judgment which has been satisf\u00eded: </em>not, as was the case in <em>Treischman, supra, </em>with a partially satisfied or unsatisfied judgment [citation omitted]; nor with the effect of a release given under the [Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors] Act, [citation omitted] (Compare, however, <em>Maryland Lumber Co. v. White, </em>205 Md. 180 ..., which held that the entry of an <em>order of satisfaction prior to judgment </em>was the equivalent of a release under the [Uniform Contribution Among Joint Tortfeasors] Act . . .), but with the entry of a judgment which the parties agree has been <em>satisf\u00eded in full. </em>[Citations omitted.] 251 Md. at 38-9. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Finally, in <em>Grantham, </em>the Court concluded that \"the Act did not alter the well-established common law rule: further action is barred when a judgment against one tortfeasor is satisfied.\u201d 251 Md. at 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Judge Singley\u2019s care in distinguishing <em>Maryland Lumber Co. v. White, </em>supra, and his conclusion that the decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>made an order of satisfaction prior to judgment the equivalent of a release under the Act. would appear to undermine the vitality of <em>Lanasa </em>when a release under the Act or its equivalent is before the Court. In such a case, <em>Maryland Lumber Co. v. White, </em>supra, would seem to apply. The relevance of this analysis to our case would appear to be clear: is the accord and satisfaction here to be equated with an order of satisfaction before judgment and, hence, be a release of only the one tortfeasor who obtained the accord or does the <em>Lanasa </em>rule that there can be but one satisfaction apply to limit the injured person to the satisfaction arising from the accord just as if there had been a satisfaction of a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">After <em>Grantham,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>another decision, <em>Bell v. Allstate Insur. Co., </em>265 Md. 727 (1972), cites <em>Lanasa, </em>and it relates, in part, to an order of satisfaction situation. In <em>Bell, </em>the Court refused to \"turn its back\u201d on <em>Grantham </em>and quoted at length from <em>Lanasa. </em>In <em>Bell, </em>however, the order of satisfaction at issue was entered upon consent judgments. There was no order of satisfaction prior to judgment as occurred in <em>Maryland Lumber Co. v. White, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">We conclude that, under Judge Singley\u2019s analysis in <em>Grantham </em>of <em>Maryland Lumber Co. v. White, </em>supra, an order of satisfaction prior to judgment is the equivalent of a release under the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act. We conclude, further, that the Act abrogated the common law rule that a release of one joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>tortfeasor released all, <em>Trieschman v. Eaton, </em>224 Md. 111, 118 (1961); <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. 613, 619 (1957).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Continued reliance on <em>Lanasa, </em>is limited to instances where judgments have been satisfied. In the case on appeal we do not have a satisfied judgment; rather, we are confronted with an accord and satisfaction between appellant and Garden State.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Logic would seem to dictate that such a satisfaction, arising in law from the acceptance of the tender submitted by Garden State, should be equated with a pre-judgment order of satisfaction.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Without judgment, there has been no determination of liability. Garden State\u2019s tender specifically denied liability. To paraphrase <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>213 Md. at 619, when one claiming no liability obtains a release for himself from the injured party, the liability of others is not affected. Safeway, consequently, would not be entitled to summary judgment on the basis of the accord and satisfaction between appellant and Garden State.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the holding in <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>supra, moreover, even the released party, here Garden State, would not be entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">It will be recalled that in <em>Swigert, </em>the third party claim was for contribution; in the case on appeal, Safeway seeks to be indemnified by Garden State. Safeway\u2019s third party pleading did not seek contribution. The distinction between indemnity and contribution is real.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The effect of that distinction in the case on appeal necessarily must be considered in light of the clear provision of the Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act that it \"does not impair any right of indemnity under existing law.\u201d Art. 50, \u00a7 21, Md. Code. This provision of the statute was considered in <em>Park Circle Motor Co. v. Willis, </em>201 Md. 104, 113 (1952), where the Court of Appeals, after referring to the statutory provision, wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\"There are many instances where an injured third person may recover against either of two persons who are, as far as he is concerned, thus joint tortfeasors. It does not follow, however, in all such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>cases that the two wrong-doers are equally liable. There may be, and often are, cases where one of the wrong-doers is primar ily liable, and in those cases, such a one must b\u00e1&amp;r the whole loss.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">We believe this language in <em>Park Circle </em>requires the fashioning of a particularized ruling in light of the hybrid situation caused in this case by the accord and satisfaction which, we have determined, has not barred the litigation. Our belief that there is a need to fashion a particularized ruling is supported by the Court of Appeals\u2019 language in <em>Swigert. </em>There, the Court noted that neither plaintiff nor defendant could recover against the third party defendant. 213 Md. at 622. Plaintiff was precluded by the release he gave Welk; Swigert\u2019s right of contribution would not cause a recovery by him against Welk but would only reduce Swigert\u2019s liability to plaintiff. If, however, at trial in the case before us, Safeway were to show, as it alleged, that Garden State was primarily liable, and the verdict exceeded $1,000, Garden State would bear as indemnitor, per <em>Park Circle, </em>a loss greater than the peace it won through the accord and satisfaction applicable through <em>Scheffenacker v. Hoopes, </em>supra. Garden State may have no right to summary judgment under our reasoning in this case but the accord and satisfaction it obtained should not be rendered worthless by a third party claim of indemnity. The hybrid release or satisfaction determined here, therefore, demands a particularized solution.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We conclude that <em>Scheffenacker v. Hoopes, </em>supra, allows Garden State to rest assured that its liability will not exceed the $1,000 it has paid. Applying the Uniform Act as interpreted by <em>Swigert v. Welk, </em>supra, summary judgments in favor of Garden State and Safeway were granted erroneously. Appellant may proceed to trial, where liability will be determined in this matter for the first time. If the verdict is against Safeway, but no right of indemnification is found on the third party claim, cf., <em>Giant Food, Inc. v. Wash. Coca-Cola, </em>273 Md. 592, 607 (1975), there will be no issue requiring a particularized solution. Appellant will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>entitled to the benefit of her judgment against Safeway, and the $1,000 already pocketed from Garden State.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> If, however, Safeway is held liable and wins a judgment in its third party action, against .the alleged indemnitor, Garden State, because of the manufacturer\u2019s primary liability, appellant should be entitled to nothing more than she has already obtained from Garden State. In this manner, the efficacy of the accord and satisfaction between Garden State and appellant will be maintained and the indemnitor, Garden State, will not lose the benefit of its satisfaction. Needless to say, if Safeway gets a defendant\u2019s verdict, no particularized issue will be needed; appellant will have had the benefit of the $1,000 received from Garden State.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Judgments reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Appellees to pay costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b135-9\">.

At the hearing, counsel for Garden State, which is unrepresented on appeal, argued that Safeway and Garden State \"could never be joint tortfeasors\u201d because Safeway had not been sued in tort. Consequently, it was argued, the joint tortfeasors Act did not apply-and the parties were bound by the \u201coriginal common law\u201d where \"a release of one is a release of all and there can only be one satisfaction.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">.

The objection that there may be double recovery is meaningless, for the amount paid under the release must be credited pro tanto to the second tort-feasor.
