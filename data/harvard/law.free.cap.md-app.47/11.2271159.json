On appeal, the host driver maintains that the trial court (Barrick, J.) erred in overruling his motion for a directed verdict because (a) he was faced with an emergency and there was no evidence that he failed to exercise due care and (b) the testimony of the plaintiff passenger exonerated him. The personal representative presents a single issue: that the trial court erred in reading Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 (a) (Driving while intoxicated) and \u00a7 21-902 (b) (Driving while ability impaired by alcohol) as part of its jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b34-10\">The relevant facts are largely undisputed. On June 3, 1978, appellee, Ruth Arlene Masters, 53, a widowed schoolteacher, and appellant, Noble Benjamin Ridings, Jr., a friend and companion of some fifteen years, had a dinner date in Thurmont, Maryland.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Shortly after 8:00 p.m., they left the restaurant and proceeded to drive south on U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Route 15 in Ridings\u2019 Chrysler with Ridings behind the wheel. Masters testified that although it was not quite dark, \"ti]t was misty \u2014 it hadn\u2019t started to rain yet, just a dreary evening.\u201d Route 15 was a 24-foot wide, two-lane highway divided by a painted center line which permitted one lane of traffic to travel in each direction. Adjoining each lane was a 12 foot asphalt shoulder thus extending the width of the highway to a total of 48 feet. On the evening in question, traffic was light.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The appellee, Masters, testified that she observed the headlights of an oncoming car in their southbound lane about 100 to 125 feet away. When questioned about the car approaching in their own lane Masters responded, \"I\u2019m positive. I have nightmares about that yet, I see those lights coming at us.\u201d Masters also testified that the driver of the approaching vehicle, appellant Fouche\u2019s decedent, James Wilson Fouche, Jr., age 21 (hereinafter \"Fouche\u201d), was slumped over the wheel and shortly before impact, raised his head and steered his car back into the northbound lane. Ridings, in his testimony, said that he was proceeding at about fifty miles per hour when he first saw the Fouche vehicle and that its speed was about the same. He removed his foot from the accelerator and watched to \"see what he was going to do.\u201d He then described the final tragic moment: \"Then I saw he wasn\u2019t going to go back in his lane so I swerved over, I turned over in the left lane, and at the same instant I did that, the other driver did the same thing.\u201d When asked why he (Ridings) didn\u2019t swerve to the right instead of the left, Ridings responded: \"[DJidn\u2019t think about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b35-7\">A Maryland State trooper, who investigated the accidecl shortly thereafter, testified that the point of impact was approximately <em>3\u00a5-\u00bf </em>feet east o\u00ed' the center line in the northbound lane. Contact was made between the left-front section of each vehicle. He also testified that upon arriving at the scene, Fouche\u2019s vehicle was partially in the northbound lane and partially on the shoulder adjoining that lane. The Ridings vehicle was straddling the center line facing in a southeasterly direction. A gouge mark in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>pavement appeared in the northbound lane and a set of skid marks extended from the southbound lane into the northbound lane.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">James Wilson Fouche, Jr., driver of the northbound automobile, a Ford Mustang, was critically injured in the accident and died in the Emergency Room of the Washington County Hospital within three hours. Both Ridings and Masters were injured, Masters more seriously. A post mortem chemical analysis performed on Fouche by a toxicologist of the State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office, disclosed that his blood alcohol level was 0.17 percent. The report was, by stipulation, received in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">The appellee, Ruth Arlene Masters, filed suit in the Circuit Court for Frederick County against Noble Benjamin Ridings, Jr., and Barbara Fouche, mother of the deceased driver, as personal representative of his estate, for damages resulting from the alleged negligent operation of both automobiles. Ridings moved for a directed verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case on the ground that the evidence showed an emergency situation created entirely by Fouche and that Ridings\u2019 response by turning into the northbound lane was, as a matter of law, not negligent. Ridings also argued that the uncontradicted testimony of Masters clearly exonerated him from liability. The trial court overruled Ridings\u2019 motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-7\">\"The Court has considered Mr. Smith\u2019s motion for directed verdict and has read the case of <em>Virginia Freight v. </em>Montgomery, reported in 256 Md. 221, and the Court will overrule the motion since this case points out that the operation of a motor vehicle in violation of the Transportation Article [\u00a7 21-301] by driving across the center line is prima facie evidence of negligence and the burden is upon the driver to overcome the presumption of negligence by showing that under circumstances such as the condition of the road or an emergency in the traffic he was justified in driving across the center line. There is no evidence of emergency situation in this case nor any condition of the road which would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>overcome this presumption, and therefore the motion is overruled.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b37-6\">\"I think from her [Masters] testimony that the jury could also very well decide that Mr. Ridings was negligent in crossing the center line, and she did not exonerate him as I heard her testimony, and upon cross-examination Mr. Varner pointed out that in her declaration she accuses him of negligent driving, so for those reasons the motion will be overruled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Ridings\u2019 motion was renewed at the conclusion of the entire case and was again overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">Ridings contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion for a directed verdict. He argues that the undisputed testimony clearly establishes that he was confronted with an emergency and was not guilty of any negligence causing or contributing to the accident. He cites <em>Virginia Freight Lines, Inc., etc. v. Montgomery, </em>256 Md. 221, 260 A.2d 59 (1969) and <em>Mason v. Triplett, </em>217 Md. 433, 141 A.2d 708 (1958) as controlling authorities. We have carefully examined and considered each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-10\">In <em>Montgomery, </em>plaintiffs tractor-trailer<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was southbound at about 4:30 p.m. on a May afternoon, on a two-lane road with traffic proceeding in a single lane in each direction. The highway shoulders, adjacent to each lane, were approximately 6 to 8 feet in width. They were described as \"fairly hard.\u201d The plaintiffs driver, Asa Nickens, was traveling at about 40 miles per hour behind another truck at a distance of 300 to 500 feet. The weather was \"clear\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>the surrounding area was \"open country.\u201d When the truck directly ahead of the plaintiff suddenly pulled over to the right shoulder, Nickens observed an automobile driven by the defendant, Montgomery, approaching in the same lane from the opposite direction. The defendant\u2019s automobile was less than 150 feet away. Nickens testified that he could not drive onto the right shoulder because of the presence of the other truck. He, therefore, veered away to the left into the northbound lane and his right front wheel hit the right front wheel of Montgomery\u2019s car. No personal injuries were sustained. Nickens\u2019 employer brought suit for property damages in excess of $4800. The trial judge, finding for Montgomery, stated that the only question was whether the driver of the plaintiffs tractor-trailer was guilty of contributory negligence and applied the rule set forth in <em>Cocco v. Lissau, </em>202 Md. 196, 199, 95 A.2d 857, 858 (1953):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-5\">\"A driver who violates this 'rule of the road\u2019 [Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-301 (1977) requiring vehicles to be driven upon the right half of the roadway] is <em>prima facie </em>guilty of negligence where the violation directly and proximately causes a collision and injury to another traveler on the road, and the burden is then cast upon the driver to overcome the presumption of negligence by showing that under the circumstances, such as the condition of the road or an emergency in the traffic, he was justified in driving in the center or upon the left half of the road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">The lower court then concluded that Nickens was not confronted with an emergency. On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, stating \"[a]lthough Judge Carter found a few additional 'inconsistencies\u2019 and 'contradictions\u2019 [in the testimony] we think, all things considered, that Nickens did react to an emergency traffic condition which arose because Montgomery was driving his car in the wrong traffic lane.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227. The Court, in an opinion by Judge McWilliams, went on to consider the question of whether Nickens breached the standard of care owed under the circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>of an emergency and concluded that he was not negligent by swerving to the left. In dicta the court suggested that even had the right shoulder been clear, its conclusion would have been the same. The Court stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-5\">\"[W]e have no difficulty concluding that by swerving to the left, Nickens did only what any reasonably prudent man would have done faced with a like emergency. <em>Nor would our conclusion differ had </em>we <em>assumed, for the sake of argument, that Nickens\u2019 access to the right shoulder was not blocked as he claimed.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 228.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-6\"><em>Mason v. Triplett, supra, </em>also involved a collision with a vehicle proceeding in the wrong lane of traffic. Mason was driving a 1954 Lincoln in a northerly direction on the proper side of a two-way street, 22 feet wide, with 6 foot gravel shoulders. The time was about 8:00 p.m. in late January. It was dark and the weather clear. While driving at a speed of 25 miles per hour, he observed a pair of headlights, four or five car lengths ahead, on his side of the road. After swerving to the left at about a car length away to avoid the oncoming car, a 1953 Ford, the impact occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">A passenger in the Ford filed suit against both drivers and the owner of the Ford. Mason sued the driver and the owner of the Ford. In a consolidated trial, the jury returned a verdict for the passenger against both drivers and a verdict for the Ford driver in Mason\u2019s suit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mason appealed, contending that his motion for a directed verdict and judgment <em>n.o.v. </em>should have been granted in the passenger\u2019s suit and that his prayer to withdraw from the jury the issue of his contributory negligence should have been granted in his action. The Court of Appeals found error and reversed the judgment for the passenger against Mason and the judgment for the driver of the Ford in Mason\u2019s suit. (Chief Judge Rrune and Judge Hammond, later Chief Judge, dissented.) On the issue of Mason\u2019s negligence, the majority stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">\"The appellees contend that several inferences of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>negligence on the part of Mason can be drawn from the testimony and the physical facts. We do not agree. The uncontradicted evidence is that Mason was on his proper side of the road, when suddenly he saw a vehicle on the wrong side of the road, with very dim lights, which had backed out of a side road and started south at an accelerated speed directly in his path. These dim lights would not have been visible to Mason until Roy started south. We think the proximate cause of the accident was the extraordinary and quite unforeseeable conduct of Roy. <em>If, as the appellees contend, Mason might have avoided the collision at the last moment by driving off the road to the right, instead of turning to the left, and we think this is only a matter of speculation, his action in swerving to the left at the last moment could hardly be deemed </em>negligent.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 438.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">We turn now to the instant appeal and the reasons why, in our judgment, <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Mason </em>are not controlling, as Ridings contends in support of his claim that the motion for a directed verdict should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-6\">We are not unmindful of factual similarities between <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Mason </em>and this case. But there are critical factual differences. In <em>Montgomery </em>and <em>Mason, </em>the highway shoulders were 6 to 8 feet wide and 6 feet wide, respectively. In the instant case, the shoulder width was 12 feet. The shoulders in <em>Montgomery </em>were \"fairly hard\u201d and in <em>Mason </em>they consisted of gravel; in the instant case, they were asphalt, identical to the roadway. Unlike <em>Mason </em>and <em>Montgomery, </em>there was some evidence of drinking by Ridings which the court may have considered in denying a directed verdict. Furthermore, the accident in <em>Mason, </em>unlike the instant case, occurred at nighttime and in a town. There, driving across the center line may well have been safer than driving onto a 6 foot shoulder. In <em>Montgomery, </em>there was an obstruction on the shoulder of the road and the Court\u2019s finding that there would have been no negligence even absent such an obstruction was dicta. In any event, the dicta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>in <em>Montgomery </em>was based upon the holding in <em>Mason </em>and we find the facts in <em>Mason </em>at variance with those here present.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">Driving in twilight, Ridings was, or should have been, aware of the 12-foot wide, well-paved shoulder to his right, available for use in the event of an emergency or for any other proper purpose. The Court of Appeals has not held, nor can this Court, that <em>any time </em>one is faced with an approaching vehicle proceeding on the wrong side of a two-lane road, swerving to the opposite lane to avoid a collision is <em>not </em>negligence as a matter of law. <em>See Lehmann </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>218 Md. 343, 146 A.2d 886 (1958); <em>Consolidated Gas, Electric Light &amp; Power Co. v. O\u2019Neill, </em>175 Md. 47, 200 A. 359 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">In ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court must consider all credible evidence and inferences fairly deducible therefrom in a manner most favorable to the party against whom the motion is made. <em>I.O.A. Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Merle Thomas Corp., </em>260 Md. 243, 249, 272 A.2d 1, 4 (1971); <em>Tippett v. Quade, </em>19 Md. App. 49, 52, 309 A.2d 481, 486 (1973). We cannot find that the court erred in denying the motion when there was evidence from which the jury could have found negligence in an emergency situation. <em>See Warnke v. Essex, </em>217 Md. 183, 141 A.2d 728 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b41-7\">In the light of the above evidence, direct and circumstantial, bearing upon the question of Ridings\u2019 negligence, we reject his contention that certain portions of Mrs. Masters\u2019 cross-examination exonerated him from a finding of negligence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b41-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b41-9\">Appellant, Barbara Fouche, personal representative of the estate of James Wilson Fouche, Jr., avers that the trial judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>erred in reading Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 (a) and (b) as part of the jury instructions because the evidence of the decedent\u2019s intoxication was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">At the center of this controversy is a stipulated exhibit \u2014 a laboratory report from the State Department of Post Mortem Examiners which showed a \"positive\u201d alcohol blood content of 0.17 percent. There was, however, no explanation to the jury by expert testimony or otherwise of the meaning or significance of 0.17 percent. Appellant maintains that because the laboratory report was not explained to the members of the jury, they had no way of interpreting the report and it was prejudicial error for the court to read the above statutory provisions and to instruct upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Over objection of counsel, the court read to the jury subsections (a) and (b) of Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 (1977). These provisions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-7\">\"(a) <em>Driving while intoxicated. </em>\u2014 A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while intoxicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-8\">(b) <em>Driving while ability impaired by alcohol. </em>\u2014 A person may not drive or attempt to drive any vehicle while his driving ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">The court then explained in general terms the meaning of \"intoxicated from the consumption of liquor\u201d and \"while his driving ability is impaired.\u201d The jury was also instructed that a violation of the statute by either or both drivers was evidence of negligence but that the plaintiff could not recover unless that negligence was the proximate cause of the injuries. This was, of course, a correct statement of Maryland law. <em>Hilton v. Williams, 258 </em>Md. 285, 289, 265 A.2d 746, 748 (1970); <em>Alston v. Forsythe, </em>226 Md. 121, 130, 172 A.2d 474, 478 (1961); <em>Ford v. Bradford, </em>213 Md. 534, 541, 132 A.2d 488, 491-92 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">Neither party disputes that the question of a driver\u2019s intoxication is relevant to the issue of negligence. <em>Singleton v. Roman, </em>195 Md. 241, 72 A.2d 705 (1950). However, there is obvious merit in Fouche\u2019s position that the jury lacked any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>means of interpreting the numerical result of the chemical analysis. They could not determine from this evidence that the deceased driver had committed a violation of the statute. In this connection, it is to be noted that the jury in a civil case may not apply the presumptions relating to intoxication and impairment set forth in Md. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7 10 307. <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These statutory presumptions apply in criminal prosecutions specified in \u00a7 10-307 (a) and only when certain prerequisites are met.5 <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Major v. </em>State, 31 Md. App. 590, 592, 358 A.2d 609, 611 (1976). Therefore, absent an explanation by an expert of the 0.17 percent disclosed in the report, the jury could only speculate as to its significance. We find the remaining evidence insufficient to warrant reference by the lower court to \u00a7 21-902 in its jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Appellee relies on <em>Carter v. </em>Correa, 28 Md. App. 397, 346 A.2d 481 (1976) wherein the trial court, as part of its jury instructions, read Md. Ann. Code art. 66V2, \u00a7 11-902 (b), the predecessor of Md. Transp. Code Ann. \u00a7 21-902 (b), making it unlawful to drive while one\u2019s ability is impaired by the consumption of alcohol. There, the evidence revealed that the defendant rounded a curve at 70 or 80 miles per hour, crossed the center line, was \"loud and boisterous,\u201d and \"smelled of alcohol.\u201d This Court upheld the giving of the disputed instruction because evidence of driving under the influence of alcohol was not lacking.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">In <em>Alston v. Forsythe, supra, </em>a requested jury instruction based upon plaintiffs contention that the defendant was driving under the influence of alcohol in violation of Md. Ann. Code art. 66 Vh, \u00a7 206 (1957) was refused by the lower court because of the lack of any causal relation between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>alleged drunken driving and the accident. The omission was affirmed on appeal. The Court of Appeals noted that the only evidence of impairment or intoxication was that the defendant had \"two beers\u201d and \"smelled slightly of beer or whiskey.\u201d <em>Compare Thomas v. State, </em>206 Md. 49, 109 A.2d 909 (1954) <em>and Walker v. Hall, </em>34 Md. App. 571, 369 A.2d 105 (1977) <em>with Singleton v. Roman, supra, and Cumberland &amp; Westernport Transit Co. v. Metz, </em>158 Md. 424, 149 A. 4 (1930).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">In the instant case, there was no evidence presented of the decedent\u2019s condition before he began driving, no admission of alcohol consumption, and no observable conditions of intoxication such as demeanor evidence or general appearance. Although the manner of operation of an automobile by an alleged violator could be evidence of driving under the influence or driving while impaired, <em>Carter v. Correa, supra, </em>we do not believe absent an explanation of the 0.17 alcohol blood content that driving on the wrong side of the road and the driver\u2019s being slumped over the steering wheel is sufficient to permit the aforementioned instruction. Nor do we agree with appellee\u2019s alternative contention that the instruction given here was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\n<em>Judgment against Barbara Fouche, personal representative of the estate of James Wilson Fouche, Jr., reversed and remanded for a new trial.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\n<em>Judgment against Noble Benjamin Ridings, Jr., affirmed; costs to be equally divided between appellant Ridings and appellee.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-11\">.
