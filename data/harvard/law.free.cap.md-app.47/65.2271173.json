Mandate to issue forthwith. Costs to be paid by appellees.</p>\n<author id=\"b89-4\">Gilbert, C. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ay9\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">This is an unorthodox appeal, in an unorthodox case, brought in an unorthodox manner from an unorthodox series of rulings in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">On October 3, 1980, we reversed an order of that court which dismissed a petition for a writ of mandamus and ancillary relief that had been filed by the appellant, Ruth T. Smith.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We took that action in a <em>per curiam </em>order issued the same day. We shall now explain why we acted as we did.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">From the record it is learned that on August 18, 1980, a petition containing the purported signatures of 11,186 registered voters of Anne Arundel County was filed with the County Executive. The petition proposed the amendment of the County Charter by adding a section to be known as \"Section 723.\u201d The proposed new section would have required \"that the full faith and credit of the County shall not, except in emergency, be pledged for debt or construction of internal improvement without the prior approval of the voters of the County.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The County Executive transmitted the petition to the Administrator of the Board of Supervisors of Elections for Anne Arundel County (Board). Pursuant to Md. Ann. Code art. 33, \u00a7 16-4 (b) (1980 Cum. Supp.), \"the form and arrangement of the ... ballots to be used in the election ... [ was] prepared by the board and made available for inspection by any registered voter.\u201d The ballot was, we were told, posted in the window of the building in which the Board is housed. The posting occurred on August 29, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">Apparently a review by the Board of the signatures on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>petition resulted in the Board\u2019s reducing the number of valid signatures from the 11,186 to 9,924, a total fewer than the number necessary to place a question on the ballot. Subsequently, the County Executive was notified by the Administrator of the Board of the shortage of valid signatures on the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Two days later, September 8, 1980, the Chairman of the County Council wrote to Mrs. Betty G. Eby, the Board\u2019s Administrator, to the effect that the Board should consider that the proposed amendment lacked the requisite number of valid signatures and, therefore, could not be on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The next day, September 9, 1980, the Board posted the Council Chairman\u2019s letter in the same window of the building. We infer it was the same window in which the \"form and arrangement\u201d of the ballot had been or was displayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Whenever or however the appellants learned that the Board believed the petitions failed for want of necessary signatures is not clear from the record. It is clear, however, that the appellants filed their suit in the circuit court on the 24th day of September 1980. A judge of that court issued a temporary injunction that required the County to advertise the amendment as if it had the required number of valid signatures. The law necessitates that amendments be published at least once a week for the five weeks immediately preceding the election. Hence, had the judge not issued the injunction, the appellants, even if the trial on the merits proved them to be right, would be left with an empty victory because of their inability to comply with the advertising requirements. They would have been in the position of a fighter who scored a knockout after the final bell had sounded, with the result that his opponent won the decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">The County promptly moved to dissolve the injunction, citing Md. Ann. Code art. 33, \u00a7 16-4 (b), which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-8\">\"Following five days of public display, a court may not entertain a suit or grant injunctive relief to any party seeking to challenge the form or arrangement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>of the ballots or the wording of a constitutional amendment or question on a ballot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">The County reasoned that after the letter from the Chairman of the County Council to the Board was posted in the window for public display on September 9, 1980, the appellants had to bring their action within five days from that date. The suit, however, was not filed until September 24, 1980. Thus, the County argued, and the circuit court agreed, because of the lateness of the filing of the suit, the court was without jurisdiction to hear and decide it. On September 26, 1980, the court dissolved the temporary injunction it had issued two days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The appellants, in accordance with Md. Rule 510, elected to have the judge\u2019s decision \"reserved for the consideration of the court <em>en banc.. . </em>.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the hearing judge certified the \"Reservation and Exception\u201d relative to dissolving the injunction as \"accurate\u201d and transmitted the matter to the <em>en banc </em>court. Four days later, September 30, 1980, an order was filed by the hearing judge that dismissed the appellant\u2019s case totally.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">When the matter was heard <em>en banc </em><footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on October 1, 1980, that court was advised of the hearing judge\u2019s dismissal of the case. The <em>en banc </em>court, having determined that the matter of the dismissal was not reserved, did not decide the question of the dissolving of the injunction, but terminated it on the ground that the issue had been rendered moot by the order of dismissal filed by the hearing judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Appellants promptly noted an appeal to this Court from the hearing judge\u2019s orders of September 26 and 30, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">On motion filed simultaneously with the appeal, we advanced oral argument to the succeeding day. Counsel for appellants conceded on oral argument that the issue of the dissolving of the injunction was not before us since it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>been reserved for an <em>en banc </em>decision. Rather, the appellants asserted that the question for us to resolve was the hearing court\u2019s dismissal on jurisdictional grounds of their petition for mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Article IV, \u00a7 <em>22 of </em>the Maryland Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">\"Where any Term is held, or trial conducted by less than the whole number of said Circuit Judges, upon the decision or determination of any point, or question, by the Court, it shall be competent to the party, against whom the ruling or decision is made, upon motion, to have the point, or question reserved for the consideration of the three Judges of the Circuit, who shall constitute a court in <em>banc </em>for such purpose; and the motion for such reservation shall be entered of record, during the sitting, at which such decision may be made; and the several Circuit Courts shall regulate, by rules, the mode and manner of presenting such points, or questions to the Court in <em>banc, </em>and <em>the decision of the said Court in banc shall be the effective decision in the premises, and conclusive, as against the party, at whose motion said points, or questions were reserved; </em>but such decision in <em>banc </em>shall not preclude the right of Appeal, or writ of error to the adverse party, in those cases, civil or criminal, in which appeal, or writ of error to the Court of Appeals may be allowed by Law. The rjght of having questions reserved shall not, however, apply to trials of Appeals from judgments of Justices of the Peace, nor to criminal cases below the grade of felony, except when the punishment is confinement in the Penitentiary; and this Section shall be subject to such provisions as may hereafter be made by Law.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Through Md. Rule 510,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals has set out the procedure for invoking the constitutionally permitted <em>en </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number><em>banc </em>hearing. The rule is applicable to all the State except Baltimore City. Md. Rule 510 (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Some reasons for invocation of Art. IV, \u00a7 22 and Rule 510 are that it allows a case to be decided faster and more economically than an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Patently, the constitutional provision and the rule authorize a procedure that operates in the same manner as an appeal. Indeed, it has been said to be a substitute for an appeal. See <em>Buck v. Folkers, </em>269 Md. 185, 187, 304 A.2d 826, 827 (1973); <em>State Roads Commission v. </em>Smith, 224 Md. 537, 540, 168 A.2d 705, 707 (1968). The judgment of the <em>en banc </em>court is just as final as if it had been decided by the Court of Appeals. Thus, the decision of the <em>en banc </em>court, as to the party initiating that procedure, is of greater effect than a judgment of this Court. This is true because even if an appellant loses in this Court, he or she still has the right to seek certiorari to the Court of Appeals. There is no certiorari, however, from a circuit court sitting <em>en banc.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Generally, when an appeal is noted to this Court, or in the case of the invocation of the death penalty, to the Court of Appeals, the appellate court is immediately vested with jurisdiction over the case. The trial court\u2019s jurisdiction, except in purely ministerial matters, is divested and that court, with the noted exception, is powerless in the case.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We see no reason why Rule 510, once triggered, should not, since it operates as an appeal, oust the trial court of jurisdiction over the case and vest it in the <em>en banc </em>panel. To hold otherwise would undercut the very purpose of the rule. If, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>here, a plaintiff could invoke Rule 5\u00cd0 and, after having done so, a defendant then prevails upon the trial court to dismiss the plaintiffs case, the result would be that Md. Const. Art. IV, \u00a7 22 and Rule 510 are meaningless unless <em>all </em>parties agree to its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">We are certain that the framers of our constitution and the Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure as well as the Court of Appeals never intended for Rule 510 to be a sterile act, unilaterally brought into play by one party and just as singularly rendered nugatory by the other. <em>See generally, Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, </em>285 Md. 393, 404 A.2d 1027 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">We think it manifest that the constitutionally permitted circuit <em>en banc </em>court is a higher tribunal than is the county circuit court. <em>Washabaugh v. Washabaugh, supra </em>at 402, 404 A.2d at 1032. It follows, therefore, that the county circuit or lower court could not dismiss a case over which the higher or <em>en banc </em>court had obtained jurisdiction. To do so was error. For the <em>en banc </em>court to dismiss the case because the county circuit court had done so simply compounded the error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-10\">.
