J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIg\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">In the law of evidence, a line as sharp as a razor\u2019s edge may separate evidence which is sufficient from evidence which is insufficient to prove the identity of a criminal defendant. Our task in this case is to hone the edge.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">The precise problem of identification now before us had its roots in the events of October 21, 1979, when the appellant was stopped by Deputy J.R. Taylor of the Harford County Sheriff\u2019s Department for operating a motor vehicle with a \"loud exhaust.\u201d At that time, the appellant failed to produce a driver\u2019s license and gave his name as \"Arvil Raymond Murphy\u201d when questioned by the deputy. Deputy Taylor proceeded to \"run a check\u201d on this name by means of the Sheriffs computer tie-in with the Motor Vehicle Administration (MVA). The \"check\u201d was unproductive. The appellant was, therefore, issued a citation for operating a motor vehicle without a driver\u2019s license. Subsequently, it was discovered that the appellant\u2019s true name was \"Raymond Arvil Murphy,\u201d and that he had reversed his first and second names when he identified himself to the deputy. A second investigation was made through the MVA. It bore fruit. The driving record of \"Raymond Arvil Murphy\u201d showed that his license as an operator had been revoked since July 31, 1979. On the sole basis of this record, the appellant was convicted, in the Circuit Court for Harford <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>County (Close, J.), of driving while his license was suspended or revoked and was committed to the County Detention Center for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The issue before us is the sufficiency of the driving record as evidence identifying the \"Raymond Arvil Murphy\u201d thereon as the \"Raymond Arvil Murphy\u201d charged. The trial judge\u2019s resolution of this issue was not clearly erroneous, Md. Rule 1086, and we, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">Existing law states that \"[e]ven if no witness physically identifies a defendant in the courtroom, identification by name is enough.\u201d <em>Sallie v. State, </em>24 Md. App. 468, 482, 332 A.2d 316, 324 (1975). This is not, however, an unqualified position, as shown by the <em>Sallie </em>Court\u2019s quotation from 1 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Evidence </em>\u00a7 103 (Torcia 13th ed. 1972), where it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\"><em>\"Identical </em>names give rise to a <em>presumption </em>of identity of person. This presumption is slight when the name is common and there are many persons having the same name. It increases in strength with circumstances indicating the improbability of there being two persons of the same name at the same time and place, and where there is no evidence that there is any other person bearing that name. <em>Identity, then can be presumed from names coupled with other circumstances.\u201d Sallie v. State, supra </em>at 482, 332 A.2d at 324. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The evidence submitted must \"show directly, or support a rational inference of, the facts to be established, or the inference supported, beyond a reasonable doubt or to a moral certainty....\u201d <em>Vincent v. State, </em>220 Md. 232, 237, 151 A.2d 898, 901 (1959). <em>See also James v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 689, 288 A.2d 644 (1972); <em>King v. State, </em>14 Md. App. 385, 287 A.2d 52 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">In the instant matter, the names were both identical and uncommon. Additionally, the driving record at issue contained not only the appellant\u2019s full name, but his height, weight, race, and sex. Those characteristics were subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>empirical confirmation at trial. We think these were sufficient \"other circumstances\u201d connected with appellant\u2019s name identification to have passed the threshold of the strict standard of proof set forth by <em>Vincent, James, </em>and <em>King, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Unquestionably, the better practice in this case would have been for the State to introduce, along with appellant\u2019s driving record, evidence of appellant\u2019s date of birth and residence. Such evidence would have facilitated the establishment of the identification of appellant beyond a reasonable doubt and quite possibly eliminated the necessity of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\n<em>Costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
