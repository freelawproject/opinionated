Defendant in error, Minerva Blair, brought suit in the Municipal Court against the plaintiff in error, the American Forwarding Company. A jury trial was had, resulting in a verdict and judgment against the defendant for $278.75, to reverse which the cause is before us on a writ of error.</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-5\" pgmap=\"530\">Defendant in error claimed damages sustained by reason of the alleged failure of plaintiff in error to safely carry and deliver to her a box containing some clothing and other articles, delivered to it September 26, 1906.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b530-6\" pgmap=\"530(245) 531(243)\">It appears that in September, 1906, plaintiff resided in Peru, Indiana, and, being about to remove to Long Beach, California, boxed her household goods for shipment to that point. After having the box addressed to her brother, \u201cDeo Hank, Long Beach, California,\u201d she turned it over to one Stephens, of Peru, to attend to details of its shipment. Upon directions from Stephens, the Peru Teaming Company, took the box, thus marked, and delivered it to the freight depot of the Wabash Railroad there, and billed it to the defendant at Chicago. The receipt, or bill of lading, had printed on its face, \u201cReleased and at owner\u2019s risk,\u201d and the name of Jesse Stephens as consignor was signed upon it. The freight was prepaid to Chicago at the low rate accorded for transportation where it is shipped at owner\u2019s risk, and the Wabash freight receipt, or bill of lading, was mailed to the defendant company, with the statement that the box was \u201cto be forwarded to Long Beach, California.\u201d On the 26th of September the Peru Teaming Company received from the defendant company its bill of lading, which the teaming company turned over to Stephens, and Stephens sent it to Long Beach, California, where it reached the plaintiff. On October 9th the defendant company sent a teaming company and procured the box from the Wabash freight depot in Chicago, and brought it to defendant\u2019s warehouse. At this time, and for several years previously, the defendant had been engaged in Chicago, receiving at its warehouse goods of persons who have less than a carload lot, which they desired to have forwarded from Chicago to any given point. Such goods are held in its warehouse until sufficient quantity, destined for a point of shipment, belonging to other persons, are received, sufficient in the aggregate to make up a carload. When a carload is thus assembled, the goods, marked with the names of their several owners, are placed in an ordinary freight car belonging to the railroad company which is to transport the goods. The car is billed to some representative of the defendant, at the terminal point of shipment, from whom the various owners of the goods in the car can get them. The defendant makes a lump charge to each shipper, which covers its services for receiving, warehousing, loading and forwarding the goods, and also the shipper\u2019s proportion of the freight charge of the railroad company for their transportation. The freight rate on household goods in carload lots from Chicago to Los Angeles, the terminal point, was $1.12% per hundred pounds. The defendant charged the plaintiff $1.80 per hundred pounds, and the difference between these sums covered the compensation of the defendant\u2014the freight to be paid to the railroad company\u2014transfer charges, etc. The freight rate to Los Angeles on less than carload lots was $2.30 per hundred pounds.</summary><summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-4\" pgmap=\"531\">The defendant company did not own any cars, tracks, locomotives, or railroad equipment, or any interest in any railroad or railway. It did not own or have any interest in the car in which the goods were forwarded, nor in any part of the tariff or freight charge of the railroad company.</summary><summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b531-5\" pgmap=\"531(54) 532(77)\">On October 10th defendant had at its warehouse sufficient goods, destined for Los Angeles, to make up a carload. Its foreman loaded a Bock Island car with goods, including plaintiff\u2019s box, and notified the railroad company that the car was ready for shipment to the Pacific Coast Freight Company, Los Angeles. The railroad company sealed up the car, placed a card upon it showing its destination, and moved it away, after which the defendant had no custody or control of the car or its movements. The car left Chicago the same day, and, on the next, the car and its contents were destroyed by fire on the tracks of the Eock Island Railroad Company near Joliet. Plaintiff was notified by defendant of the loss on October 12,1906.</summary><summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-5\" pgmap=\"532\">When the car was turned over to the Rock Island Railroad Company, the defendant signed an instrument, releasing the railroad company from liability in excess of $5 per hundred pounds.</summary><summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-6\" pgmap=\"532\">The Pacific Co\u00e1st Freight Company of Los Angeles, to whom the car was consigned, did not charge defendant for distributing and handling goods at that point. Their charges were collected from the owners of the goods. They got the teaming and often the storage in their warehouse.</summary><summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-7\" pgmap=\"532\">The receipt, or bill of lading, issued by defendant to plaintiff, was as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-8\" pgmap=\"532\">\u201cInland Form 1</summary><summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-9\" pgmap=\"532\">Inland Bill of Lading</summary><summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A7NU\" pgmap=\"532\">No. 8578.</summary><summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-10\" pgmap=\"532\">THE AMERICAN FORWARDING AND MERCANTILE CO.</summary><summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b532-11\" pgmap=\"532\">General Office: Security Bldg., Cor.

The American Forwarding Co., 146 Ill. App. 388, and the same as reported in 242 Ill. 298; also, the Interstate Commerce Commissions Decisions in Export Shipping Co. v. Wabash R. R. Co. et al., 14 I. C. C. Rep. 437, and California Commercial Ass\u2019n v. Wells Fargo &amp; Co., 14 I. C. C. Rep. 422.</p> <p id=\"b535-13\" pgmap=\"535(10) 536(108)\">The facts before this court in the Bare case were very different from those in the case at bar, and may have warranted entirely different conclusions than can be reached in this case. In that case, the plaintiff in person took the goods to the freight depot of the railway company for shipment and there met one of the officers of the American Forwarding Company, who received the goods and issued a receipt therefor; and there is, also, testimony in the case (though denied by the defendant) to the effect that the officer of the forwarding company, thus receiving the goods, assured the plaintiff that the company would be responsible for the trunk if lost.</p> <p id=\"b536-5\" pgmap=\"536\">Upon the evidence in this case, and so far as this case is concerned, we regard the transaction by the defendant company as one in which it acted as a forwarding agent, and not as a common carrier.</p> <p id=\"ANL\" pgmap=\"536\">The business of gathering from various small shippers their freight, and assembling it into carload lots, and thus enabling the forwarding company to secure the transportation of the various parcels of freight at carload rates\u2014and, to secure this carload rate, waiving the protection which otherwise the shippers of less than carload rates would have\u2014with the difference between the carload and less than carload rates distributed between the forwarding company and the shipper in such proportion as the forwarding company may find necessary to secure business, leaving to the railway company the burden of maintaining its equipment and expensive terminal privileges for such amounts as it can earn upon the less than carload lots of freight which it is compelled to handle for individual shippers to such places, as are not important terminal points, involves considerations upon which much might be said upon both sides.</p> <p id=\"b536-8\" pgmap=\"536(50) 537(73)\">It is clear, however, that if the forwarding agent, to get this business, is to be allowed to release the railway company from all liability, except such as is comparatively nominal, for losses or damages incurred by reason of the shipment, it should be done only with the assent of the shipper. Perhaps this should he in the form of a distinct notification to the shipper, at the time the goods are accepted, that, in order to secure the reduced rate obtained by shipping at carload rates, and of which reduced rate the shipper is a beneficiary, it is necessary that the shipment be \u201creleased and at owner\u2019s risk,\u201d but, in some manner, the shipper must be advised and assent.</p> <p id=\"b537-4\" pgmap=\"537\">In this case defendant in error (Minerva Blair), after packing the box, had a Mr. Stephens, a merchant of Peru, Indiana, call and mark it for shipment, and she authorized him to attend to the details of shipping it to California for her. ' The drayman for Stephens came and took it for that purpose, and turned it over to the Peru Teaming Company of Peru, Indiana, which billed it over to the Wabash Bailroad Company to plaintiff in error in Chicago, and enclosed the bill of lading to plaintiff in error in a letter, stating \u201cHerewith enclosed find bill of lading for one box H. H. Goods, to be forwarded to Long Beach, California. The box is plainly marked for consignee, Deo Hank, with freight paid to Chicago.\u201d The bill of lading enclosed, acknowledges receipt in good order from Jesse Stephens by the Wabash Bailroad Company, to be delivered to The American Forwarding &amp; Mercantile Company of Chicago, Ill., one box H. H. Goods, weight 340 pounds, marked Deo Hank, Long Beach, California. On this bill of lading there appeared, among other things, the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b537-5\" pgmap=\"537\">\u201cThe consignor of this property has the option of shipping same at a higher rate without limitation as to value in case of loss or \"damage, but agrees to the specified valuation named in case of loss or damage in consideration of the lower rate accorded for transportation.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b537-6\" pgmap=\"537\">Jesse Stephens, Consignor,</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"Aq-\" pgmap=\"537\">subject to all the terms and conditions of the bill of lading now in use by the Wabash Bailroad Company.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b537-7\" pgmap=\"537\">Also the following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b537-8\" pgmap=\"537\">\u201cBeleased at owner\u2019s risk.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b538-4\" pgmap=\"538\">There was, also, evidence in this case to- the effect that it was the custom of forwarders to ship at the reduced rate, and to waive liability, as plaintiff in error did in this case.</p> <p id=\"b538-5\" pgmap=\"538\">We think the evidence in this case justified the act of the plaintiff in error in shipping the box at the reduced rate and in waiving liability on the part of the railroad company.</p> <p id=\"b538-6\" pgmap=\"538\">Jesse Stephens was the agent of defendant in error to attend to the shipment. He delegated the work to the Peru Teaming Company, which did ship to Chicago at the reduced rate, and waived liability, and the only instructions which the plaintiff in error had consisted of the letter and bill of lading it received from the Peru Teaming Co.\u2014showing the goods were \u201cto be forwarded,\u201d and that the freight was \u201cpaid to Chicago.\u201d Plaintiff in error, as sub-agent for defendant in error, in shipping at the reduced rate, did what her agent had already done within the scope of instructions, and, therefore, it was not liable.</p> <p id=\"b538-7\" pgmap=\"538\">The judgment of the court below is reversed, with a finding of facts.</p> <p id=\"b538-8\" pgmap=\"538\">Reversed.</p> <p id=\"b538-9\" pgmap=\"538\">Me. Justice Smith dissents.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
