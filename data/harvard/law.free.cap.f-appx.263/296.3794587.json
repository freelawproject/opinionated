The Department asserts that it discharged Davani because it had given him three separate \u201cGroup II Written Notices,\u201d which are notices of disciplinary action for conduct warranting discharge, the most recent on April 7, 2003. The third notice was given to him for failing to follow instructions to investigate issues relevant to the presence of utilities at a construction site. Davani claims, however, that in discharging him, the Department of Transportation discriminated against him on the basis of his race (Middle Eastern), national origin (Iran), and religion (Muslim); retaliated against him for filing complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; and violated state law by conspiring to injure his reputation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">Although Davani had previously filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d), he elected to challenge his discharge through state employee grievance procedures, even while the EEOC investigation was still pending. That state administrative process led to the conclusion, affirmed by a Virginia state court, that Davani\u2019s discharge was justified, was not contrary to law, and was not based on any unlawful discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">After the EEOC concluded its investigation about a year later, Davani commenced the present action. The district court dismissed Davani\u2019s complaint, concluding that it was barred by principles of collateral estoppel and res judicata, based on the determinations by the Virginia agency and the state court that Davani\u2019s claims were without merit. This appeal followed, and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-11\">The district court had previously dismissed Davani\u2019s complaint in this case under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basie Industries Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005), however, we vacated the district court\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the district court to consider the alternative arguments raised by the defendants, based on principles of collatei\u2019al estoppel and res judicata. <em>See Davani v. Va. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>434 F.3d 712, 720 (4th Cir.2006) (noting that \u201cprudence counsel [ed] that, because of the undeveloped state of the record, we refrain from [addressing the alternative arguments] at [that] time\u201d). After considering the alternative issues, the district court has now concluded that Davani\u2019s present claims of discrimination and retaliation were litigated and rejected in state proceedings and affirmed by the state court, and that this action is therefore precluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">Under Virginia law, the decision of a state administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d), following an administrative proceeding, is treated as the equivalent of a state court determination; it carries the same weight as a jury\u2019s verdict and will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>See Willis v. Magette, </em>254 Va. 198, 491 S.E.2d 735, 736 (1997); <em>see also Univ. of Tenn. v. Elliott, </em>478 U.S. 788, 799, 106 S.Ct. 3220, 92 L.Ed.2d 635 (1986) (\u201c[W]hen a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>agency acting in a judicial capacity ... resolves disputed issues of fact properly before it which the parties have had an adequate opportunity to litigate, federal courts must give the agency\u2019s factfinding the same preclusive effect to which it would be entitled in the State\u2019s courts\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). In addition, a state circuit court\u2019s review of an ALJ decision constitutes a valid state court judgment to which federal courts must give the same preclusive effect that another state court would, under the principle stated above. <em>See Davenport v. N.C. Dep\u2019t of Tramp., </em>3 F.3d 89, 93 n. 4 (4th Cir.1993) (\u201c28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1738 requires application of state preclusion law ... where, as here, the state administrative decision has been judicially reviewed ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Having carefully reviewed the record in this case, we agree with the district court that Davani\u2019s claims are now barred. The ALJ\u2019s findings that \u201cno credible evidence was presented suggesting that the [Department of Transportation] disciplined [Davani] for any impermissible reason\u201d can be understood only as a rejection of his evidence introduced during the administrative hearing, including the voluminous collection of exhibits he submitted, to support his claim that the Department had subjected him to an ongoing campaign of discrimination and retaliation since 2001. Although Davani\u2019s counsel claimed at the hearing before the ALJ that such issues were not before the ALJ\u2014asserting that the only issue presented was the propriety of the third Group II Written Notice\u2014he nonetheless proceeded to describe for the ALJ precisely the same history of discrimination and retaliation that he now presents in his federal complaint. The ALJ had the authority and the responsibility to consider this broader evidence as potential mitigation of the Department\u2019s disciplinary action against Davani based on the third Group II Written Notice. And the ALJ specifically ruled that this broader evidence was not credible and declined to mitigate Davani\u2019s discharge because of the alleged discrimination and retaliation. To the contrary, the ALJ relied on the fact that Davani had \u201caccumulated a sufficient number of active disciplinary actions to uphold removal,\u201d even after the ALJ elected to reduce Davani\u2019s third Group II Written Notice to a Group I Written Notice, which alone would not justify the discharge. Considering the entire record of Davani\u2019s claims of improper discrimination and retaliation as presented,, the ALJ specifically determined that the evidence was not credible, making that determination because it was essential to his judgment that Davani\u2019s discharge should not be mitigated. We conclude, therefore, that collateral estoppel now precludes Davani from maintaining his current action.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In addition, we are persuaded that the general bar of res judicata is applicable here. In April 2003, after receipt of his third Group II Written Notice and his subsequent discharge, Davani elected to file a grievance over his discharge through the State Department of Employee Dispute Resolution, as he was entitled to do, eventually requesting and receiving a formal hearing before an ALJ. Further, he chose to appeal the ALJ\u2019s adverse decision to the Fairfax County Circuit Court, as he again was entitled to do. Having made those choices, however, he committed himself to the results of those proceedings, including the fact that any subsequent attempt to relitigate his discharge would constitute claim-splitting under Virginia law.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Both in the state proceedings and in the present case, Davani alleged that he was wrongfully discharged as part of an ongoing campaign of harassment, discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>tion and retaliation. The ALJ took testimony from the parties and reviewed the records submitted to him, concluding that Davani\u2019s discharge was proper and that there was no credible evidence of discrimination. Thus, to permit Davani now to maintain the present action would be to allow him to seek the same remedy on the same cause of action that the ALJ decided adversely to him and the Fairfax County Circuit Court reviewed and held was not contrary to law. Under Virginia law, Davani may not \u201cbring[ ] successive suits on the same cause of action where each suit addresses only a part of the claim.\u201d <em>Bill Greever Corp. v. Tazewell Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>256 Va. 250, 504 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1998). Yet, that is precisely what Davani is attempting to do, by suggesting that he is splitting off from his claim in the present case all issues pertaining to the third Group II Written Notice and the ALJ\u2019s decision on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">We reject Davani\u2019s argument that the scope of the state administrative proceedings before the ALJ was limited to the third Group II Written Notice. While we agree with Davani that the <em>basis </em>for the ALJ proceeding was his challenge to the third Group II Written Notice, it did not preclude the ALJ from considering the effect of the earlier Group II Written Notices. Indeed, such consideration was necessary to support relief entered by the ALJ. Moreover, much of the testimony presented during the hearing before the ALJ centered on events that took place six months or more prior to the issuance of the third Group II Written Notice. While it is true that the ALJ could not have directly modified or overturned the first and second Group II Written Notices, he was fully authorized to mitigate Davani\u2019s discharge based on the third Group II Written Notice if he had found credible Davani\u2019s claim that all discipline of Davani was based on improper discrimination or retaliation. As noted, however, the ALJ rejected that claim as unsupported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">We also reject Davani\u2019s argument that the two earlier Group II Written Notices were not actually presented for review by the ALJ. While the ALJ clearly did not intend to open up and relitigate the propriety of the first two Group II Written Notices themselves, he did have to consider whether they were part of a scheme of discrimination to resolve Davani\u2019s defense to the third Group II Written Notice that the entirety of disciplinary action against him arose from illegal discrimination and retaliation. Critically for our purposes, it is this latter issue, and not the validity of the first two Group II Written Notices themselves, which Davani seeks to litigate again in the federal forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">At bottom, Davani\u2019s central claim is that he was subjected to an ongoing course of illegal discrimination and retaliation that lasted for years and culminated in the termination of his employment. He maintained consistently that the first two Group II Written Notices were part of the alleged campaign of discrimination against him and that the third Group II Written Notice was just another part of that campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">After considering the long and tortured procedure Davani pursued before the EEOC, before the state agency and the state court, and now in federal court, we conclude that Davani chose in the first instance to submit his claims to the offices of the Commonwealth of Virginia, a choice he was legally free to make. Having done so, however, he is now bound by both the results and its consequences. <em>See Rao v. County of Fairfax, Va., </em>108 F.3d 42, 45 (4th Cir.1997) (noting that while \u201can unreviewed state administrative determination ... is not entitled to any preclusive effect,\u201d such determinations do have preclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>sive effect \u201cif rendered or reviewed by a court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AOc\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b322-5\">SHEDD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A6H\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Davani has asserted a litany of employment discrimination and retaliation allegations that span several years, culminating in his termination from employment. The district court dismissed this case under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), holding that the doctrine of collateral estoppel bars all of Davani\u2019s claims, and the majority affirms this decision. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes parties to a prior action from litigating in a subsequent action any factual issue that was actually litigated and essential to a valid, final judgment in the prior action.\u201d <em>Scales v. Lewis, </em>261 Va. 379, 541 S.E.2d 899, 901 (2001). In order for the doctrine to apply, the party asserting it bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the issue is precluded by a prior judgment. <em>Id. </em>Among other things, that party must establish that the issue sought to be litigated in the subsequent action (1) was actually litigated in the prior action and (2) was essential to the judgment in the prior action. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, collateral estoppel does not apply when the party against whom it is asserted did not have a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d in the prior action to litigate the issue sought to be precluded. <em>Slagle v. Slagle, </em>11 Va.App. 341, 398 S.E.2d 346, 349 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">The prior action in this case is Davani\u2019s grievance proceeding relating to his third Group II notice. Davani\u2019s receipt of this notice led to his termination. The presiding administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) reduced the severity of this third Group II notice but nonetheless upheld Davani\u2019s termination because he had accumulated two prior Group II notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">Although it is true that other issues related to Davani\u2019s employment came up during the grievance hearing, the critical fact of the matter is that the ALJ expressly confined the proceeding only to consideration of the merits of Davani\u2019s third Group II notice. For example, during the grievance hearing the ALJ (referring to Davani\u2019s first two Group II notices) stated: \u201cI don\u2019t want to litigate these two other incidences because I\u2019m really not that concerned about it.\u201d J.A. 170. Later, the ALJ again made this point clear, stating in regard to the first Group II notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-12\">But I will tell you that if it\u2019s completely ... bogus, if it had been grieved and ... it would have clearly, hundred percent been reversed, it doesn\u2019t matter at this point because it\u2019s not before me. It\u2019s only before me in the sense that there\u2019s a ... history. And so I am bound by that group notice and ... the fact that, assuming it\u2019s completely ... frivolous for lack of a better term, I still treat it ... as if it was completely valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">J.A. 339.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-14\">In light of the ALJ\u2019s comments, and based on my review of the record of the administrative proceedings, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that all of Davani\u2019s discrimination and retaliation allegations and claims were actually litigated in the prior action or were essential to the prior judgment. Further, I do not believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>that Davani had a \u201cfull and fair opportunity\u201d to litigate all of those allegations and claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For these reasons, I would hold that collateral estoppel does not compel dismissal of this case. Because the district court did not rule on any of the alternate bases for dismissal raised by appellees, including res judicata, I would leave those issues for the district court to decide in the first instance on remand.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b322-9\">. As Davani's counsel explained during closing arguments: \"We did not spend time going into the details of the first grievance or the second grievance, going into the details of these totally false and spurious workplace violence allegations. Ah, we did not pull in witnesses for all of those issues. There's an entirely other appropriate forum for doing so however.\u201d J.A. 424.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b323-12\">. Although the ALJ noted in his order that \u2018\u2018[n]o credible evidence was presented suggesting the Agency disciplined [Davani] for any impermissible reason,\u201d J.A. 99,1 find that conclusion to be immaterial for our purposes because, as set forth above, the ALJ limited the scope of the proceeding in such a manner that Davani could not have litigated all of his discrimination and retaliation allegations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
