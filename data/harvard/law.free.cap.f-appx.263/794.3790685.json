After a thorough review of the record, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-20\">While confined in a federal prison in Florida awaiting new criminal proceedings, Wright filed the instant \u00a7 2241 petition in the district court for the Southern District of Florida seeking review of his 1993 Indiana burglary and theft convictions for which he was to serve 22 years\u2019 imprisonment and 13 years probation. The district court dismissed the petition without prejudice, finding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, and not \u00a7 2241, was the proper section under which Wright should bring his petition, and that it lacked jurisdiction to decide the petition . because the proper jurisdiction was federal district court in Indiana. Wright now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-23\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s denial of a habeas corpus petition, we review questions of law <em>de novo </em>and the court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error. <em>Coloma v. Holder, </em>445 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir.2006). This court has noted that the writ of habeas corpus is a single post-conviction remedy that is governed by both \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2254, the former section defining the outer parameters of federal courts\u2019 authority to decide petitions for habeas corpus, and the latter limiting the courts\u2019 authority with respect to a subclass of petitioners\u2014 those in custody pursuant to the judgment of a state court. <em>Medberry v. Crosby, </em>351 F.3d 1049, 1059 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-24\">In general, an application for habeas relief \u201cby a person in custody under the judgment and sentence of a State court of a State which contains two or more Federal judicial districts, ... may be filed in the district court for the district wherein such person is in custody or in the district court for the district within which State court was held which convicted and sentenced him and each of such district courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction to entertain the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In considering the proper venue for challenges to state court convictions, this court has held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>A prisoner may bring a habeas petition attacking a conviction in another state which may subject him to future custody in that state. In that situation, jurisdiction exists concurrently in both the district of the prisoner\u2019s confinement and the district in the state in which the conviction which he seeks to attack was entered. The most convenient forum will often be the district in the state whose conviction is being attacked, and a transfer of the case to that district is permissible, but not required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-5\"><em>Byrd v. Martin, </em>754 F.2d 968, 965 (11th Cir.1985) (concluding that there was concurrent jurisdiction where the petitioner had been convicted and sentenced for a crime by both a North Carolina state court and a federal district court located in North Carolina, the petitioner was serving his federal sentence in Alabama, and the habeas petition challenging the state court judgment was filed in Alabama); <em>see also White v. Butterworth, </em>70 F.3d 573 (11th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Braden v. 30th Judicial Circuit Court of Kentucky, </em>410 U.S. 484, 498-499 &amp; n.15, 93 S.Ct. 1123, 1131-32 &amp; n.15, 35 L.Ed.2d 443 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Applying this precedent to the instant case, Wright properly filed his petition in the district in which he was confined, and the district court erred by dismissing the petition for lack of jurisdiction. Accordingly, we VACATE the dismissal of the petition and REMAND for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-21\">. In contrast, an application filed pursuant to \u00a7 2241 must be filed in the \"district wherein <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>the restraint complained of is had.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-9\">. On remand, the district court should consider Wright\u2019s petition in conjunction with the mandates of \u00a7 2254. <em>Medberry, </em>351 F.3d at 1062. Additionally, the district court may transfer the case to a federal district court in Indiana if it determines that court to be the most convenient. <em>Byrd, </em>754 F.2d at 965. Notably, Wright had requested such a transfer, which the district court denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
