Navarro argues that his sentence was imposed in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court applied enhancements for possessing a dangerous weapon and for his role as organizer/leader. He contends that the facts to support these enhancements must be either admitted by him or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-15\">Navarro was sentenced in July 2006, after the issuance of <em>Booker. </em>Thus, the district court\u2019s determination, under an advisory guidelines scheme, that various sentence enhancements should be applied in the calculation of Navarro\u2019s sentence, did not violate Navarro\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-16\">Rafael Cuevas appeals his conviction for possession with the intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana and conspiracy to possess with the intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine or 1000 kilograms or more of marijuana. Cuevas argues that the Government\u2019s untimely disclosure of Jesus Carrera\u2019s arrest record violated his due process rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-17\">Because Cuevas complains of late disclosure rather than suppression of favorable evidence, this court determines whether Cuevas was prejudiced by the untimely disclosure. <em>See United States v. Walters, </em>351 F.3d 159, 169 (5th Cir.2003). Cuevas was granted a continuance during trial to determine whether Carrera had been convicted of murder in Mexico. Carrera was cross-examined extensively on his alleged murder convictions as well as other criminal transgressions. Because Cuevas had time to investigate and put the information to effective use at trial, he was not prejudiced by the late disclosure of Carrera\u2019s criminal history, and there is no <em>Brady </em>violation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b451-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
