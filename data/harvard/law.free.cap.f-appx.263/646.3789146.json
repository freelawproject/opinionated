Astrue, who was sworn in as Commissioner of the Social Security Administration on February 12, 2007, is substituted as the defendant-appellee pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 43(c)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b669-12\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">Christopher Stephann appeals the district court\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen the proceedings below. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">We lack jurisdiction to address Stephann\u2019s contentions regarding the district court\u2019s dismissal and entry of judgment because Stephann failed to file a notice of appeal within 60 days of entry of judgment. Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B). Accordingly, the scope of Stephann\u2019s appeal is limited to the order denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-17\">Stephann\u2019s motion to reopen, purportedly based on Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and (6), is properly construed as a motion for relief from judgment based on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). <em>Cf. Mt. Graham Red Squirrel v. Madigan, </em>954 F.2d 1441, 1463 n. 35 (9th Cir.1992) (\u201cAn untimely motion for reconsideration is construed as a motion based on Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-18\">The district court abused its discretion when it denied Stephann\u2019s motion to reopen for failure to properly file his case within the 60-day period, because this denied Stephann an opportunity to have his case reviewed on the merits. <em>See Rodgers v. Watt, </em>722 F.2d 456, 459 (9th Cir.1983) (holding that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) should be liberally construed so that cases are heard on the merits and not hampered by technical problems).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-19\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
