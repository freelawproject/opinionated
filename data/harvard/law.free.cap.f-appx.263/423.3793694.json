Following an answer from Defendants and an amendment of Dantzler\u2019s original motion, Defendants filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. The court stayed the proceedings while Plaintiff sought counsel. On January 29, 2007, Plaintiff filed a motion to extend his time to respond to the summary judgment motion, requesting that \u201cOscar Dantzler be granted an extension of thirty (30) days within which to file a responsive \u25a0pleading ... or until the 21st day of February 2007.\u201d The court granted this motion but later found that Plaintiffs response was not timely filed, as the court did not receive the motion until February 26, 2007. The court entered judgment for Defendants on March 1, 2007. The court denied Plaintiffs motion for reconsideration. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-16\">We are not persuaded by Plaintiffs argument that he had a full thirty-day extension to file his response and that the court erred in finding that his response was untimely. The court\u2019s order, signed on February 2, 2007, contained a handwritten note stating, \u201cThe hearing on the Motion for Summary Judgment is continued and reset for Feb. 28, 2007. The plaintiffs opposition is due on Wednesday, Feb. 21.\u201d The clear language of the order showed a due date of February 21, and the court did not receive the response until February 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-17\">We also fail to be persuaded by Plaintiffs argument that the court erred in granting summary judgment. \u201cThis Court reviews grants of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... A genuine issue of material fact exists when the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-movant. Summary judgment is [also] appropriate ... if the non-movant \u2018fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-18\">Plaintiff has failed to establish an essential element of his case, namely, that he was a party to the case resulting in the court order that he claims Defendants violated. Rather, Plaintiff drew a line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>through the name of an apparent plaintiff from that case and inserted his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">AFFIRMED. Plaintiffs motions for costs and sanctions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b446-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
