The petition for rehearing was referred to the panel that heard the appeal, and thereafter the petition for rehearing en banc and response were referred to the circuit judges who are authorized to request a poll whether to rehear the appeal en bane. A poll was requested, taken, and failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">Upon consideration thereof,</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">(1) The petition for panel rehearing is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-10\">(2) The petition for rehearing en banc is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-11\">(3) The mandate of the court will issue on February 5, 2008.</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b888-12\">RADER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A-3h\">dissenting from denial of the petition for rehearing en banc, with whom NEWMAN, LOURIE, and MOORE, Circuit Judges, join.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-13\">In an extremely short <em>per curiam </em>opinion with far too little explanation, the panel left the impression that it was giving away this court\u2019s jurisdiction over a broad swath of claims potentially arising from the Bayh-Dole Act, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 200-212. While non-precedential, the panel\u2019s opinion nonetheless unnecessarily suggests that this court\u2019s jurisdiction to review these cases is limited. I respectfully dissent from this court\u2019s denial of rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b888-15\">The panel concluded, albeit without much analysis, that WARF\u2019s complaint did not allege that the Bayh-Dole Act creates a cause of action. Thus it was entirely unnecessary for the panel to opine as to whether the Bayh-Dole Act is a \u201cpatent law\u201d or not. And indeed, the Bayh-Dole Act, in my view, is most certainly a patent law. While the panel dismissed the notion that the Bayh-Dole Act\u2019s \u201cmere inclusion\u201d in Title 35 does not make it a \u201cpatent law,\u201d it seems to me that this is actually a pretty good indicator. After all, Title 35 is itself entitled \u201cPatents,\u201d and Chapter 18, which encompasses only \u00a7\u00a7 200-212, is called \u201cPatent Rights in Inventions Made with Federal Assistance.\u201d Also, the language within some of the sections of the BayhDole Act suggests its provenance as a patent law. For example, 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 201(d) defines \u201cinvention\u201d as \u201cany invention or discovery which is or may be patentable .... \u201d Section 201(e) explains that a \u201csubject invention\u201d is an invention conceived of or first reduced to practice by a contractor. \u201cConception\u201d and \u201creduction to practice\u201d are familiar patent law terms of art. Also, \u00a7 200 states that the Act intends \u201cto use the patent system to promote the utilization of inventions arising from federally supported research or development. ...\u201d The Bayh-Dole Act is, \u201cat its heart,\u201d a patent law, albeit a patent law that employs some government contract rules to facilitate its patent-related policy objectives.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-16\">Although this court\u2019s panel opinion did not mention it, the reason that the \u201cimprovements\u201d clause in this case does not require an infringement analysis is that the WARF/Xenon agreement features no issued patents, just patent applications. Thus, no court need perform a true infringement analysis. <em>See GAF Building </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number><em>Materials Corp. v. Elk Corp., </em>90 F.3d 479, 483 (Fed.Cir.1996) (no declaratory judgment jurisdiction for infringemeni/invalidity of a design patent that had not issued when suit was filed; without an issued patent, there can be no infringement and thus no Article III controversy). Unlike <em>GAF, </em>however, this case features an undeniable controversy between the parties. To resolve this dispute, some court will have to compare the claims of the pending patent applications of the WARF/Xenon agreement with the alleged \u201cimprovements,\u201d and the contract\u2019s use of patent infiingement parlance to define this term will necessitate some sort of patent analysis, starting with construction of the pending claims. Thus, this is a patent dispute for still another reason.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
