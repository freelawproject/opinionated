We conclude that summary disposition is appropriate because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The regulations provide that a party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision, and such motion \u201cmust be filed with the Board within 30 days after the mailing of the Board decision.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider, filed nearly 18 months after the BIA\u2019s November 21, 2005 decision denying petitioners\u2019 third motion to reopen. <em>See Lava-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is reviewed for abuse of discretion). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion for summary disposition is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Ml other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate. The motion for stay of voluntary departure, filed after the departure period had expired, is denied. <em>See Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>368 F.3d 1157 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
