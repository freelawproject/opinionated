The court construes the motion as one also for summary denial of the petition for review. So construed, respondent\u2019s opposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The Board of Immigration Appeals did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen. <em>See Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 782 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-28\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.
