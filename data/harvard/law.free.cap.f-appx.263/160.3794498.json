Sept. 8, 1995). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Where the BIA does \u201cnot adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent,\u201d we review the decision of the BIA alone. <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). Though we do not have jurisdiction \u201cto review purely discretionary decisions\u201d of the BIA, <em>Noble v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 73, 77 (2d Cir.2007), we may review constitutional claims and questions of law, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The government contends that we do not have jurisdiction to consider Ramnarine\u2019s petition. We do, however, have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction. <em>Kuhali v. Reno, </em>266 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir.2001). To the extent that Ramnarine argues that the BIA made an error of law in reviewing the IJ\u2019s findings <em>de novo </em>in its September 8, 1995 order, that argument is meritless, since at that time the BIA had the authority to do just that. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 127 (2d Cir.2005). To the extent Ramnarine contends, instead, that the BIA applied the wrong standard in its <em>de novo </em>review, this case is covered by our recent decision in <em>Noble. See Noble, </em>505 F.3d at 78. Although we may have jurisdiction in some circumstances to review whether the BIA applied a legally erroneous standard of review, in this instance, Ramnarine\u2019s argument is best characterized as challenging the agency\u2019s discretionary determination, and, therefore, \u201cbeyond our jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Ramnarine\u2019s remaining contentions, relevant to his application for adjustment of status, are moot, having been rendered so by the discretionary denial of the section 212(c) waiver. <em>See Ruiz-Almanzar v. Ridge, </em>485 F.3d 193, 198 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
