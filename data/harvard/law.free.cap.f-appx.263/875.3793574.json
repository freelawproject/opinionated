Nicholson, </em>No. 05-0547, 2006 WL 3844151 (Vet.App. Nov. 9, 2006). We <em>dismiss </em>the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-20\">This court lacks jurisdiction over this case because Hobson did not timely appeal, and the time limit for filing a notice of appeal is not subject to equitable tolling. Furthermore, Hobson prevailed in his appeal at the Veterans Court, so there would be no issue to be considered here in any event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
