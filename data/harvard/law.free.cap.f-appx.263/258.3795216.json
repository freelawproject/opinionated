Tulio raises numerous issues on appeal, from the sufficiency of the indictment to the calculation of his sentence, each of which we will address. As Tulio\u2019s arguments are without merit, we will affirm both the defendants\u2019 convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-15\">Tulio is a construction contractor that submitted bids for contracts with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) to replace storm drain pipes along one of its railroad lines. SEPTA required contractors like Tulio to participate in its Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program\u2014SEPTA\u2019s effort to increase the opportunities of minority- and women-owned businesses to contract with SEPTA. As part of the DBE program, Tulio submitted bids stating the amount of work that would be subcontracted to a DBE, and presented the winning bid on two occasions. The bids certified that the requisite percentage of work would be subcontracted to DBE Eugene Pullins Trucking and Equipment Rental (DBE Pullins).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-16\">SEPTA subsequently learned that Tulio never used DBE Pullins, and had used fraudulent business utilization reports, invoices, and proof of payments (including altered checks) to prove that his company had done so. Tulio had also agreed to pay DBE Pullins a fee for using the company\u2019s name in false representations made to SEPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-17\">Approximately two months before Tulio was tried, the Government advised the defendants that Eugene Pullins was suffering from stage 4 terminal cancer and had less than six months to live. Neither party took Pullins\u2019 deposition and he died shortly thereafter. A jury subsequently convicted Tulio and his company of one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C \u00a7 371, and two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Tulio first argues that the indictment insufficiently alleged that the object of the alleged mail fraud scheme and conspiracy was money or a traditionally recognized property right. To be valid, \u201can indictment must allege that the defendant performed acts which, if proven, constituted a violation of the law that he or she is charged with violating.\u201d <em>United States v. Zauber, </em>857 F.2d 137, 145 (3d Cir.1988). In this case, the indictment clearly identified the elements of mail fraud and its charging language tracks 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. In particular, the indictment charged Tulio with \u201cobtain[ing] construction contracts and money from SEPTA by falsely reporting to SEPTA that they were in compliance with SEPTA\u2019s DBE requirement\u201d and paying a fee to a DBE to use its name in the false representations made to SEPTA. Appendix (App.) 38-39. Given these allegations, among others, the indictment fairly informed the defendants of acts which, if proven, constituted fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision not to dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">Tulio\u2019s next argument\u2014that judgment of acquittal should have been entered at the close of the Government\u2019s case for failure to prove that SEPTA was deprived of money or a traditionally recognized property right\u2014fails as well. As a preliminary matter, \u201c[i]n reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal on the ground of insufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we must sustain the verdict if there is substantial evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Government, to uphold the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>600 F.2d 414, 416-417 (3d Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">The Government correctly notes that the relevant inquiry concerns what Tulio intended\u2014not whether SEPTA was <em>actually </em>deprived of money or property. <em>See United States v. Rayborn, </em>495 F.3d 328, 338 (6th Cir.2007) (citations omitted). The Government presented sufficient evidence that the object of the fraud was to induce SEPTA to pay Tulio for work they agreed would be done by a DBE, but which was instead performed by Tulio and his company. For example, the Government demonstrated that the defendants were instructed multiple times about the requirements of the DBE program, that Tulio submitted reports and altered checks to make it seem that DBE Pullins had done the requisite work, and indeed, that Tulio never intended to use DBE Pullins to perform the requisite work at all. Accordingly, by showing Tulio\u2019s intention to induce SEPTA to pay for a service it did not receive\u2014 work done by a certified DBE\u2014there was sufficient evidence that the object of the alleged fraud and conspiracy was SEPTA\u2019s money, and the District Court\u2019s decision not to grant a judgment of acquittal will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">Related to its first two arguments, Tulio also contends that the District Court erroneously instructed the jury as to whether Tulio deprived SEPTA of a traditionally recognized property right. Tulio correctly notes that the prosecution in a mail fraud case must show that the object of the defendants\u2019 fraud was money or a property right (tangible or intangible), but not simply an \u201cintangible right\u201d unrelated to money or property. <em>Cleveland v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 12, 18-20, 121 S.Ct. 365, 148 L.Ed.2d 221 (2000). In a nearly identical case, <em>United States v. Leahy, </em>464 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>F.3d 773 (7th Cir.2006), various defendants were convicted of a fraudulent scheme involving the City of Chicago\u2019s DBE Program. Just as in <em>Leahy, </em>\u201c[d]espite defendants\u2019 contortions to squeeze this case into the intangible rights category, we cannot agree that it is such a case.\u201d <em>See Leahy, </em>464 F.3d at 787 <em>(citing Cleveland v. United States, </em>531 U.S. 12, 121 S.Ct. 365, 148 L.Ed.2d 221 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The jury in the instant case was entitled to find that by depriving SEPTA of a fundamental basis of their bargain, Tulio had deprived SEPTA of a property right. As explained in cases such as <em>United States v. Granberry, </em>908 F.2d 278 (8th Cir.1990) and <em>United States v. Miller, </em>997 F.2d 1010, 1017 (2d Cir.1993), contract rights can be considered property rights for purposes of the federal mail fraud statute. <em>See also United States v. Hedaithy, </em>392 F.3d 580, 602 (3d Cir.2004) (explaining that \u201cthe Court [in <em>Cleveland </em>] was not setting out a requirement that a mail fraud scheme must be designed to \u2018obtain\u2019 property ... [but] [r]ather, this language reflects the Court\u2019s conclusion that a victim has been defrauded of \u2018property,\u2019 within the meaning of the mail fraud statute, only if that which the victim was defrauded of is something that constitutes \u2018property\u2019 in the hands of the victim.\u201d); <em>Adinolfi v. Hazlett, </em>242 Pa. 25, 88 A. 869 (1913) (noting that the common law of Pennsylvania recognizes contract rights as property rights). Importantly, unlike in <em>Cleveland, </em>Tulio\u2019s scheme to defraud SEPTA did not turn on defrauding the Government out of a license, thus merely implicating the Government\u2019s role as sovereign. 531 U.S. at 23-24, 121 S.Ct. 365; <em>see Hedaithy, </em>392 F.3d at 597. So too, unlike <em>McNally v. United States, </em>SEPTA was deprived of more than just a citizen\u2019s intangible right to have the Government\u2019s affairs conducted honestly. <em>See McNally, </em>483 U.S. 350, 352, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987). Instead, much like in <em>Leahy, </em>the fraudulent scheme implicated SEPTA\u2019s role as a property holder, purchasing goods and services in the open market. <em>See Cleveland, </em>531 U.S. at 24, 121 S.Ct. 365 (differentiating the Government\u2019s role as sovereign from its role as property holder, selling goods and services in the open market). In this position, SEPTA was deprived of its contract rights when Tulio appropriated the money that SEPTA had intended to, and Tulio promised would, enable a DBE to provide services for SEPTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">Beyond property rights, Tulio\u2019s fraudulent scheme directly targeted SEPTA\u2019s \u201cmoney, plain and simple\u201d as SEPTA paid for services\u2014construction done by a certified DBE-\u2014that it did not receive. <em>Leahy, </em>464 F.3d at 788; <em>see also United States v. Osser, </em>864 F.2d 1056, 1063 (3d Cir.1988) (distinguishing a case where the indictment and jury charge were focused solely on the deprivation of the employee\u2019s honest services by the receipt of kickbacks from a case where the jury was charged explicitly that it could find financial detriment to the City as a result of kickbacks and commissions paid out). As the jury instructions properly permitted the jury to consider whether the object of Tulio\u2019s fraud was money or property, the jury instructions adequately stated the applicable law, and we will affirm the District Court on this issue. <em>See United States v. Khorozian, </em>333 F.3d 498, 507-08 (3d Cir.2003) <em>(quoting United States v. Coyle, </em>63 F.3d 1239, 1245 (3d Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Tulio\u2019s fourth argument\u2014that the Court erroneously allowed the prosecutor to elicit a speculative answer to a hypothetical question\u2014also must be rejected. As Tulio\u2019s counsel did not object to such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>inquiry at trial, we review the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (stating that a court\u2019s discretion to award relief on plain error review should be exercised only if the defendant is \u201cactually innocent\u201d or the error \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings\u201d); <em>United States v. Boone, </em>279 F.3d 163, 174 n. 6 (3d Cir.2002). Given the nature of the issue before the Court\u2014whether DBE compliance was a fundamental basis of the bargain\u2014the relevant testimony elicited by the prosecutor certainly does not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Tulio next contends that the District Court erroneously precluded him from challenging the constitutionality of SEPTA\u2019S DBE program. The Supreme Court has long affirmed \u201cthe governing principle [] that a claim of unconstitutionality will not be heard to excuse a voluntary, deliberate and calculated course of fraud and deceit. One who elects such a course as a means of self-help may not escape the consequences by urging that his conduct be excused because the statute which he sought to evade is unconstitutional.\u201d <em>Dennis v. United States, </em>384 U.S. 855, 865-67, 86 S.Ct. 1840, 16 L.Ed.2d 973 (1966); <em>see Bryson v. United States, </em>396 U.S. 64, 68, 90 S.Ct. 355, 24 L.Ed.2d 264 (1969). Moreover, all the District Court did in this case was inform Tulio\u2019s counsel that if he contested the legality of the DBE Program, the Court would likely charge the jury that the program is legal. Given the District Court\u2019s understanding of the law surrounding DBE programs in general, providing such an instruction to the jury so as to avoid potential confusion would be entirely appropriate. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgments of the District Court on these contentions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Tulio\u2019s sixth argument is that the Government\u2019s tactics with respect to Eugene Pullins, both before and during trial, amounted to a denial of his due process rights. Specifically, Tulio contends that the Government intentionally lulled him into believing that Pullins was in adequate health to appear at trial, when in fact Pullins was not, making Tulio unable to present Pullins\u2019s crucial testimony. There is simply no evidence to support this alleged due process violation, and so there was no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Finally, Tulio argues that the District Court erroneously enhanced his sentence by misinterpreting three sections of the Sentencing Guidelines (Guidelines): Sections 2B1.1, 3E1.1, and 3B1.1. As to Section 2B1.1, contrary to Tulio\u2019s contention, the Court specifically found that Application Note 3(F) should apply, in light of several analogous cases, <em>United States v. Tupone, </em>442 F.3d 145 (3d Cir.2006), <em>United States v. Brothers Construction Company of Ohio, </em>219 F.3d 300 (4th Cir.2000), and <em>United States v. Leahy, </em>464 F.3d 773 (7th Cir.2006), and calculated the loss amount at just under $70,000\u2014the amount that Tulio promised would go to DBE Pullins. App. 856. As to Section 3E1.1, the Court did not commit clear error in denying Tulio\u2019s purported acceptance of responsibility, as he contested several of the Government\u2019s factual arguments at trial. <em>See United States v. Barr, </em>963 F.2d 641, 657 (3d Cir.1992) (noting that the determination of entitlement to a credit for acceptance of responsibility is reviewed for clear error). Tulio contested the Government\u2019s ability to prove a conspiracy, to prove that defendants intended to commit mail fraud, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>and to prove that SEPTA suffered any loss of property or money. Lastly, as to Section 3B 1.1(c), the District Court did not err in imposing a two-level Guidelines enhancement based on Tulio\u2019s leadership role in the fraud. The Government presented substantial evidence that Tulio directed others\u2014such as his employee, Ms. Geria\u2014 to engage in activities to perpetuate the fraud on SEPTA. App. 862.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">For these reasons we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
