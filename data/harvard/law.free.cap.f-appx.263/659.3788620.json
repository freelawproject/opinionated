McWILLIAMS, Senior Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b681-24\">On February 3, 2005, Robert SedilloGutierrez (the defendant) was charged in a one-count indictment filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico with possession with an intent to distribute 500 grams and more of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Defendant pled not guilty and on August 15, 2005, a jury trial commenced, but a mistrial was declared on August 23, 2005. A second trial was commenced on March 27, 2006, and on March 30, 2006, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged. At that trial, when the United States rested its case, counsel moved for a directed verdict of not guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>on the grounds that the United States \u201chadn\u2019t proven a sufficient nexus between my client and the lot located at 814 W. 12th St.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. The district court denied that motion, whereupon counsel elected to call no defense witnesses. On March 30, 2006, the jury returned a verdict of guilty as charged. On August 7, 2006, the district court sentenced defendant to imprisonment for 360 months, ten years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">On appeal, counsel frames the one issue he seeks to raise on behalf of the defendant as follows: \u201cThere was not sufficient evidence to find that Mr. Sedillo possessed the contraband in question.\u201d Our review of the matter convinces us that there was \u201csufficient evidence that Mr. Sedillo possessed the contraband in question\u201d and we therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The government\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case\u201d was that the defendant was a dealer in methamphetamine and that he sold the methamphetamine out of a house located at 1101 North Kansas Avenue in Roswell, New Mexico. That house was not defendant\u2019s place of residence, but the residence of a \u201cfriend.\u201d Continuing with the government\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d: the defendant hid his supply of methamphetamine in an abandoned lot located at 814 W. 12th St., which was adjacent to the backyard of the residence at 1101 North Kansas and, as said, sold methamphetamine to his various customers who would pick up the contraband from 1101 North Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">A key witness at trial for the government was one Estanislada Cardona, hereinafter referred to as C.I. She testified at trial that she first met the defendant in 2002, when she was approximately 23 years of age. In the Fall of 2004, the police raided her home and found marijuana, methamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia in her home. At that time, the C.I. said she had been buying methamphetamine from the defendant for over a year at $1,100 for one ounce, part of which she was using, but otherwise selling some of it to others. She said, on occasion, she would go as often as once or twice a day to get methamphetamine from the defendant at 1101 North Kansas and either use it or resell it. On many occasions when she went to 1101 North Kansas to pick up methamphetamine from the defendant she observed the defendant \u201cwalk to the backyard and be back in the backyard somewhere for a few minutes and then he\u2019d walk back to the front.\u201d She also testified that the day she was released from jail, she, at'the request of the police, did go to 1101 North Kansas to buy some more methamphetamine, but that the defendant on that occasion refused to sell her any \u201cbecause she had just gotten out of jail.\u201d She also estimated that she had made nearly $500 a day selling methamphetamine which she had obtained from the defendant. In this latter connection, she \u201cguessed\u201d that defendant had money from sales of the methamphetamine \u201cburied at his mom\u2019s house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">The evidence presented at trial also showed that after talking to the C.I. the police set up a surveillance at 1101 North Kansas and noted that the defendant would go to the house and disappear behind the residence located thereon. On such occasion, a vehicle would arrive and stop in front of the residence and the defendant would reappear and make contact with the person in the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">At about this point in their investigation of this entire matter, the police obtained a search warrant for the house at 1101 North Kansas. When executing the warrant, they found an elderly man living therein. The defendant was not inside the house when the officers arrived. The offi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>cers searched the house but found no contraband, nor did they find any contraband in the yard area of the house itself. One of the officers testified that he saw a ladder propped up against a corrugated steel fence at the rear of the property on North Kansas. The fence separated the backyard of 1101 North Kansas from the abandoned lot at 814 W. 12th St. In this connection, the testimony presented at trial by the government also showed that the out-of-state owner of the adjacent lot, which looked like a \u201cjunk yard,\u201d gave the police permission to search his property, and the search ultimately disclosed a \u201cbrick-type form\u201d of a substance which subsequently was determined to be about eight pounds of methamphetamine. Witnesses stated that the amount of methamphetamine was greater than one would possess for \u201cpersonal use\u201d and was consistent with \u201csales and distribution.\u201d While searching the adjacent lot, the police also found a cellular phone receipt printed with defendant\u2019s name and an address which was later determined to be that of defendant\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Another witness, who lived at 816 W. 12th St., testified at trial that he had seen defendant \u201cclimbing the fence\u201d between the backyard of 1101 N. Kansas and the \u201cjunk yard\u201d at 814 W. 12th St., and that he had advised police of that fact when he saw police executing the search warrant at 1101 N. Kansas.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Acting on the C.I.\u2019s statement, the police later obtained the consent of defendant\u2019s mother to search her property, and \u201cburied beneath a tree\u201d found a \u201cpickle jar\u201d which contained $77,200 in cash. Later, a \u201clist of items needed to make methamphetamine\u201d was found in an FBI search of defendant\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">As stated, the one issue on appeal is whether the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict that the defendant was guilty of possessing with an intent to distribute the methamphetamine found hidden in the abandoned lot adjacent to the rear of the residence at 1101 North Kansas. In this regard, in <em>United States v. Williamson, </em>53 F.3d 1500, 1514 (10th Cir.1995), we spoke as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">In reviewing a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the record <em>de novo, </em>\u201cand ask only whether, taking the evidence\u2014\u2018both direct and circumstantial, together with the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom\u2019\u2014in the light most favorable to the government, a reasonable jury could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In order to conclude the evidence was insufficient, as a matter of law, to support a conviction, \u201cwe must find that no reasonable juror could have reached the disputed verdict.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-10\">Our study of the record leads us to conclude that the evidence is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s determination that the defendant possessed with an intent to distribute the methamphetamine found by the police secreted in an abandoned lot behind the residence at 1101 North Kansas. The government showed that defendant had constructive possession of the methamphetamine. In this latter connection, <em>see United States v. Culpepper, </em>834 F.2d 879, 881-82 (10th Cir.1987) (holding that defendant had constructive possession over marijuana found in fields he did not own, where he had the ability to exercise dominion and control over it).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">In sum, the testimony of the C.I., which was obviously given credibility by the jury, showed that the defendant was indeed engaged in distributing methamphetamine out of and from the residence at 1101. No methamphetamine was found at that residence or at defendant\u2019s residence. However, a considerable amount of metham<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>phetamine was located in the abandoned lot behind the residence at 1101. An officer had found a ladder at the rear of the 1101 residence propped up against the corrugated steel fence that separated the residence from the abandoned lot. And a neighbor testified that he had seen, a couple of weeks before, the defendant \u201cclimbing\u201d the fence. Officers also found a cellular phone receipt in the abandoned lot which contained defendant\u2019s name and the address of his mother. Officers found $77,200 in cash in a pickle jar buried outside defendant\u2019s mother\u2019s house, and a list of items used to make methamphetamine at defendant\u2019s house. The evidence supports the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b681-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
