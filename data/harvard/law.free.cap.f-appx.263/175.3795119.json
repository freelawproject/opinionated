We assume familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-18\">Ms. Francis is an elementary school teacher employed by the Elmsford School District. She was born in 1935. Ms. Francis claims that because of her age, in July 2002, Elmsford transferred her from teaching second grade in a classroom to teaching Academic Intervention Services (\u201cAIS,\u201d somewhat comparable to special education) in a hallway. Ms. Francis also asserts that she was unfairly transferred among several different teaching assignments in the district in the late 1990s and early 2000s; provided with an uncomfortable student chair once she was transferred to the hallway; not given a job description relating to her new AIS duties; forced to go up and down stairs to store and retrieve her personal effects; and denied a budget for teaching materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s award of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003). Claims brought under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d) are governed by the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). \u201cFirst, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. ... Second, if the plaintiff succeeds in establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination, then the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate a non-discriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection. Third, if the defendant meets this burden of production, the presumption drops away ... and the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant\u2019s explanations were pretextual.\u201d <em>D\u2019Cunha v. Genovese/Eckerd Corp., </em>479 F.3d 193, 195 (2d Cir.2007) (internal citations omitted). \u201cA <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination requires that plaintiffs demonstrate membership in a protected class, qualification for their position, an adverse employment action, and circumstances that support an inference of age discrimination.\u201d <em>Kassner v. 2nd Ave. Delicatessen Inc., </em>496 F.3d 229, 238 (2d Cir.2007). The burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of employment discrimination is minimal. <em>McPherson v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>457 F.3d 211, 215 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">A plaintiff bringing a hostile work environment claim under the ADEA must show that \u201cthe workplace is permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment.\u201d <em>Kassner, </em>496 F.3d at 240 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cMinor incidents do not merit relief.... To establish a hostile work environment, plaintiffs must prove that the incidents were sufficiently continuous and concerted to be considered pervasive. A plaintiff must also demonstrate that she was subjected to the hostility because of her membership in a protected class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 240-41 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">We find that Ms. Francis set forth a <em>prima facie </em>case of age discrimination. She was a member of a protected class. Her many positive teaching evaluations and years of experience as an elementary school teacher rendered her qualified for her desired position. Ms. Francis alone was assigned to teach in a hallway and her teaching responsibilities were diminished; this alteration in working conditions constituted an adverse employment action. Finally, we note that she was replaced (albeit temporarily) by a younger teacher, supporting an inference of discrimination on the basis of age. <em>See, e.g., D\u2019Cunha, </em>479 F.3d at 195 (making an inference of discrimination based on the fact that one of the individuals who was offered a position in place of the plaintiff was eight years younger, and opining that \u201c[t]his difference in age\u2014though not large\u2014is significant enough to support an inference in D\u2019Cunha\u2019s favor.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">Elmsford has, however, successfully articulated a non-discriminatory reason for Ms. Francis\u2019 reassignment: concerns about her teaching that coalesced in the 2001-2002 school year, the year before she was reassigned. During that year, Ms. Francis attempted to retain two students in second grade, precipitating parental complaints, scrutiny of her teaching methods, and the removal of one student from her class.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">Ms. Francis did not prove that these stated reasons were pretextual and that Elmsford was motivated by age-based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>bias. She admitted that no school official ever made any comments to her about her age. Further, there is no indication that older teachers within the school district were in any way treated differently than younger ones. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment to Appellees on Appellant\u2019s age discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Ms. Francis\u2019 hostile work environment claim. Many of the conditions about which she complained\u2014her chair, and lack of budget and job description\u2014were remedied within a few months of her reassignment to AIS. As to Ms. Francis\u2019 location in the hallway, we are not convinced that these conditions constitute \u201cdiscriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Having carefully considered Ms. Francis\u2019 remaining arguments and finding them without merit, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
