App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b545-20\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">Joseph Williams-Bey, an inmate at the Indiana State Prison, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, claiming that his constitutional and statutory rights were violated when the prison chaplain suspended him without notice or a hearing from participating in activities at the prison\u2019s religious center. The district court dismissed the complaint, holding that Williams-Bey could not challenge this punishment under \u00a7 2254 because it did not affect the duration of his detention. The court suggested, however, that Williams-Bey could possibly re-file his claims in an action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-22\">The facts alleged in Williams-Bey\u2019s complaint are sparse. In August 2006 one of the prison chaplains suspended Williams-Bey from participating in all activities at the prison\u2019s religious center because of Williams-Bey\u2019s conduct toward the chaplain a few days earlier. The complaint does not say what that conduct was. Williams-Bey learned of his suspension in a letter from the chaplain, which he attached to the complaint. The letter said that Williams-Bey would be allowed to participate in activities again if he repented to the chaplain.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-23\">After the district court dismissed his habeas corpus petition, Williams-Bey brought this appeal. But he does not address the basis of the district court\u2019s dismissal, <em>ie., </em>that the allegations do not state a claim under \u00a7 2254 because his punishment does not affect the fact or duration of his confinement. Instead, Williams-Bey argues the merits of his underlying claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Dismissal was proper here. It is well-established that a prisoner who challenges neither the fact nor duration of confinement but instead challenges the conditions of confinement\u2014such as exclusion from programs and loss of privileges\u2014must do so in an action under \u00a7 1983 or another federal statute, not a petition for habeas corpus. <em>See Cochran v. Buss, </em>381 F.3d 637, 639 (7th Cir.2004); <em>Bunn v. Conley, </em>309 F.3d 1002, 1007 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Moran v. Sondalle, </em>218 F.3d 647, 650-51 (7th Cir. 2000). Williams-Bey challenges only his suspension from pai\u2019ticipation in religious programs, which does not implicate the fact or duration of his sentence. <em>See Bunn, </em>309 F.3d at 1007. Therefore, a \u00a7 2254 petition was the wrong vehicle for Williams-Bey to challenge his punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Moreover, instead of converting the petition into a \u00a7 1983 complaint on Williams-Bey\u2019s behalf, the district court properly suggested that Williams-Bey could re-file his claims in a \u00a7 1983 action. District courts should not convert a habeas corpus petition into a civil rights complaint, even for a pro <em>se </em>petitioner, because important procedural differences exist between the two actions that can have significant consequences for the petitioner\u2019s ability to appeal or bring later suits, among other things. <em>See Glaus v. Anderson, </em>408 F.3d 382, 388-89 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that re-characterization is appropriate in only narrow circumstances and outlining different consequences of filing \u00a7 1983 and habeas corpus actions); <em>Moore v. Pemberton, </em>110 F.3d 22, 23-24 (7th Cir.1997) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
