On appeal, Ellerbee asserts that the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>trict court erred in calculating his base offense level by cross-referencing the drug trafficking guideline. The Government asserts that Ellerbee validly waived the right to appeal his sentence in the plea agreement. We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A defendant may waive the right to appeal if that waiver is knowing and intelligent. <em>United States v. Amaya-Portillo, </em>423 F.3d 427, 430 (4th Cir.2005). Generally, if the district court fully questions a defendant regarding the waiver of his right to appeal during the Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 colloquy, the waiver is both valid and enforceable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>410 F.3d 137, 151 (4th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991). The question of whether a defendant validly waived his right to appeal is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 168 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that Ellerbee knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal his sentence. Moreover, the sentencing issue raised on appeal falls within the scope of the waiver. Accordingly, we dismiss Ellerbee\u2019s appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
