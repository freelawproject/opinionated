They both testified that in Iraq they suffered multiple incidents of abuse at the hands of Ba\u2019ath <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>Party officials and \u201cIslamic extremists.\u201d The IJ found their testimony was \u201ccredible and consistent,\u201d and implicitly accepted that they had satisfied their burden of establishing past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The burden thus shifted to the government to establish a change in circumstances in Iraq such that Petitioners would no longer have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(ii). The IJ, however, appears to have placed the burden on Petitioners to establish that their presumption was not rebutted by the fall of Saddam Hussein and the Ba\u2019ath Party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-6\">[F]inding the respondents credible does not end the Court\u2019s inquiry in this case.... [I]n light of the recent fall of Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime, the Court believes that the <em>respondents cannot establish </em>a well-founded fear of future persecution upon their return to Iraq, due to changed country conditions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(A). The security forces that detained the respondent and her husband are no longer in control of the country, nor is the B\u2019ath party that apparently also caused the respondents at least some difficulty, [emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Our case law requires that \u201cthe BIA ... provide an \u2018individualized analysis of how changed conditions will affect the specific petitioner\u2019s situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lopez v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 799, 805 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Borja v. INS, </em>175 F.3d 732, 738 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc)). \u201c \u2018Information about general changes in the country is not sufficient.\u2019\u201d <em>Rios v. Ashcroft, </em>287 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Garrovillas v. INS, </em>156 F.3d 1010, 1017 (9th Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Here, the record contains only a State Department report on Iraq\u2019s pre-2003 human rights abuses, and some newspaper articles that do little more than describe Iraqis\u2019 reactions to the fall of the Hussein regime. Although these articles mention, for example, that some Iraqi-Amerieans are willing to return to Iraq because of the perceived security in the country, they also report that some Iraqi-Amerieans are \u201cworried about the persistent danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">At the hearing, the government called no witnesses, and its closing was a mere five sentences, two of which contained the basic observation that \u201ccountry conditions have changed.\u201d The evidence presented during the hearing and submitted into the record does not provide overwhelming evidence of how the change in country conditions affected <em>these particular </em>Petitioners. Because the IJ stated the incorrect legal standard, we will not assume that he relied on this sparse record to conduct the necessary individualized analysis. Accordingly, we remand to the BIA \u201cto assess whether changed country conditions rebut the presumption based on the proper legal standards including an individualized determination.\u201d <em>Lopez, </em>366 F.3d at 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-11\">Because this error is sufficient to warrant a remand, we decline to reach the other issues presented in the petition for review. We do note, however, that \u201cso much in Iraq has changed since [Petitioners\u2019] final hearing\u201d on July 17, 2003, only four months after Saddam Hussein was removed from power. <em>Hanna v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 933, 939 (9th Cir.2007). While we do not necessarily order the taking of additional evidence, the Board may wish to consider whether Petitioners\u2019 fear of future persecution is objectively reasonable in light of current country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-12\">We GRANT the petition and REMAND to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b570-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
