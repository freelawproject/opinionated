Nelson, which pretermitted his application for asylum and denied his application for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Tashi Tsering, </em>No. A98 694 515 (B.I.A. Apr. 17, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 694 515 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 17, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-22\">As an initial matter, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or its finding of neither changed nor extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Notwithstanding that provision, however, we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Because Tsering has failed to present any constitutional claim or question of law related to the IJ\u2019s finding that his asylum application was time-barred, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s decision insofar as it pretermitted his asylum claim and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>However, we may review his challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of his claims for withholding of removal and relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion finds no error with the IJ\u2019s reasoning or decision, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, the Court will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Here, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s finding that Tsering failed to establish that he was eligible for withholding of removal. Tsering argues that the IJ erred in determining that he did not suffer past persecution in Tibet or Nepal. The BIA has defined persecution as \u201ca threat to the life or freedom of, or the infliction of suffering or harm upon, those who differ in a way regarded as offensive.\u201d <em>Matter of Acosta, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 211, 216 (BIA 1985). This Court has clarified that a valid past persecution claim can be based on harm other than threats to life or freedom, including non-life-threatening violence and physical abuse, <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 n. 3 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 128 (2d Cir.2004)), but the harm must be sufficiently severe, rising above \u201cmere harassment.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">In this case, Tsering testified that his mother had informed him that his father and uncle had been jailed and tortured by the Chinese government in Tibet for following the Dalai Lama. Tsering asserted that he and his mother fled Tibet for Nepal when he was eight years old. Aside from the alleged arrests and torture of his father and uncle, Tsering does not claim that any harm befell him or his mother in Tibet. As Tsering does not claim to have been present when his father or uncle were harmed, or assert that he suffered harm directly flowing from their suffering, the agency properly determined that he failed to establish that he personally suffered past persecution in Tibet. <em>See Tao Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 141-42 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that \u201can asylum applicant cannot claim past persecution based solely on the harm that was inflicted on a family member on account of that family member\u2019s political opinion or other protected characteristic\u201d). <em>But see id. </em>(recognizing that there may exist circumstances where harm to an applicant\u2019s family member in conjunction with other factors may be sufficiently severe to amount to past persecution and noting that such a situation would presumably require that the applicant shared the family member\u2019s characteristic motivating the persecutors, was in the \u201czone of risk,\u201d and suffered some harm following the incident) (citing <em>Jorge-Tzoc v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 146, 150 (2d Cir.2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">As to his assertion that he suffered past persecution in Nepal, Tsering testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>fied that he was arrested on two occasions during demonstrations against China\u2019s presence in Tibet. During his first incarceration, Tsering claimed to have been held for two days and stated that if the prisoners moved around, \u201cthe police would come and beat us ... and if we don\u2019t do anything, then they would do nothing.\u201d He did not testify that he was actually beaten. Regarding his second arrest, Tsering asserted that he was held for seven days and that the authorities \u201cwere not thinking of releasing [him] and they also started talking about returning [him] back to ... Tibet.\u201d However, he was released and went back to work in Nepal. These incidents do not demonstrate that Tsering suffered harm that was sufficiently severe to constitute persecution. <em>See Ivanishvili, </em>433 F.3d at 341. As the IJ properly concluded that Tsering had not suffered past persecution and that he was not entitled to a presumption of a future threat of persecution,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1), the agency reasonably denied Tsering\u2019s withholding of removal claim. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that a withholding claim necessarily fails if the applicant is unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Finally, as to Tsering\u2019s challenge of the IJ\u2019s denial of relief under CAT, Tsering argues that it \u201cdoes not appear\u201d that the IJ considered the background materials on Nepal and Tibet.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Here, after considering the evidence in the record, the IJ found that Tsering failed to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to Nepal or China. Although background materials in the record indicate that the Chinese government\u2019s repression of Tibetan Buddhists can be brutal, Tsering did not allege any circumstances that would allow the IJ to find that he, in particular, is more likely than not to be tortured. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003) (requiring that an alien seeking relief under CAT provide evidence \u201cthat someone in [the alien\u2019s] particular alleged circumstances is <em>more likely than not </em>to be tortured\u201d); <em>see also Pierre v. Gonzales, </em>502 F.3d 109, 118-19 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that beyond evidence of inhumane prison conditions, a CAT claimant must provide some evidence that the authorities act with the specific intent to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering on those detained). Therefore, the IJ reasonably determined that Tsering failed to meet the heavy burden of establishing CAT eligibility. <em>See Mu-Xing Wang, </em>320 F.3d at 143-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. Other than the conclusory statement that his \"testimony shows that [he] faces a serious threat to his life and freedom in Nepal and Tibet,\u201d Tsering has failed to proffer any argument that he demonstrated a likelihood of future persecution independent of his claim that he established a presumption of such a likelihood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b167-12\">. Contrary to the government\u2019s assertion, we find that Tsering has not waived his challenge of the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
