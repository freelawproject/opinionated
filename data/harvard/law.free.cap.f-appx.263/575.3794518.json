We conclude that summary disposition is appropriate with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The regulations provide that a motion to reconsider \u201cshall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior Board decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider where petitioners failed to identify any errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s February 26, 2007 decision affirming the denial of cancellation of removal. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004) (BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider is reviewed for abuse of discretion). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition in part is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Respondent\u2019s unopposed motion to dismiss this petition for review for lack of jurisdiction with respect to petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 601 (9th Cir.2006) (concluding that the court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 denial of motion to reopen for failure to establish a prima facie case if a prior adverse discretionary decision was made by the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">The temporary stay of removal and voluntary departure confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) and <em>Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741 (9th Cir.2004), shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part, DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b597-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
