Jan. 19, 2006). The BIA denied Chen\u2019s motion to reopen finding that it was untimely and that Chen did not qualify for an exception to the timeliness requirement because she had not shown changed circumstances arising in her country of nationality under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). On appeal, Chen argues that she is eligible for the exception to the deadline for filing a motion to reopen on the basis of changed country conditions pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). She argues that evidence she submitted regarding (1) the rigorous enforcement of the Chinese family planning policies; and (2) the birth of her three children in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>United States establishes changed country conditions. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. See <em>Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34 (quoting <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">We initially heard Chen\u2019s petition in tandem with several other petitions and indicated our intention to consolidate the petitions for disposition. We now conclude that Chen\u2019s petition does not raise the same issues as the other petitions and find her petition appropriate for separate disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">As we have previously noted, the birth of additional children constitutes a change of personal circumstances and does not establish changed country conditions required by 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). <em>See Guan v. BIA, </em>345 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir. 2003). In addition, the BIA properly found that the evidence petitioner submitted of strict enforcement of the family planning policies does not establish changed country conditions. <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir.2007). We therefore conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED and the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
