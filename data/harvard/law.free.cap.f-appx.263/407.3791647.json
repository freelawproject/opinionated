Ijemba seeks to challenge a BIA order issued on June 9, 2006, affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) order of removal, construing Ijemba\u2019s challenge to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction based on new evidence as a motion to remand, and denying the motion. Ijemba also seeks to challenge a BIA order issued on August 7, 2006, denying his motion for reconsideration of its prior decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-20\">Ijemba filed his initial petition for review on July 5, 2006, within 30 days of the BIA\u2019s June 9, 2006, order. That petition is properly before this court and vests this court with jurisdiction to consider the June 9, 2006, order. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). Ijemba attempted to. challenge both the June 9 and the August 7, 2006, orders in his brief supporting his July 5 petition for review. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s August 7 denial of Ijemba\u2019s motion for reconsideration because Ijemba did not file a separate and timely petition for review of that decision; he only disputed that decision in his supporting brief. <em>See Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173, 176 (5th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Jaquez-Vega v. Gonzales, </em>140 Fed.Appx. 547 (5th Cir. Aug. 5, 2005) (unpublished)) (recognizing that \u201c \u2018[t]he BIA\u2019s denial of an appeal and its denial of a motion to reconsider are two separate final orders, each of which require their own petitions for review\u2019\u201d); Karim<em>ian-Kaklaki v. INS., </em>997 F.2d 108, 111 (5th Cir.1993). Ijemba filed his second petition for review on December 11, 2006, more than 30 days after either of the BIA\u2019s orders. The Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss that petition for lack of jurisdiction is granted. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Ijemba has not shown that the BIA in its June 9 order erred by construing his challenge to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction based on new evidence as a motion to remand or by rejecting that motion on grounds that apply to motions to reopen. <em>See Ramchandani v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 337, 340 n. 6 (5th Cir.2005) (where circumstances permit, motions to remand and reopen are \u201csubject to the same standards and regulations\u201d); <em>see also Ogbemudia v. INS, </em>988 F.2d 595, 600 (5th Cir.1993) (affirming the BIA\u2019s characterization of plaintiffs motion as a motion to remand and its simultaneous consideration of that motion as a motion to reopen). Nor has Ijemba shown that the BIA abused its discretion in denying the motion to remand. Ijemba argued that the immigration court in Oakdale, Louisiana, lacked jurisdiction to order his removal because the government had already instituted deportation proceedings against him in Phoenix, Arizona. Ijemba failed to explain why he did not present this evidence during his removal proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 601 (rejecting a challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen partially because the new evidence that plaintiff submitted was available when deportation proceedings occurred). Moreover, although Ijemba acknowledges that the commencement of deportation proceedings requires the filing of an order to show cause, he has not shown that an order to show cause was filed in the Phoenix immigration court.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">Finally, we are not persuaded that the BIA erred in affirming the IJ\u2019s order of removal based on his 1991 criminal convictions. Ijemba\u2019s argument that his criminal convictions were not sufficiently final to support a removal order is unavailing. Even if a conviction must be final to support an order of removal\u2014a contention that we have recently questioned<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u2014the BIA did not err in finding that his conviction was final.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Ijemba has not shown that the BIA erred in denying his appeal from the IJ\u2019s order of removal, erred in construing his challenge to the IJ\u2019s jurisdiction as a motion to remand in the nature of a motion to reopen, or abused its discretion in denying that motion. His initial petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">INITIAL PETITION DENIED; MOTION TO DISMISS GRANTED; SECOND PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b430-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b431-6\">. See <em>Moosa v. INS, </em>171 F.3d 994, 1008-09 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b431-7\">. The Ninth Circuit affirmed Ijemba\u2019s conviction on direct appeal. Ijemba argued that the affirmance was unconstitutional because he did not have counsel on appeal. The BIA found that Ijemba had initially requested counsel but then filed a motion with the Ninth Circuit to proceed <em>pro se, </em>which the court granted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
