The parties do not dispute that Serrano-Castillo committed one crime involving moral turpitude, namely, his violation of CahPenal Code \u00a7 472 (forgery or counterfeiting of an official seal). The parties also do not dispute that this forgery violation qualifies as a \u201cpetty offense\u201d under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(ii) because the maximum penalty under \u00a7 472 is one year in prison and Serrano-Castillo\u2019s sentence was only sixteen days in jail. Therefore, under the \u201cpetty offense\u201d exception, Serrano-Castillo is eligible for cancellation of removal if and only if he did not commit a second crime involving moral turpitude.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the principal question is whether Serrano-Castillo\u2019s conviction for violating Cal. Vehicle Code \u00a7 20002 qualifies as a crime involving moral turpitude. To answer this question we apply the analysis set out in <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">In <em>Cerezo v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 1163 (9th Cir.2008), we held that violations of Cal. Vehicle Code \u00a7 20001(a) do not categorically involve moral turpitude. Like \u00a7 20001(a), \u00a7 20002 specifically and by its own terms criminalizes conduct which is not vile, base, or depraved. <em>See Quintero-Salazar v. Keisler, </em>506 F.3d 688, 693 (9th Cir.2007). For instance, \u00a7 20002(a)(2) would punish a driver who, after hitting a parked car, leaves his name and address in a conspicuous place on the parked vehicle but fails to report the incident to the local police department. Put simply, the rationale for our holding in <em>Cerezo </em>applies with equal force to \u00a7 20002. Violations of Cal. Vehicle Code \u00a7 20002 do not categorically involve moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">Ml that can be discerned from Serrano-Castillo\u2019s record of conviction is that he was convicted of violating \u00a7 20002. Therefore, the modified categorical approach does not alter our analysis. <em>See Quintero-Salazar, </em>506 F.3d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">PETITION GRANTED</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> ThiS disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">. Serrano-Castillo was also convicted of driving under the influence, in violation of California Vehicle Code \u00a7 23152(a). The government does not argue that this was a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See In re Lopez-Meza, 22 </em>I. &amp; N. Dec. 1188, 1194 (BIA 1999) (concluding that simple DUI is not a crime involving moral turpitude).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
