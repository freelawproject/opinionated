After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-22\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b840-23\">Mole pled guilty to conspiracy to evade currency reporting requirements by concealing more than $10,000 in United States currency, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 5332(a), (b)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. In his written plea agreement, Mole agreed to forfeit all of the currency seized from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-24\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), Mole and his girlfriend, Anna Ocasio, were stopped for a routine examination by Customs and Bor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>der Protection (\u201cCBP\u201d) Officers at Miami International Airport as they were leaving for Panama. Mole told CBP Officers that he was carrying $4,000 in cash and indicated on a customs form that he was carrying $4,000 and was not transporting more than $10,000. When asked by CBP officers to present all the money he was carrying, Mole produced $9,081 from his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">CBP Officers questioned Ocasio separately. Ocasio told them that she thought she was carrying about $2,000 in cash and that the money was hers. Because she was not exactly sure of the amount of money she was carrying, Ocasio indicated on a customs form that she was <em>carrying </em>$8,000 in cash and was not carrying more than $10,000. When CBP Officers asked Ocasio to present all the money she was carrying, she retrieved approximately $8,000 from her person. She then told CBP Officers that the money was Mole\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Mole confirmed that Ocasio was carrying his money and that he had asked her to do so because he did not want to have to declare more than $10,000. Although Mole stated there was no additional currency in his carry-on luggage, a search of the luggage revealed an additional $36,000. A search of Ocasio\u2019s luggage retrieved another $27,000. The total amount of money carried by Mole and Ocasio was $80,081.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Mole signed a statement in which he admitted having $80,000 in cash on him. Mole indicated that the cash was legitimate money from his business and that he had planned to use it to invest in a condominium in Panama.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">The PSI calculated a base offense level of 14 based on an initial offense level of 6, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(a)(2), and an additional 8 levels because the value of the funds was more than $70,000 but not more than $120,000, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(l)(E). The PSI applied (1) a two-level enhancement for the offense involving bulk cash smuggling, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2S1.3(b)(l)(B), and (2) a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b), which resulted in a total offense level of 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">The PSI also determined that Mole had a criminal history category of I. Mole\u2019s criminal history reflected: (1) a 1997 state court conviction for third-degree grand theft; (2) prior convictions for a municipal ordinance violation and disorderly conduct in which adjudication was withheld with fines and costs in both; (3) arrests for (a) driving under the influence, (b) dealing in stolen property and \u201cvehicle alternate ID/possession,\u201d and (c) resisting an officer; and (4) nine minor traffic convictions. Based on an offense level of 13 and a criminal history category of I, Mole\u2019s advisory guidelines range was twelve to eighteen months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Before sentencing, Mole filed a motion seeking a sentence below the advisory guidelines range because his offense was a victimless crime, his prior encounters with the law were minor, he had a good employment history, and he had made amends by forfeiting his life savings and accepting responsibility for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-12\">At sentencing, Mole\u2019s counsel raised no objections to the PSI or to the guidelines calculation. In addressing Mole\u2019s request for a downward sentencing variance, the district court stated, <em>\u201cI </em>will tell you I guess from the outset that what disturbs me about your request is the criminal history. And so tell me why you believe that despite that a sentence outside of the advisory range is appropriate.\u201d Mole\u2019s counsel responded that this was a victimless regulatory crime and that the money Mole was carrying was \u201clegitimate, honest money\u201d that was intended for a legitimate purpose, not drug money, as is usually the case in these crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>The district judge responded, \u201cOf course, if it were drug money the guidelines would be vastly different. Isn\u2019t there an increase in the guidelines if the money is drug money?\u201d Mole\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is a distinction, sir,\u201d but the prosecutor stated, \u201cThe Court is correct. It would be an enhancement if the money was traceable to drug proceeds.\u201d The probation officer also stated, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Mole spoke on his own behalf and requested leniency because, if imprisoned, he would lose his business and his employees would lose their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Before imposing a sentence, the district court stated that it had considered the statements of all the parties, Mole\u2019s request, the PSI which contained the advisory guidelines, and the statutory factors. The district court determined that the low end of the advisory guidelines provided a reasonable sentence. The district court specifically noted that \u201c[a] factor that weighs heavily in that determination is the criminal history.\u201d The district court sentenced Mole to 12 months and 1 day\u2019s imprisonment and 2 years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">When asked for objections to the court\u2019s fact findings or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced, Mole\u2019s counsel responded, \u201cNone other than the request we made to the Court previously.\u201d Mole timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-7\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under an abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. -,-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Unreasonableness may be procedural or substantive. <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court does not follow the requirements of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), regardless of the actual sentence imposed. <em>Id. </em>For a sentence to be proeedurally reasonable, a district court must correctly calculate the guidelines range and consider the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in determining a reasonable sentence. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[A]n acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient under <em>Booker.\u201d Id. </em>Once we determine that the sentence was proeedurally reasonable, we evaluate the ultimate sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness, considering the totality of the circumstances. Gall, 552 U.S. at -, 128 S.Ct. at 597. The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of showing that a sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>485 F.3d 1264, 1272 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-13\">On appeal, Mole argues that the sentencing judge erred on two grounds. First, Mole contends that the district court erred in not stating that it had considered all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in sentencing. However, \u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1357 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005)). It is sufficient if the district court acknowledges that it has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 832-33 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007). Here, the district court twice stated before imposing its sentence that it had considered the statutory factors. Thus, Mole has not shown that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>the district court erred on this procedural ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Second, Mole contends that the district court sentenced him based on the erroneous view that his advisory guidelines range would have been higher if the money he was transporting was drug money. Mole contends that this was an error by the district court in calculating his advisory guidelines range. However, this does not correctly frame the issue because the district court properly calculated his advisory guidelines range of 12 to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, and Mole has shown no error in that calculation. Instead, at most, Mole\u2019s claim is that the district court based its decision on whether to sentence him below the advisory guidelines range, in part, on a mistaken belief that his guidelines range would have been higher if his currency was related to drug activity. In other words, Mole contends that the district court considered something that was not factually true in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">However, Mole failed to raise an objection on this ground when the district court solicited objections after it imposed its sentence. Thus, we review this issue for plain error and will reverse only if \u201c(1) there is an error; (2) the error is plain; (8) the error affects the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of a judicial proceeding.\u201d <em>United States v. Vance, </em>494 F.3d 985, 993 (11th Cir.2007) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">In its brief on appeal, the government concedes that Mole\u2019s advisory guidelines range would not have been higher if the money Mole was transporting was drug money.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Even assuming that the mistaken belief about the guidelines range for drug activity rose to the level of error that was plain, Mole has not shown that it affected his substantial rights. The record reflects that the district court denied Mole\u2019s motion for a sentence variance based on its concerns about Mole\u2019s criminal history, not its incorrect assumption about the guidelines range for drug activity. Before hearing Mole\u2019s argument on his motion for a sentence variance, the district court stated that \u201cwhat disturbs me about your request is the criminal history.\u201d In determining that a sentence at the bottom of the advisory guidelines range was a reasonable sentence, the district court noted that \u201c[a] factor that weighs heavily in that determination is the criminal history.\u201d Thus, the district court denied the motion for a sentencing variance based on a \u00a7 3553(a) factor\u2014\u201cthe history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1)\u2014not its assumption about the guidelines range for drug activity. Furthermore, the district court explicitly stated that it had considered the statements of the parties and Mole\u2019s request for a sentencing variance, which necessarily included Mole\u2019s argument that his money was from a legitimate source and was intended to be used for a legitimate purpose. In light of these considerations, Mole has not shown that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>procedural error constituted reversible plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b843-7\">. Section 2S1.3(b)(1) of the guidelines provides for a two-level enhancement \"[i]f (A) the defendant knew or believed that the funds were proceeds of unlawful activity, or were intended to promote unlawful activity; or (B) the offense involved bulk cash smuggling.\u201d U.S. S.G. \u00a7 2S 1.3(b)(1). The PSI had already applied a two-level enhancement under this subsection in calculating Mole\u2019s guidelines range because his offense involved \"bulk cash smuggling.\u201d Because this guidelines subsection is written in the disjunctive, it appears that Mole would not have received an additional two-level enhancement if the funds he was carrying were proceeds of unlawful activity or intended to promote unlawful activity, such as activity involving illegal drugs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b844-20\">. Although we conclude that plain error review should apply to this procedural issue, we note that we would reach the same result if we were to apply an abuse-of-discretion standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
