O\u2019Brien, a federal prisoner, filed suit against prison officials under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), alleging that the conditions of his confinement at Federal Correctional Institution (\u201cFCI\u201d)-Marianna violated his rights. O\u2019Brien\u2019s claims arise from an altercation he had with his cellmate on August 15, 2002. In his complaint, O\u2019Brien alleges that prison officials failed to protect him from his cellmate, failed to provide adequate medical treatment after the attack, and violated his due process rights by failing to file his formal grievances (BP-9 forms) with the warden. Because O\u2019Brien\u2019s discovery requests were not calculated to create a genuine issue of material fact, and because O\u2019Brien failed to properly exhaust his available administrative remedies as mandated by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPLRA\u201d), 42 U.S.C.1997e(a), we affirm the district court\u2019s rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">We review the district court\u2019s discovery decisions for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. R &amp; F Props, of Lake County, Inc., </em>433 F.3d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, applying the same standard as the district court and viewing the evidence and all factual inferences drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to O\u2019Brien, the nonmoving party. <em>Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). Likewise, we review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s interpretation of the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement as applied to O\u2019Brien\u2019s claims. <em>See Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">Although O\u2019Brien requested transfer to a new cell several times due to problems with his cellmate, prison officials failed to take action until after O\u2019Brien\u2019s cellmate attacked him on August 15, 2002. As a result of the altercation, O\u2019Brien suffered neck and back injuries. Over the next month, until O\u2019Brien was transferred to a different prison on September 18, 2002, he sought treatment numerous times, but he was unsatisfied with the medical care he received. On September 15, 2002, O\u2019Brien submitted a BP-9 grievance concerning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the denial of his requests to be separated from his cellmate. On September 18, 2002, as he was being transferred out of FCI-Marianna, O\u2019Brien submitted a second BP-9 grievance, this time concerning the lack of adequate medical treatment following the attack. O\u2019Brien has not produced a receipt evidencing either submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">On November 4, 2002, after receiving no response to either grievance, O\u2019Brien wrote to the Administrative Coordinator at FCI-Marianna to check on the status of his grievances. O\u2019Brien attached carbon copies of the text that he had typed on his BP-9s. Iris Basford, the warden\u2019s secretary, responded to O\u2019Brien on November 25, 2002, and informed him that FCI-Marianna had no record of either BP-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">After receiving Ms. Basford\u2019s letter, rather than refile his BP-9 grievances at the institutional level, O\u2019Brien proceeded to the next step of the grievance process by filing two BP-10 grievances with the regional office. The regional office instructed O\u2019Brien to file BP-9 grievances with FCI-Marianna before proceeding to the BP-10 level. Instead of refiling his BP-9s, however, O\u2019Brien filed two BP-11 grievances with the central office. Like O\u2019Brien\u2019s BP-10s, his BP-1 Is were rejected because he had not refiled his BP-9s. After the central office rejected his BP-11s, O\u2019Brien again failed to refile his BP-9s, choosing instead to initiate the instant suit in federal court on January 14, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-7\">Over two years after the commencement of this suit, and after O\u2019Brien had received discoverable information necessary to support his case, Defendants-Appellees moved for summary judgment based, <em>inter alia, </em>on O\u2019Brien\u2019s failure to refile his BP-9s as instructed. At this point, O\u2019Brien sought further discovery, arguing that he needed to locate two prisoners. The district court denied O\u2019Brien\u2019s request for further discovery and granted summary judgment on behalf of Defendants-Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-10\">Having carefully reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, we discern no error regarding the district court\u2019s discovery rulings. On appeal, \u201ca party must be able to show substantial harm to its case from the denial of its requests for additional discovery.\u201d <em>Leigh v. Warner Bros., Inc., </em>212 F.3d 1210, 1219 (11th Cir. 2000). Although Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) allows a party opposing summary judgment to move the court to permit additional discovery,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b29-11\">[t]he party seeking to use rule 56(f) may not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified, facts, but rather he must specifically demonstrate how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant\u2019s showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b29-12\"><em>Reflectone, Inc. v. Farrand Optical Co., </em>862 F.2d 841, 843-44 (11th Cir.1989) (quotations omitted). O\u2019Brien failed to demonstrate that the affidavits he sought from two inmates would create a genuine issue of material fact. The inmates could not provide any information on O\u2019Brien\u2019s attempts to exhaust his available administrative remedies, and O\u2019Brien does not even allege that he ever refiled his BP-9s after receiving Ms. Basford\u2019s letter. Because O\u2019Brien failed to show the relevance of the discovery he sought or how the denial of discovery substantially harmed his case, the district court did not abuse its discretion in limiting discovery and considering the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">We also agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that O\u2019Brien failed to properly exhaust his available administrative remedies, and thus, the district court properly granted summary judgment on O\u2019Brien\u2019s claims that prison officials failed to protect him and failed to provide adequate medical treatment. Under the PLRA, a confined prisoner must exhaust all administrative remedies available before filing a federal action with respect to prison conditions. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). A civil action with respect to \u201cprison conditions\u201d means \u201cany civil proceeding arising under Federal law with respect to the conditions of confinement or the effects of actions by government officials on the lives of persons confined in prison.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3626(g)(2). The mandatory exhaustion requirement in \u00a7 1997e(a) applies to <em>Bivens </em>claims. <em>Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1324 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In deciding whether a prisoner has exhausted his administrative remedies, we do not review the effectiveness of those remedies, but rather whether remedies were available and properly exhausted. <em>Id. </em>at 1328. A prisoner seeking to exhaust remedies must comply with applicable procedures because \u201cno adjudicative system can function effectively without imposing some orderly structure on the course of its proceedings.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 2386, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006); <em>see also Jernigan v. Stuchell, </em>304 F.3d 1030 (10th Cir.2002) (finding that where a grievance submitted to a warden was allegedly lost or misfiled and inmate did not refile with the warden as instructed by the director, the inmate had not exhausted his remedies and was not entitled to file in federal court); <em>Harper v. Jenkin, </em>179 F.3d 1311, 1312 (11th Cir.1999) (holding that filing of an untimely grievance does not properly exhaust a prisoner\u2019s administrative remedies).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-7\">The Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) has established a grievance procedure, which consists of four sequential levels, for prisoner complaints. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 542.10-542.19. First, a prisoner must seek resolution of the issues through informal grievance using Form BP-8. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.13(a). If unsuccessful, a prisoner may then file a BP-9 formal written complaint with the institution within twenty calendar days following the date on which the incident occurred. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.14(a). Next, a prisoner may appeal the institution\u2019s decision by filing a BP-10 grievance with the Regional Director. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.15. Finally, a prisoner may appeal the Regional Director\u2019s response by filing a BP-11 grievance with the central office\u2019s General Counsel for the BOP. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.15(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-9\">Having carefully reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that O\u2019Brien failed to properly exhaust his administrative remedies. In the first instance, concerning O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaints about his requests to change cells, O\u2019Brien filed his BP-9 on September 15, 2002, more than twenty calendar days after the altercation with his cellmate on August 15, 2002. Because O\u2019Brien failed to demonstrate a valid reason for his delay, this filing was untimely under the BOP regulations. Furthermore, despite being put on notice by Ms. Basford that FCI-Marianna had no record of his BP-9 grievances, O\u2019Brien never attempted to refile at the institutional level. Even when BOP officials at each successive level of review instructed O\u2019Brien to refile his BP-9s, O\u2019Brien neglected to do so. Because it is undisputed that O\u2019Brien failed to perfect the filing of his grievances at the institutional level, O\u2019Brien failed to properly exhaust his available ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>ministrative remedies, and the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees on O\u2019Brien\u2019s claims of failure to protect him and failure to provide adequate medical care.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">The district court also properly granted summary judgment on O\u2019Brien\u2019s claim that prison officials violated his due process rights when they failed to deliver his initial BP-9s to the warden. Even assuming O\u2019Brien has a constitutionally protected interest in the grievance procedure, and even assuming prison officials wrongfully failed to file his initial grievances, O\u2019Brien was not denied due process where he had several opportunities to resubmit his BP-9 grievances, but he failed to do so. Thus, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment on O\u2019Brien\u2019s due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-7\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-8\">AFFIRMED<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b28-11\">. Because O\u2019Brien is a <em>pro se </em>litigant, we liberally construe his pleadings. <em>See Sanders v. United States, </em>113 F.3d 184, 187 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b31-19\">.
