Fowler (\u201cFowler\u201d) appeals from an August 21, 2007 final judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d), affirming a July 5, 2005 decision by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) that denied entitlement to service connection for post-traumatic stress disorder. Because Fowler\u2019s arguments on appeal relate to issues over which we do not have jurisdiction, <em>see </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), we <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b894-18\">Our jurisdiction to hear appeals from the Veterans Court is strictly limited to questions of law; we have no jurisdiction to review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). Fowler does not contend that the Veterans Court\u2019s decision involved the validity or interpretation any statute or regulation. Rather, Fowler\u2019s arguments on appeal all relate to alleged errors in the Board\u2019s finding that there was no service connection. Such arguments are directed to factual determinations and the application of law to facts\u2014issues outside the scope of our jurisdiction. Accordingly, because Fowler fails to present an issue over which we have jurisdiction, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-19\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b894-20\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
