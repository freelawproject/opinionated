Holguin contends that the District Court erred in denying her a safety valve reduction which could have prevented the imposition of the mandatory minimum five year imprisonment term. Because we find that Holguin did not truthfully provide the Government with all the information and evidence she had concerning the relevant offense, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">As we write only for the parties, our statement of the facts is brief. On January 13, 2005, a Grand Jury in the District of Delaware charged Holguin and twelve co-defendants in a superseding indictment arising out of a large-scale heroin trafficking conspiracy. Holguin was charged in Count One with conspiracy to distribute more than one kilogram of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846, and in Count Seven with possession with the intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B). Holguin entered into a plea agreement and pled guilty to Count Seven. She asked the court to sentence her without regard for the five year statutory minimum sentence, pursuant to the safety valve provisions in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court determined that Holguin was not eligible for safety valve relief because \u201cthe defendant has not provided the government with all evidence or information regarding the offense of conviction or offenses of a common scheme or plan or same course of conduct,\u201d Appendix (App.) 129, and sentenced Holguin to sixty months imprisonment, four years supervised release, and a special assessment of $100. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">The safety valve provisions were enacted to provide relief to individuals playing minor roles in drug trafficking conspiracies, who lacked the detailed knowledge to qualify for \u201csubstantial assistance\u201d sentence reductions under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). Such a defendant bears the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the safety valve provisions are applicable to his or her case, <em>Sabir, </em>117 F.3d at 754, and application \u201cnot only requires a defendant to admit the conduct charged, but [ ] also imposes an affirmative obligation on the defendant to volunteer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>any information aside from the conduct comprising the elements of the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Dell, </em>247 F.3d 655, 675 (6th Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Unlike other reduction provisions, such as United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3E1.1 (acceptance of responsibility), the safety valve provisions require a defendant to \u201creveal a broader scope of information about the relevant criminal conduct to the authorities.\u201d <em>Sabir, </em>117 F.3d at 753. \u201cThese stringent requirements reflect the fact that the safety valve was intended to benefit only those defendants who truly cooperate.\u201d <em>O\u2019Dell, </em>247 F.3d at 675 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s ultimate refusal to invoke the safety valve provisions, <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>106 F.3d 1140, 1143 (3d Cir.1997), but can reject the District Court\u2019s factual findings that Holguin did not provide the requisite information and evidence only if we conclude that those findings were clearly erroneous. <em>Sabir, </em>117 F.3d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">In this case, there is no dispute that Holguin met the first four factors of Section 3553. The parties disagree on whether Holguin demonstrated that she met the fifth factor by truthfully providing the Government with all evidence she possessed \u201cconcerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). The Government argues that the District Court correctly determined that Holguin did not fulfill her affirmative obligation and burden to demonstrate that she was completely candid in disclosing all information regarding her role and the roles of her co-conspirators in the drug trafficking offense, while Holguin asserts that she fully and completely disclosed all of the relevant information regarding the conspiracy prior to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">Holguin\u2019s sole argument backing her appeal is that she disclosed the identities of all parties she knew to be associated with the drug-trafficking conspiracy and provided the Government with as much information as she could regarding their respective roles in the scheme. In support of this assertion, Holguin points to an exchange between her counsel and DEA Task Force Officer Marilyn Brown at Holguin\u2019s July 28, 2005 detention hearing. Counsel asked the officer if Holguin had \u201cdisclosed her role in the offense\u201d after pleading guilty, and Officer Brown responded in the affirmative. App. 84. On redirect, however, Officer Brown testified that Holguin did not \u201cfully disclose[ ] her interaction with other co-defendants in this case,\u201d nor \u201cfully disclose! ] her understanding of what other co-defendants did in this case, in this offense.\u201d App. 85-86. Thus, Holguin cannot rely on the argument that Officer Brown admitted that Holguin disclosed fully her complete role and the roles of her co-conspirators in the offense. Moreover, the District Court did not base its decision to deny safety valve relief on this testimony, and even acknowledged that the cross-examination of Officer Brown \u201cwas effective in soliciting testimony ... favorable to the defendant\u2019s argument in support of safety valve,\u201d Supplemental Appendix (Supp. App.) 10, before citing other inconsistencies and lack of candor on the part of Holguin to support its denial. For example, the court found that Holguin \u201cdidn\u2019t provide letters that were sent to her by another participant in the criminal activity,\u201d made inconsistent statements to the Government regarding \u201cnot knowing the location or amount of money [involved] and not knowing about some of the details of the location of indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>viduals or recalling] their whereabouts,\u201d and specifically did not disclose the extent of \u201ccontacts and relationship\u201d with involved parties Jose Diaz and Esmerelda Hernandez. Supp. App. 3, 11. These findings were not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Holguin had the burden to demonstrate that she supplied the Government with complete information and persuade the District Court of her candor. <em>Sabir, </em>117 F.3d at 754; <em>see also United States v. Ponce, </em>358 F.3d 466, 468-69 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201ca district court may consider a defendant\u2019s lack of candor in determining eligibility under the safety-valve provision.\u201d). However, she offered no evidence to explain gaps and inconsistencies in her various statements to the Government. To give but one example, at her second proffer session with the Government, Holguin told agents that she had forgotten to bring a cell phone she received from a co-conspirator and letters from another co-conspirator. At the third proffer, however, Holguin claimed she could not find the phone and had discarded the letters. Likewise, Holguin failed to explicate fully her relationship with numerous co-conspirators or provide a consistent explanation of her involvement with the drug-trafficking operation. Thus, we reject Holguin\u2019s contentions that she complied with the safety valve provisions\u2019 requirement that she truthfully provide the Government with all information and evidence she had regarding the drug trafficking offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the sentence imposed on Holguin by the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b242-6\">. \"The safety valve provisions establish that a defendant shall be sentenced pursuant to the sentencing guidelines without regard to any statutory minimum sentence in certain drug offense cases in the event that [] five conditions are met.\u201d <em>United States v.
