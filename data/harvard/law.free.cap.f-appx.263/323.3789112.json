At sentencing, the district court increased Medina\u2019s offense level under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) (2006) and under \u00a7 3C1.2. Medina challenges both enhancements. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cm.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Because Medina withdrew his objection to the enhancement under USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, we review that claim for plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">We find no error with the application of either enhancement. Clearly, the six-level increase under USSG \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) was proper as Medina attempted to run the police officer over with his car. The two-level increase under USSG \u00a7 3C1.2 was proper because Medina drove his car 640 feet after being told to turn it off, jumped over a curb and into a public parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
