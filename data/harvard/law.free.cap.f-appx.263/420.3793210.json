The district court denied Carrothers\u2019s IFP motion and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Carrothers\u2019s appellate pleadings address his financial status and assert that his appeal is not frivolous, but do not identify any error in the district court\u2019s rejection of his claims, which were addressed on the merits and dismissed for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Although pro se briefs are afforded liberal construction, <em>see Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Carrothers\u2019s brief does not address the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissing his claims, this court need not address them. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Therefore, Carrothers has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his appeal would be frivolous. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 224-25. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Carrothers\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal is denied and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Carrothers\u2019s complaint and this court\u2019s dismissal of his appeal count as two strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Carrothers is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will be unable to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b442-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
