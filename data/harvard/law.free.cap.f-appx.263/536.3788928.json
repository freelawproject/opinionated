United States, </em>551 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). In <em>Rita, </em>the Supreme Court held that the \u201cpresumption [of reasonableness] applies only on appellate re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>view.\u201d <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2465. \u201c[T]he sentencing court does not enjoy the benefit of a legal presumption that the Guidelines sentence should apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>After reconsidering Ibarra\u2019s sentence as directed by the Supreme Court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Ibarra appealed the sentence pronounced by the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after his plea of guilty to possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A). The district court sentenced Ibarra to 108 months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence at the lower end of his advisory sentencing guidelines range of 108 to 135 months. This court affirmed the sentence. Further discussion of the underlying facts in this matter may be found at <em>United States v. Ibarra, </em>220 Fed.Appx. 454 (8th Cir.), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 487, 169 L.Ed.2d 336 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">At sentencing, the district court discussed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and also stated that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range was presumptively reasonable. Ibarra did not object to the district court\u2019s presumption. Therefore, we now review Ibarra\u2019s sentence for plain error. <em>See United States v. Pirani, </em>406 F.3d 543, 550 (8th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Under plain error review, the defendant has the burden of proof. <em>Id. (citing United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). He must prove that there was \u201c(1) error, (2) that [was] plain, and (3) that affect[ed] substantial rights. If all three conditions are met, an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997)). The district court committed error by stating that an advisory guidelines sentence was presumptively reasonable. The error is plain at this time. <em>Id. </em>However, this error did not affect substantial rights and was not prejudicial to Ibarra because the record does not show \u201creasonable probability that he would have received a more favorable sentence\u201d without the presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 551. The district court thoroughly discussed the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before it sentenced Ibarra. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-13\">It is certainly appropriate that I consider Mr. Ibarra\u2019s past and his activities, and the record that I have indicates that it was of being a fine citizen, a contributor to his community ... [but] the court must also consider the nature of the offense.... [Distribution of cocaine, particularly significant amounts of cocaine, is a very serious offense and an extreme problem to society....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-14\">It seems to me that, under the circumstances of this case, what really drives this case is the seriousness of the offense, the amount of cocaine involved, the absence of any criminal record in the past, and all of those things are specifically addressed in the guideline calculation, particularly with the application of the safety valve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-15\">I conclude that the guideline sentencing system adequately addresses the circumstances of this case and that the sentencing guideline range is a reasonable range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-16\">Due to the seriousness of the offense and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(6), the district court determined that \u201cthe sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>tenting guideline range is a reasonable range.\u201d With this proper analysis of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the district court\u2019s determination that the guidelines range constituted a reasonable range, we are convinced that Ibarra cannot carry his burden of showing that he would have received a lesser sentence in the absence of the district court\u2019s erroneous presumption. Accordingly, we affirm Ibarra\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b559-10\">. The Honorable James E.
