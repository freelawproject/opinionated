Burl petitions for review oL the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) that dismissed as untimely his appeal from the decision of the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cagency\u201d) denying his discrimination complaint. <em>Burl v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>AT-0752-07-0579-I-1, 107 M.S.P.R. 180 (M.S.P.B. Sept 10, 2007). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">Mr. Burl received the decision of the agency denying his discrimination complaint on September 30, 2002. Pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.154(b)(1), if Mr. Burl wished to appeal that decision to the Board, he was required to do so by October 30, 2002. However, Mr. Burl did not appeal to the Board until April 7, 2007, well over four years later. The Board dismissed Mr. Burl\u2019s appeal after it determined that he had failed to show good cause for his delay in filing, as required by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.22(c). This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health and Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">On appeal, as was the ease before the Board, Mr. Burl makes no attempt to demonstrate good cause for the lengthy delay in the filing of his appeal to the Board. Rather, he argues matters that are pertinent only to the merits of his challenge to the agency\u2019s decision on his discrimination complaint. However, these matters are in no way relevant to the issue of whether there was good cause for Mr. Burl\u2019s untimely filing before the Board. In short, Mr. Burl has given us no reason to disturb the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board dismissing Mr. Burl\u2019s appeal as untimely is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
