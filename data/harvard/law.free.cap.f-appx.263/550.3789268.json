Because there was no error in any of these respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-12\">I. Motions to Substitute Counsel and Withdraw Guilty Plea</p>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">After an evidentiary hearing\u2014 wherein both Bride and his attorney explained the apparent conflict created by the attorney\u2019s continued representation\u2014 the district court denied Bride\u2019s motion to substitute counsel. We review such denials for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Musa, </em>220 F.3d 1096, 1102 (9th Cir.2000). Bride argues that the district court abused its discretion by failing to conduct an adequate inquiry into his complaint. <em>See id. </em>We disagree. The evidentiary hearing transcript reveals that the hearing, while brief, provided the district court with a \u201csufficient basis for reaching an informed decision.\u201d <em>United States v. McClendon, </em>782 F.2d 785, 789 (9th Cir.1986); <em>cf. Musa, </em>220 F.3d at 1102; <em>United States v. Torres-Rodriguez, </em>930 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">Moreover, the attorney\u2019s continuing representation did not prevent Bride from adequately presenting the argument he contends was made more difficult by his attorney\u2019s continued representation. <em>See Musa, </em>220 F.3d at 1103. At the ex parte hearing, Bride articulately explained to the district court that he felt pressured into signing the plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That the district court was ultimately unpersuaded does not mean that Bride was somehow prevented from adequately presenting this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-15\">For similar reasons, the district court also did not abuse its discretion in denying Bride\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>428 F.3d 802, 805 (9th Cir.2005). To the extent Bride contends he should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>allowed to withdraw his guilty plea because he was pressured into entering it (the only argument Bride sufficiently presents on appeal),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the district court heard ample information from Bride and his attorney\u2014both at the ex parte hearing and at the sentencing hearing\u2014regarding this subject, and employed a proper legal standard when denying Bride\u2019s request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">II. Counts 8 and 9</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Bride argues that the court should reverse his two convictions for being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition because the facts he admitted in his plea agreement do not support these convictions. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3) (requiring a factual basis for a guilty plea). This argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Murillo, </em>422 F.3d 1152, 1155 (9th Cir.2005) (under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), a crime is \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d if the <em>statutory maxi</em>mum\u2014not the state sentencing guidelines maximum\u2014for that crime exceeds one year).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">III. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">Although we have jurisdiction to consider Bride\u2019s three sentencing-related arguments on appeal because they all allege imposition of his sentence \u201cin violation of law,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a), we reject each of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">First, the court did not err in failing to resolve a number of disputed facts contained in Bride\u2019s pre-sentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Because the court was bound by the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement to impose the nineteen-year sentence it imposed, the facts contained in the PSR remained relevant <em>only </em>insofar as they might affect the conditions under which Bride will serve his sentence. As this court recently held in <em>United States v. Saeteurn, </em>504 F.3d 1175, 1180-81 (9th Cir.2007), district courts are permitted to\u2014but not required to\u2014resolve factual disputes relating only to a defendant\u2019s \u201cservice of sentence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-12\">Second, the district court did not deprive Bride of his right of allocution. Assuming, without deciding, that a defendant being sentenced pursuant to a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement retains some right of allocution, <em>see United States v. Mukai, </em>26 F.3d 953, 956 (9th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>953 F.2d 461, 468 (9th Cir.1991), the district court afforded Bride that right here by addressing him personally and permitting him to speak on his own behalf before his sentence was imposed. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii). The district judge\u2019s comments at the ex parte hearing that the court was <em>inclined </em>to accept the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement and impose the binding sentence therein did not amount to a decision actually imposing that sentence. <em>Compare United States v. Mack, </em>200 F.3d 653, 658 (9th Cir.2000). Rather, the sentencing transcript reveals that the district court \u201clistened] and [gave] careful and serious consideration\u201d to Bride\u2019s allocution before making its final sentencing decision. <em>Id., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number><em>quoted in United States v. Gunning, </em>401 F.3d 1145, 1147-48 (9th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Third, the district court did not sentence Bride before considering the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Again, Bride\u2019s sentence was not imposed until the end of the sentencing hearing, at which point the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before sentencing Bride to nineteen years imprisonment, as it was then required to do. <em>See Mulcai, </em>26 F.3d at 956. This sentence was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b573-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b573-16\">. Bride's attorney also made this argument, both at the ex parte hearing and at the hearing regarding Bride\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">. <em>See United States v. Kama, </em>394 F.3d 1236, 1238 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-10\">. When the purported reason for withdrawal relates to the voluntariness of the plea at the time it was entered\u2014as opposed to \u201cnewly discovered evidence, intervening circumstances, or any other reason ... that did not exist when the defendant entered his plea,\" <em>see United States v. Ortega-Ascanio, </em>376 F.3d 879, 883 (9th Cir.2004)\u2014the standard for permitting withdrawal is exactly the same as the standard for finding the plea invalid. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>401 F.3d 1008, 1012 (9th Cir.2005). The district court thus did not err in using the \"knowing and voluntary\u201d standard when evaluating this purported reason for withdrawal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b575-17\">. The district court expressly \"affordfed] everybody [including Bride] an opportunity to speak their peace with regard to the appropriate disposition\u201d <em>after </em>accepting the Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement but <em>before </em>imposing sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
