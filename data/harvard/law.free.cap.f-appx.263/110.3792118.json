We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Appellant first contends that the sentencing judge erred in failing to grant a downward departure for duress, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.12. \u201c[A] refusal to downwardly depart is generally not appealable.\u201d <em>United States v. Valdez, </em>426 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir.2005). The only exceptions occur \u201cwhen a sentencing court misapprehended the scope of its authority to depart or the sentence was otherwise illegal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, this Court applies \u201ca presumption that district judges understand the much-discussed processes by which they may, in circumstances permitted by law, exercise discretion to depart from the sentence range prescribed by the Guidelines calculus.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>98 F.3d 690, 694 (2d Cir.1996) (per curiam). \u201cThis presumption is overcome only in the rare situation where the record provides a reviewing court with clear evidence of a substantial risk that the judge misapprehended the scope of his departure authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The transcript of the sentencing proceedings makes clear that Judge Preska understood the scope of her authority to depart, and, indeed, she cited our Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Cotto, </em>347 F.3d 441, 445-46 (2d Cir.2003), to describe the scope of her departure authority. Her discretionary decision not to depart downward is therefore not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Appellant also asserts that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. We review sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Appellant\u2019s forty-eight month sentence was already well below the Guidelines range, and we do not think that Judge Preska abused her discretion in not departing further.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
