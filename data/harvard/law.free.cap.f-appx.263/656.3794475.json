We dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-21\">Leniear contends that he received ineffective assistance of counsel in conjunction with his change of plea, sentencing, and his request to file a notice of appeal, and seeks a remand pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). The government contends that Leniear knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-22\">We cannot review Leniear\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal because the record is not sufficiently developed and accordingly we \u201ccannot now conclude that [Leniear] has shown that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>plea agreement, which included an unequivocal waiver of his appeal rights, was involuntary and unenforceable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Jeronimo, </em>398 F.3d 1149, 1156 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AQq\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
