FLETCHER, CANBY, and RAWLINSON, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b638-20\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b638-21\">Appellant Sandra Stickney (Stickney) challenges the district court\u2019s ruling that a transmutation of residential property interests from community property to tenancies in common constituted a fraudulent transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-22\">Although it appears that the district court\u2019s ruling on the merits was supported by the record, the district court lacked jurisdiction because Stickney failed to establish that \u201c[her] action falls within an unequivocally expressed waiver of sovereign immunity ...\u201d <em>Dunn &amp; Black, P.S. v. United States, </em>492 F.3d 1084, 1088 (9th Cir.2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-23\">1. The district court lacked jurisdiction over Stickney\u2019s quiet title action brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410. <em>See Dunn &amp; Black, </em>492 F.3d at 1092 n. 9 (\u201c[A] plaintiff cannot seek relief for monies or property already in the hands of the IRS in a \u00a7 2410 quiet title action.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-24\">2. The district court also lacked jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7433, which applies only to the direct taxpayer and not to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>third parties such as Stickney. <em>See Allied/Royal Parking L.P. v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 1000, 1003 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">3. For the same reason, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7432 did not confer jurisdiction. <em>See Soghomonian v. United States, </em>82 F.Supp.2d 1134, 1143 (ED.Cal.1999); <em>cf. Allied/Royal Parking, </em>166 F.3d 1000 at 1003.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">4. Finally, jurisdiction was lacking under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7426, as Stickney\u2019s action did not involve a wrongful levy or a substituted fund. <em>See Sessler v. United States, </em>7 F.3d 1449, 1451-52 (9th Cir.1993) (\u201c[Election 7426 is not a broad grant of jurisdiction for suit brought by any third-party interest-holder; it only waives immunity when there\u2019s been a wrongful levy.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Williams, </em>514 U.S. 527, 537-38, 115 S.Ct. 1611, 131 L.Ed.2d 608 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">VACATED and REMANDED for dismissal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b638-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
