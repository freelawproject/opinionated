Hon. Lewis A. Kaplan, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b196-19\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b196-20\">Ethan Book Jr. appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (Arterton, J.) granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss his complaint and from an order of the same court denying his motion for reconsideration and other motions. We assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The district court correctly dismissed Book\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which applies when one who has lost in state court brings an action in federal court \u201ccomplaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). \u201c[A] party losing in state court is barred from seeking what in substance would be appellate review of the state judgment in a United States district court, based on the losing party\u2019s claim that the state judgment itself violates the loser\u2019s federal rights.\u201d <em>Johnson v. De Grandy, </em>512 U.S. 997, 1005-06, 114 S.Ct. 2647, 129 L.Ed.2d 775 (1994). Moreover, defendants are entitled to absolute immunity, because them actions were performed in their judicial capacities and not in the clear absence of all jurisdiction. <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356-60, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978); <em>Tucker v. Outwater, </em>118 F.3d 930, 932-33 (2d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Furthermore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Book\u2019s motions for reconsideration of its dismissal of his complaint, for reconsideration of its denial of his motion to supplement, and to reopen judgment, because Book pointed to no controlling decisions or data that the court had overlooked. <em>Shrader v. CSX Transp., Inc., </em>70 F.3d 255, 257 (2d Cir.1995). Nor was it an abuse of discretion to deny Book\u2019s motion for leave to amend his complaint. \u201cA district court may properly deny a motion to amend when it finds that amendment would be futile,\u201d <em>Patane v. Clark, </em>508 F.3d 106, 113 n. 6 (2d Cir.2007) (citing <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962)), and the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that any amendment of Book\u2019s complaint would be futile for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">Finally, to the extent that Book appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to \u201cvoid defendants\u2019 appearance,\u201d which the district court construed as a request to disqualify defense counsel, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Book\u2019s complaint and its order on motions. All outstanding motions are DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
