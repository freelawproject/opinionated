Pursuant to a plea agreement, the government dismissed an additional charge that Williams was a felon in possession of a firearm, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g), and did not pursue any penalty enhancement for his prior convictions, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851. The district court found that the applicable guidelines range for Williams\u2019s offense was 121-151 months\u2019 imprisonment, but after considering the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court imposed a sentence of 120 months, the mandatory minimum by statute, <em>see </em>\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Williams filed a notice of appeal, but counsel now moves to withdraw because he cannot discern a non-frivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Williams to respond to counsel\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), but he has not done so. Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, so we limit our review to the potential issues it identifies. <em>See United States v. Schuh, </em>289 F.3d 968, 973-74 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-20\">Counsel first considers whether Williams could challenge the voluntariness of his guilty plea. Counsel is correct, however, that he cannot proceed to consider such a challenge because, after discussing the appeal with Williams, Williams did not ask counsel to pursue the argument in light of its associated risks. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-71 (7th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we examine it no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-21\">Counsel also correctly determines that any challenge to the reasonableness of Williams\u2019s sentence would be frivolous. At sentencing, Williams advanced a policy argument against the then\u2014applicable 100:1 crack-to-powder cocaine ratio, and he argued that the mandatory minimum of 120 months was adequate punishment for his offense. Williams did not otherwise dispute the calculation of his applicable guidelines range. After a thorough review of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court gave Williams the sentence he asked for\u2014 120 months\u2014which was one month below the guidelines range. The court was free to impose a sentence below the guidelines range based upon Williams\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a) arguments, including his policy arguments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>provided they showed that his guidelines sentence was greater than necessary. <em>See Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 573-74, 575-76, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). But the district court was not free to go below the mandatory minimum sentence provided by statute, and therefore the district court\u2019s sentence cannot be unreasonably high when the court was not empowered to impose a lesser term. <em>See United States v. Cannon, </em>429 F.3d 1158, 1160-61 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Lee, </em>399 F.3d 864, 866 (7th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
