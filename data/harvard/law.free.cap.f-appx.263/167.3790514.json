Schoppert, which denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Weng, Hong Ping </em>No. A97 949 286 (B.I.A. Oct. 25, 2005), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 949 286 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 27, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">When the BIA does not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wcmgchuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-14\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. Weng\u2019s testimony about his \u201cengagement party\u201d was inconsistent with his statement at his credible fear interview that it was a \u201cwedding party.\u201d Although Weng challenges the reliability of the credible fear interview, we find that even under the standards for airport interviews in <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169 (2d Cir.2004), the record was sufficiently reliable to support an adverse credibility find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 179. Weng argued before the BIA that the terms \u201cwedding party\u201d and \u201cengagement party\u201d were ambiguous. Although the BIA did not evaluate this argument, it is appropriate to presume that it considered and reasonably rejected this explanation. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 n. 17 (2d Cir.2006) (stating that an IJ need not \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each and every one of [an applicant\u2019s] purported explanations for testimonial inconsistencies or evidentiary gaps\u201d). This discrepancy was central to Weng\u2019s claim that his girlfriend was subjected to a forced abortion because she and he were not married. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">The record also supports the IJ\u2019s finding regarding the fine allegedly levied against Weng due to his girlfriend\u2019s pregnancy. Although Weng testified that he was fined and that his mother paid the fine, neither Weng\u2019s written application nor a letter from his mother contains this information. Such omissions, which \u201cgo to a heart of an applicant\u2019s claim[,] can form the basis for an adverse credibility determination.\u201d <em>See Cheng Tong Wang v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 451, 453 (2d Cir.2006). The record also reflects the IJ\u2019s observation of a discrepancy between Weng\u2019s statement in his credible fear interview that he was told of the fine when he went to the \u201cMarriage office\u201d and his testimony that his parents were told to pay the fine when they went to the \u201cfamily planning office.\u201d Because, as noted, the issue of whether Weng was fined went to the heart of his claim, the IJ appropriately based his adverse credibility determination on this discrepancy. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Additionally, it was appropriate for the IJ to determine that, \u201c[i]n view of\u2019 his adverse credibility determination and given that they were not authenticated, Weng\u2019s documentary evidence was not due any weight. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 342 (finding that the weight accorded to an applicant\u2019s evidence lies largely within the discretion of the IJ).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, supported by substantial evidence, was a proper basis for the denial of Weng\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). As such, we need not reach the IJ\u2019s alternative burden of proof findings. Moreover, because Weng did not raise his CAT claim in his brief to this Court, we deem that claim waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005)</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\">. Although the record contains Weng\u2019s paraphrased (rather than transcribed) remarks, the interview was conducted in Mandarin and Weng did not indicate that he had any trouble understanding the interpreter. Moreover, the questions asked were designed to elicit the details of an asylum claim. <em>See Ramsameachire, </em>357 F.3d at 180.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\">. We need not consider whether the IJ\u2019s findings with respect to Weng's Falun Gong claim were flawed. Adequate findings regarding Weng's family planning claim are\u2018sufficient to support the IJ\u2019s overall adverse credibility finding where the two claims where factually intertwined: Weng claimed that he fled to his friend's home after a confrontation with family planning officials regarding his girlfriend\u2019s pregnancy, and that it was his friend who invited him to a Falun Gong demonstration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
