A law enforcement officer discovered the methamphetamine in question on Young\u2019s person while executing a search warrant. Young moved to suppress this evidence, arguing that a search of her person was beyond the scope of the warrant. The district court denied this motion. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-21\">During an ongoing narcotics investigation, Officer Brett Miller of the Taylorsville, Utah police department learned from a confidential informant (Cl) that Young was involved in methamphetamine distribution. The Cl said that he had purchased methamphetamine from Young at her apartment, and that he had also seen Young travel to other locations to conduct narcotics transactions. The Cl claimed that Young would personally transport the narcotics to these locations, and that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>doing so, Young would conceal' them on her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">After receiving this information, Officer Miller arranged two controlled buys of methamphetamine at Young\u2019s apartment. During these controlled buys, Officer Miller observed the Cl enter Young\u2019s apartment without drugs on his person and leave with bags containing methamphetamine. The informant indicated that during these buys, he observed larger quantities of methamphetamine in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Officer Miller prepared an affidavit in support of a warrant application and applied for a search warrant. His affidavit related the information he received from the Cl concerning prior drug transactions, as well as his own knowledge concerning the two controlled buys. Based on this affidavit, a judge of the Utah state district court issued a search warrant on October 31, 2005. In pertinent part, the warrant stated that there was probable cause to believe that evidence of narcotics distribution would be found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">... (X) in the premises known as: 4696 S Sunstone Road apartment 199, which is further described as being located in a multi family apartment building. The apartment is on the third floor and the door faces to the west, the numbers 199 are visible above the door and the numbers 4696 are displayed on the front of the building. To include all rooms, attics, basements, and other parts therein, the surrounding grounds, any garages, storage rooms, storage areas and trash containers of any kind located thereon where articles of evidence may reasonably be concealed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-10\">... on the persons known as: Amber Tempest Young, a Caucasian female, approximately 5'10\" and 189 pounds, with blonde/strawberry hair and blue eyes, with a birth date of February 20th, 1981....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-11\">Search &amp; Seizure Warrant, Aplt. Br., Appx. E, at 1. The command line of the warrant, however, stated only that \u201cYOU ARE THEREFORE COMMANDED ... to make a search of the above-named premises.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-12\">The following day, Officer Miller executed the warrant by stopping Young while she was driving on the freeway, several miles from the apartment described in the warrant. Officer Miller proceeded to search Young, and discovered 30 grams of methamphetamine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-13\">On February 1, 2006, a grand jury indicted Young for, among other things, possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1). Young moved to suppress the drugs discovered during the search of her person. In her motion, Young argued that the thrust of the warrant was to permit a search of her apartment, and that the warrant permitted law enforcement officers to search her person only if she was at, or in close proximity to, her apartment. She specifically stated that she was not challenging \u201cthe probable cause finding or the facial validity of the warrant.\u201d Memo, in Supp. of Mot. to Suppress, Vol. I, Doc. 35, at 4. As a result, Young argued that the \u201cgood faith\u201d exception to the exclusionary rule in <em>United States v. Leon, </em>468 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>897, 920, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984), did not apply because she was challenging only Officer Miller\u2019s execution of the warrant as exceeding the scope of the warrant, and not the warrant\u2019s validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">The district court denied Young\u2019s motion. In so doing, the court found that the language of the warrant authorized a search of Young away from her apartment. The court further held that while the ambiguity of the warrant\u2019s language \u201craise[d] questions about the validity of the warrant,\u201d Officer Miller executed the warrant in good faith, making it unnecessary to suppress the methamphetamine seized. Order &amp; Memo. Decision, Aplt. Br., Appx. C, at 4-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">Following the court\u2019s ruling on her motion to suppress, Young pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. As a part of the plea agreement, she reserved the right to appeal the denial of her motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and we accept the district court\u2019s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. McKerrell, </em>491 F.3d 1221, 1224-25 (10th Cir.2007). We review the ultimate determination of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">On appeal, Young argues that the district court erred in denying her motion to suppress for two reasons. First, she argues that the court erred in determining that the warrant authorized a search of her person at a place other than the apartment named in the warrant. Second, she argues that the court erred in holding that, even if the warrant was invalid for some reason, the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">a. <em>Scope of the Warrant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Search warrants must \u201cparticularly describ[e] the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. Young does not challenge the validity of the warrant, or argue that it does not describe the places to be searched or things to be seized with particularity. Instead, she contends that the search of her person was beyond the scope of the warrant. Specifically, she claims that her person was not \u201cparticularly described\u201d in the warrant as one of the places to be searched, and that the warrant only authorized a search of her person if she was at, or in close proximity to, the apartment named in the warrant. The government disputes this interpretation of the warrant and argues the district court\u2019s more expansive view of the scope of the warrant is the correct reading. The scope of a search warrant is a question of law that we review <em>de novo. United States v. Angelos, </em>433 F.3d 738, 745 (10th Cir.2006). The scope of a warrant is determined using \u201ca standard of practical accuracy rather than technical precision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Ortega-Jimenez, </em>232 F.3d 1325, 1328 (10th Cir.2000)). Such a \u201cpractical reading\u201d of the warrant is permissible if a warrant\u2019s terms are disputed, as they are here. <em>Id. </em>at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">The district court concluded that the warrant \u201cpurported on its face to authorize a search of Ms. Young separate and apart from her apartment.\u201d Order &amp; Memo. Decision, Aplt. Br., Appx. C, at 6. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on the two paragraphs in the warrant stating that there was probable cause to search the apartment and to search Young. Because no language in these paragraphs \u201cexpressly conditioned the permission to search [Young] on [her] presence\u201d at the apartment, the court concluded that no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>such condition existed, thereby distinguishing the cases on which Young relied. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Neither the parties nor the district court specifically addressed the command line of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">On appeal, Young contends that \u201cthe warrant clearly only command[ed] a search of Ms. Young\u2019s residence.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 14. She concedes that the warrant stated that there was probable cause to believe that contraband or evidence of a crime would be found on her person. However, she now points to the warrant\u2019s command line, which only authorized the searching officer \u201cto make a search of the above-named <em>'premises.\u201d </em>Search &amp; Seizure Warrant, Aplt. Br., Appx. E, at 2 (emphasis added). According to Young, because \u201c[t]he plain meaning of premises does not include someone\u2019s person,\u201d the warrant cannot reasonably be construed to permit a search of her person apart from her residence. Aplt. Br. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">When the warrant is read in its entirety, we agree that the search of Young\u2019s person was beyond the scope of the warrant. In both popular and legal usage, the term \u201cpremises\u201d refers to real property, not persons. <em>See </em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 1789 (1993) (definition of \u201cpremise\u201d); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1180-81 (6th ed. 1990) (\u201cThe term [\u201cpremises\u201d] as used in a search warrant includes land, buildings, and appurtenances thereto.\u201d). In addition, the warrant itself uses the term \u201cpremises\u201d to refer specifically to Young\u2019s apartment; Young, by comparison, is referred to as a \u201cperson\u201d earlier in the warrant. <em>See </em>Search &amp; Seizure Warrant, Aplt. Br., Appx. E, at 1. Particularly when viewed in light of this cross-reference, we believe that the term \u201cpremises\u201d in the command line refers to Young\u2019s apartment, and not to Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">We acknowledge the possibility that the use of the term \u201cpremises\u201d in the command line was boilerplate, and that the omission of Young from the command line was a mere oversight on the part of the Utah judge. We are hesitant to place too great an emphasis on the command line of the warrant, standing alone, which threatens to value technical precision over practical accuracy. <em>Cf. Angelos, </em>433 F.3d at 745. We therefore reaffirm that in reviewing a warrant, we should and do take into account <em>all </em>parts of the warrant. <em>United States v. Callwood, </em>66 F.3d 1110, 1113 (10th Cir.1995). Our reading of the command line as permitting only a search of the apartment, however, is strengthened by reference to the affidavit Officer Miller submitted to the magistrate judge. <em>See United States v. Ortega-Jimenez, </em>232 F.3d 1325, 1329 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201c[A]n affidavit ... may be used to clarify with \u2018practical accuracy\u2019 the meaning of a disputed term in a warrant when the same person is both affiant and executing officer.\u201d). As the district court recognized, \u201cthe facts submitted to the magistrate in support of Officer Miller\u2019s request for a warrant to search Ms. Young are sparse.\u201d Order &amp; Memo. Decision, Aplt. Br., Appx. C, at 5. While Officer Miller\u2019s Cl claimed that he had both purchased methamphetamine from Young and observed Young travel to other locations to conduct narcotics transactions, the only information that Officer Miller\u2019s subsequent investigation corroborated was that narcotics transactions took place at Young\u2019s apartment. Based on this fact, it is entirely plausible that the magistrate judge who issued the warrant did not find probable cause to search Young apart from her apartment, and that the omission of Young\u2019s person from the command line was intentional.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">We therefore conclude that the warrant permitted no more than a search of the apartment, and that the search of Young <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>several miles away from her apartment exceeded the scope of the warrant. For purposes of this appeal, we need not address the hypothetical question of whether Young could have been searched at her apartment, had her apartment been searched pursuant to the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The government argues that we should not address Young\u2019s command-line argument (that the search of Young\u2019s person exceeded the scope of the command line) because Young did not specifically raise this argument before the district court. Young admittedly focused her argument before the district court on the more ambiguous part of the warrant, the section describing where evidence was likely to be found. That Young did not focus more attention on the command line does give us some pause. However, the ultimate issue before the district court was the same issue now presented on appeal: whether the search of Young\u2019s person exceeded the scope of the authority given by the <em>warrant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">Before the district court, Young clearly articulated the basis of her objection to the search, which was that the warrant only authorized a search of her apartment and not her person. She argued that if the warrant authorized a search of her person, it only did so if she was at or close to her apartment. The warrant in this case is not particularly complex or confusing. It consists of only two pages and a one-page addendum. We see no way to construe the warrant without considering the command line.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It would require a hypertechnical reading of Young\u2019s arguments before the district court to conclude that Young has waived any argument based on the command line. The question presented to the district court was whether the search of Young\u2019s person exceeded the scope of the warrant\u2014and the proper construction of the command line, as a part of the warrant, was properly presented to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">\n<em>b. Good Faith Exception</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">The district court, having found that the search warrant permitted a search of Young apart from her apartment, harbored doubts about the warrant\u2019s validity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court thus proceeded to consider whether the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule applied. Under this exception, exclusion of evidence is not an appropriate remedy \u201cwhere an officer acting with objective good faith has obtained a search warrant from a judge or magistrate and acted within its scope, even though the search warrant was later deemed to be invalid.\u201d <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>444 F.3d 1238, 1249 (10th Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Leon, </em>468 U.S. at 920, 104 S.Ct. 3405). However, if a warrant has been improperly executed, the good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>exception will not save the ensuing search. <em>Id.-, see also United States v. Medlin, </em>798 F.2d 407, 410 (10th Cir.1986) (explaining that the rationale for the exclusionary rule is deterrence of police misconduct, and that \u201c[u]nlike cases in which the police properly execute an invalid warrant that they reasonably thought was valid, in cases of improper execution there is police conduct that must be deterred.\u201d). Because the validity of the warrant is not challenged in this case, and because we have concluded that the warrant did not authorize the search of Young\u2019s person, we also conclude that <em>Leon\u2019s </em>good faith exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">The government contends that we should remand to the district court for further factfinding \u201con the alternative grounds for affirmance that could be raised by the United States.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. at 7. The government argues that on remand, the district court could determine (1) whether the warrant incorporated the warrant affidavit; and (2) whether the search was justifiable as either a search incident to arrest, or as a <em>Terry </em>stop and frisk. The government relies on cases providing that \u201c[w]hen the record from the district court is inadequate, leaving the court of appeals unable to resolve an issue, remand is an appropriate alternative remedy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8 (citing <em>United States v. Olivares-Rangel, </em>458 F.3d 1104, 1113 (10th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Ramstad, </em>219 F.3d 1263, 1265 (10th Cir.2000)). However, a closer examination of those cases reveals that in both, the issue for which there was an insufficient record was actually raised in the original proceeding. This authority does not support the proposition that we may remand in order to permit the government to make entirely new arguments in support of the district court\u2019s ruling. We therefore respectfully decline the government\u2019s invitation to remand this case to the district court for further factfinding.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">We REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial of Young\u2019s motion to suppress and REMAND for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">IN THE THIRD DISTRICT COURT, WEST JORDAN DIVISION IN AND FOR SALT LAKE COUNTY, STATE OF UTAH</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT No.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">COUNTY OF SALT LAKE, STATE OF UTAH</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">To any peace officer in the State of Utah.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">Proof by Affidavit under oath having been made this day before me by Detective Brett Miller, I am satisfied that there is probable cause to believe.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">That (X) in the premises known as: 4696 S Sunstone Road apartment 199, which is further described as being located in a multi family apartment building.

For this reason, the primary case cited by the government, <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>783 F.2d 971 (10th Cir.1986), is inapposite. In <em>Mitchell, </em>the defendant argued before the trial court that evidence should be suppressed because the officers who executed the warrant did not give adequate warning before breaking and entering the premises. <em>Id. </em>at 973. On appeal, the defendant renewed that argument, and also made the entirely new argument that the search exceeded the scope of the warrant. <em>Id. </em>Young, by contrast, has made essentially the same argument.
