BALDOCK, United States Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b746-18\">Defendant Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) is a private Maryland corporation under contract with the United States Marshals Service to detain and house federal prisoners. Plaintiff Wesley Purkey, a federal prisoner formerly held at CCA\u2019s facility in Leavenworth, Kansas, instituted this suit in federal court against CCA and various CCA employees. Purkey\u2019s Amended \u201cPetition\u201d (Complaint) states multiple <em>Bivens </em>claims for alleged violations of his constitutional rights, as well as one pendant state law tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-19\">In the district court, Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss. The district court concluded Purkey failed to prove he exhausted available administrative remedies in regard to Count VI of his Amended Complaint, which states a claim for excessive force. The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) requires that prisoners exhaust available administrative remedies before they initiate lawsuits related to the conditions of them confinement. <em>See Jernigan v. Stuchell, </em>304 F.3d 1030, 1032 (10th Cir.2002). Consequently, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion and dismissed Purkey\u2019s entire Amended Complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-20\">On appeal, Purkey argues the district court erred in: (1) placing the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>proving he exhausted available administrative remedies on him; (2) ruling he failed to exhaust available administrative remedies in regard to Count VI, and (3) dismissing his entire Amended Complaint without prejudice. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We vacate and remand in order to give the district court an opportunity to reconsider its opinion in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007), and resulting changes in our Court\u2019s PLRA precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">The PLRA states that: \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The PLRA\u2019s requirement that an inmate exhaust all available administrative remedies before initiating suit is \u201cmandatory,\u201d whether or not such remedies \u201cmeet federal standards.\u201d <em>Woodford v. Ngo, </em>548 U.S. 81, 126 S.Ct. 2378, 2382, 165 L.Ed.2d 368 (2006). This \u201cexhaustion requirement applies to all inmate suits about prison life, whether they involve general circumstances or particular episodes, and whether they allege excessive force or some other wrong.\u201d <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Jones, </em>we issued our opinions in <em>Steele v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>355 F.3d 1204 (10th Cir.2003), and <em>Ross v. County of Bernalillo, </em>365 F.3d 1181 (10th Cir.2004). <em>Steele </em>held that prisoners have the burden of pleading the exhaustion of available administrative remedies under the PLRA and that failure to properly plead exhaustion of such remedies amounts to failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>355 F.3d at 1209-10. In <em>Ross, </em>we held that the PLRA incorporates a total exhaustion requirement. <em>See </em>365 F.3d at 1189. Thus, we held an inmate\u2019s entire case must be dismissed if it contains a single unexhausted claim. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">In this case, the district court faithfully applied <em>Steele </em>in placing the burden on Purkey to plead exhaustion of available administrative remedies. The district court also followed our niling in <em>Ross </em>in dismissing Purkey\u2019s entire Amended Complaint once it concluded Purkey had not exhausted available administrative remedies in regards to Count VI. As we have recognized, however, <em>\u201cJones </em>overrules [both] <em>Steele </em>and <em>Ross.\u201d Freeman v. Watkins, </em>479 F.3d 1257, 1260 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">In <em>Jones, </em>the Supreme Court addressed several procedural requirements adopted by lower courts, requiring a prisoner, under the PLRA, to \u201callege and demonstrate exhaustion in his compliant ... and requiring] courts to dismiss the entire action if the prisoner fails to satisfy the exhaustion requirement as to any single claim in his compliant.\u201d 127 S.Ct. at 914. The Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Jones </em>that \u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative .defense under the PLRA, and that inmates are not required to specially plead or demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints\u201d clearly abrogated our holding in <em>Steele. Id. </em>at 921. Similarly, the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Jones </em>that the PLRA does not alter the legal norm by which \u201c[o]nly\u201d unexhausted (or \u201cbad claims\u201d) in a complaint \u201care dismissed\u201d\u2014rather than \u201cthe complaint as a whole\u201d\u2014abrogates our holding in Ross. <em>Id. </em>at 924.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\"><em>Post-Jones, </em>we stated that prisoners \u201cno longer [have] the duty of pleading exhaustion.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>479 F.3d at 1260. \u201cAs <em>Jones </em>makes clear, exhaustion is an affirmative defense and defendants now have the burden of asserting the failure to exhaust in their responsive] pleadings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Jones, </em>we also recently held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>that \u201cthe burden of proof for the exhaustion of administrative remedies in a suit governed by the PLRA lies with the defendant.\u201d <em>Roberts v. Barreras, </em>484 F.3d 1236, 1241 (10th Cir.2007). Further, we have recognized that \u201cunder the newly announced rules of <em>Jones,\u201d </em>the failure to exhaust available administrative remedies \u201con one claim does not warrant dismissal of the entire action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The district court did not have the opportunity to apply <em>Jones, </em>or our post-<em>Jones </em>case law, when it ruled on Defendants\u2019 motion. As a result, and through no fault of its own, the district court\u2019s treatment of Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss was in error. <em>See Peterson v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., </em>849 F.2d 464, 466 (10th Cir.1988) (\u201cThe general rule is that[,] absent injustice, an appellate court should apply the case law in effect at the time it renders its decision.\u201d). A remand is necessary in order to give the district court an opportunity to apply the new PLRA framework\u2014as laid down by <em>Jones </em>and our post-Jones precedents\u2014to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Defendants raised the issue of exhaustion in regard to Count VI in their memorandum in support of their Motion to Dismiss. As such, Defendants satisfied their post-Jones \u201cburden of asserting the failure to exhaust in their responsive] pleadings.\u201d <em>Freeman, </em>479 F.3d at 1260. On remand, however, Defendants also bear the burden of proving Purkey failed to exhaust available administrative remedies in regard to Count VI. <em>See Roberts, </em>484 F.3d at 1241. Thus, Defendants must necessarily prove that: (1) administrative remedies were, in fact, available to Purkey after he left CCA\u2019s custody, and (2) Purkey failed to exhaust these remedies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the district court concludes administrative remedies were, in fact, available to Purkey and that Purkey failed to exhaust these remedies, only Purkey\u2019s unexhausted claims may be dismissed. <em>See Freeman, </em>479 F.3d at 1260 (stating that \u201c \u2018if a complaint contains both good and bad claims, ... court[s] proceed[ ] with the good and leave[ ] the bad\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Jones, </em>127 S.Ct. at 924)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b746-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\">. At this juncture, we are unsure whether administrative remedies were, in fact, available to Purkey after he left CCA\u2019s custody or whether Purkey failed to exhaust the administrative remedies actually available to him. CCA\u2019s grievance policy merely states that: \"If a grievance is submitted for review and the grievant is released from custody, efforts to resolve the grievance will <em>normally </em>continue.\u201d <em>See </em>Policy 14-5.5(I)(3) (emphasis added). This section hardly states an unequivocal rule. Further, nothing in \u00a7 14\u20145.5(I)(3) clearly indicates that prisoners released from CCA\u2019s custody are required to comply with all other sections of CCA's grievance policy, including those sections pertaining to appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
