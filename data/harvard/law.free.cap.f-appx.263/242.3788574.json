For the following reasons, we will summarily affirm. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">In March 2004, Velentzas, a federal prisoner, initiated a <em>Bivens </em>action against various prison officials.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Velentzas alleged that he received sub-standard dental care while housed at the Federal Correctional Institution in White Deer, Pennsylvania (FCI-Allenwood). The District Court, adopting the Report and Recommendation of the Magistrate Judge, dismissed his complaint on March 17, 2005. On October 1, 2007, Velentzas filed a motion to re-open his case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) and to re-open the time to file a notice of appeal under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6). The District Court denied the motion and Velentzas appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We review the District Court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>See Brown v. Phila. Hous. Auth., </em>350 F.3d 338, 342 (3d Cir.2003). We likewise review the denial of Fed. R.App. R. 4(a)(6) relief for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Rinaldi, </em>447 F.3d 192, 195 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Reopening the period in which to appeal is governed by Rule 4(a)(6). Under 4(a)(6), a party must establish that he or she did not receive notice pursuant to Rule 77(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Moreover, the 4(a)(6) motion must be filed within 180 days of the entry of judgment or within 7 days of the party\u2019s receipt of notice, whichever is earlier. Appellant asserts that he did not receive notice that his case had been dismissed until he received an August 17, 2007 Report and Recommendation in a more recent lawsuit he filed in the same court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the last day to file a 4(a)(6) motion would have been February 10, 2006, or 180 days after the entry of judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rule 4(a)(6) relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-14\">The District Court also did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Velentzas\u2019s only argument in support of the 60(b) motion was that he did not receive notice of the District Court\u2019s dismissal. The rule in this circuit is clear: where the sole basis for a Rule 60(b) motion is a party\u2019s lack of notice, the motion must meet the time limitations of Rule 4(a). <em>See Hall v. Cmty. Mental Health Ctr. of Beaver County, </em>772 F.2d 42, 44 (3d Cir.1985). As noted above, Velentzas failed to meet the time limitations of Rule 4(a), therefore the District Court properly denied his Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">Finally, the docket shows that Velentzas filed two documents after the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Court closed the case. The filing on October 11, 2005, would be a timely motion pursuant to Rule 4(a)(6), however, it did not evince an intent to appeal, let alone an intent to request reopening the time to appeal. The June 12, 2006 letter requesting an update on the status of his case would be untimely under any relevant provision of 4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Accordingly, because this appeal presents us with no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the decision of the District Court. <em>See </em>Third Circuit L.A.R. 27.4 and I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-10\">. In <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), the Supreme Court recognized a private cause of action to recover damages against a federal agent for violations of constitutional rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b265-11\">. <em>Velentzas v.

The District Court\u2019s March 17, 2005 judgment did not comply with the separate judgment rule. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(a). Thus, for Rule 4(a) purposes, the judgment was entered 150 days after the entry of the judgment on the District Court civil docket, or August 15, 2005. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
