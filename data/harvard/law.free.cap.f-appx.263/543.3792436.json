United, States Dist. Ct. for N. Dist. of Cal., </em>339 U.S. 844, 845, 70 S.Ct. 954, 94 L.Ed. 1326 (1950) (per curiam) (denial of IFP motion is appealable order). The court\u2019s denial of IFP status was based on its finding that Bell had three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). The court also denied leave to proceed IFP on appeal, and Bell has renewed his IFP motion in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-19\">We have reviewed the docket sheets and orders in the three cases the district court listed as strikes, <em>see Owens v. Isaac, </em>487 F.3d 561, 563 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (reviewing de novo district court\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 1915(g)), and have determined that Bell had only one strike when the instant lawsuit and appeal were filed, <em>see Campbell v. Davenport Police Dep\u2019t, </em>471 F.3d 952, 952-53 (8th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (dismissals are counted as strikes only when appeals have been exhausted or waived; \u00a7 1915(g) does not apply unless inmate has three strikes at time he files lawsuit or appeal). Accordingly, we grant Bell\u2019s motion to proceed IFP in this appeal, and reverse the district court\u2019s order denying Bell IFP based on section 1915(g). We deny Bell\u2019s motion to stay the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
