Mar. 12, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77-977447 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect our ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangehuck v. DHS, </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Iouri v. Ashcroft, </em>487 F.3d 76, 81 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting section 1252(b)(4)(B)); <em>see also Gjolaj v. BCIS, </em>468 F.3d 140, 143 (2d Cir.2006) (reviewing the question of nexus for substantial evidence).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">Our review of the record leads us to conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s determination that Gao did not demonstrate that he would face persecution on account of a protected ground. In addition to showing past persecution or a well-founded fear, asylum eligibility requires that the persecution alleged be on account of the applicant\u2019s race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or particular social group. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). Gao is not and never claimed to be a Falun Gong practitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">Even if Gao had proven that the government thought he had a pro-Falun Gong stance, he did not demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution on that basis. As the agency found, it is significant that Gao\u2019s parents, who were similarly situated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>to Gao, have not experienced any harm at the hands of the authorities. The agency did not err in relying on his parents\u2019 experience to support its finding that Gao failed to show a reasonable fear of future persecution. <em>See, e.g., Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999); <em>Matter of A-E-M- </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1157, 1160 (BIA 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s finding that Gao\u2019s alleged illegal departure from China does not give rise to an objectively reasonable fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. As the IJ noted, there is no evidence to suggest that Gao left China illegally. Even if there was, the fact that a country may punish a citizen for his illegal departure does not generally qualify an alien for refugee protection. <em>See Matter of Sibrun, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 354, 359 (BIA 1983). Gao states in his application that he was \u201csmuggled to the U.S.\u201d However, he fails to present any evidence showing that the Chinese government imputes a political opinion to its citizens who leave the country in that manner, or that such individuals are subjected to harm rising to the level of persecution. Therefore, we do not disturb the agency\u2019s denial of Gao\u2019s application for asylum or withholding of removal, where both were based upon the same factual predicate. <em>See Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Gao also argues that the agency erred in denying his CAT claim because he met his burden of proof for that relief. Unlike asylum and withholding of removal, an applicant for CAT relief need not show that his claimed fear bears a nexus to a protected ground. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16, 1208.17. However, Gao fails to point to any evidence that someone in his particular circumstances will more likely than not face torture in China on the basis of having departed illegally. <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Mu-Xing Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>320 F.3d 130, 143-44 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of Gao\u2019s CAT claim was also supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
