Hicks appeals the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> order affirming the denial of disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. Hicks alleged disability from back and right-leg pain, and from numbness in his arms, hands, and right leg. Following a hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>while the medical evidence established a herniated disc, bursitis, and chronic back pain\u2014which were severe impairments\u2014 the impairments alone or combined did not meet or equal a listing; that Hicks\u2019s subjective complaints were not fully credible; and that although his residual functional capacity (RFC) for a wide range of light work precluded his past relevant work, based on the testimony of a vocational expert, Hicks could perform certain jobs and thus he was not disabled. After the Appeals Council denied review, the district court affirmed. Having carefully reviewed the record, we affirm. <em>See Casey v. Astrue, </em>503 F.3d 687, 691 (8th Cir.2007) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Contrary to Hicks\u2019s assertions, the ALJ gave multiple valid reasons for his credibility findings. <em>See id. </em>at 696 (ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is entitled to deference if based on good reasons). Further, we find substantial evidence in the record for the ALJ\u2019s decision to discount the RFC opinion of a spine specialist who had assessed Hicks on two occasions. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2)-(6), 416.927(d)(2)-(6) (factors in determining weight to give treating physician\u2019s opinion); <em>Hacker v. Barnhart, </em>459 F.3d 934, 937 (8th Cir.2006) (ALJ may elect in certain circumstances not to give controlling weight to treating physician\u2019s opinion, as record must be evaluated as whole; final RFC determination is left to ALJ). We also reject Hick\u2019s assertion that the record shows he meets or equals the requirements of Listing 1.04. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 1.04; <em>Johnson v. Barnhart, </em>390 F.3d 1067, 1070 (8th Cir. 2004) (to meet burden of proof, claimant must present medical findings equal in severity to all criteria of listing). Hicks\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for reversal and merit no discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-19\">. The Honorable James M. Moody, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
