The district court sentenced Perez to 121 months of imprisonment and ordered that he serve his term of imprisonment consecutive to the seven-year sentence he was then serving in the State of Georgia. Perez did not directly appeal his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">In 2006, Perez filed a nunc pro tunc motion in which he argued (1) that the district court misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 when it ordered that his federal sentence run concurrent to his state sentence, and (2) that the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) had incorrectly denied him a sentence credit for the time he spent in state custody. The district court denied Perez\u2019s motion, construing it as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In the alternative, the district court further concluded that the motion was without merit because the BOP had correctly calculated Perez\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">On appeal, Perez argues that his motion arose under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 rather than \u00a7 2255 and reurges the merits of his claims. In the alternative, Perez asserts that his claims are timely under \u00a7 2255, H 6, (4). Perez also asserts that the district court abused its discretion when it failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether his state and federal sentences should have been ordered to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-11\">Section 2255 is the primary means of collaterally attacking a federal sentence. The record reflects that Perez\u2019s sentence credit claim in inextricably intertwined with, and in fact derivative of, his claim that the district court misapplied the sentencing guidelines. Unless Perez can establish that the district court\u2019s order imposing the consecutive sentence was error, he will not be entitled to the sentence credit he seeks. Thus, because Perez\u2019s claim was fundamentally a challenge to his consecutive sentence, the district court did not err in concluding that his claim arose under \u00a7 2255 and that it was untimely. Because Perez did not present any arguments in the district court regarding the timeliness of his motion, we will not consider such arguments here. <em>Bower v. Quarterman, </em>497 F.3d 459, 475 (5th Cir. 2007) (claims presented for the first time on appeal are not considered). Finally, because the record conclusively establishes that Perez was not entitled to relief under \u00a7 2255, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it failed to conduct an evidentiary hearing regarding Perez\u2019s claims. <em>See United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
