R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b589-24\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-25\">This is a petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying petitioners\u2019 motions to reopen and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>reconsider the BIA\u2019s September 6, 2005 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss is also construed as a motion for summary disposition in part. So construed, the motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The regulations provide that a motion to reopen must be filed with the BIA within ninety days after the mailing of the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Here, petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen was filed almost a year and a half after the mailing of the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">The regulations provide that a motion to reconsider must be filed with the BIA within thirty days after the mailing of the BIA decision and that a party may file only one motion to reconsider any given decision. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Here, petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider was filed almost a year and a half after the mailing of the BIA\u2019s decision and it was petitioners\u2019 second motion to reconsider filed with the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-9\">Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied petitioners\u2019 motions to reopen and reconsider. <em>See Lara-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 968, 972 (9th Cir.2004), <em>amended by </em>404 F.3d 1105 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that BIA denials of motions to reopen or reconsider are reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">It should also be noted that petitioners are barred from cancellation of removal relief as they failed to depart pursuant to the grant of voluntary departure. <em>See Azarte v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 1278 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">Accordingly, this petition for review is denied because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-15\">To the extent that petitioners seek review of the BIA\u2019s denial of their request to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings, this court lacks jurisdiction over this petition for review. <em>See Ekimian v. INS, </em>303 F.3d 1153, 1159 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-16\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-17\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b589-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
