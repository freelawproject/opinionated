Because we conclude that Moeun\u2019s conviction does not qualify as an aggravated felony, we grant the petition for review and vacate the order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">An alien convicted of an aggravated felony is removable. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii). Although this court lacks jurisdiction to review a final order of removal based upon an aggravated felony conviction, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(c), we have jurisdiction to determine whether Moeun\u2019s conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony. <em>Martinez-Perez v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 1022, 1024-25 (9th Cir.2005). Whether an offense qualifies as an aggravated felony is a legal question we review de novo. <em>Id. </em>at 1025.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">If a state statute is \u201ccategorically broader than the generic definition\u201d of the aggravated felony of sexual abuse of a minor, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A), we apply the modified categorical approach to determine whether a conviction under that statute qualifies as an aggravated felony conviction. <em>See Navarro-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1063, 1073 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc); <em>Estrada-Espinoza v. Gonzales, </em>498 F.3d 933, 935 (9th Cir.2007). In this case, the statute under which Moeun was convicted is broader than the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor because it does not require the victim of sexual battery to be a minor. <em>See </em>Cal.Penal Code. \u00a7 243.4(a) (\u201cAny person who touches an intimate part of another person while that person is unlawfully restrained by the accused or an accomplice, and if the touching is against the will of the person touched and is for the purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification, or sexual abuse, is guilty of sexual battery....\u201d). Therefore, we turn to the modified categorical approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-11\">Under the modified categorical approach, Moeun\u2019s conviction for sexual battery qualifies as an aggravated felony if \u201cthe record includes documentation or judicially noticeable facts that clearly establish\u201d that he was convicted of all of the elements of sexual abuse of a minor. <em>Estrada-Espinoza, </em>498 F.3d at 935 (internal quotations and citation omitted).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When applying the modified categorical approach the panel may look to \u201ca narrow, specified set of documents that are part of the record of conviction, including the indictment, the judgment of conviction, jury instructions, a signed guilty plea, or the transcript from the plea proceedings.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163-64 (9th Cir.2006) (internal quotations and citation omitted). The documents in the record are insufficient to establish that Moeun was convicted of all of the elements of sexual abuse of a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-12\">The record includes Moeun\u2019s plea agreement, the charging document, and a minute order. We decline to consider the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>minute order. Minute orders are not judicially noticeable documents, and the minute order in this case does not include the factual basis for Moeun\u2019s guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Snellenberger, </em>493 F.3d 1015, 1019-20 (9th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Though we may consider Moeun\u2019s plea agreement together with the charging document, these documents also do not clearly demonstrate that Moeun\u2019s guilty plea was for sexual abuse of a <em>minor. See United States v. Kelly, </em>422 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.2005) (charging document alone cannot establish elements of conviction but court may consider charging document in conjunction with plea agreement). The charging document reflects that count 3, the only count to survive the charging document\u2019s amendment, was originally for \u201cLewd Act Upon a Child\u201d based on an alleged lewd act on the body of \u201cJane Doe, who was 14 years old.\u201d A handwritten note reveals that count 3 was amended to a charge of sexual battery under \u00a7 243.4(a). But Moeun\u2019s plea agreement states only that he \u201cstipulate^] to a factual basis\u201d for his guilty plea to \u201cPC 243.4(a).\u201d Thus, we cannot be certain that amended count 3 includes the allegation that Jane Doe was fourteen years old, or that by stipulating \u201cto a factual basis,\u201d Moeun was stipulating that Jane Doe was fourteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">For this reason, we GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the order of removal, and REMAND the matter to the BIA for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\">. The panel acknowledges that <em>Navarro-Lopez </em>holds that the modified categorical approach does not apply \"[w]hen the crime of conviction is missing an element of the generic crime altogether.\u201d 503 F.3d at 1073 (quoting <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 892, 899-901 (9th Cir.2004) (Kozinski, J., concurring)). The panel declines to address whether California Penal Code \u00a7 243.4(a) falls under this rule because the documentation in the record is, in any event, insufficient to establish that Moeun\u2019s conviction was for sexual abuse of a minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
