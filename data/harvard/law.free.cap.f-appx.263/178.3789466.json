We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Appellant was formerly employed by Metro-North as an electrician. Hedru claimed that while on the job during the early morning hours on October 31, 2002, he tripped and fell on a section of new asphalt that was about two and a half inches higher than the section on which he had been walking. He was injured again while performing a train inspection on December 26, 2002, when he slipped and fell on water-covered ice inside a train car. Hedru sued Metro-North under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51 <em>et. seq., </em>for damages arising from the two incidents, alleging that Metro-North had been negligent in maintaining the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Before trial, Metro-North tendered an Offer of Judgment to Appellant in the amount of $450,000. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 68. Appellant rejected the offer. After a four-day trial, a jury found that Metro-North was not negligent with regard to the October 2002 incident, but that it was negligent with regard to the December 2002 incident. The jury also found that Hedru\u2019s damages from the December accident totaled $400,000, and that Hedru was 75% contributorily negligent. Therefore, Hedru was awarded $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Hedru did not move for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, nor did he move for a new trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(b), 59. On appeal, however, he argues that the verdict should be overturned because the jury\u2019s findings were \u201cagainst the weight and contrary to the clear evidence,\u201d and that we should order a new trial \u201cin order to prevent a manifest injustice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">It is well settled that a claim that a verdict was based on insufficient evidence cannot be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See, e.g., Jacques v. DiMarzio, Inc., </em>386 F.3d 192, 199 (2d Cir.2004) (declining to address sufficiency of evidence claim because no post-verdict motion for judgment as a matter of law was made); <em>Patrolmen\u2019s Benevolent Ass\u2019n of New York v. City of New York, </em>310 F.3d 43, 51 n. 5 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201cTo the extent that appellants request a new trial on these claims on the grounds that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence ... that request must be denied because it was not raised before the trial judge.\u201d). None of Hedru\u2019s contentions were raised in the appropriate post-trial motions. Therefore, we do not review Appellant\u2019s sufficiency of the evidence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">We could order a new trial if the jury\u2019s verdict were \u201cwholly without legal support.\u201d <em>Varda, Inc. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>45 F.3d 634, 638 (2d Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Sojak v. Hudson Waterways Corp., </em>590 F.2d 53, 54 (2d Cir.1978) (per curiam)). Upon reviewing the evidence introduced at trial, however, we cannot agree with Appellant that the jury\u2019s verdict in this case\u2014finding that Metro-North was not negligent for the October 2002 incident, and that Hedru was 75% contributorily negligent for the December 2002 ineidentwas \u201cwholly without legal support.\u201d Nor do we perceive any error in the district court\u2019s instructions to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-10\">Having considered Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and finding them without merit, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
