We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Saffold challenges a prison disciplinary action that resulted in a sentence credit loss of 30 days. Specifically, he contends that the California Department of Corrections\u2019 (\u201cCDC\u201d) failure to assign an Investigative Employee (\u201cIE\u201d) to assist him in his defense violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process, and that the findings of the senior hearing officer at the disciplinary hearing were not supported by sufficient evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">We conclude that there was no due process violation. The assistance of an IE was not necessary because Saffold was not illiterate nor were the issues pertaining to the disciplinary action so complex as to make it difficult for Saffold to collect and present the evidence necessary for an adequate comprehension of the case. <em>See Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 570, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974). Furthermore, the findings of the senior hearing officer were supported by some evidence in the record. <em>See Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">Accordingly, the California Superior Court\u2019s determination that the CDC did not violate Saffold\u2019s due process rights was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
