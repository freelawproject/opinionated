Jan. 24, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-15\">When the agency denies a motion to reopen, this Court reviews the BIA\u2019s decision for an abuse of discretion. <em>Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. DOJ, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-16\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Zheng\u2019s motion to reopen. The BIA appropriately noted that Zheng\u2019s motion was untimely where its prior decision had been issued in December 2003, and Zheng did not submit her motion until November 2006, well beyond the ninety-day deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">Further, the BIA properly found that Zheng\u2019s case did not warrant equitable tolling based on ineffective assistance of counsel when she failed to show that she was prejudiced by her prior attorney\u2019s conduct. <em>See, e.g., Esposito v. INS, </em>987 F.2d 108, 111 (2d Cir.1993) (per curiam) (emphasizing that to demonstrate prejudice, the petitioner must establish that had counsel acted competently, the result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>the proceeding would have been different). As the BIA noted, this Court upheld its affirmance of the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, which was based on several weaknesses in the presentation of Zheng\u2019s claim. <em>See Yu Yan Zheng v. DOJ, </em>186 Fed.Appx. 118, 120-21 (2d Cir.2006). However, in asserting that her prior attorney was ineffective, Zheng contended only that he failed to explain to the IJ a mistake he made in preparing her written application with respect to the date of her sterilization.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">In her brief to this Court, Zheng argues that \u201cit is impossible to predict whether the IJ would have reached the same determination had this significant discrepancy not been present.\u201d To the contrary, the record reflects that the IJ did not find the inconsistency concerning the date of Zheng\u2019s sterilization dispositive. Rather, after identifying that inconsistency, the IJ relied on several other inconsistencies and implausibilities in the record, as well as Zheng\u2019s submission of a questionable abortion certificate, to support his decision. As such, the BIA\u2019s finding that equitable tolling was not warranted was not arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
