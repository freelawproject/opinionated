On appeal, Smith argues that he is entitled to file a \u00a7 2241 petition through \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause because (1) he is relying on <em>Alabama v. Shelton, </em>535 U.S. 654, 122 S.Ct. 1764, 152 L.Ed.2d 888 (2002), which provides a new rule of constitutional law that is retroactively applicable, and (2) his case is within the spirit of <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), even though it may not meet all three requirements set forth in <em>Wofford. </em>For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b876-11\">Smith is serving a life sentence for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute. In December 2004, he filed a <em>pro se </em>habeas corpus petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Smith acknowledged in his petition that he had previously filed more than one \u00a7 2255 motion, and attached a copy of a decision by this court denying an application for leave to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion, but he argued that his claims involved a \u201cfundamental defect\u201d in his sentencing, triggering the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. (Rl-1 at 3-4). Smith claimed that (1) the sentence for his federal conviction was unconstitutionally enhanced based on a state conviction from 1978 that was obtained in violation of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shelton; </em>(2) his counsel in his federal trial was ineffective because the issue of whether Smith was represented by counsel in his 1978 state conviction was never investigated; (3) he was actually innocent of 1978 state conviction because he was charged with possession of cannabis, but the substance was actually parsley; (4) the trial court in the 1978 proceedings misadvised Smith that his conviction and sentence to 18 months of probation could not be used against him in a later case; and (5) the 1978 offense does not constitute a conviction under Florida law because he pled <em>nolo contendere </em>and adjudication was withheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">A magistrate judge issued a report recommending the dismissal of Smith\u2019s petition. The magistrate judge found that the court did not have jurisdiction to review the expired state sentence because Smith did not meet the \u201cin custody\u201d requirement as to that sentence. (Rl-4 at 1). Therefore, the magistrate judge construed Smith\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>to vacate, attacking his current federal judgment and sentence. The magistrate judge then found that Smith had filed four prior motions to vacate that sentence and had failed to obtain authorization from this court to file his current motion as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). The magistrate judge noted that the savings clause cited in <em>Wofford </em>does not allow a petitioner to bypass the requirement of obtaining permission to file a successive motion to vacate. He also noted that Smith\u2019s successive motion was barred by \u00a7 2244\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. Smith filed objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation. Smith argued that (1) the savings clause applies to claims involving a fundamental defect where the petitioner did not have an opportunity to obtain a judicial correction of the defect earlier and where the petitioner is actually innocent, and (2) his present action should be considered his first \u00a7 2255 motion because none of his previous motions were denied on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation over Smith\u2019s objections. The district court found that Smith\u2019s petition should be construed as a motion to vacate pursuant to \u00a7 2255 and conducted a <em>de novo </em>review of the issues presented by Smith\u2019s objections. Without expressly discussing <em>Wofford </em>or \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, the district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction because Smith had not been authorized by this court to file a successive motion, and that Smith\u2019s petition does not fall under any of the exceptions that render subsequent motions non-successive.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Smith then filed a motion for rehearing. Smith noted that \u00a7 2241 may be utilized by a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his sentence if he can meet the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, and argued that he can meet those criteria because <em>Shelton </em>created a new rule of constitutional law that is retroactively applicable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also argued that the district court erred in determining that his motion was successive because his previous motions had not been adjudicated on the merits, and therefore did not need to be authorized by this court. The district court construed this motion as a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment and denied it, finding that Smith failed to meet his burden showing that there was a change in the law, new evidence, a clear legal error, or manifest injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">Smith filed a notice of appeal, which the district court construed as a motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). The district court found that Smith did not make a substantial showing that he was denied a constitutional right and did not issue a COA. However, we granted the COA on the limited issue of whether \u201cthe district court erred in dismissing [Smith\u2019s] 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition as an impermissible second or successive 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and denying [Smith\u2019s] motion for rehearing, construed as a Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion, without applying the [ ] test in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236, 1244 (11th Cir.1999).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Whether a federal prisoner is eligible for habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Darby v. Hawk-Sawyer, </em>405 F.3d 942, 944 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Typically, such a prisoner must collaterally attack <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>the validity of a federal conviction or sentence through a motion under \u00a7 2255. <em>Id. </em>at 944-45. However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to \u00a7 2241. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1365 (11th Cir.2003). That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b878-4\">[a]n application for a writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 K 5. Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">We have established that the savings clause applies when: (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision establishes that the petitioner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; and (3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. The savings clause only applies if the petitioner has satisfied all three elements, and we may not reach the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claim unless he has \u201copen[ed] the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding\u201d by meeting the <em>Wofford </em>test. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3. If we can reach the merits of a claim, the proper inquiry is whether the petitioner can establish actual innocence to overcome his procedural default for not raising his claim earlier. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[0]nly sentencing claims that may conceivably be covered by the savings clause are those based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision overturning circuit precedent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245. The petitioner bears the burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979) (per curiam). Finally, we may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that finds support in the record. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1351 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">In this case, Smith alleges that his federal sentence for conspiracy to possess cocaine with intent to distribute was enhanced by a state conviction that was obtained in violation of his right to counsel under the Sixth Amendment, and of which he was actually innocent. Smith has filed several previous \u00a7 2255 motions challenging his state conviction. Although the district court erred by not explicitly analyzing Smith\u2019s petition under the <em>Wofford </em>test, we conclude that Smith has not made the necessary showing to invoke the savings clause because he has not met his burden to establish each of the three prongs of the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">In <em>Howard v. United States, </em>374 F.3d 1068, 1081 (11th Cir.2004), we stated that <em>Shelton </em>recognized a new right which is retroactively applicable on collateral review, so Smith\u2019s petition meets the first prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test. However, even if <em>Shelton </em>applies to Smith\u2019s prior state conviction and sentence, he cannot meet the second prong of the test. Smith correctly acknowledges that his petition \u201cmay not\u201d satisfy the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test. (Appellant\u2019s Br. 15). <em>Shelton </em>does not render non-existent the offense for which Smith was convicted, possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>of marijuana. Instead, Smith merely alleges that his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced by that conviction. Consequently, we do not need to examine whether Smith\u2019s petition meets third prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. Smith\u2019s argument that his case falls within the spirit of <em>Wofford </em>is unpersuasive, as we have made clear that all three prongs of the test must be satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 1244. Because Smith fails to meet the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test, he is not able to proceed under \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, and he cannot use a \u00a7 2241 petition to circumvent the requirements of \u00a7 2255. He has not opened the portal to a \u00a7 2241 proceeding, and we cannot consider the merits of his petition. <em>Id. </em>at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">Finally, in a proceeding on a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the legal issues <em>de novo. Castillo v. United States, </em>200 F.3d 735, 736 (11th Cir.2000) (per curiam). Because the legal issues raised by Smith\u2019s appeal from his Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment are identical those raised by his motion to vacate, correct, or set aside sentence, Smith likewise has not carried his burden in that aspect of his appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Freddie Lee Smith appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, which was construed as a motion to vacate, correct, or set aside a sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, as impermissibly successive, and the denial of his motion for rehearing, which the district court construed as a motion under Rule 59(e) to alter or amend the judgment. On appeal, Smith argues that he is entitled to file a \u00a7 2241 petition through \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause because <em>Shelton </em>provides a new rule of constitutional law that is retroactively applicable, and his case is within the spirit of <em>Wofford. </em>The district court correctly dismissed Smith\u2019s petition because it clearly fails the second prong of the <em>Wofford </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b877-7\">.
