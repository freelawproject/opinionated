Lippman moves for leave to withdraw as counsel for Alfonzo Sanford. The court considers whether it should summarily affirm the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment in <em>Sanford v. Nicholson, </em>03-1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-25\">The briefing schedule in this appeal was stayed pending a case with a related issue. In this case, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims held that the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals accounted for the relevant medical evidence and provided a sufficient statement of reasons and bases to support its conclusion that Sanford was not entitled to an earlier effective date. The court also rejected Sanford\u2019s argument that he had been provided insufficient notice for his claim seeking an earlier effective date. Specifically, the court held that a notice of disagreement concerning an earlier effective date did not trigger the duty to provide notice pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-26\">Concerning the first issue, we do not have jurisdiction to review factual issues or the application of the law to the facts. <em>See Forshey v. Principi, </em>284 F.3d 1335, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2002) (en banc). This court \u201cmay not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-27\">Concerning the second issue, we recently addressed the notice issue in <em>Hartman v. Nicholson, </em>483 F.3d 1311 (Fed.Cir.2007). We held that a claimant\u2019s notice of disagreement concerning an earlier effective date does not trigger the Secretary\u2019s duty to provide notice pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103. <em>Hartman, </em>483 F.3d at 1314-15. Because the only issue over which we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>would have jurisdiction is clearly resolved by our recent decision in <em>Hartman, </em>summary affirmance of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment is appropriate. <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994) (summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">(1) The motion to withdraw as counsel is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
