For the reasons that follow, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Patel is a native and citizen of India. In removal proceedings, he admitted removability, but filed applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Patel claimed that his family, which is Hindu, was persecuted in India for donating land to a Christian society to build a school. Patel testified that on July 1, 2001, a group of people came to his family\u2019s house, beat up his parents, and burned their sugar cane crop. A.R. 141. Patel was not there at the time. He never returned home after the incident, first fleeing to Bombay and then to the United States. A.R. 141, 148-15. He additionally testified that his brother has been missing since July 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The Immigration Judge (IJ) found Patel credible, and found that Patel could potentially claim asylum on the basis of religion. A.R. 79. However, the IJ found that Patel had not personally been persecuted in the past, as he was never harmed, and found that it was not likely he would be persecuted in the future, as the persecution of his family was based on one event that occurred five years earlier, and his parents continued to live in the same place without harm. A.R. 80. The IJ also noted that Patel could relocate to another area of India if he was not comfortable with returning to the area of the family home. A.R. 81. The IJ thus denied all relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-10\">The BIA affirmed without opinion. Patel then filed a motion to reopen and reconsider, which the BIA denied. Patel filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">This court reviews the Board\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for abuse of discretion only. <em>Nocon v. INS, </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1029 (3d Cir.1986).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, the decision to deny a motion to reopen is within the Board\u2019s discretion. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a); <em>Lu v. Ashcroft, </em>259 F.3d 127, 131 (3d Cir.2001). Under the regulations, the Board \u201chas discretion to deny a motion to reopen even if the party moving has made out a prima facie case for relief.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a). As the Supreme Court has stated, the regulations \u201cplainly disfavor\u201d such motions. <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 110, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Accordingly, the Court reviews the Board\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion with \u201cbroad deference\u201d to its decision. <em>Ezeagwuna v. Ashcroft, </em>325 F.3d 396, 409 (3d Cir.2003). Thus, in order to succeed on the petition for review, Patel must ultimately show that the Board\u2019s discretionary decision was somehow arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law. <em>See Tipu v. INS, </em>20 F.3d 580, 582 (3d Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-12\">A motion to reopen proceedings based on changed country conditions \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1). Patel\u2019s motion to reopen was purportedly based on changed country conditions. Patel\u2019s motion stated that there had been \u201cunfortunate changes for the worst [sic] in India\u2019s political landscape-where a government is still and becomes more unable to control the religiously persecuted in Respondent\u2019s situation....\u201d A.R. 11. Patel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>also included a printout from an internet blog detailing recent persecution of Christians. We agree with the BIA that the articles \u201chave not been shown to have any relevance to the respondent\u2019s claim or demonstrate any increased threat to respondent.\u201d Given the lack of support for his motion, we find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">To the extent the motion could be construed as a motion to reconsider, we agree with the BIA that the motion simply reargued the basis for the appeal and disagreed with the Board\u2019s conclusions, but did not identify \u201cany material factual or legal errors in the prior decision that are supported by pertinent authority.\u201d The BIA thus did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition will be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\">. This court\u2019s review does not extend to the BIA's earlier order, because the petition for review was only timely as to the order entered on July 31, 2007. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Nocon, </em>789 F.2d at 1033-34.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
