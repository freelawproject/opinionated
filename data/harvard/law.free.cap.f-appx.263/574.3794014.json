Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The regulations provide that a motion to reopen \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen, filed nearly two years after the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). Nor did the BIA abuse its discretion in declining to equitably toll the 90-day time limit where the BIA determined that petitioner failed to act with due diligence in pursuing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Id. </em>at 889, 897. Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b596-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
