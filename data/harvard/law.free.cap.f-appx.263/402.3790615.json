Further, Taylor brings a collection of other challenges to his sentence and conviction, but he concedes that those claims are foreclosed by precedent. Finding Taylor\u2019s arguments without merit, we AFFIRM the district court on all grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">A grand jury indicted Defendant Lawrence James Taylor (\u201cDefendant\u201d) on one charge of being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(e). Taylor filed a motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis that these statutes were unconstitutional, but he acknowledged that his arguments were foreclosed under this court\u2019s case law, and he raised the issue only to preserve it for possible further review. The district court denied the motion, and with the Government\u2019s written consent, Taylor conditionally pleaded guilty to the charge against him while preserving his right to challenge the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Taylor\u2019s presentencing report (\u201cPSR\u201d) determined that Taylor was an Armed Career Criminal (\u201cACC\u201d) and assigned him a base offense level of 33 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. This ACC designation was based on Taylor\u2019s two prior burglary convictions, which were deemed violent felonies; his conviction for possession of cocaine, which was a serious drug offense; and his conviction for injury to a child, which qualified as a crime of violence. Taylor received no adjustments to his offense level and qualified for a criminal history category of VI. Thus, his guidelines sentencing range was 235-293 months in prison and three-to-five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Taylor objected to the PSR, arguing that his cocaine conviction did not qualify as a serious drug offense, and though the Government ultimately agreed, the change in classification of the drug conviction did not change Taylor\u2019s status as an ACC or his offense level. Additionally, Taylor contended that the statutory maximum sentence for his offense was ten years, but he conceded that this argument was foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Totres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Taylor also argued that he had accepted responsibility for his offense and should have received a corresponding adjustment to his offense level. Further, he contended that a sentence below the guidelines range was proper and reasonable based on the factors given in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553. Finally, Taylor objected to his ACC classification, arguing that it was improper because the Government could not show that his two burglary offenses occurred on different occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">The district court sustained Taylor\u2019s objection concerning the drug offense and denied the remaining objections. With respect to Taylor\u2019s ACC argument, the district court noted that the indictments and the judgments for the two burglary convictions established that the two offenses took place nine months apart.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">The district court sentenced Taylor to serve 260 months in prison and a four-year term of supervised release. Taylor filed a timely notice of appeal, again challenging the applicability of his ACC enhancement and the reasonableness of his sentence and raising a variety of foreclosed claims to preserve them for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">II. ACCA Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b425-12\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">Legal conclusions underlying a district court\u2019s application of the Armed Career Criminal Act are reviewed <em>de novo. United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002). The district court\u2019s factual findings will be upheld unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Barlow, </em>17 F.3d 85, 89 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b425-15\">On appeal, Taylor challenges his sentence enhancement under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), alleging that the district court violated <em>Shepard v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number><em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), and <em>United States v. Fuller, </em>453 F.3d 274, 278 (5th Cir.2006), by applying the ACCA enhancement to his sentence. Specifically, Defendant asserts that nothing in the Shepard-approved documents, the only documents that the district court may consult in applying the ACCA, supported the district court\u2019s conclusion that the offenses occurred on different occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">The ACCA subjects a defendant convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) to a minimum sentence of 15 years if he has three prior convictions for \u201ca violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). To establish that an ACCA enhancement is proper, the Government bears the initial burden of establishing the defendant\u2019s prior convictions. <em>See Barlow, </em>17 F.3d at 89. However, \u201c[ojnce the Government establishes the fact of a prior conviction based upon a guilty plea, the defendant must prove the invalidity of the conviction by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Ultimately, the district court must determine whether the ACCA applies and in doing so is generally limited to consulting the following sources: 1) the statutory definition, 2) the charging document, 3) the written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, or prior-offense judgment, and 4) any explicit finding by the trial court to which the defendant assented. <em>See Fuller, </em>453 F.3d at 279 (citing <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 16, 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">According to these procedures, the district court\u2019s imposition of the ACCA enhancement was proper in Taylor\u2019s case. The Government met its initial burden by providing reliable evidence of past convictions. Defendant then bore the burden of proving that the convictions did not support an ACCA enhancement. Defendant argued that the ACCA enhancement was improper because ambiguity might exist regarding the date of the offenses, but Defendant failed to introduce any evidence, much less a preponderance, that his offenses occurred simultaneously. Defendant\u2019s only arguments attempted to introduce uncertainty as to the date of the offenses because the indictments say \u201con or about.\u201d Thus, Defendant could not meet his <em>Barlow </em>burden and demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that his prior convictions are invalid for consideration under the ACCA. Based on the evidence presented, the district court consulted only S/iepanZ-approved sources, concluded from the indictments and state court judgments that Defendant\u2019s offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>occurred on different occasions, and applied the ACCA enhancement. Given Defendant\u2019s failure to offer evidence to the contrary, the district court\u2019s findings were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">This holding is consistent with our decision in <em>Fuller, </em>though the <em>Fuller </em>court never addressed the <em>Barlow </em>standard. Fuller, who had been convicted of two burglaries taking place on the same day, introduced evidence that \u201che and a friend entered two different buildings (or trailers) simultaneously,\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>453 F.3d at 278, and based on this evidence as well as the possibility of accomplice liability, the <em>Fuller </em>court concluded that \u201cwe cannot determine as a matter of law that the burglaries occurred on different occasions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279. Thus, the <em>Fuller </em>court implicitly found that Fuller had carried his burden of proof by supplying some evidence that his offenses did not occur on different occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Unlike in <em>Fuller, </em>Defendant here provides no evidence that his burglaries occurred simultaneously; Defendant merely attempts to introduce ambiguity. Thus, while Fuller succeeded in carrying his burden of proof under <em>Barlow, </em>Defendant fails to meet his burden, and the district court\u2019s ACCA enhancement was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">III. Reasonableness of Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">This court reviews guidelines sentences for reasonableness in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). In reviewing for reasonableness, an appellate court \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-63, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A district court\u2019s sentencing decision is entitled to great deference. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597-98, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (fact that appellate court might reasonably impose different sentence is insufficient justification for reversal of district court). In fact, this court has held that sentences within a properly calculated guideline range should be afforded a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court upheld this rebuttable presumption in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">When analyzing the reasonableness of a sentence, this court considers if the sentence: 1) fails to \u201caccount for a factor that should have received significant weight,\u201d 2) gives \u201csignificant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor,\u201d or 3) \u201crepresents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 376 (5th Cir.2007). A defendant who wishes to show that his within-guidelines sentence was unreasonable must establish that his sentence \u201cfalls so far afoul\u201d of one of these factors \u201cas to constitute a clear error in the court\u2019s exercise of its broad sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">B. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">Taylor argues that two unrelated factors make his sentence unreasonable. First, he argues that he should have received an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and that his sentence was an unreasonable four to six years longer because he did not receive the adjustment. Second, Taylor argues that, despite his guilty plea, he is actually innocent of the injury to a child offense to which he pleaded; he does not challenge the conviction but does assert that, in light of his factual innocence, the district court was unreasonable in declining to give him a more lenient sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">Nothing indicates that Taylor\u2019s sentence was unreasonable. The district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>adopted the PSR, considered proper \u00a7 3553 factors, and gave a sentence midway in the guideline range. The record demonstrates none of the <em>Nikonova </em>factors for rebutting the presumption of reasonableness, and Taylor has made no showing that his sentence is the result of \u201ca clear error in the court\u2019s exercise of its broad sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>See Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d at 376. Thus, Taylor has not rebutted the presumed reasonableness of his guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">IV. Other Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">To preserve his claims for further review, Taylor raises a number of issues that he concedes are foreclosed by precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">First, Taylor argues that his enhanced sentence under \u00a7 924(e) is unconstitutional because the dates of his prior convictions were not alleged in the indictment, proven beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury, or admitted by him. For this proposition, he cites <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); <em>United States v. White, </em>465 F.3d 250, 254 (5th Cir.2006); and <em>United States v. Stone, </em>306 F.3d 241, 243 (5th Cir.2002). However, \u201cSection 924(e)(1) does not create a separate offense but is merely a sentence enhancement provision.\u201d <em>White, </em>465 F.3d at 254 (quoting <em>Stone, </em>306 F.3d at 243) (internal brackets and quotation marks omitted). Consequently, \u201cneither the statute nor the Constitution requires a jury finding on the existence of the three felony convictions required for the enhancement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Stone, </em>306 F.3d at 243). Moreover, \u201c[t]he data necessary to determine the separateness of [a defendant\u2019s crimes] is [sic] inherent in the fact of prior convictions and do not have to be put before a jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). This argument is, as Taylor concedes, foreclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Taylor also argues that the sentencing enhancement provisions of \u00a7 924(e) are unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>and that his prior convictions are elements of the offense that must be proven to a jury. Taylor concomitantly argues that his plea was involuntary because he was not admonished that \u201cthe prior offense enhancement provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) stated essential offense elements that Taylor had the right to have the Government prove, and a jury find, beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d However, in <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, the Court held that a prior conviction is a sentencing factor under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and not a separate element of a criminal offense. <em>Apprendi </em>did not overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. 2348; <em>see also United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000) (noting that the <em>Apprendi </em>Court expressly declined to overrule Almendarez-Torres). Further, in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi, </em>that \u201c \u2018[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301-02, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (quoting <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490,120 S.Ct. 2348). Similarly, the Court in <em>Booker </em>applied its holding to \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction).\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 244, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Accordingly, Taylor\u2019s argument fails. <em>See United States v. Guevara, </em>408 F.3d 252, 261 (5th Cir.2005) (holding that \u201c[c]areer offender status is not a sentencing judge\u2019s determination of fact other than a prior conviction\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1115, 126 S.Ct. 1080, 163 L.Ed.2d 898 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Finally, Taylor argues that the factual basis for the interstate commerce element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>of his offense was insufficient to support his guilty plea conviction and, alternatively, that \u00a7 922(g) is unconstitutional. He suggests that after <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 567, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), in which the Court held that the Commerce Clause does not authorize Congress to criminalize the purely local possession of a firearm within a school zone, two panels of this court have reluctantly and erroneously upheld the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g)(1). This court previously rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to \u00a7 922(g) under <em>Lopez, </em>stating, \u201c \u2018the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g) is not open to question.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>United States v. DeLeon, </em>170 F.3d 494, 499 (5th Cir.1999)). The <em>Daugherty </em>court also refused to reconsider the interstate commerce element of \u00a7 922(g)(1) in light of <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000) and <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000) reasoning that those cases are distinguishable because a plain jurisdictional element exists in \u00a7 922(g), and, as in the instant case, there was stipulated evidence showing that the gun traveled in interstate commerce. <em>Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 518. \u201cNeither <em>Jones </em>nor <em>Morrison </em>affects or undermines the constitutionality of \u00a7 922(g).\u201d <em>Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Y. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM Taylor\u2019s sentence and conviction on all grounds.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cm. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b426-5\">. This approach accords with other circuits' applications of the ACCA burden of proof. While all circuits to address the issue note that the Government carries an initial burden, they also place the onus on defendants to prove that prior offenses are not separate. <em>See United States v. Phillips, </em>149 F.3d 1026, 1033 (9th Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, Phillips v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 1052, 119 S.Ct. 1359, 143 L.Ed.2d 520 (1999) (\"The Government carried its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Phillips committed three predicate offenses \u2018on occasions different from one another.' It did so by submitting unchallenged, certified records of conviction and other clearly reliable evidence.... The burden then shifted to Phillips to challenge the Government\u2019s evidence.\u201d) (internal citations omitted); <em>United States v. Cowart, </em>90 F.3d 154, 159 (6th Cir.1996) (holding that once the Government has shown that defendant has prior convictions, the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that the predicate crimes were committed as part of a single common scheme or plan); <em>United States v. Hudspeth, </em>42 F.3d 1015, 1019 n. 6 (7th Cir.1994) (holding that a certified record of conviction satisfies the Government\u2019s burden and the defendant must then establish that the prior convictions occurred on one occasion); <em>United States v. Redding, </em>16 F.3d 298, 302 (8th Cir.1994) (same); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ruo, </em>943 F.2d 1274, 1276 (11th Cir.1991) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
