DeFonzo, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jaswinder Kaur, </em>No. A75 565 000 (B.I.A. Apr. 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A75 565 000 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 17, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-17\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); see, <em>e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc). </em>However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>We find that agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ observed in his decision that the repeated inconsistencies in Kaur\u2019s testimony suggested that she had \u201csimply failed to memorize a pre-eonceived script.\u201d To the extent that this was an observation of Kaur\u2019s demeanor, we afford deference to that finding. <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). The IJ also explicitly noted several inconsistences in Kaur\u2019s testimony: 1) Kaur indicated in her asylum application that police had attempted to rape her in front of her husband, but testified that she was separated from her husband before the police officers tried to rape her; 2) Kaur claimed in the sworn statement accompanying her asylum application that she was able to visit her husband every month during his three month detention in 1994, but she testified that she was not permitted to visit him during that time; 3) Kaur alleged in her asylum application that her husband returned in August 1995 after his \u201cdisappearance\u201d in 1994, but then testified that he returned in July 1995; 4) Kaur testified to her complete ignorance of her husband\u2019s whereabouts after he \u201cdisappeared\u201d from detention in 1994, but her own evidence explained that he was in hiding; 5) Kaur initially testified that she was arrested in January 1996, but then retracted that statement, claiming that she had not been arrested a fourth time; and 6) Kaur gave conflicting testimony and did not seem to know whether she belonged to the Amirt Dhoric sect of Sikhism or the Shaij Dharie sect of Sikhism.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">We have held that, to form the basis of an adverse credibility determination, a discrepancy must be \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003). At the same time, we have held that \u201ceven where an IJ relies on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to the claim, .. .the cumulative effect may nevertheless be deemed consequential by the fact-finder.\u201d <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted). Here, we find that several of the agency\u2019s findings were substantial when measured against the record as a whole.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While others may properly be characterized as ancillary, they were properly considered for their cumulative effect on Kaur\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Taken together, the inconsistencies and discrepancies that the agency properly identified in the record provide substantial evidence in support of the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. As such,, its denial of Kaur\u2019s asylum claim was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Kaur based her claim for withholding of removal and CAT relief on the same factual predicate as her asylum claim. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding necessarily precludes the withholding of removal and CAT claims as well. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b110-4\">. To the extent that the agency relied on its finding that Kaur demonstrated \u201conly a rudimentary knowledge of the precepts of Sikhism\" in making its adverse credibility determination, it did so in error. <em>See Yose Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir.2006) (\"Both history and common sense make amply clear that people can identify with a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion's doctrinal tenets, and that those same people can be persecuted for their religious affiliation.\u201d). However, we find that remand would be futile on that basis because the IJ\u2019s determination is amply supported by the non-erroneous findings that we have identified. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
