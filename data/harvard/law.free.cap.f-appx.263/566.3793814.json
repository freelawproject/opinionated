We conclude summary disposition is appropriate because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v. Hooton, </em>693 F.2d 857, 858 (9th Cir.1982) (per curiam) (stating standard). The regulations provide that \u201ca party may file only one motion to reopen,\u201d and that the motion \u201cmust be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying petitioner\u2019s second motion to reopen, filed more than three years after petitioner was ordered removed <em>in absentia. See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">All other pending motions are denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">The temporary stay of removal shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b588-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
