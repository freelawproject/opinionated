Phillips, </em>420 F.Supp.2d 327 (S.D.N.Y.2006). The district court granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on a single issue: whether the state trial court erred in denying Gibson\u2019s motion to suppress his October 14, 1997, statement to police pursuant to <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, and with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">We begin by rejecting the respondent\u2019s challenge to our jurisdiction on grounds that the COA was improvidently granted. A COA vests us with jurisdiction to consider an appeal even if the district court should not have found that a COA was warranted. <em>Soto v. United States, </em>185 F.3d 48, 51-53 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Although we have jurisdiction to consider Gibson\u2019s appeal, we do not reach the merits of the constitutional issue that was the basis for the COA. Gibson is procedurally barred from pursuing his <em>Miranda </em>claim in federal court because he did not \u201cfairly present\u201d it in one complete round of a state-court appellate review process. <em>See Jimenez v. Walker, </em>458 F.3d 130, 148-49 (2d Cir.2006), <em>cert. </em>denied,U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 976, 166 L.Ed.2d 740 (2007); <em>Smith v. Duncan, </em>411 F.3d 340, 345 (2d Cir.2005). In his brief to the Appellate Division on direct appeal, Gibson expressly waived any challenge to the admissibility of his October 14 statement. Gibson also did not raise the October 14 statement in his motion to the New York Court of Appeals for leave to appeal from the Appellate Division\u2019s decision affirming his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">Gibson\u2019s attempts to avoid the consequences of his procedural default by showing \u201ccause and prejudice\u201d or a \u201cfundamental miscarriage of justice,\u201d <em>see Jimenez, </em>458 F.3d at 149, fail. According to Gibson, ineffective assistance of appellate counsel caused the procedural default of his <em>Miranda </em>claim. But ineffective assistance of counsel \u201cmust be presented to the state courts as an independent claim before it may be used to establish cause for a procedural default,\u201d <em>Edwards v. Carpenter, </em>529 U.S. 446, 452, 120 S.Ct. 1587, 146 L.Ed.2d 518 (2000) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), and Gibson has not presented an ineffective-assistance claim in New York state court, <em>see DiSimone v. Phillips, </em>461 F.3d 181, 191 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">As for the assertion of miscarriage of justice, Gibson argues that he would not have cooperated with police, and therefore would not have been convicted, had his October 14, 1997, interrogation been preceded by a <em>Miranda </em>warning. This assertion, even if true, does not help Gibson. The term \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d in this context necessarily includes \u201cactual innocence\u201d of the petitioner. <em>Sweet v. Bennett, </em>353 F.3d 135, 141 (2d Cir.2003). In assessing an actual-innocence claim we must \u201cconsider <em>all </em>evidence without regard to its admissibility.\u201d <em>Doe v. Menefee, </em>391 F.3d 147, 162 (2d Cir.2004) (emphasis in original), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>546 U.S. 961, 126 S.Ct. 489, 163 L.Ed.2d 364 (2005). The evidence does not support Gibson\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
