We have reviewed the record and conclude that the Board and IJ\u2019s conclusions are supported by substantial evidence, and that the record does not compel a contrary result. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (West 2005); <em>Haoua v. Gonzales, </em>472 F.3d 227, 231 (4th Cir.2007). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
