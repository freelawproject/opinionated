The district court sentenced Boyce to ninety-six months\u2019 imprisonment, at the top of the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range. Boyce timely appealed, challenging only his sentence. He claims his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to advise him of his speedy trial rights between his guilty plea and sentencing hearings <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and in failing to object to the Government\u2019s decision not to move for a downward departure under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 5K1.1 based on his assistance to the Government. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-20\">To establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment owing to ineffective assistance of counsel, Boyce must demonstrate trial counsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and there is a reasonable probability he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). However, we may address ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal only if the ineffectiveness appears conclusively on the face of the record. <em>United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-21\">Because trial counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness does not appear conclusively on the face of the record, we conclude Boyce\u2019s claims are not cognizable on direct appeal; these claims should be raised, if at all, in a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). As ineffective assistance is the sole issue raised on appeal, we affirm Boyce\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b358-18\"> Boyce\u2019s guilty plea hearing occurred in March 2006, and he was sentenced in June 2007. In the interim, Boyce moved for substitution of counsel, claiming trial counsel was uncommunicative. A magistrate judge denied the motion, finding trial counsel had not visited Boyce to discuss sentencing because a presentence report had yet to be submitted; however, the magistrate judge found trial counsel had discussed other matters with Boyce.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
