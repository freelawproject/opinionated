Ghilduta, and Robert Ghilduta, natives and citizens of Romania, seek review of a February 23, 2007, order of the BIA affirming the February 14, 2005, decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Jeffrey S. Chase denying their applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In Re Ioan M./Gyongyi Maria/Robert Ghilduta, </em>Nos. 70 866 744/A 75 996 713/996 714 (B.I.A. Feb. 23, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>Nos. A 75 996 713/70 866 744/75 996 714 (Immig. Ct. New York City Feb. 14, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">As an initial matter, we decline to review the Ghildutas\u2019 contention that remand is warranted because the Government and the IJ failed to forward Maria\u2019s asylum application to the Department of State, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.11(a). The Ghildutas failed to raise that argument in their brief to the BIA. We therefore decline to consider it. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 107 n. 1 (2d Cir.2007)(\u201cIf the government points out to the appeals court that an issue relied on before that court by a petitioner was not properly raised below, the court must decline to consider that issue.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but \u201cits brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning,\u201d we may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>ultimate conclusion. <em>Wangchuck v. D.H.S., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Iouri v. Ashcroft, </em>487 F.3d 76, 81 (2d Cir.2007)(quoting section 1252(b)(4)(B)). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law, including what quantum of evidence will suffice to discharge an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. I.N.S., </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003); <em>Islami v. Gonzales, </em>412 F.3d 391, 396 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We conclude that the agency properly determined that \u201cthe harm to the respondent constitutes discrimination and harassment, but not persecution.\u201d We have decided that persecution may include non-life-threatening violence and physical abuse, but \u201cpersecution does not encompass mere harassment.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the treatment suffered by the primary applicant, Maria Ghilduta, did not rise above \u201cmere harassment.\u201d She asserted that she was not chosen to head the company where she worked, but was instead passed over in favor of another, who was male and ethnically Romanian. She also asserts that she was pressured and harassed on a daily basis and therefore quit her job. She also alleges that while she and her son were traveling on a train, they were angrily confronted by an ethnic Romanian who cursed at them for speaking Hungarian. Additionally, she asserted that her parents\u2019 vineyard had been destroyed by ethnic Romanians, and that she constantly endured racial slurs and insults because of her Hungarian ethnicity. However, as the BIA found, Maria and her family \u201cwere not detained or physically harmed, or threatened with detention or physical harm, by the government, or by persons the government was unwilling or unable to control, on account of them Hungarian ethnicity.\u201d Moreover, the BIA properly found that Maria and her family were not \u201cprevented from obtaining gainful employment or subjected to other severe economic restrictions.\u201d <em>Cf. In re T-Z-, </em>24 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 163, 173-74 (BIA 2007) (finding that nonphysical forms of harm, such as the deliberate imposition of a severe economic disadvantage may amount to persecution). Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 argument, the BIA properly assessed the harms that they suffered \u201cin the aggregate,\u201d and concluded that they did not rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Because Maria was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on a claim for withholding of removal, where both claims were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
