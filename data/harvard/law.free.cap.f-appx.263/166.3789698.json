July 7, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>The BIA denied Greenidge\u2019s special motion on the basis that \u201cinasmuch as the respondent is removable as an aggravated felon, ... we must conclude that the respondent is ineligible for a waiver under section 212(c) of the Act, because there is no corresponding ground of inadmissibility for [a] crime of violence under section 212(a) of the Act.\u201d In support of its conclusion, the BIA cited its decision in <em>Matter of Blake, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 722 (B.I.A.2005). In challenging the BIA\u2019s order, Greenidge argues that this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blake v. Carbone, </em>489 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007), altered the test for section 212(c) eligibility used by the BIA, and he requests remand on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Assuming that the BIA did err in its grounds for denial of Greenidge\u2019s special motion, we nonetheless decline to remand. Remand is not \u201crequired each and every time an administrative agency assigns a wrong reason for its action.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Am. Geri-Care, Inc., </em>697 F.2d 56, 64 (2d Cir.1982). In the immigration context, we have concluded that remand would be futile whenever \u201cthe reviewing panel is confident that the agency would reach the same result upon a reconsideration cleansed of errors.\u201d <em>Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 107 (2d Cir.2006). The BIA had earlier found in its May 7, 2002 order\u2014an order fully litigated through Greenidge\u2019s prior habeas petitions before the district court\u2014that Greenidge was statutorily ineligible for section 212(c) relief. This was because Greenidge had been convicted of an aggravated felony, pursuant to a guilty plea entered on July 23, 1993, and had served at least five years of his prison sentence at the time of the BIA\u2019s original, May 18, 1999, decision denying him relief. This ruling comports with this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Buitrago-Cuesta v. INS, </em>7 F.3d 291, 296 (2d Cir.1993), and nothing in <em>Edwards v. INS, </em>393 F.3d 299 (2d Cir.2004), is to the contrary. Given the existence of this alternative, and determinative, ground for denying Greenidge section 212(c) relief, we conclude that remand in this case would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
