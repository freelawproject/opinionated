R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b677-21\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-22\">Francisco Ledesma-Aceves appeals from his 77-month sentence imposed after his guilty-plea conviction for being an alien found in the United States following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-23\">Ledesma-Aceves contends that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), because the indictment did not allege, he did not admit, and a jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had been deported subsequent to his drug trafficking conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-24\">The record reflects that the dates of Ledesma-Aceves\u2019 prior removal were alleged in the indictment and that he admitted all of these dates in his Rule 11 hearing. <em>See United States v. Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d 748, 751-55 (9th Cir.2007) (noting that it is sufficient if the date of removal is alleged in the indictment and admitted by the defendant or found by the jury); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>also United States v. Calderon-Segura, </em>512 F.3d 1104, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2008). Thus, the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 1326(b) did not result in <em>Apprendi </em>error. <em>See Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d at 751-55; <em>see also Calderon-Segura, </em>512 F.3d at 1110-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Ledesma-Aceves also contends that <em>Almendarez-Toyres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), is invalid and should not be relied upon. He further contends that under the constitutional avoidance doctrine, <em>Almendarez-Tor&gt;~es </em>is limited to challenges to the indictment where the defendant admits the prior conviction during a guilty plea. These contentions are foreclosed. <em>See Salazar-Lopez, </em>506 F.3d at 751 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b677-25\"><em> </em>This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
