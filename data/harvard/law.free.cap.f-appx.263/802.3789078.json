At his sentencing hearing, Cambronne moved to withdraw his guilty plea alleging that new evidence had surfaced, which related to the veracity of the police officers who testified at his suppression hearing. Cambronne also sought to qualify for a reduction in his sentence, pursuant to the safety-valve provision of the Guidelines, asserting that he was not aware that a gun was in his car at the time of his arrest. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2. The district court denied both requests, and Cambronne now appeals both denials.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">As an initial matter, we find no merit to the government\u2019s suggestion that Cambronne did not properly move the district court to withdraw his guilty plea and to apply a safety-valve adjustment. The transcript of the sentencing hearing reflects that he requested such relief, that the district court understood him to request such relief, and that the district court denied both requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-10\">We review the denial of Cambronne\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Freixas, </em>332 F.3d 1314, 1316 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cThe district court may be reversed only if its decision is arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Buckles, </em>843 F.2d 469, 471 (11th Cir.1988). \u201cA defendant may withdraw a plea of guilty ... after the court accepts the plea, but before it imposes sentence if ... the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). The \u201cfair and just reason\u201d standard should be liberally construed, but there is no absolute right to withdraw a guilty plea before sentencing. <em>Buckles, </em>843 F.2d at 471. To determine whether a defendant has shown a \u201cfair and just reason,\u201d a district court may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea, including the following factors: \u201c(1) whether close assistance of counsel was available; (2) whether the plea was knowing and voluntary; (3) whether judicial resources would be conserved; and (4) whether the government would be prejudiced if the defendant were allowed to withdraw his plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 471-72. Among other factors that we have considered are the defendant\u2019s admission of factual guilt under oath at a plea hearing and the timing of the motion to withdraw. <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>848 F.2d 166, 168 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">The testimony at Cambronne\u2019s suppression hearing reflects the following: While stopped at a 7-Eleven convenience store, Detectives Neese and Reid decided to investigate a suspiciously parked vehicle, the license plate number of which did not match the vehicle. Neese testified that he walked to the driver\u2019s side of the car and observed what he believed to be marijuana on the center console. At that time, Reid was talking to the individual in the car, who the detectives later learned was Cambronne. Eventually, Reid took Cambronne out of the vehicle while Neese called for a canine narcotics search. Officer Clark eventually arrived with a narcotics canine, which alerted the officers to the potential presence of contraband under the driver\u2019s seat of the car. Neese testified that he discovered a handgun and a bottle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>of crack cocaine beneath the driver\u2019s seat of the car. According to Neese\u2019s testimony, a tow truck arrived to take Cambronne\u2019s car into police custody. On the basis of Neese\u2019s and Reid\u2019s testimony regarding the course of events, the district court denied Cambronne\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Cambronne eventually pleaded guilty, but, at the sentencing hearing, he sought to withdraw his plea, claiming that after the suppression hearing, he and his attorney learned that the tow-truck driver discovered the bottle of crack cocaine in the course of preparing to tow the car and called the police to recover it. Cambronne argues that this casts doubt on the detectives\u2019 veracity at the suppression hearing, as they omitted mention of the tow-truck driver\u2019s involvement in the discovery of the crack cocaine. Cambronne\u2019s request to withdraw his guilty plea came approximately one month after speaking to the tow-truck driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">In rejecting Cambronne\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, the court noted that the truck driver\u2019s testimony would not address Cambronne\u2019s guilt or innocence in the case. The district court noted the seeming misconduct of the detectives but denied Cambronne\u2019s motion on the basis of his admission of factual guilt and the fact that the new evidence would not affect the \u201cresult,\u201d presumably of a new suppression hearing. We find no error in the district court\u2019s ruling as Cambronne does not explain how the tow-truck driver\u2019s testimony would plausibly change the district court\u2019s denial of Cambronne\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, the balance of the <em>Buckles </em>factors support the district court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">Cambronne next argues that the district court erred in failing to sentence him below the statutory minimum by way of a safety valve adjustment under \u00a7 5C1.2 of the Guidelines. We review the district court\u2019s factual determinations under \u00a7 5C1.2 for clear error, <em>United States v. Cruz, </em>106 F.3d 1553, 1557 (11th Cir.1997), and we review the district court\u2019s interpretation and application of the guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Matos-Rodriguez, </em>188 F.3d 1300, 1309 (11th Cir.1999). Section 5C1.2(a) enables a court to sentence below the statutory minimum for an offense if a defendant meets five conditions, including the requirement that \u201cthe defendant did not ... possess a firearm ... in connection with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(2). We have considered the phrase \u201cin connection with\u201d in other contexts and concluded that it should be given an \u201cexpansive intei\u2019pretation.\u201d <em>MatosRodriguez, </em>188 F.3d at 1308-09. In <em>Matos-Rodriguez,, </em>for example, we affirmed a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant possessed a gun \u201cin connection with\u201d the delivery of counterfeit currency by taking the gun with him to make the delivery, even though he did not in fact use the gun. <em>Id. </em>at 1308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">Here, Cambronne argues that although the gun was found in close proximity to the contraband beneath the driver\u2019s seat of his car, he was unaware of its presence, as he normally kept it at home. Cambronne argues that the district court was inclined to apply the safety-valve adjustment to his sentence but erroneously felt constrained by the gun\u2019s proximity to the contraband in Cambronne\u2019s ear, whether or not Cambronne knew the gun was in the car. Although we have affirmed inferences of such knowledge and findings that a gun was possessed \u201cin connection with\u201d offenses without actual use, a defendant cannot be found to possess a gun \u201cin connection with\u201d an offense without knowledge of the gun\u2019s presence. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, </em>276 F.3d 1231, 1234-35 (11th Cir.2001) (describing circumstances that convert simple possession of a firearm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>into possession \u201cin connection with\u201d a particular offense). Because the record is unclear as to whether the district court made a finding that Cambronne knew the gun was in the car, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial of Cambronne\u2019s request for a safety-valve adjustment and remand this issue for reconsideration of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">The government urges that we nonetheless affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Cambronne\u2019s request for application of the safety valve on several grounds not considered by the district court. Whether or not the circumstances cited by the government would support the factual findings that the government urges we adopt in affirming on alternative bases, we decline that invitation and allow the district court to consider in the first instance the factual issues it deems relevant on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Therefore, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of Cambronne\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, VACATE the denial of Cambronne\u2019s request for a safety-valve adjustment, and REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
