May 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">This Court reviews the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34 (quoting <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied Lin\u2019s motion to reopen. The applicable regulations provide that a party must file a motion to reopen no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative order of removal was issued. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). However, the regulations also provide that the time and numerical limitations shall not apply if the motion is based on \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or the country to which [removal] has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-13\">Lin filed her motion to reopen roughly four years after the final agency disposition in her case; therefore, the BIA properly framed its inquiry as whether she had provided material evidence of changed country conditions that was not available at the time of her previous proceeding. In support of her motion, Lin provided unofficial translations of documents entitled \u201cPopulation and Family Planning Regulation of Fujian Province\u201d and \u201cPopulation and Family Planning Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China,\u201d the 2005 State Department Report on Human Rights in China, and two articles about family planning in China. The BIA found that this evidence did \u201cnot provide adequate support for the contention that a returning individual with one 7-year-old child born in the United States will be persecuted upon return to China.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-14\">In her brief to this Court, Lin points to a provision, allegedly from China\u2019s 2005 family planning law, that concerns when \u201creturned overseas Chinese\u201d may give birth to a second child. That provision does not indicate that individuals in Lin\u2019s circumstances will be persecuted. The BIA properly distinguished our holding in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006). In that case, we remanded to the BIA for further consideration of materials similar to those that Lin provided to the BIA in support of her motion to reopen. However, the BIA correctly noted that Guo was specific to the potential well-founded fear of a \u201cparent of two children,\u201d which makes it clearly distinguishable from Lin\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 115. In cases such as Lin\u2019s, where petitioners only have one child, a claim of a well-founded fear of persecution may appropriately be consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>ered speculative. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260, 265 (2d Cir.2007)(\u201c[T]he <em>Guo </em>documents are not material to claims by Ni, who has had a single child.\u201d). Therefore, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">While Lin argues that the BIA\u2019s denial of her motion to reopen violates her due process rights under the Fifth Amendment, she offers no explanation of how she was denied a meaningful opportunity to be heard other than describing the BIA\u2019s decision as \u201chasty.\u201d We therefore find that she does not make a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Saloum v. U.S. Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs., </em>437 F.3d 238, 243 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
