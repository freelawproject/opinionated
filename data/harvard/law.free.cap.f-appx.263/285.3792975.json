Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). Such a causal nexus is required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>support the grant of asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (2000); <em>Saldarriaga v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 461, 466 (4th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1169, 126 S.Ct. 1330, 164 L.Ed.2d 47 (2006). Accordingly, we deny Dias\u2019 petition for review of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">Moreover, we reject Dias\u2019 contention that the immigration judge and the Board improperly denied her discretionary asylum. The grant of discretionary asylum pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(iii) (2005) is only available to an asylum applicant who is not otherwise eligible for asylum because of a fundamental change in circumstances or because safe relocation within the applicant\u2019s country of origin is available and reasonable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(I), (iii) (2005). Because there was no finding that Dias had suffered past persecution, but that changed circumstances or safe, reasonable relocation within Sri Lanka prohibited her from receiving a grant of asylum, relief under this regulation was simply not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-25\"> Because Dias does not challenge the Board's affirmance of the denial of withholding of removal or CAT relief, we will not consider the disposition of those claims. <em>See </em>4th Cir.R. 34(b); <em>Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, </em>178 F.3d 231, 241 n. 6 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
