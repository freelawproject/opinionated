Chew denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Bei Zheng, </em>No. A 96 401 077 (B.I.A. May 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 401 077 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, Dec. 2, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-24\">When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014 or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled, in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">We conclude that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. First, the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that it would have been \u201cinconceivable\u201d for a family to have obtained a household register while in hiding and to have entries made in it. Indeed, Zheng indicated that her mother had been in hiding from the Public Security Bureau since an individual who had distributed Falun Gong flyers with her family was arrested in December 2001. Zheng testified that her mother did not have a \u201cfixed residence\u201d and that her father had escaped to Korea. Despite Zheng\u2019s testimony that her family members were in hiding, her documentary evidence indicates that the Public Security Bureau issues household registers, and that a household registration officer updated their register in March 2003 to include information about Zheng\u2019s sister. Because the IJ\u2019s implausibility finding in this respect was \u201ctethered\u201d to the evidentiary record, it supported his adverse credibility finding. <em>See Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir. 2007) (according deference to an IJ\u2019s inferential leap so long as it is \u201ctethered to record evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Further, the IJ properly found Zheng\u2019s testimony inconsistent with her household register with respect to her sister\u2019s whereabouts. Zheng testified that after her parents sent her and her sister to live with their uncle in December 2001, her sister \u201ccould not stand it,\u201d and left after one month. Zheng testified that she had not since heard from her sister and did not know where she was. In contrast, the household register Zheng submitted indicates that her sister had been residing at the Teacher\u2019s College in Licheng District, Quanzhou City, but had \u201cmoved into\u201d Lianjiang County where her parents resided in March 2003. When confronted with this discrepancy, Zheng testified that after her sister \u201cdisappeai\u2019ed,\u201d her family \u201cdid not have any news from her,\u201d and she had \u201cno idea\u201d regarding her sister\u2019s residence at the college or her return to Lianjiang County. Zheng added that when she last mentioned her sister when speaking to her mother over the phone, her mother \u201cbegan to sigh.\u201d The IJ appropriately rejected those explanations. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so). Thus, although the inconsistency relied upon by the IJ was arguably ancillary to Zheng\u2019s asylum claim, it nonetheless supported the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 402 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted) (emphasizing that \u201ceven where an IJ relies on discrepancies or lacunae that, if taken separately, concern matters collateral or ancillary to the claim, ... the cumulative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>effect may nevertheless be deemed consequential by the fact-finder\u201d); <em>see also Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[A]n IJ need not consider the centrality <em>vel non </em>of each individual discrepancy or omission\u201d and can instead \u201crely upon the cumulative impact of such inconsistencies, and may conduct an overall evaluation of testimony in light of its rationality or internal consistency and the manner in which it hangs together with other evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Overall, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly, the denial of asylum was not in error. Because the only evidence of a threat to Zheng\u2019s life or freedom depended upon her credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on her claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Further, because Zheng failed to challenge in her brief to this Court the agency\u2019s denial of her application for relief under the CAT, that claim is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">To the extent that Zheng argues that she has established a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution of people similarly situated to her, we decline to review that issue as she failed to exhaust it by raising it in her brief to the BIA. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 121-22, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (holding that issue exhaustion is mandatory, even if not a jurisdictional requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
