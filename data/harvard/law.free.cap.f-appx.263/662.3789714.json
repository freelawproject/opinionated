Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b684-22\">Louis Dean Cosco, proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to defendants in this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 proceeding. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-23\">Mr. Cosco brought a claim of deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment and three claims alleging impairment of his right to access the courts and/or retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. In a comprehensive order, the district court granted summary judgment on all of Mr. Cosco\u2019s claims. Having reviewed the district court\u2019s decision de novo, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Mr. Cosco, <em>see Hayes v. Mamott, </em>70 F.3d 1144, 1146 (10th Cir.1995), we affirm for substantially the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s March 29, 2007, Order Granting Defendants\u2019 Motions for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Mr. Cosco\u2019s \u201cLetter or Motion,\u201d which the court has construed as a motion for leave to file an amended or supplemental opening brief, is DENIED. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b684-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
