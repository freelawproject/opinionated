Videla, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>(\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Quan Jin Chen a.k.a. Quan Jin Cheng, </em>No. A 78 852 459 (B.I.A. April 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 78 852 459 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, July 15, 2005). Wefassume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). When the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, this Court reviews both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions\u2014or more precisely, the Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision including the portions not explicitly discussed by the BIA. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA emphasized several of the IJ\u2019s findings with respect to his adverse credibility determination, but declined to adopt the IJ\u2019s implausibility finding concerning the significance of the fact that petitioner sent her children to China. Thus, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s decisions, excluding the IJ\u2019s implausibility finding. <em>See Xue Hong Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Belortaja v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 619, 623 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">As the IJ and BIA emphasized, there were multiple inconsistencies in petitioner\u2019s claim of past persecution. Most significantly, her asylum application presented a different explanation for petitioner\u2019s departure from China than she gave in her initial airport interview.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Whereas petitioner now claims that she left China in 2001 because she was forced to have an abortion in 1997, during her airport interview, Chen never mentioned the forced abortion. Instead, she reported that she came to the United States to attend school, because her father had gotten into a fight with someone at her local school. This discrepancy, which petitioner failed to adequately explain, undermines the \u201ccrux\u201d of petitioner\u2019s asylum application. <em>See Zhou Yi Ni v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>424 F.3d 172, 174 (2d Cir.2005). In addition, petitioner could not accurately state how old she was at the time of the abortion. Further, the IJ found that petitioner\u2019s demeanor suggested that she was not testifying from personal experience but rather was reciting a story that she had previously memorized. <em>See Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 401 (2d Cir.2006) (emphasizing that a fact-finder who assesses testimony together with a witness\u2019 demeanor is in the best position to discern whether a witness \u201cwho hesitated in a response was nevertheless attempting truthfully to recount what he recalled of key events or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>struggling to remember the lines of a carefully crafted \u2018script\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We find that the above determinations provide a legitimate ground for the BIA and IJ to deny Chen\u2019s asylum application based on her alleged forced abortion. Accordingly, we need not review the agency\u2019s additional credibility findings. <em>See Zhou Yi Ni, </em>424 F.3d at 174. Moreover, the adverse credibility determination as to the asylum claim necessarily precludes success on Chen\u2019s claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT to the extent that they were based on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">The BIA also properly found that Chen\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence did not support her claim of a well-founded fear of sterilization due to the birth of her two United States citizen children. The record in the instant case does not suggest that remand is warranted because Chen does not present evidence that the birth of her children in the United States violated the family planning policy in her area of residence, or that the implementation of sanctions resulting from any possible violation would rise to the level of persecution, and Chen does not request remand for consideration of evidence not in the record pertaining to the likelihood of her sterilization. <em>See Xiao Xing Ni v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 260 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Matter of J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185, 191 (B.I.A.2007) (calling into question whether children born abroad are counted under China\u2019s family planning policy).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Lastly, because Chen failed to challenge before the BIA the IJ\u2019s frivolousness finding, we decline to review that issue on appeal. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 121-22, 124 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. The IJ reasonably relied on the record of Chen's airport interview because it appears to be a verbatim transcript of Chen\u2019s responses during that interview and reflects that she indicated her understanding of all of the questions posed to her through the interpreter; further, the interview seems to have been designed to elicit the details of any asylum claim, and there is no indication that petitioner did not have a full opportunity to express her actual beliefs and fears. <em>See Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179-80 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
