Bower also appeals the denial of her motion for appointed counsel, and the dismissal of her children as plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-23\">After careful review of the record, we find no error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, <em>see Dulany v. Carnahan, </em>132 F.3d 1234, 1237 (8th Cir.1997) (standard of review), and nothing to support Bower\u2019s contention that the district court judge should have recused himself, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a) (judge is required to disqualify himself in proceedings in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned). We also find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bower\u2019s motion for appointed counsel. <em>See Butler v. Fletcher </em>465 F.3d 340, 346 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review). Thus, the district court did not err in dismissing the claims of Bower\u2019s minor children, as Bower was unable to represent them pro se, see <em>Myers v. Loudoun County Pub. Schs., </em>418 F.3d 395, 401 (4th Cir.2005), but those claims should have been dismissed without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-24\">Accordingly, we affirm, see 8th Cir. R. 47B, but we modify the dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>claims of Bower\u2019s minor children to be without prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-17\">.
