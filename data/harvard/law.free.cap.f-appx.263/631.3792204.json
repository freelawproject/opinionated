Khnkoyan (\u201cKhnkoyan\u201d). The BAP affirmed the U.S. Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision finding Chukhian\u2019s debt nondischargeable under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) and 523(a)(3) and denying Chukhian\u2019s discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(4). It also remanded the issue of prejudgment interest to the bankruptcy court, for either a recalculation of the proper rate or a reasoned justification for awarding interest at the 10 percent rate. Reviewing the decision of the BAP de novo, Price <em>v. U.S. Trustee (In re Price), </em>353 F.3d 1135, 1138 (9th Cir.2004), and conducting an independent review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s rulings, <em>Miller v. Cardinale (In re DeVille), </em>361 F.3d 539, 547 (9th Cir.2004), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">Chukhian raises fourteen claims of error, which we consider, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">1. Khnkoyan\u2019s complaint under \u00a7\u00a7 523 and 727 was timely. Chukhian waived the right to object to the bankruptcy court\u2019s ruling that Khnkoyan\u2019s complaint was timely filed by failing to raise the issue at any time prior to or at trial. That Khnkoyan\u2019s motion for an extension of the deadline for filing a complaint was mentioned in Chukhian\u2019s trial brief, during Khnkoyan\u2019s closing argument and in the bankruptcy court\u2019s oral ruling, did not constitute an objection by Chukhian to the complaint based on a lack of timeliness. Chukhian\u2019s claim that she preserved this issue with her affirmative defense of failure to state a claim lacks merit. <em>See Kantrick v. Ryan, </em>540 U.S. 443, 459-60, 124 S.Ct. 906, 157 L.Ed.2d 867 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">2. The bankruptcy court did not err when it determined Khnkoyan\u2019s claims under \u00a7 523, once it determined that Chukhian would not be entitled to a discharge under \u00a7 727. The eases cited by Chukhian do not urge otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">3. Khnkoyan has standing to bring the action under \u00a7 727, because any question as to the strength of Khnkoyan\u2019s claim goes to its merits, not to its justiciability. Moreover, as a \u201ccreditor,\u201d as defined in \u00a7 101(10)(A), Khnkoyan has standing to object to the dischargeability of her claim pursuant to \u00a7 727(c)(1) which provides that \u201ca creditor ... may object to the granting of a discharge under subsection (a) of this section.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-10\">4. The bankruptcy court did not clearly err in denying Chukhian\u2019s discharge under \u00a7 727(a)(4)(A). <em>See Latman v. Burdette, </em>366 F.3d 774, 781 (9th Cir.2004). Section 727(a)(4)(A) provides that \u201c[t]he court shall grant the debtor a discharge, unless ... the debtor knowingly and fraudulently, in or in connection with the case ... made a false oath or account.\u201d We agree with the BAP that the bankruptcy court correctly found that the errors in Chukhian\u2019s bankruptcy schedules were material and were made knowingly and fraudulently. The court specifically found that Chukhian failed to (1) adequately identify her earnings in the two years preceding and in the partial year leading up to her bankruptcy; (2) identify herself as an officer, director, and shareholder of a corporation during the relevant period; and (3) identify and account for three deposits, totaling $101,000. The bankruptcy judge also found that Chukhian\u2019s testimony lacked credibility and was decidedly evasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-11\">5. The bankruptcy court correctly concluded that Khnkoyan is entitled to a money judgment against Chukhian. The bankruptcy court is entitled to deference as to the sufficiency of the evidence. Even if two views of the evidence are possible, \u201cthe trial judge\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Beauchamp v. Hoose (In re Beauchamp), </em>236 B.R. 727, 729-30 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-12\">6. The bankruptcy court did not clearly err in determining that Chukhian made purposeful misrepresentations to Khnkoyan. <em>See Latman, </em>366 F.3d at 781; <em>Anderson v. Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573-75, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>(1985). The court heard evidence from both sides during a five-day trial and pretrial proceedings spanning over a year. Based on our review of the evidence presented, the court did not err in finding that Chukhian \u201cmisrepresented the transactions for which she borrowed or failed to account adequately for the use of funds\u201d and \u201cmade these borrowings with no intent to repay them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">7. The bankruptcy court did not clearly err in finding that Khnkoyan justifiably relied on Chukhian\u2019s misrepresentations as a result of the trust Khnkoyan had in Chukhian as a friend, colleague, and perhaps mentor, and that Khnkoyan lost her money as a result of her reliance. Reliance may be justified \u201ceven if the falsity of the representation could have been ascertained upon investigation.\u201d <em>Romesh Japra, M.D., F.A.C.C., Inc. v. Apte (In re Apte), </em>180 B.R. 223, 229-30 (B.A.P. 9th Cir.1995) (citing <em>Eugene Parks Law Corp. Defined Benefit Pension Plan v. Kirsh (In re Kirsh), </em>973 F.2d 1454, 1458 (9th Cir.1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">8. The bankruptcy court did not clearly err when it considered the nature of the relationship between the women, including the trust that Khnkoyan placed in Chukhian as a friend and colleague and a person well-regarded by the Armenian community in Los Angeles, in concluding that Khnkoyan\u2019s reliance was justified under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) (providing an exception to discharge \u201cto the extent [the money is] obtained by ... false pretenses, a false representation, or actual fraud\u201d). <em>See Apte, </em>180 B.R. at 230 (\u201cIn considering whether reliance is justifiable, the court must take into account \u2018the knowledge and relationship of the parties.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Kirsh, </em>973 F.2d at 1458)).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">9. The bankruptcy court properly admitted the $325,000 check, written to the order of Khnkoyan and signed by Chukhian, into evidence as an example of a false attempt to repay Khnkoyan. <em>See Latman, </em>366 F.3d at 786 (requiring a finding that the bankruptcy court abused its discretion and that the error was prejudicial in order to reverse on the basis of an erroneous evidentiary ruling). In reaching its conclusion, the court correctly considered and evaluated the ample testimony presented by the parties regarding the check.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-8\">10. The bankruptcy court did not err in concluding that Khnkoyan was owed $433,000, despite Chukhian\u2019s statute of limitations argument. Under California law, Khnkoyan\u2019s cause of action did not \u201caccrue[ ] until the discovery ... of the facts constituting the fraud or mistake,\u201d and there is no evidence that Khnkoyan discovered the facts constituting the fraud at any time prior to the moment when she learned of Chukhian\u2019s bankruptcy filing. Cal. Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 338(d). Also, Chukhian\u2019s reassurances that Khnkoyan would be repaid what she was owed, and her occasional partial repayments acted as a renewal of Chukhian\u2019s obligation. <em>See Alton, v. Rogers, </em>127 Cal.App.2d 667, 679-80, 274 P.2d 487 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-9\">11. The BAP correctly concluded that laches did not bar Khnkoyan\u2019s claim. Any delay in bringing the complaint was neither unreasonable nor prejudicial because Chukhian\u2019s scheme involved partial repayments and promises to pay which kept Khnkoyan mistakenly convinced of Chukhian\u2019s honesty and good faith, and Chukhian, not Khnkoyan, was responsible for the loss of the documents at Chukhian\u2019s former place of employment. <em>See Couveau v. American Airlines, Inc., </em>218 F.3d 1078, 1083 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-10\">12. Because Chukhian\u2019s discharge was appropriately denied under \u00a7 727(a)(4), a count which Khnkoyan undisputedly pled, we need not resolve whether the bankrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>cy court erred in holding that Chukhian\u2019s discharge would be denied under \u00a7 727(a)(2), (a)(3), and (a)(5) because Khnkoyan did not plead such claims for relief in her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">13. Nor do we need to resolve whether the bankruptcy court erred in finding that Chukhian\u2019s post-loan representations qualify as \u201cfalse representations\u201d under \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A) because there is no dispute that Chukhian\u2019s ongoing scheme involved pre-loan representations which fall under the exception of \u00a7 523(a)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">14. Because it is unclear how the bankruptcy court arrived at an award of prejudgment interest at the 10 percent California rate rather than the lower variable federal rate, we affirm the BAP\u2019s remand to the bankruptcy court for either a recalculation of the prejudgment interest, or for a \u201creasoned justification,\u201d as required under <em>Blanton v. Anzalone, </em>813 F.2d 1574, 1576 (9th Cir.1987). <em>See also Banks v. Gill Distrib. Ctrs., Inc. (In re Banks), </em>263 F.3d 862, 871 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Goichman v. Bloom (In re Bloom), </em>875 F.2d 224, 228 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b654-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
