May 24, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A95 473 685 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 26, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-21\">As an initial matter, because Widjaya does not challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his asylum application, we deem that claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Additionally, because Widjaya failed to exhaust the IJ\u2019s denial of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>request for relief under the CAT in his appeal to the BIA, we are without jurisdiction to consider that claim. <em>See Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Beharry v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 51, 59 (2d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155, 159 (2d Cir.2004). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Widjaya did not suffer past persecution in Indonesia on account of his religion or race. Indeed, Widjaya testified that he was never arrested in Indonesia, was never detained or harmed by the government, and, apart from being hit by his schoolmates, was never physically harmed by anyone. The IJ properly concluded that these childhood taunts and fights suffered by Widjaya, without more, do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (finding that the harm must be sufficiently severe, rising above \u201cmere harassment.\u201d); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 127. To the extent that Widjaya argues that his uncle\u2019s home being burned supports his claim of past persecution, the IJ properly found that this does not support Widjaya\u2019s claim of past persecution. <em>See Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.3d 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cA petitioner who has \u2018not personally experienced persecution ... on a protected ground\u2019 is ineligible to obtain withholding of removal relief.\u201d) (citing <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 306).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Additionally, Widjaya argues that the IJ erred by failing to consider the background materials in the record in making its determination. We will vacate agency findings of no past persecution if the agency fails to consider the entire record, including background reports material to an applicant\u2019s claim. <em>Jorge-Tzoc v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 146, 150 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 272-73 (2d Cir.2005). At the same time, however, summary analysis may sometimes be sufficient, and we do not require the agency to provide a detailed analysis of all pieces of evidence. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338, n. 17 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[W]e presume that an IJ has taken into account all of the evidence before him, unless the record compellingly suggests otherwise.\u201d). Contrary to Widjaya\u2019s argument, the IJ found that Widjaya failed to submit \u201cevidence to show that there\u2019s been a significant escalation in persecution or violence directed at ethnic Chinese.\u201d The IJ also found that he \u201ccould not find <em>on this record </em>that [Widjaya] has established a likelihood of harm to himself on return to Indonesia.\u201d Additionally, Widjaya has not cited or pointed to any background evidence in the record that the IJ failed to consider that would materially affect his eligibility for withholding of removal. Because the IJ considered the entire record, and because the record does not \u201ccompelling suggest[]\u201d that the IJ failed to take into account all the evidence before him, we find that Widjaya\u2019s argument is without merit. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 338 n. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Moreover, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that Widjaya failed to show that it is more likely than not that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened\u201d in Indonesia on account of his race or religion. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1); <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). The IJ properly found that Widjaya\u2019s claim of future persecution was undermined given his testimony that his similarly situated parents continue to attend church in Indonesia without any problems and that his sister is a full-time reverend and evangelist at a church in Indonesia who also has not suffered any problems there. <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999) (finding that where asylum applicant\u2019s mother and daughters continued to live in petitioner\u2019s native country, claim of well-founded fear was diminished); <em>see also Matter of A-E-M- </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1157, 1160 (BIA 1998) (finding that applicant lacked a well-founded fear in part, because his family members remained unharmed in Peru since his departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Finally, Widjaya argues that he need not show that he will be singled out for persecution in the future because the evidence in the record demonstrates a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution\u201d of ethnic Chinese Christians in Indonesia. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2)(I). Here, unlike our recent decision in <em>Mufied v. Mukasey </em>in which we required remand so that the BIA could consider in the first instance Mufied\u2019s pattern and practice claim, the IJ addressed this claim in the first instance. <em>Mufied v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 88 (2d Cir.2007). The IJ specifically applied <em>Matter of A-M-, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 737 (BIA 2005) to Widjaya\u2019s case and held that he should not benefit from a presumption of future persecution based on an alleged \u201cpattern and practice\u201d of persecution. In <em>Matter of A-M-, </em>the BIA held that while reports on conditions in Indonesia indicate that there are \u201c \u2018instances of discrimination and harassment\u2019 \u201d against ethnic Chinese Christians, such reports \u201cdo[ ] not describe persecution so systemic or pervasive as to amount to a pattern or practice of persecution.\u201d 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 741. Therefore, the IJ\u2019s determination that Widjaya had not met his burden of proof for withholding of removal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED, in part, and dismissed, in part. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
