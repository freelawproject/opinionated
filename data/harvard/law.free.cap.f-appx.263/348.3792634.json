We order a limited remand for factual findings relating to whether FOE and CLEAN (together, \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) continue to have standing to prosecute this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">The CWA provides that \u201c[ejxcept as in compliance with [the Act], the discharge of any pollutant by any person shall be unlawful.\u201d 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1311(a) (West 2001). The Act established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cNPDES\u201d) to authorize the issuance of permits for the discharge of limited quantities of effluents, <em>see </em>33 U.S.CA. \u00a7 1342 (West 2001 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2007), and individual states are allowed to issue NPDES permits with the approval of the Environmental Protection Agency, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 1342(b). The State of South Carolina has established an NPDES program administered by the Department of Health and Environmental Control (\u201cDHEC\u201d). <em>See </em>S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 48-1-100 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-16\">The CWA is subject to private enforcement as well as public enforcement, in that \u201cany citizen may commence a civil action on his own behalf ... against any person ... alleged to be in violation of ... an effluent standard or limitation under this chapter.\u201d 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1365(a) (West 2001). Proof of liability may result in an award of injunctive relief and the imposition of civil penalties payable to the United States treasury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b371-17\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">Gaston is a South Carolina corporation that owned and operated a metals smelting plant in Gaston, South Carolina. When Gaston purchased the plant in 1990, it was already covered by an NPDES permit issued to the prior owner. The permit allowed Gaston to discharge non-contact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>cooling water and treated stormwater into the Boggy Branch of Bull Swamp Creek. Boggy Branch is a tributary of Bull Swamp Creek, which, in turn, flows into the North Fork of the Edisto River. The permit set effluent limitations and monitoring requirements and required quarterly reporting of the monitoring results. Gaston continued to operate under the original permit until March 1,1991, when a new permit was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The new permit contained Phase I limits, which were effective from March 1, 1991, to May 31, 1992, and Phase II limits, which were effective from June 1, 1992, until expiration of the permit. The Phase I effluent limits were largely the same as those of the previous permit. They applied to total suspended solids, oil and grease, iron, cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, nickel, zinc, and polychlorinated biphenyls (\u201cPCBs\u201d). They also contained limits on \u201cflow,\u201d meaning the amount of wastewater that could be discharged per day. The Phase II limits were stricter for cadmium, copper, lead, mercury, zinc, and pH, and contained a limitation on biochemical oxygen demand (\u201cBOD\u201d). The permit contained specific requirements for monitoring and reporting and included a schedule of compliance for Gaston to satisfy its Phase II effluent limits. That schedule required Gaston to submit a preliminary \u00e9ngineering report by March 31, 1991; submit final plans and specifications by September 1, 1991, for any waste water treatment plant upgrade needed to meet Phase II discharge limits; and meet those Phase II limits by June 1, 1992. The 1991 permit remained in effect until June 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Despite the September 1, 1991, deadline, Gaston did not submit the required final plans and specifications detailing its planned improvements until December 23, 1991. DHEC approved the plans in May 1992 and issued a draft permit modification, moving back the effective date of the Phase II effluent limits until March 14, 1993. Following a public hearing regarding the proposed modification, DHEC modified the permit in March 1993 to require compliance with the Phase II limits by April 2, 1993. Gaston began building its wastewater treatment upgrade in mid-July 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">On July 13, 1992, Plaintiffs sent Gaston a letter (\u201cthe notice letter\u201d) alleging that Gaston had violated and continued to violate its permit\u2019s requirements \u201cin at least the instances set forth in [an] attached chronological list of permit violations.\u201d J.A. 485. The attached list identified a total of eight violations of Phase I effluent limitations from July 1990 to September 1991 for flow, mercury, and PCBs. The letter further alleged that \u201c[i]n addition to the attached list of violations, there appear to be instances in which the facility has failed to comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements of the permit. However, the extent of these violations cannot be determined from the information available.\u201d J.A. 485. The letter also informed Gaston that it had failed to meet its deadline for submitting its final plans and specifications to meet the Phase II limitations and failed to make modifications to its facility to meet the Phase II limits by June 1, 1992. It alleged that, as a result, \u201cin June 1992, the facility will have violated its permit limits at least as to pH, copper, PCBs, and mercury.\u201d J.A. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Plaintiffs subsequently filed this citizens suit complaint on September 14, 1992, alleging that Gaston had been discharging pollutants into a South Carolina waterway in violation of the terms of its permit in that it had failed to comply with its discharge limits, failed to monitor and report its discharge properly, and failed to adhere to its compliance schedule. Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as the imposition of civil penalties and other statutory relief. In its answer, Gaston denied Plaintiffs\u2019 principal allegations and asserted that Plaintiffs lacked standing to prosecute the action. At the conclusion of a six-day bench trial, Gaston also argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that Plaintiffs had failed to prove any violations of which they had provided the statutorily required notice prior to filing suit. <em>See </em>83 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1365(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The district court declined to rule on the merits of the suit and instead dismissed the complaint for lack of standing. The district court determined that Plaintiffs failed to show that any of their members had suffered an injury fairly traceable to Gaston\u2019s challenged conduct. <em>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., </em>9 F.Supp.2d 589, 600-01 (D.S.C.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">A divided panel of this court affirmed on appeal. <em>See Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Gasto7b Copper Recycling Corp., </em>179 F.3d 107, 116 (4th Cir.1999). However, we subsequently granted rehearing en banc and reversed the district court decision, holding that CLEAN had established standing through its member Wilson Shealy. <em>See Friends of the EaRh, Inc. v. Gaston Copper Recycling Corp., </em>204 F.3d 149, 155-64 (4th Cir.2000) (en banc). We remanded to the district court for further proceedings, including reconsideration of whether FOE also had standing in light of the then-recently issued <em>Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., </em>528 U.S. 167, 120 S.Ct. 693, 145 L.Ed.2d 610 (2000). <em>See Gaston Copper Recycling, </em>204 F.3d at 161 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">On remand, the district court found that Gaston violated its effluent limitations for a total of 91 days. Phase I discharge violations found by the district court concerned levels of pH, cadmium, zinc, and iron, while Phase II discharge violations concerned the same pollutants as well as oil and grease and copper. However, the court determined that because DHEC had agreed to delay the effective date of the Phase II effluent limits, Gaston was not required to comply with those stricter limits until April 2, 1993, and thus was not liable either for exceedances of those limits or failures to report such exceedances pri- or to that date. The court also found 396 monitoring violations and 323 violations for failing to report discharge exceedances and monitoring violations. Finally, the court found that Gaston violated its schedule of compliance for 54 days. Finding that Gaston had made a good-faith effort to comply with its permit and that it obtained no economic benefit from its noncompliance, the district court imposed a civil penalty of $2,340,000 and required Gaston to pay Plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The district court entered final judgment on July 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">Several post-trial motions followed. On July 23, 2003, Gaston moved to amend the judgment with a filing that stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">Defendant moves the Court, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 52(b) and 59(e), to amend its findings of fact and alter or amend its judgment in accordance therewith. This Motion will be supported by a memorandum which will be submitted in the time frame established by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-11\">J.A. 238. On the same date Gaston moved for an extension of time to file an accompanying memorandum. The district court granted the extension on July 30, 2003. Then, on August 1, 2003, Gaston filed a motion (\u201cthe notice motion\u201d) in which Gaston asked the district court to alter or amend its findings on the grounds that \u201cthe Court erred in calculating the civil penalty amount by including matters not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>covered by the notice letter served by the plaintiffs.\u201d J.A. 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">Plaintiffs and Gaston both also made post-trial motions relating to standing. On August 1, 2003, Plaintiffs moved to amend the judgment pursuant to Rules 52(b) and 59(e) to reflect that Shealy had died prior to the judgment but that Plaintiffs continued to have standing through FOE and CLEAN member Jones and FOE member McCullough. Plaintiffs requested that if the district court was unable to conclude based on the then-existing record that both Plaintiffs continued to have standing, Plaintiffs should be allowed to supplement the record. Plaintiffs sought to present affidavits from Shealy\u2019s widow and son asserting that they were members of CLEAN and adopting Shealy\u2019s testimony as their own. Plaintiffs also sought to present an affidavit from Jones describing his continued use of the E disto River since the trial. Gaston opposed Plaintiffs\u2019 motion and moved on August 29, 2003, for relief from the judgment on the ground that Plaintiffs no longer had standing to prosecute this case after Shealy\u2019s death (\u201cthe Rule 60 motion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">On September 16, 2005, the district court granted Plaintiffs\u2019 August 1, 2003, motion to amend the judgment to reflect that Shealy had died but that Plaintiffs continued to have standing through Jones and McCullough. Apparently in light of that ruling, the district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 request to supplement the record. On May 22, 2006, the district court denied Gaston\u2019s motions challenging the amount of the civil penalty and claiming that Plaintiffs no longer had standing after Shealy\u2019s death. Gaston then filed a notice of appeal on June 20, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">While Gaston\u2019s appeal was pending, Plaintiffs filed a motion in this court seeking dismissal of the appeal except insofar as it challenged the district court\u2019s denial of the Rule 60 motion. We deferred ruling on this motion until after oral argument. We now deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">As we have explained, the district court entered judgment against Gaston on July 21, 2003. It is undisputed that Plaintiffs\u2019 August 1, 2003, Rule 52(b)/59(e) motion tolled the time for appealing. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(4). Because the district court granted this motion by order entered September 16, 2005, Plaintiffs contend that the time for appealing expired 30 days from that date. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(l)(A)(ii). Since Gaston did not appeal by that time, Plaintiffs argue that we lack jurisdiction to consider an appeal of the judgment and possess jurisdiction to review only the denial of its Rule 60 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">Gaston notes, however, that it had filed the notice motion on August 1, 2003, within 10 court days of entry of the judgment. Gaston argues that its motion also tolled the time for appealing the final judgment, <em>see </em>Fed. RApp. P. 4(a)(4), just as Plaintiffs\u2019 motion tolled the appeal period. Because the notice motion was not denied until May 22, 2006, and because Gaston filed its notice of appeal within 30 days of that denial, Gaston maintains its appeal of the final judgment was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">Plaintiffs respond, in turn, that the notice motion was insufficient under Rule 7 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to toll the time for filing an appeal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-12\">Rule 7(b) requires that a motion \u201cshall state with particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 7(b)(1). Although Rule 7(b) applies to motions under Rule 59, Rule 7 \u201cdoes not require ritualistic detail but rather a fair indication to court and counsel of the substance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>grounds relied on.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 advisory committee\u2019s note (1966 amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">The Appendix of Forms contained within the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides examples of documents that \u201care sufficient under the rules.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 84. These forms \u201care intended to indicate the simplicity and brevity of statement which the rules contemplate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Form 19 illustrates the liberal standard the rules impose for determining the sufficiency of motions and thus confirms the sufficiency of the notice motion. For example, Form 19 shows that a motion to dismiss is sufficiently detailed if it seeks dismissal \u201cbecause the complaint fails to state a claim against defendant upon which relief can be granted.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P.App. Form 19.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-6\">Here, Gaston\u2019s motion stated, Defendant moves the Court, pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 52(b) and 59(e), to amend its findings of fact and alter or amend its judgment in accordance therewith. The grounds for this Motion are that the Court erred in calculating the civil penalty amount by including matters not covered by the notice letter served by the plaintiffs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">J.A. 266. This motion clearly provided <em>more </em>specificity than Appendix Form 19 regarding the description of the legal basis for the motion.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Additionally, the record reflects that long before judgment was entered against it, Gaston fully articulated its position (in proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law) that Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to provide adequate notice prevented the court from finding Gaston liable for any of the violations eventually found by the district court. <em>See </em>J.A. 62-67. Under these circumstances, no purpose would be served by requiring Gaston to restate this position in its post-trial motion. We therefore hold that the motion was sufficient under Rule 7(b), that it tolled the time for appealing the final judgment, and that Gaston\u2019s appeal of the final judgment was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">We now turn to Gaston\u2019s jurisdictional challenge. Gaston contends that the district court erred in holding that Plaintiffs continued to have standing to prosecute this suit after Shealy\u2019s death prior to the entry of judgment. We remand to the district court for further proceedings regarding this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">Article III of the Constitution restricts federal court jurisdiction to the resolution of \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies,\u201d and the requirements of establishing Article III standing enforce this jurisdictional restriction. See <em>Elk Grove Unified Sch. Disk v. Newdow, </em>542 U.S. 1, 11, 124 S.Ct. 2301, 159 L.Ed.2d 98 (2004). \u201cThe standing requirement is designed to guarantee that the plaintiff has a sufficient personal stake in the outcome of a dispute to render judicial resolution of it appropriate.\u201d <em>Emery v. Roanoke City Sch. Bd., </em>432 F.3d 294, 298 (4th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). When a plaintiff dies and no other plaintiff maintains a continuing interest in the litigation, the federal courts no longer have jurisdiction over the case. <em>See Laidlaw Envtl. Sens., </em>528 U.S. at 192, 120 S.Ct. 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">Here, Plaintiffs are both associations consisting of their individual members. An association has</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-14\">standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>protect are germane to the organization\u2019s purpose; and, (c) neither the claim asserted, nor the relief requested, requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><em>Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm\u2019n, </em>432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). There is no dispute in this case regarding the latter two elements. The jurisdictional issue here involves only the first element. The question, then, is whether any of the Plaintiffs\u2019 members satisfies the general requirements for individual standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">To demonstrate that its members have standing, an organization bears the burden of proving that: 1) at least one of its members has suffered an actual or threatened injury; 2) the injury is \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to the defendant\u2019s actions; and 3) the injury will likely be redressed if it prevails in the lawsuit. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">The Supreme Court has made clear that a plaintiff need not show a traditional trespass on property or tortious injury to satisfy the actual-or-threatened-injury requirement. <em>See Gaston Copper Recycling, </em>204 F.3d at 154. Rather, damage to an individual\u2019s \u201caesthetic or recreational interests\u201d may be sufficient. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201cbecause these and other noneconomic interests may be widely shared, the Supreme Court has cautioned that environmental plaintiffs must themselves be \u2018among the injured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Otherwise, the case or controversy requirement would be essentially meaningless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Gaston maintains that Plaintiffs have not established that them members are \u201camong the injured\u201d because they have not shown that the members have the proper connection to the affected water. We conclude that the record is not sufficiently clear for us to decide whether that is true.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">According to his testimony, Jones, a member of CLEAN and FOE, is a retailer of canoes, kayaks, and other outdoor equipment and provides canoe trips for the general public. His business takes canoe trips that he often leads on the Edisto River downstream from Gaston\u2019s discharge point. Jones testified that guides on a canoe trip tend to go into the water, as do the clients. Clients also picnic and fish. Jones testified that he was concerned about the quality of the rivers in which he canoes because his \u201cbusiness is very much dependent upon the public\u2019s perception that water quality is good.\u201d J.A. 446. Regarding his understanding of water quality, Jones testified that \u201con the Edisto the heavy metals that may be present from the Gaston Copper plant pose a very real concern.\u201d J.A. 446. Jones stated that his belief regarding the amount of pollution in the river affected his enjoyment of canoeing and swimming in that he had \u201cgreater confidence in [his] ability to market [his] trips to the general public when [he was] taking people into an area [where] they [would] have a quality experience and [where] their health is going to be not threatened by the quality of the water.\u201d JA. 447. Jones stated that in light of the pollution that may be flowing from Gaston\u2019s plant, he was \u201cconcerned\u201d about the quality of the water at issue even \u201caside from [his] business interests.\u201d J.A. 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">McCullough, an FOE member, testified that he boated and scuba-dived in \u201cPond Pond,\u201d J.A. 452, and that he was planning to dive again downstream from that area. He testified that he planned to go canoeing on the Edisto in Colleton State Park. He described both locations as being downstream1 of Edisto\u2019s North Fork. When asked about whether he was concerned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>about the quality of the water in which he boated and went scuba-diving, McCullough stated that he \u201cwould like to dive in water that is relatively clean\u201d and that he was \u201cconcerned about all waters in South Carolina that [he went scuba-diving in] having contaminants, especially heavy metals [and] pesticide runoff.\u201d J.A. 458. He said that if he knew water contained contaminants, he would be less likely to dive in it and if he \u201cthought the water was polluted, [he] would be less likely to go canoeing in that particular spot and ... would go to a different spot that [he believed] would be less polluted or not polluted at all.\u201d J.A. 455.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Gaston argues that Jones\u2019s and McCullough\u2019s <em>concern </em>for the water they use is not a sufficiently concrete injury to establish standing in the absence of evidence that the water quality was actually affected. We disagree. A plaintiff is not required to present \u201cadditional scientific proof [of actual harm to the environment] where there was a direct nexus between the claimant and the area of environmental impairment.\u201d <em>Gaston Copper </em>Recycling, 204 F.3d at 159. That point is illustrated by <em>Sierra Club v. Cedar Point Oil Co., </em>73 F.3d 546 (5th Cir.1996), a decision we cited with approval in our previous en banc opinion in the present case, <em>see Gaston Copper Recycling, </em>204 F.3d at 159-60. There, the Fifth Circuit held that citizens\u2019 concern about water quality in Galveston Bay sufficed as injury in fact where \u201c[t]wo of the affiants live near Galveston Bay and all of them use the bay for recreational activities.\u201d <em>Cedar Point Oil Co., </em>73 F.3d at 556. The court held that it was sufficient that \u201cthe affiants expressed fear that the discharge ... will impair their enjoyment of these activities because these activities are dependent upon good water quality.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Relying on <em>Friends of the Earth v. Crown Central Petroleum Corp., </em>95 F.3d 358 (5th Cir.1996), Gaston also contends that Jones\u2019s and McCullough\u2019s testimony was insufficient to establish standing. In <em>Lujan, </em>the Supreme Court explained that a \u201cplaintiff claiming injury from environmental damage must use the area affected by the challenged activity and not an area roughly \u2018in the vicinity\u2019 of it.\u201d <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 565-66, 112 S.Ct. 2130. In <em>Crown Central, </em>the Fifth Circuit applied that principle to conclude that downstream users located 18 miles and three tributaries from the point of discharge could not establish standing since injury could not be fairly traceable to a discharger based simply on the \u201ctruism that water flows downstream.\u201d <em>Crown Cent., </em>95 F.3d at 361. Gaston argues here that Plaintiffs have established only that their members used water downstream of the point to which its discharge flowed, and that that is not sufficient to satisfy the <em>Lujan </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">We are unable, considering the current state of the record, to determine whether Plaintiffs\u2019 members have a sufficient connection to the affected area. In our previous en banc decision in this case, we held that CLEAN established standing because Shealy owned a home and lake four miles downstream from Gaston\u2019s discharge and \u201cthat Gaston Copper\u2019s discharges can impact the receiving waterway for a good distance downstream\u2014well past Shealy\u2019s property and on down to the Edisto River itself.\u201d <em>Gaston Copper Recycling, </em>204 F.3d at 158. In reaching that conclusion, we relied primarily on evidence of an official written response from DHEC to the owner of a piece of property at the location where Bull Swamp Creek flows into the Edisto River. The owner asked if the runoff would reach his property. The response stated that the runoff would, in fact, \u201cgo to Boggy Branch to Bull Swamp to the Edisto River\u201d and added that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>confluence of Bull Swamp and the Edisto River is 16.5 miles [from the polluting facility].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 158 (internal quotation marks &amp; alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Regarding Jones, Plaintiffs established that Gaston\u2019s runoff flowed into the North Fork of the Edisto River and that Jones used waters of the Edisto\u2019s North Fork. Concerning which part of the North Fork Jones used, Jones testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">[W]e canoe from the main stem, an area that is described as Green Pond Church, to Colleton State Parta Another area is from Shill\u2019s ... Bridge to the Edisto Gardens in Orangeburg, and another is from a location called Rowesville down to a location called Branchville.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">J.A. 442-43. Jones testified that he believed that all of these areas were downstream of Bull Swamp Creek. Like Jones, McCullough did not specifically testify that he had used, or even planned to use, waters between Gaston\u2019s facility and the Bull Swamp Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Gaston observes that in our previous en banc decision, we stated that the confluence of Bull Swamp Creek and the Edisto River was \u201cthe acknowledged outer perimeter of the discharge zone,\u201d <em>Gaston Copper Recycling, </em>204 F.3d at 158. Gaston maintains that because Jones\u2019s and McCullough\u2019s use of the North Fork was downstream of that confluence, they used waters only \u201croughly \u2018in the vicinity\u2019 of\u2019 the affected area. <em>Lujan, </em>504 U.S. at 566, 112 S.Ct. 2130. Gaston\u2019s argument fails to take into account the context of the statement on which it relies. The DHEC response that we referenced in our previous opinion did not purport to identify the <em>farthest </em>point downstream to which the runoff proceeded. Rather, it addressed only whether the runoff proceeded <em>as far as </em>the confluence of Bull Swamp Creek and the North Fork of the Edisto River. DHEC acknowledged that it did proceed that far, and DHEC had no reason to discuss to what extent the runoff proceeded further. Thus, our description of the confluence as the \u201cacknowledged outer perimeter of the discharge zone\u201d conveyed only that it was the farthest point that DHEC had acknowledged the runoff proceeded, not that DHEC acknowledged that that was the farthest point the runoff reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">The problem we are left with, however, is that we cannot determine whether Jones or McCullough had the requisite connection to waters in the affected area without knowing either that they used the waters at the confluence of Bull Swamp Creek and the Edisto\u2019s North Fork or knowing how much farther beyond the confluence that the runoff proceeded and where, in relation to this point, the waters that Jones and McCullough used and planned to use were. We therefore order a limited remand so that the district court may resolve these factual issues. Because the scope of our remand is narrow and this case has been pending for such a very long time, we request a response from the district court as soon as is practical.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">In sum, we deny Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial dismissal of this appeal, and we order a limited remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">\n<em>REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-8\"> Plaintiffs contend that a Rule 52(b)/59(e) motion must state its grounds more specifically than a 12(b)(6) motion, but we know of no reason why that would be the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
