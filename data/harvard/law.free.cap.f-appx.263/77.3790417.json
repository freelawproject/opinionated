REENA RAGGI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b99-25\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b99-26\">Brandon Miles appeals from a judgment of conviction entered October 18, 2006, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>pursuant to a conditional guilty plea in which Miles retained the right to challenge the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress evidence. On appeal, Miles challenges the district court\u2019s ruling that the search of his person conducted on February 1, 2005, which uncovered the contraband that was the basis of his conviction, did not violate the Fourth Amendment. We assume the parties\u2019 and counsel\u2019s familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case, and with the issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Miles contends that the search method employed violated the scope of the search authorized by <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), because the police officer squeezed Miles\u2019s pockets from the outside rather than using an open-palmed patdown technique to search for weapons. Under some circumstances, a law enforcement officer\u2019s use of clutching fingers for a patdown during a <em>Terry </em>stop, resulting in the discovery of a relatively small amount of contraband rather than a weapon, might well give' rise to Fourth Amendment concerns. We need not reach that issue here, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">The district court found that Miles consented to the search when, upon being asked whether he had any weapons, he answered, \u201cNo, you can check me,\u201d and put his hands in the air. A search conducted pursuant to voluntary consent is one of the exceptions to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that the government obtain a judicial warrant prior to a search. <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamante, </em>412 U.S. 218, 219, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973). The scope of a defendant\u2019s consent to a search is a question of fact, <em>United States v. Gandia, </em>424 F.3d 255, 265 (2d Cir.2005), which we therefore review for clear error, <em>see United States v. Garcia, </em>339 F.3d 116, 118-19 (2d Cir.2003). We conclude that the district court\u2019s conclusion as to the voluntary nature of the consent and its scope was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
