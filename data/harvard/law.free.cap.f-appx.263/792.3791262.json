The BIA noted that the IJ extensively questioned Mareano and her attorney, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>determined that the questioning did not exceed the IJ\u2019s authority. The BIA also concluded that the IJ\u2019s concerns over the similarity between Marcano\u2019s claims and the claims of another applicant (Brito) did not constitute bias or prejudicial conduct. Moreover, the BIA noted that there was no evidence that the IJ relied upon extrajudicial material in deciding the case. The BIA affirmed the decision, including the IJ\u2019s substantive removal decision, after concluding that the IJ\u2019s conduct did not demonstrate bias or prejudice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">\u201cWhen the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Lopez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1341, 1344 (11th Cir.2007). Here, the BIA expressly addressed Marcano\u2019s claims of bias. We, therefore, review the BIA\u2019s decision. We review legal and constitutional claims <em>de novo, </em>including claims of due process violations. <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Recusal of an IJ is warranted if it is shown that \u201cthe immigration judge had a personal, rather than judicial, bias stemming from an extrajudicial source which resulted in an opinion on the merits on some basis other than what the immigration judge learned from his participation in the case.\u201d <em>Matter of Exame, </em>18 I. &amp; N. Dec. 303, 306 (BIA 1982) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cAn exception to the general rule that bias must stem from an extrajudicial source may arise where such pervasive bias and prejudice is shown by otherwise judicial conduct as would constitute bias against a party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). The IJ may interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the asylum applicant and any witnesses during the proceeding. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201copinions formed by the judge on the basis of ... events occurring in the course of the current proceedings ... do not constitute a basis for a bias or partiality motion unless they display a deep-seated favoritism or antagonism that would make fair judgment impossible.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 1157, 127 L.Ed\u00fcd 474 (1994) (in the context of a district court proceeding). \u201c[J]udicial remarks during the course of a trial that are critical or disapproving of ... counsel, the parties, or their cases, ordinarily do not support a bias or partiality challenge.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">An IJ must \u201cconsider the issues raised and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006) (citation and quotation marks omitted) (in the context of withholding-of-removal applications). We will not require the IJ to address specifically each claim and each piece of evidence where it makes adequate findings and gives reasoned consideration to the motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">In this case, the BIA did not err in affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of Marcano\u2019s motion to recuse and concluding that Marcano received a full and fair hearing because there was no evidence that the IJ violated Marcano\u2019s due process rights due to (1) an inherent bias against Marcano, (2) an insufficient ruling on the motion to recuse, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>or (3) improper questioning of witnesses and attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-7\">. Marcano does not appeal the merits portion of the BIA's order affirming the IJ's denial of her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Thus, these issues are deemed abandoned. <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir.2005). Rather, Marcano's appeal focuses on her due process claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
