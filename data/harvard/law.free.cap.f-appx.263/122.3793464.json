Nelson, denying Zhang\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zhang, </em>No. A 95 688 033 (B.I.A. Apr. 30, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A 95 688 033 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 22, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its factfinding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that Zhang failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing eligibility for asylum. The INA provides that a person who has been forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo involuntary sterilization, or who has been persecuted for failure or refusal to undergo such a procedure is deemed to have been persecuted on account of political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). We have held, however, that an applicant does not establish past persecution on the basis of the forced abortion or sterilization of a parent. <em>See Shoo Yan Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>417 F.3d 303, 305 (2d Cir.2005); <em>see also Ai Feng Yuan v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 192, 197 (2d Cir.2005)(holding that parents and in-laws of people persecuted under a coercive family planning policy are not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum), <em>ove'iTuled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">In her brief, Zhang invites us to overrule our decision in <em>Ai Feng Yuan, </em>in which we held that one is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum on the basis of her children\u2019s persecution under a coercive family planning policy. Indeed, that decision has already been overruled in part to the extent it could be read to find that the spouse of a person who suffered a forced abortion or sterilization is per se eligible for asylum. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 305. In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>we determined that \u201capplicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308. We further held that individuals who had not themselves undergone the procedures must seek relief under the two remaining categories of INA \u00a7 601(a), providing protection to applicants who demonstrate persecution based on their \u201cother resistance to a coercive population control program\u201d or \u201ca well-founded fear that he or she will be ... subject to persecution for such, resistance ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309-10 (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)). Relying directly on that holding, we subsequently held that one is not <em>per se </em>eligible for asylum based upon his or her parent\u2019s harm under a coercive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>family planning policy, thus reinforcing the continuing vitality of <em>Shao Yan Chen </em>and <em>Ai Feng Yuan. See Too Jiang v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 137, 141 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Here, there is no evidence that Zhang personally was harmed under the family planning policy where she acknowledged that she is single, has no children and was never personally threatened with sterilization. Moreover, she has failed to demonstrate any \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy. <em>See Shi Liang Lin, </em>494 F.3d at 309-10. As Zhang no longer argues that leaving China illegally constituted \u201cother resistance\u201d to the family planning policy, we deem that argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal in the absence of manifest injustice).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">As to Zhang\u2019s claimed fear of future persecution, the agency properly found that such fear was not well-founded where she was not married, had no children, and was not pregnant. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that, absent solid support in the record for the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be subjected to forced sterilization, his fear was \u201cspeculative at best\u201d even though his wife was pregnant with their second child); <em>see also INS v. Cardozar-Fonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (noting that a .well-founded fear does not require high probability of persecution, but does require \u201can objective situation ... established by the evidence\u201d); <em>cf. Rui Ying Lin v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 127 (2d Cir. 2006) (finding that substantial evidence did not support the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the petitioner\u2019s claim was \u201ctoo speculative\u201d where record evidence supported that \u201cshe already had two children, that she planned to have more, that she had gone to great lengths to avoid being sterilized in China, and that she had removed her IUD after escaping to the United States\u201d). Accordingly, the agency properly denied Zhang\u2019s application for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Because Zhang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on her claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Gomez v. INS, </em>947 F.2d 660, 665 (2d Cir.1991). Similarly, to the extent her claim for CAT relief was dependent upon the same factual predicate underlying her asylum and withholding of removal claims, the agency properly found that there was no evidence demonstrating that it was more likely than not that Zhang would be tortured if returned to China. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005); <em>cf. Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 184-85 (2d Cir.2004). To the extent Zhang argued before the agency that she would face persecution or torture on account of her illegal departure from China, she has not raised that argument in her brief before this Court. Accordingly, we deem that argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
