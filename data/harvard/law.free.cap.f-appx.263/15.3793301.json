U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>504 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2007). After careful review, we discern no such abuse of the BIA\u2019s discretion and, accordingly, affirm the denial of DeSa\u2019s motion to reconsider.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-22\">\u201cA motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for the motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior [BIA] decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>A motion to reconsider that merely restates the arguments that the BIA previously rejected provides no reason for the BIA to change its prior decision. <em>See Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1329 (citation omitted). \u201cTherefore, merely reiterating arguments previously presented to the BIA does not constitute \u2018specifying ... errors of fact or lav/ as required for a successful motion to reconsider.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying DeSa\u2019s motion to reconsider. In the motion, DeSa argued, in relevant part, that the BIA erred in its dismissal order by failing to examine all of DeSa\u2019s proffered reasons for missing his removal hearing before the IJ, including that he never received two notices of the hearing, and that he had changed addresses and timely notified the IJ of his new address. Contrary to this argument, in its dismissal order, the BIA specifically considered and rejected DeSa\u2019s argument that he provided a change-of-address form to the immigration court and missed the hearing through no fault of his own. Moreover, the remainder of his arguments in the motion to reconsider \u201coffered nothing more than reiteration of [his] assertions in [his] motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Calle, </em>504 F.3d at 1331. Therefore, he did not \u201cadequately specify errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s denial of [his] motion to reopen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1)). As a result, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding no error of fact or law in its previous order dismissing DeSa\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b37-16\">. Our review is limited to the BIA\u2019s April 24, 2007 order denying DeSa's motion to reconsider. Although DeSa raises arguments concerning the IJ\u2019s order denying his motion to reopen his case and the BIA's order dismissing his appeal of the IJ's decision, DeSa never timely petitioned this Court for review of those orders. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1) (providing that petitions for review of removal orders be filed within 30 days of the order); <em>see Jaggernauth v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>432 F.3d 1346, 1350-51 (11th Cir.2005) (observing that the filing of a motion to reconsider does not affect the finality of the underlying order or toll the 30-day period for petitioning for review of such order). As a result, we lack jurisdiction to review those orders. <em>Dakane v. U.S. Atty\u2019 Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (time limits for judicial review are mandatory and jurisdictional and are not tolled by the filing of a motion to reopen or for reconsideration).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
