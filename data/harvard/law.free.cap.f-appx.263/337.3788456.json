Russell\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting, in his opinion, there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but raising the issue of whether Russell received ineffective assistance of counsel in presenting his objections to the presentence report in view of counsel\u2019s job change while representing him. Russell'was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">Adopting the findings and guideline calculations in the presentence report, the district court determined Russell\u2019s advisory guideline range was 292 to 365 months, and his mandatory minimum sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) (2000) was twenty years in prison. The court granted the Government\u2019s motion for a downward departure based on Russell\u2019s substantial assistance, and granted Russell\u2019s counsel\u2019s request that he be sentenced to the low end of his departure range. On appeal, <em>Anders </em>counsel notes that Russell filed his own pro se objections to the presentence report, and his trial attorney moved to withdraw after accepting a position with a public defender\u2019s office and receiving notice that Russell\u2019s sentencing would be continued to a date after he left his private law practice. However, the district court denied the motion to withdraw, and <em>Anders </em>counsel concludes that Russell\u2019s sentence is reflective of a significant benefit from his attorney\u2019s representation. We may address a claim of ineffective assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>tance on direct appeal only if the lawyer\u2019s ineffectiveness conclusively appears from the record. <em>See United States v. Baldovinos, </em>434 F.3d 233, 239 (4th Cir.2006). We have reviewed the record and find it does not conclusively show ineffective assistance. Accordingly, we conclude that the claim is unreviewable at this stage.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b360-8\"> Our conclusion that we may not review Russell\u2019s ineffective assistance claim is not \u201cintended to prejudice, or prejudge, in any way [his] right to apply for relief in a [habeas corpus] proceeding, should he choose to invoke such remedy.\" <em>United States v. Mandello, </em>426 F.2d 1021, 1023 (4th Cir.1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
