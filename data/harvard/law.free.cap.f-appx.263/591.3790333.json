That decision, which was based on \u201ca review of the record,\u201d affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision that Nosa was not credible and that Nosa\u2019s testimony was not supported by the background country conditions evidence of record. The BIA also made an independent finding that Nosa had not adequately explained the discrepancies in the record that rendered him incredible. Because the BIA conducted an independent review of the IJ\u2019s findings, we review the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Kankwmalage v. INS, </em>335 F.3d 858, 861 (9th Cir.2003). We review the IJ\u2019s opinion only to the extent that it was \u201cexpressly adopted\u201d by the BIA. <em>Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1067 (9th Cir.2000). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Because the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination was not supported by substantial evidence, we grant the petition, reverse, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">We reverse because the inconsistencies identified by the BIA, and to the extent incorporated, the IJ, were not inconsistencies, were minor, or did not go to the heart of Nosa\u2019s asylum claim. <em>Chen v. INS, </em>266 F.3d 1094, 1098 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that minor discrepancies, inconsistencies, or omissions that do not go to heart of applicant\u2019s claim cannot support an adverse credibility determination). First, Nosa\u2019s conduct facilitating his travel and entry into the United States is both consistent (as revealed by a review of the transcript of the hearing before the IJ), and \u201cincidental\u201d to Nosa\u2019s claim of persecution. <em>Akinmade v. INS, </em>196 F.3d 951, 956 (9th Cir.1999). Second, Nosa\u2019s omission in his asylum application of details surrounding his detention does not support a finding of inconsistency. Rather, the omission reflects Nosa\u2019s express decision to tell \u201c[ajbout those accuses, beating, threatenings ... during my confidential interview.\u201d Moreover, Nosa\u2019s October 24, 2002 supplemental statement, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>never referenced in either the IJ or BIA decision, supports Nosa\u2019s detailed testimony regarding his detention. As to the other inconsistencies mentioned by the IJ, Nosa did not have to corroborate his testimony about his head wound with medical records, <em>see Shah, </em>220 F.3d at 1071, nor was Nosa\u2019s use of substantively interchangeable words to describe symptoms of a concussion a substantial basis from which to assess Nosa\u2019s credibility. Last, the fact that Nosa did not disclose prior to the hearing that he was fired from his job shortly before leaving Ukraine is irrelevant to Nosa\u2019s claim for asylum where Nosa never alleged that the event had anything to do with his Jewish identity, his political opinion, or his claim for asylum. The BIA\u2019s finding that there were inconsistencies in Nosa\u2019s testimony is not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Next, the BIA and the IJ improperly relied on general descriptions in the State Department report to find Nosa\u2019s particular testimony implausible. This approach misapplies this court\u2019s precedent. <em>See Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043-44 (9th Cir.2001) (finding that country reports are \u201csupplemental\u201d evidence to discredit \u201ca generalized statement\u201d made by the petitioner; they do not \u201cdiscredit specific testimony regarding his individual experience\u201d); <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1110-11 (9th Cir.2006) (generalized country report cannot be used to find specific testimony about experiences implausible).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">The issue is not, as the Board identified, whether \u201cacts of anti-Semitic violence were uncommon,\u201d but rather whether Nosa\u2019s individual experiences are consistent with the country report. <em>Singh </em>439 F.3d at 1110-11. A review of the record shows that they are. The country report recounts that \u201c[pjolice and prison officials tortured and beat detainees and that the Government rarely punished officials who committed abuses.\u201d The report also found that there \u201cwas no effective mechanism for registering complaints about mistreatment or for obtaining redress for such actions ... disciplinary action against law enforcement authorities that committed abuses was limited.\u201d Police corruption also \u201cremained a serious problem\u201d as did \u201carbitrary arrest and detention.\u201d These conditions, not merely the ones cited by the BIA, appropriately \u201cprovide the context for evaluating [Nosa\u2019s] credibility.\u201d <em>Duarte de Guinac v. INS, </em>179 F.3d 1156, 1162 (9th Cir.1999). They are relevant to Nosa\u2019s specific and individualized experiences. Moreover, they are consistent with Nosa\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the adverse credibility determination of the BIA, vacate its decision, and remand so that the agency may determine whether, in light of our holding that his testimony was credible, Nosa has met the requisite criteria for asylum. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">PETITION GRANTED; REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-7\">. Because there were no inconsistencies for Nosa to explain, it is inconsequential that the Board found that he did not provide an \"adequate explanation\u201d for them, or that because he did not raise his \"opportunity to explain\u201d claim before the Board, the court now lacks jurisdiction to review that issue. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (\"A court may review a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
