Feb. 28, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 95 961 782 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 26, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">As an initial matter, Younas never sought asylum before the agency and never alleged that any of the exceptions applied allowing an untimely asylum application. Thus, as a statutory matter, we are without jurisdiction to consider Younas\u2019 asylum claim because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">When the BIA does not adopt the decision of the IJ to any extent, this Court reviews only the decision of the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). The Court reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Younas failed to establish a nexus between his alleged mistreatment by police and the imputed political opinion of his father where no evidence indicates that the police imputed any political opinion to Younas. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). The BIA accurately noted that Younas testified that the police beat him only because he refused to disclose his father\u2019s whereabouts and that they did not accuse him of being politically active. <em>See Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 129-30 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">Remand is required, however, for the agency to address Younas\u2019 alternate claim for relief based on his membership in a particular social group as a family member of \u201can active member of a political party opposed to military rule\u201d in Pakistan. Athough Younas asserted eligibility for relief on that basis before the agency, the BIA failed to address whether Younas was a member of a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(l)(i) and whether he has been or will more likely than not be persecuted on that basis. This Court cannot address that basis for relief as an initial matter and must remand for an agency determination. <em>See Gonzales v. Thomas, </em>547 U.S. 183, 126 S.Ct. 1613, 164 L.Ed.2d 358 (2006) (remanding to allow the agency to address whether a petitioner\u2019s \u201cfamily presents the kind of \u2018kinship ties\u2019 that constitute a \u2018particular social group\u2019 \u201d where the agency failed to address that basis for relief); <em>Ucelo-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 163, 170 (2d Cir.2006) (remanding under <em>Thomas </em>for the BIA to determine whether affluent Guatemalans constitute a particular social group).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">We bring to the agency\u2019s attention on remand that both the IJ and BIA noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>that Younas\u2019 father has not been arrested since Younas\u2019 departure from Pakistan and that that fact undermined the reasonableness of his claim of fear of persecution. Neither the IJ nor the BIA, however, addressed Younas\u2019 explanation that his father had not been arrested because he remains in hiding and moves frequently.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Because Younas\u2019 CAT claim is based on the same factual predicate as his withholding of removal claim, his CAT claim should be remanded as well to allow the agency to evaluate the likelihood of Younas being tortured because he is the son of a politically active member of a party opposed to military rule. <em>Cf. Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 155-57 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part, GRANTED in part, and REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. The pending motion for a remand to adjust status is denied without prejudice to petitioner submitting the motion to the IJ or BIA, as may be appropriate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
