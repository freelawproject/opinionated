We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the record of prior proceedings, which we reference only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-20\">Where the BIA summarily affirms the decision of an IJ without issuing an opinion, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). The agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 126-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>27 (2d Cir.2007). We treat those findings as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We identify no error in the IJ\u2019s determination that Cai has failed to make out claims of past persecution based on her whistle-blowing and pro-democracy activities in China. Nevertheless, because the IJ refused to consider Cai\u2019s 1-589 written statement on adverse credibility grounds, he may not have sufficiently addressed allegations raised in that statement concerning Cai\u2019s fear of future persecution based on her pro-democracy activities in the United States. The IJ identified several \u201csuspect\u201d features of Cai\u2019s written statement: (1) the document was written in Chinese despite the fact that Cai indicated during her testimony that Korean is her primary language, (2) the document appeared \u201cto be a typographical professional rendering of her statement that seems to be used in the creation of a magazine or publication\u201d and Cai worked for a magazine in New York, and (3) \u201cthe written statement which is 19 pages long, when compared to her oral testimony, goes way beyond simple embellishment\u201d and \u201cclearly represents a document that was researched and compiled, and clearly not by [Cai].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Cai provided explanations for some of the discrepancies: With respect to her use of the Chinese language, Cai stated that she was educated in Chinese schools, where she was taught written Chinese and, thus, is more proficient in written Chinese than written Korean. The IJ noted this explanation in his ruling, but failed to state whether or not he credited it. The omission is significant because \u201cwhere it is not apparent on the face of the record that the IJ has considered the applicant\u2019s responses to the IJ\u2019s credibility concerns, we do require the IJ to say enough to allow us to understand, and to review, the reasons for rejecting the applicant\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 89-90 (2d Cir.2006). With respect to Cai\u2019s submission of a typewritten document, she testified that she had typed the statement herself, without help from her employer. She further explained that her decision to type rather than handwrite her statement was \u201c[i]n order to submit neat documentation to the judge.\u201d The IJ failed to discuss this testimony in his ruling, necessarily precluding our review. With respect to the differing levels of detail in Cai\u2019s written statement and her testimony, the IJ failed to identify this as an inconsistency or to seek an explanation as required by our precedent. <em>See Ming Shi Xue v. BIA, </em>439 F.3d 111, 122 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that where inconsistency is not obvious on the face of alien\u2019s testimony, IJ must give alien an opportunity to address the inconsistency).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Given Cai\u2019s plausible explanations for several of the identified deficiencies and the IJ\u2019s failure to state any reasons for rejecting those explanations,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we cannot ensure that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination as pertaining to the 1-589 statement was not based on \u201cbald speculation.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004) (holding that appellate review must ensure credibility findings are not based on \u201cbald speculation or caprice\u201d), <em>overruled in part on other grounds Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 306 (2d Cir.2007) <em>(en banc). </em>Accordingly, remand is required so that the IJ can address the claim raised in Cai\u2019s statement that she has a well-founded fear of <em>future </em>persecution because the Chinese government is aware of her publication in the United States of pro-democracy articles in the magazine <em>Beijing Spring. </em>We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>express no opinion ourselves as to whether the written statement and testimony in support of this claim are sufficient, without further corroboration either from Cai\u2019s husband or any other source, to demonstrate a well-founded fear of future persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\">. We note that no convincing reasons are apparent from the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
