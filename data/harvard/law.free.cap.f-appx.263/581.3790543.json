Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in dismissing petitioner\u2019s appeal after petitioner indicated on his Notice of Appeal that he would file a separate written brief or statement, and then failed to do so within the time allotted for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-26\">Petitioner has further failed to identify any issue sufficiently substantial to warrant further argument. <em>See United States v.

Accordingly, this petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-27\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b603-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
