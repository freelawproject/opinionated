Further, petitioner did not raise the issue of whether his conviction constituted a crime of domestic violence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E) before the BIA and does not raise any challenges concerning his conviction in this petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">Accordingly, respondent\u2019s unopposed motion for summary disposition is granted because the questions raised by this petition for review are so insubstantial as not to require further argument. <em>See United States v.
