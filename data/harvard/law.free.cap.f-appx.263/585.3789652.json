We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b608-21\">Avila first challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the Government\u2019s wiretap ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>plication established the necessity requirement of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also asserts that the district court erred when it refused to hold a <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), hearing to determine whether the Government misled the court as to the necessity of the wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">The Government\u2019s wiretap application must include \u201ca full and complete statement as to whether or not other investigative procedures have been tried and failed or why they reasonably appear to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(l)(c). We have emphasized \u201cthe statutory presumption against this intrusive investigative method,\u201d and interpreted these statutory prerequisites as a \u201cnecessity\u201d requirement. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>412 F.3d 1102, 1112 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">We agree with the district court that the wiretap affidavit satisfied the necessity requirement. Avila argues that the Government failed to establish necessity because the Government already had enough information at the time of the application to determine Avila\u2019s identity, residence, and activities through ordinary investigative means. The affidavit, however, clearly states that the goals of the investigation were broader than this characterization suggests; the Government sought information regarding Avila\u2019s co-conspirators, the \u201clocations [Avila\u2019s] Los Angeles cell uses to store narcotics and narcotics proceeds[,]\u201d and \u201c[t]he management and disposition of proceeds generated by [Avila\u2019s] Los Angeles cell and its involvement in money laundering.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">In the context of a conspiracy investigation, the district court must evaluate necessity in relation to the goals of the overall investigation; if the Government can demonstrate that ordinary investigative techniques would not disclose information covering the scope of the drug trafficking enterprise under investigation, then it has established necessity for the wiretap. <em>See United States v. McGuire, </em>307 F.3d 1192, 1197-99 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">In light of the stated goals of the investigation and the way in which the affidavit ties its explanation of necessity to specific facts about the investigation, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the affidavit provides an adequate basis for a finding of necessity.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-13\">Next, Avila contends that the district court erred in denying his request for a <em>Franks </em>hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He argues that because the Government conducted minimal investigation prior to seeking authorization for a wiretap, it based its allegations in the affidavit on a generic stereotype of drug trafficker behavior that was not accurate in Avila\u2019s case. \u201cA <em>Franks </em>hearing is appropriate where the defendant makes a substantial preliminary showing that a false statement was (1) deliberately or recklessly included in an affidavit submitted in support of a wiretap, and (2) material to the district court\u2019s finding of necessi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>ty.\u201d <em>United States v. Shryock, </em>342 F.3d 948, 977 (9th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Bennett, </em>219 F.3d at 1124). Avila, however, fails to identify any affirmative, material misrepresentations or omissions that would have entitled him to a <em>Franks </em>hearing, and accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Avila challenges the district court\u2019s imposition of a twenty-year mandatory minimum sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He argues that \u00a7 851(d)(2) contains a specific remedial scheme that applies when the Government fails to prove the predicate conviction beyond a reasonable doubt, and because the statute does not contain a provision explicitly allowing the Government to move for reconsideration in such a case, the court erred by permitting it to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">While \u00a7 851 does provide an appellate remedy, this provision alone does not preclude the district court from reconsidering a prior ruling. A district court has inherent authority to reconsider its rulings as long as it retains jurisdiction over a matter. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>389 F.3d 944, 949-51 (9th Cir.2004) (finding the law of the case doctrine inapplicable to a district court\u2019s decision \u201cto reconsider an order over which it has not been divested of jurisdiction\u201d); <em>City of L.A. v. Santa Monica Baykeeper, </em>254 F.3d 882, 886-87 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that a district court\u2019s power to reconsider its orders in a case where it retains jurisdiction is derived from the common law). Here, although the Government filed a notice of appeal from the court\u2019s initial ruling, the Government dismissed the appeal before the district court granted the motion for reconsideration.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In light of these circumstances, we conclude that the district court had jurisdiction to reconsider its \u00a7 851 ruling and did not err in increasing the applicable mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-11\">Finally, Avila argues that the district court erred in applying a two-level leadership role enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, because the evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that Avila exercised control over his co-defendants in the offense. We disagree. The record before the district court, including the Presentence Report and evidence introduced at trial, was more than sufficient to demonstrate that Avila exercised some degree of control over his co-defendants in the drug-trafficking conspiracy, and the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>court did not clearly err in finding that these facts supported the enhancement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

We review de novo a district court's construction of a statute requiring the imposition of a minimum sentence, and we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual findings in the sentencing phase. <em>United States v. Castaneda, </em>94 F.3d 592, 594 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. Avila contends that as in <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), we should construe the prior conviction enhancement of \u00a7 841(b)(1) as an element of the offense that must be charged in the indictment and proven to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. His argument fails because, unlike drug type or quantity, the Supreme Court has held that the fact of a prior conviction is specifically exempt from the requirements of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). <em>See also Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 301, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Accordingly, there is no merit to his statutory argument. Because a prior conviction is not an element of an offense under \u00a7 841(a), Avila\u2019s double jeopardy argument fails on that ground as well as under <em>Monge v. California, </em>524 U.S. 721, 118 S.Ct. 2246, 141 L.Ed.2d 615 (1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b610-13\">.
