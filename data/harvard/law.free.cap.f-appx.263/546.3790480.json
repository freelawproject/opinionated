We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <em>Fernandez-Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 1159, 1163 (9th Cir. 2006), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-18\">As the IJ provided alternative grounds for denying Rodriguez\u2019s motion on the merits, we need not address his contention that his motion was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-19\">Reviewing de novo, we conclude that Rodriguez\u2019s due process contention is unpersuasive. In light of the IJ\u2019s multiple reasons for denying relief, Rodriguez has not demonstrated that he was prejudiced by the agency\u2019s failure to provide him a transcript of his removal hearing. <em>See Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge to deportation proceedings, [a petitioner] must show error and substantial prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b569-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
