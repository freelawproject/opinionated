Elstein, denying Singh\u2019s applications for withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Singh, </em>No. A 16 087 122 (B.I.A. May 8, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 16 087 122 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 17, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, the Court may consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions for the sake of completeness if doing so does not affect the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion. <em>Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland See., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Delgado v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 702, 705 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">Here, substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility finding. The agency emphasized material inconsistencies between Singh\u2019s testimony and the statement attached to his asylum application. First, the IJ reasonably noted that Singh had introduced a new aspect to his claim when he testified about his supposed affiliation with the Akali Dal Mann political faction. As this fact would have further explained the incidents with the authorities and their accusation that he was anti-Government, the omission of any reference to his involvement with Akali Dal Mann in his asylum application was central to Singh\u2019s claim and was properly relied upon by the agency in making its adverse credibility determination. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307-08 (2d Cir.2003). Singh argues that his asylum application impliedly referenced Akali Dal Mann in that he checked the box indicating that he belonged to \u201ca particular social group.\u201d Although \u201casylum applicants are not required to list every incident of persecution on their 1-589 statements,\u201d <em>Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir.2006), the agency reasonably concluded here that given the importance of his supposed affiliation with Akali Dal Mann, Singh\u2019s failure to expressly include this association in his statement suggested \u201cit [was] highly questionable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">In addition, we conclude that the IJ reasonably found that Singh\u2019s failure to reference his friend Paramjit at the hearing, when this friend was included in the asylum application, was a material omission. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 279, 288 (2d Cir.2000). In his written statement, Singh stated that he attended the rally at which he was arrested for the second time at the request of this close friend. Paramjit allegedly managed to escape as Singh was apprehended. The IJ reasonably noted an inconsistency between these statements in Singh\u2019s asylum application and Singh\u2019s testimony, given that \u201c[Singh] made no reference to his close friend Par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>amjit\u201d during his testimony, and that no letter from Paramjit was provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">In his brief, Singh fails to address other inconsistencies cited by the IJ, including Singh\u2019s failure to testify about the statement in his asylum application that the police photographed him and threatened to publish his photographs throughout the Punjab if he continued his anti-Government activities. As such, we decline to address these findings any further, noting only that they provided additional support for the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.8d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (issues not sufficiently argued in the briefs are considered waived and normally will not be addressed on appeal). Singh\u2019s failure to corroborate his claim with letters from Akali Dal Mann members or affidavits from his family about the incidents to which he testified also supported the adverse credibility determination in this case. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 164 (2d Cir.2006) (an applicant\u2019s failure to corroborate his testimony may bear oh credibility where the absence of corroboration renders an applicant unable to rehabilitate testimony that has already been called into question).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Because the only evidence that Singh was likely to be tortured depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for CAT relief. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 523 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Singh\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
