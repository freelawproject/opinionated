The district court concluded that Harmon\u2019s complaint was barred by <em>res judicata, </em>and directed that the dismissal be classified as a second \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">Harmon, relying on <em>Denton v. Hernandez, </em>504 U.S. 25, 112 S.Ct. 1728, 118 L.Ed.2d 340 (1992), argues that his previous section 1983 complaint against Defendants, filed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d), was dismissed as frivolous under the court\u2019s discretionary power. Such a dismissal, he argues, is not \u201con the merits,\u201d and thus, does not have a <em>res judicata </em>effect on the filing of a later paid complaint against the same Defendants raising the same allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l), using the same standards that govern Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) dismissals. <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1278-79 (11th Cir.2001). We review a district court\u2019s application of <em>res judicata </em>principles <em>de novo. Kizzire v. Baptist Health Sys., Inc., </em>441 F.3d 1306, 1308 (11th Cir.2006).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">Res judicata will bar a later action if the following requirements are met: (1) the prior decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (2) there was a final judgment on the merits; (3) the parties were identical in both suits; and (4) the prior and present causes of action are the same. <em>Jang v. United Tech. Corp., </em>206 F.3d 1147, 1149 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">Harmon previously filed a section 1983 complaint against the same Defendants alleging the identical claims about their acts in his criminal proceedings as the instant complaint. The district court dismissed this previous complaint for failure to state a claim under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) because Defendants were entitled to absolute immunity. This prior dismissal satisfies the elements of <em>res judicata. </em>A court of competent jurisdiction rendered a final judgment on the merits, and the present complaint raises the same claims against the same parties. <em>See Jang, </em>206 F.3d at 1149; <em>see also NAACP v. Hunt, </em>891 F.2d 1555, 1560 (11th Cir.1990) (a dismissal for failure to state a claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) is an adjudication on the merits for <em>res judicata </em>purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-15\">Harmon\u2019s reliance on <em>Denton </em>is misplaced. In <em>Denton, </em>the United States Supreme Court construed a prior version of the IFP statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d), which granted district courts broad discretion in dismissing complaints as frivolous and allowed them to dismiss an IFP complaint \u201cif satisfied that the action [was] frivolous or malicious.\u201d <em>Denton, </em>112 S.Ct. at 1733-34. The Court explained that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>section 1915(d) dismissal was not on the merits, but instead, was an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion under the IFP statute such that the dismissal did not prejudice the filing of a later paid complaint making the same allegations. <em>Id. </em>at 1734. But Harmon\u2019s previous complaint was not dismissed as frivolous pursuant to the discretionary power afforded by section 1915(d). Instead, it was dismissed for failure to state a claim under the mandatory language of section 1915(e)(2), which provides that a district court <em>shall </em>dismiss a case at any time if, among other things, it fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added); <em>see also Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001) (noting changes made to the IFP statute by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, including mandatory dismissal and the addition of dismissal for failure to state a claim). So, Harmon\u2019s contention that the prior dismissal was discretionary is incorrect, and <em>Denton </em>is not applicable here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">Harmon also argues that it was error for the district court to assign him a second \u201cstrike\u201d under section 1915(g) because his prior section 1983 complaint was dismissed as frivolous, and thus, was without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">We review a district court\u2019s determination of qualifying strikes under section 1915(g) <em>de novo. Rivera v. Allin, </em>144 F.3d 719, 723 (11th Cir.1998), <em>abrogated in part on different grounds by Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920-21, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007). Section 1915(g) provides the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-6\">In no event shall a prisoner bring a civil action or appeal a judgment in a civil action or proceeding under this section if the prisoner has, on 3 or more prior occasions, while incarcerated or detained in any facility, brought an action or appeal in a court of the United States that was dismissed on the grounds that it is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, unless the prisoner is under imminent danger of serious physical injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Under the plain language of section 1915(g), both the prior and instant dismissals qualify as \u201cstrikes\u201d because both complaints were dismissed for failure to state a claim under section 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) and section 1915A(b)(l). <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g). Harmon\u2019s argument that a discretionary determination of frivolity does not qualify as a \u201cstrike\u201d is without consequence because, as noted, his prior complaint was dismissed for failure to state a claim under a mandatory provision, not as frivolous under a discretionary provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">In sum, the district court correctly determined that Harmon\u2019s instant section 1983 complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted because it was barred by <em>res judicata, </em>and correctly classified this dismissal as a second \u201cstrike\u201d for purposes of section 1915(g). Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-10\">. In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-7\">. In its order dismissing the instant complaint, the district court indicated that the court's prior dismissal was discretionary. This was incorrect because the prior complaint was dismissed under the mandatory language of the revised IFP statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
