The IJ ruled that Claro\u2019s conviction for sexual assault in the third degree under Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 707-732(l)(b) constituted sexual abuse of a minor, which is classified as an aggravated felony under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">To determine whether a crime js an aggravated felony, we apply the categorical approach under <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990). <em>See Parilla v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 1038, 1041 (9th Cir.2005). Claro argues that the crime of conviction is not categorically an aggravated felony because it lacks the element of sexual intent. <em>See, e.g., Matter of Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 991, 995 (BIA 1999) (adopting a definition of sexual abuse of a minor that includes \u201cintent to abuse, humiliate, harass, degrade, or arouse or gratify sexual desire of any person\u201d (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3509(a)(9))). However, in <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 127 S.Ct. 815, 822, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007) (per curiam), the Supreme Court clarified that the categorical approach requires \u201ca realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility, that the State would apply its statute to conduct that falls outside the generic definition of a crime.\u201d Therefore, if \u201cthe conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case,\u201d would fall within the generic crime, <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1594, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), the burden shifts to the petitioner to \u201cpoint to his own case or other cases in which the state courts did in fact apply the statute in the special (nongeneric) manner for which he argues,\u201d <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">Claro has pointed to no cases in which the Hawaii courts applied the sexual assault in the third degree statute to what he deems \u201cplayful contact without any sexual intent at all,\u201d nor does he argue that his own conduct in touching the sexual or intimate body parts of five different victims under age fourteen was innocuous. Furthermore, the Hawaii Supreme Court has rejected the notion that innocuous contact would be prosecuted as sexual assault. <em>See State v. Hicks, </em>113 Hawaii 60, 148 P.3d 493, 506-09 (2006); <em>accord State v. Richie, </em>88 Hawaii 19, 960 P.2d 1227, 1240 (1998). Since Claro has failed to carry his burden under <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>we hold that the crime of conviction is categorically an aggravated felony. <em>See Emile v. INS, </em>244 F.3d 183, 188 (1st Cir.2001) (holding that the crime of conviction, which lacked a sexual intent element, was categorically sexual abuse of a minor because there was no evidence that the state courts applied the statute to \u201cconduct other than inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>tional touchings of a sexual character directed against minors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\">. Although the Department of Homeland Security subsequently amended the Notice to Appear to include a charge of removability for conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(i), the IJ did not explicitly find Claro removable on this ground.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
