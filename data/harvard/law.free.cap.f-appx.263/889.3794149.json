George (Mr. George) appeals the United States Merit Systems Protection Board\u2019s (Board) final order in <em>George v. Department of the Army, </em>104 M.S.P.R. 596 (2007). The Board affirmed the administrative judge\u2019s June 6, 2006 initial decision, sustaining the Department of the Army\u2019s (agency) reduction of Mr. George\u2019s grade from the position of Supervisor Firefighter, GS-8, step 8, to the position of Firefighter, GS-7, step 10, based upon the agency\u2019s charge that Mr. George engaged in \u201cRetaliatory Behavior Directed Against a Subordinate for Protected Activity.\u201d We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b912-13\">Mr. George submitted inaccurate time statements that over-reported the overtime hours that he and seven of his subordinate firefighters spent in completing training exercises at the Army\u2019s Yakima Training Center (YTC). Another firefighter posted at YTC, who was subordinate to Mr. George, discovered the inconsistency and reported it to the YTC Base Commander. In response, the agency conducted an internal investigation. During the course of the investigation, Mr. George made comments about the presence of a \u201crat\u201d at the YTC fire station. Mr. George also hung a large rat trap on the wall in a prominent location at the YTC fire station upon which he attached a piece of paper containing the definition of the term \u201crat,\u201d which included the following language: \u201ca contemptible person; as one who betrays or deserts friends or associates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-14\">Based upon the investigator\u2019s findings, the agency proposed Mr. George\u2019s demotion from Supervisory Firefighter to non-supervisory position of Firefighter, based upon a general charge of \u201cSupervisory Misconduct,\u201d which was composed of three specific charges: (1) \u201cAllowing False Time Cards to be Processed Resulting in Overtime Payment for Unearned Overtime for Yourself and Subordinates;\u201d (2) \u201cFalsification of the Official Fire Department Incident Report;\u201d and (3) \u201cRetaliatory Behavior Directed Against a Subordinate for his Protected Activity.\u201d On December 5, 2005, the Deputy Base Commander of the YTC issued a Notice of Decision, sustaining the agency\u2019s charges and finding that the penalty of demotion was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-15\">On February 6, 2006, Mr. George filed an appeal of the agency\u2019s action. On June 6, 2006, the administrative judge issued an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>initial decision that affirmed the agency\u2019s reduction of Mr. George\u2019s grade based upon Charges One and Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">On appeal to the Board, Mr. George argued that the administrative judge erred as a matter of law by finding that Charge Three did not require a showing by the agency that Mr. George had taken or threatened to take an adverse \u201cpersonnel action\u201d against a subordinate. Although the Board in its February 1, 2007 order found that the administrative judge incorrectly interpreted Charge One, the Board nevertheless affirmed the initial decision, finding that Mr. George had not demonstrated that the administrative judge had erred in sustaining Charge Three. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">This court affirms a decision of the Board unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7708(c). The primary issue in this appeal\u2014whether the Board erred by sustaining the agency\u2019s charge of \u201cRetaliatory Behavior Directed Against a Subordinate for His Protected Activity\u201d without requiring proof of an adverse \u201cpersonnel action\u201d\u2014is a legal question that this court reviews <em>de novo. See Augustine v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>429 F.3d 1334, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">George argues that the term \u201cRetaliatory Behavior\u201d as used in the title of Charge Three should be interpreted in such a way as to require the agency to prove the elements of the Whistleblower Protection Act, including proof of a \u201cpersonnel action.\u201d The government counters that the agency did not charge Mr. George with taking or threatening to take a \u201cpersonnel action\u201d against the subordinate or refer in any way to the Whistleblower Protection Act in its charging documents. The government contends that the charging documents indicate that the essence of the charge is Mr. George\u2019s improper harassment of a subordinate and the creation of a hostile work environment at the YTC fire station. Finally, the government contends that Mr. George\u2019s application of the Whistleblower Protection Act is inconsistent with its central purposes, as Mr. George is seeking to invoke the statute as a shield to insulate himself from the effects of his own misconduct. <em>See Watson v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>64 F.3d 1524, 1530 (Fed.Cir.1995) (the Whistleblower Protection Act was clearly intended to encourage Federal employees to \u201cblow the whistle on wrongdoing\u201d and to \u201cprevent reprisals against the whistle-blowing employee\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-10\">We agree with the government. The use of the term \u201cretaliatory\u201d in a charge does not mean that the government must prove that Mr. George engaged in an adverse \u201cpersonnel action.\u201d The agency has the right and the duty to discipline employees, particularly supervisors who engage in acts of harassment, in order to promote the \u201cefficiency of the service.\u201d <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7513(a) (an agency may take an \u201cadverse action\u201d against an employee, such as reducing an employee\u2019s grade, for \u201csuch cause as will promote the efficiency of the service\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b913-11\">The essence of Charge Three is not that Mr. George violated the Whistleblower Protection Act, but rather that his behavior in hanging the rat trap and commenting about the presence of a rat at the YTC fire station led to a hostile work environment. In the specifications underlying the charge in the proposal letter, the agency characterized the charge as \u201cretaliatory and harassing behavior that created a hostile work environment.\u201d The final decision letter specifies that the basis for the agency\u2019s action was Mr. George\u2019s lapse in judgment as a supervisor by posting the rat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>trap while \u201cknowing that an investigation was ongoing\u201d and that the display of the rat trap could be \u201cconstrued as harassment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">George also asserts that even if Charge Three is upheld, removal from supervisory status was not an appropriate penalty. An agency\u2019s penalty determination should only be overturned when \u201cthe agency failed to weigh the relevant factors, or ... the agency\u2019s judgment clearly exceeded the limits of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Hunt v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Services, </em>758 F.2d 608, 610 (Fed.Cir.1985) (citing <em>Douglas v. Veterans Admin., </em>5 M.S.P.B. 313, 333, 5 M.S.P.R. 280 (1981)). When the Board sustains fewer than all of the agency\u2019s charges, it may mitigate the agency\u2019s penalty to the maximum reasonable penalty. <em>Lachance v. Devall, </em>178 F.3d 1246, 1260 (Fed.Cir.1999). The Board exercises its mitigation after consideration of the relevant Douglas factors. <em>Adam v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>96 M.S.P.R. 492, <em>aff'd, </em>137 Fed. Appx. 352 (Fed.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Here, the Board balanced the relevant Douglas factors including the absence of a prior disciplinary history and Mr. George\u2019s years of government service, and determined that the penalty of reduction was within the tolerable limits of reasonableness, given Mr. George\u2019s position as a supervisor and the seriousness of the misconduct. In addition, according to the agency\u2019s Table of Penalties, Mr. George\u2019s reduction in grade fell within the range of penalties for a first offense of \u201creprisal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
