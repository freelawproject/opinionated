The pair ordered bank personnel to get on the ground, then jumped over the counter and stole $16,887.23. Three months later, on December 19, 2005, Richardson and Aleman entered the United Community Bank, again displaying handguns. As in the earlier robbery, Richardson and Aleman ordered customers and bank personnel to the ground at gunpoint, then jumped over the counter, stealing $30,344. Richardson was ultimately charged, along with two others, in a nineteen count indictment with various bank robbery and firearms counts. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Richardson pled guilty to two counts of bank robbery by force, violence and intimidation, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2113(a) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007), and to two counts of using and carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) (West 2000 and Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">Prior to Richardson\u2019s sentencing, the probation office prepared a presentence report. The probation officer determined that, for both bank robbery counts, Richardson had a base offense level of twenty. This was increased two points for each count because the property of a financial institution was taken and two points were added because bank personnel were restrained in order to facilitate the offenses. One point on both counts was also added due to the amount of loss and an additional two points were added under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3D1.4. Richardson received a three point reduction for acceptance of responsibility, for a total offense level of twenty-four. Richardson\u2019s offense level combined with a criminal history category of III resulted in an advisory guidelines range on the bank robbery counts of 63 to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">Prior to Richardson\u2019s sentencing, the Government filed a motion pursuant to \u00a7 5K1.1 of the guidelines, recommending that Richardson be granted a downward departure due to his substantial assistance in testifying against a co-defendant. The Government recommended a ten level departure from an offense level of twenty-four to an offense level of fourteen. The adjusted offense level and criminal history score resulted in an advisory guidelines range of 21 to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment. In accordance with the Government\u2019s motion and recommendation at sentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>the district court sentenced Richardson to twenty-one months\u2019 imprisonment on both bank robbery counts, to be served concurrently, and to seven years on the first \u00a7 924(c) violation and twenty-five years on the second \u00a7 924(c) violation, to be served consecutively. Richardson timely noted an appeal and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> In his brief, Richardson contends that imposition of a twenty-five year sentence for his second conviction under \u00a7 924(c) was excessive or disproportionate.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">According to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(C)(i), a defendant convicted of a second or subsequent offense of using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence \u201cshall ... be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 25 years.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(C)\u00ae. A district court is required to impose a sentence of at least twenty-five years for a second \u00a7 924(c) conviction, unless the Government files a motion requesting the court to impose a lesser sentence so as to reflect a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000 and Supp.2007). Here, although the Government filed a motion pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 to reduce Richardson\u2019s sentence due to his substantial assistance, the Government specifically limited its motion to Richardson\u2019s bank robbery convictions. Accordingly, the district court was without authority to impose a lesser sentence on Richardson\u2019s second \u00a7 924(c) conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">To the extent Richardson complains that his twenty-five year sentence is disproportionate or unconstitutional, his contention is without merit. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a sentencing court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. After calculating the correct advisory guidelines range, the sentencing court must consider the guidelines range, any relevant factors set forth in the guidelines, and the factors in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 and Supp.2007); then the court may impose sentence. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">On appeal, this court will affirm a post-<em>Booker </em>sentence if it \u201cis within the statutorily prescribed range and is reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.2006). A post <em>-Booker </em>sentence may be unreasonable for procedural or substantive reasons. However, a sentence that falls within a properly calculated advisory guidelines range is presumed to be reasonable. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-12\">At sentencing, the district court properly calculated Richardson\u2019s advisory guidelines range and then, pursuant to the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion, reduced his offense level ten points, resulting in a range of 21 to 27 months\u2019 imprisonment. Prior to sentencing Richardson, the district court specifically considered the advisory nature of the guidelines and the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). The court then imposed a sentence at the bottom of Richardson\u2019s advisory guidelines range on his bank robbery convictions and a sentence in conformity with the statutory requirements of \u00a7 924(c) on the firearms convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-13\">Additionally, Richardson\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. Richardson received a total sentence of twenty-one months\u2019 imprisonment to be served con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>currently on two bank robbery convictions that the Assistant United States Attorney described as \u201cthe most violent bank robberies that I\u2019ve had occasion to deal with since becoming a federal prosecutor.\u201d As noted in the presentence report, during each robbery, customers and bank personnel were ordered to the ground at gunpoint. Accordingly, Richardson\u2019s challenge to his sentence is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Finally, Richardson argues that \u201cthe parties did not stipulate that a firearm was used, brandished, or discharged\u201d and that at sentencing \u201cno evidence was presented that Mr. Richardson ever brandished or (sic) firearm or made threats of death or exerted force towards another person.\u201d At sentencing, Richardson specifically stipulated to the information in the presentence report as establishing a factual basis for the charges to which he pled guilty. According to the presentence report, Richardson brandished a firearm during each of the bank robberies. Accordingly, the district court did not err in imposing a seven year sentence for Richardson\u2019s first \u00a7 924(c) conviction. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Richardson, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Richardson requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Richardson.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b412-6\"> Richardson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief. He has elected not t\u00f3 do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
