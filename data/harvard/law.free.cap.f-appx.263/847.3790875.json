Turner argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582 motion and his motion for reconsideration because Amendment 484 is retroactive and, accordingly, should be applied to adjust his sentence. Specifically, Turner argues that the district court erred in sentencing him based on a finding that he was responsible for 61.4 grams of cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d) because the drugs seized in the case were wet at the time they were weighed and analyzed. Turner asserts that Amendment 484 dictates that water weight must be excluded from the weight of usable crack cocaine attributable to his conduct. Accordingly, Turner contends that we should remand for resentencing in order to recalculate the drug quantity attributable to his conduct based on its dry weight. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>In 1995, a federal grand jury indicted Turner and codefendants Clinton Burns and Norman Robinson for one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and two counts of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Following a jury trial, Turner was found guilty on all three counts. The district court sentenced Turner to concurrent terms of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment as to each count. We affirmed Turner\u2019s conviction and sentence. Turner subsequently filed the instant motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which the district court summarily denied. Turner then filed a motion for reconsideration, styled as a Fed.R.CivP. 59(e) motion to alter or amend judgment, which the district court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We review for abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce a sentence. <em>United, States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir. 2002) <em>(per </em>curiam) (citation omitted). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may modify an imposed term of imprisonment \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). An amendment is retroactive for purposes of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only if it is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d 905, 907 (11th Cir.2003); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a) and comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Amendment 484 to the sentencing guidelines, which became effective on November 1, 1993, provides, in pertinent part, that, for sentencing purposes, the definition of \u201cmixture or substance\u201d as used in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 \u201cdoes not include materials that must be separated from the controlled substance before the controlled substance can be used.\u201d U.S.S.G. App. C, Amend. 484. The Sentencing Commission went on to explain that the amendment addresses cases where \u201ca controlled substance [is] bonded to, or suspended in, another substance <em>(e.g., </em>cocaine mixed with beeswax); however, the controlled substance is not usable until it is separated from the other substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because this amendment is listed in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(c), it is available retroactively and may provide the basis for a reduced sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Armstrong, </em>347 F.3d at 907; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a) and (c), comment, (n. 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">In the instant case, although Amendment 484 is retroactive, Turner\u2019s argument fails because the amendment does not apply to his case. Because Turner was sentenced in 1995, Amendment 484, which became effective in November 1993, is not a \u201csubsequent\u201d amendment within the meaning of \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Thus, the district court did not have jurisdiction to consider Turner\u2019s motion. <em>See United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1322 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a motion could be addressed under \u00a7 3582(c) only if the appellant was arguing that his sentence should be modified \u201cbased on a subsequent sentencing guideline amendment\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Turner\u2019s motion for a sentence reduction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) or his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">In light of the foregoing, the district court\u2019s denial of Turner\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of his sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
