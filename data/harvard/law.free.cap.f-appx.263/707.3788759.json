R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-27\">Magdaleno De Jesus-Gomez appeals his sentence of forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment for illegally reentering the United States after having been convicted of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). The sentence was at the bottom of the range calculated under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d or \u201cGuidelines\u201d). De Jesus-Gomez argues that the district court erred in applying a presumption of reasonableness to the sentence calculated under the Guidelines. He also contends that his sentence was substantively unreasonable in light of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and remand with directions to vacate De Jesus-Gomez\u2019s sentence and resentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">De Jesus-Gomez is thirty-nine years old and a citizen of Mexico. In 1996, he pled guilty in Colorado state court to sexual assault on a child and was sentenced to eight years in prison. After serving his sentence, De Jesus-Gomez was deported to Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">On March 31, 2005, United States Border Patrol agents apprehended De Jesus-Gomez near Columbus, New Mexico. He subsequently pled guilty to reentry of a deported alien previously convicted of an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). The probation office then prepared a presentence report in advance of sentencing. It recommended a base offense level of eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), as well as a sixteen-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) because of his previous conviction for sexual assault on a child, which the presentence report concluded was \u201ca crime of violence.\u201d It also recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. After these adjustments, De Jesus-Gomez\u2019s final offense level was twenty-one, which, when combined with a criminal history category of III, resulted in a Guidelines sentencing range of forty-six to fifty-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1; <em>id. </em>ch. 5, pt. A.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-12\">On February 8, 2007, De Jesus-Gomez filed a sentencing memorandum, in which he requested a sentence of time served.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He explained that he fled southern Mexico because of a contentious land dispute that had resulted in threats to his life, and he fled to the United States to avoid the poverty in northern Mexico. The government filed a response on February 12, 2007, arguing that De Jesus-Gomez\u2019s circumstances did not merit a departure or variance, and urging the district court to adhere to the Guidelines range. In its argument, the government contended that \u201cthe applicable guideline range has a presumption of reasonableness for the district court, and is not just an appellate review standard.\u201d Government Response at 2. On appeal, the government admits that its argument was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-13\">At the sentencing hearing on March 6, 2007, the district court adopted the presentenee report without change. The district court found no basis for a departure under the Guidelines, or a variance under the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The district court stated that \u201ca sentence within a correctly calculated guideline range is a presumptively reasonable sentence,\u201d and that \u201c[a] defendant may rebut the presumption of reasonableness by showing that the sentence is unreasonable when viewed against the factors delineated in 18 U.S.C. 3553(a).\u201d Sentencing Transcript at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>11. In analyzing De Jesus-Gomez\u2019s sentence under those factors, the court explained that, under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), \u201cthe guideline sentence ... avoids unwarranted sentencing disparities among defendants with similar records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 3553(a)(1), moreover, the conviction for sexual assault on a child was \u201ca serious offense\u201d and \u201cwas the reason for the 16-level increase.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12. Also, under \u00a7 3553(a)(2), the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-5\">So the guideline sentence in this case, in my view, correctly reflects the seriousness of the offense; that is, the illegal reentry into this country after the defendant\u2019s prior deportation for an aggravated felony offense. The guideline sentence also will promote respect for the law and provide just punishment for the offense. The guideline sentence in this case, I will find, affords adequate deterrence to criminal conduct and will also protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 13. As for the problems De Jesus-Gomez faced in Mexico, the district court \u201csimply [did not] consider that a basis for granting a sentencing variance under the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the district court explained that \u201cthe mt presumption of reasonableness has not been overcome, and I will find that the guideline sentence in this case is a reasonable sentence taking into account the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court denied De Jesus-Gomez\u2019s request for a variance and sentenced him to forty-six months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">On appeal, De Jesus-Gomez claims that his sentence is both procedurally and substantively unreasonable. \u201cWhen reviewing a sentencing challenge, we evaluate sentences imposed by the district court for reasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Conlan, </em>500 F.3d 1167, 1169 (10th Cir.2007) (citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005); <em>United States v. Kristi, </em>437 F.3d 1050, 1053 (10th Cir.2006)); <em>see also Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (\u201c[A]ppellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d). This inquiry includes both procedural and substantive components, and we \u201creview the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cProcedural reasonableness involves using the proper method to calculate the sentence. Substantive reasonableness involves whether the length of the sentence is reasonable given all the circumstances of the case in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Conlan, </em>500 F.3d at 1169 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-12\">\n<em>Procedural reasonableness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b731-13\">De Jesus-Gomez first contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court erroneously believed that the \u201cpresumption of reasonableness\u201d applied at the district court level. The government correctly concedes that the district court erred and that the presumption of reasonableness only applies at the appellate level. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Arrevalo-Olvera, </em>495 F.3d 1211, 1213 (10th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Begay, </em>470 F.3d 964, 975-76 (10th Cir.2006). The government argues, however, that the district court\u2019s procedural error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-16\">The government concedes that our harmless error standard applies here, so we will review the district court\u2019s procedural error under that standard. <em>United States v. Montgomery, </em>439 F.3d 1260, 1263 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>n. 3 (10th Cir.2006) (reviewing for harmless error where \u201cboth parties agree the harmless error standard applies,\u201d even though we might otherwise have reviewed for plain error). <em>But see United States v. Brown, </em>316 F.3d 1151, 1155 n. 1 (10th Cir.2003) (reviewing for plain error even though \u201c[t]he government argues that we should apply harmless error analysis rather than plain error analysis\u201d). \u201cHarmless error is that which did not affect the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>439 F.3d at 1263. The government has the burden of proving that the district court\u2019s sentencing error was harmless. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The government has not shown that the district court\u2019s error was harmless. De Jesus-Gomez correctly notes that, in several cases where the district court erroneously applied a presumption of reasonableness and then sentenced a defendant at the bottom of the Guidelines range, we have reversed and remanded for resentencing. <em>See, e.g., Conlan, </em>500 F.3d at 1170 (\u201cMr. Conlan was sentenced at the very bottom of his advisory guideline range, a sign we have taken in the past to indicate that the court may have done something differently had it not felt mistakenly bound by the guidelines.\u201d); <em>Begay, </em>470 F.3d at 976-77 (\u201cBut the government fails to argue harmless error. Nor could it do so successfully. The sentence imposed was at the bottom of the Guidelines range. We cannot say whether the district court would have imposed the same sentence if it had properly understood the <em>post-Booker </em>legal landscape.\u201d); <em>see also Arrevalo-Olvera, </em>495 F.3d at 1214 (\u201cThe district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence above the low end of the guideline range also makes Arrevalo-Olvera\u2019s case distinguishable from <em>Be-gay.\u201d). </em>This case is no different. The district court, after erroneously applying a presumption of reasonableness, and further stating that De Jesus-Gomez had not overcome that presumption, imposed a sentence at the very bottom of the Guidelines range. Under our precedent, \u201cremand is required so that the district court can determine whether it should impose a lower sentence, even though a sentence within the Guidelines range may indeed be reasonable.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>470 F.3d at 976. We therefore REMAND with directions to vacate De Jesus-Gomez\u2019s sentence and re-sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b729-17\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
