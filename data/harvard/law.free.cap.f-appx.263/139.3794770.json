Abrams denying Huang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Shu Quan Huang, </em>No. A 98 580 401 (B.I.A. Mar. 29, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 98 580 401 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 7, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-22\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or its finding of neither changed nor extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Notwithstanding that provision, however, this Court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). \u201cQuestions of law\u201d encompass the same issues traditionally reviewed by courts in habeas petitions challenging Executive detentions. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 326-27 (2d Cir.2006). Huang argues that the IJ erred by finding his testimony concerning his date of entry not credible because the IJ inaccurately identified an inconsistency between his testimony and that of his witness. Huang also contends that the IJ\u2019s rationale for finding it implausible that he would obtain a receipt for a prescription for cold medicine was flawed. However, these arguments challenge only \u201cthe correctness of the [IJ\u2019s] factual findings\u201d with respect to whether he established his claimed date of entry into the United States. <em>See id. </em>at 329; <em>see also Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716 (2d Cir.2007) (concluding that the IJ did not \u201cunambiguously] mischaracterize\u201d the record so as to raise a question of law). Accordingly, as the Government correctly asserts, we are without jurisdiction to review Huang\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s pretermission of his asylum claim. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). We therefore dismiss the petition for review to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We also find that the denial of withholding of removal was proper. In <em>Shi Liang Lin, </em>this Court concluded that the statutory scheme under IIRIRA \u00a7 601(a) \u201cunambiguously dictates that applicants can become candidates for asylum relief only based on persecution that they themselves have suffered or must suffer.\u201d 494 F.3d at 308. Thus, even assuming credibility, Huang was not entitled to withholding of removal based solely on his wife\u2019s forced abortion, regardless of their marital status. Moreover, Huang does not allege, nor is there any indication in the record, that he was persecuted for his own resistance to a coercive population control program. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(B). The BIA has stated that the term \u201cresistance\u201d includes, but is not limited to, \u201cexpressions of general opposition, attempts to interfere with enforcement of government policy ... and other overt forms of resistance of the family planning law.\u201d <em>Matter of S-L-L, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1, 10 (BIA 2006). Here, Huang testified that he was fined 3,000 RMB for the birth of his son prior to registration of his marriage, and that he paid the fine the same day. In addition, he testified that when birth control officials \u201cdragged\u201d his wife away for an abortion, he \u201ctried to resist, struggle,\u201d but that two cadres held him down. Even assuming that his conduct constituted other resistance, Huang denied ever having been fined or arrested for such resistance. Moreover, the harm described by Huang with respect to the fine, without further explanation as to the economic impact of the fine, did not amount to persecution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that to constitute persecution, the harm must rise above \u201cmere harassment\u201d); <em>Matter of T-Z-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 163, 169 (BIA 2007).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Finally, because Huang fails to meaningfully challenge in his brief to this Court the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim, any such challenge is deemed waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b164-7\">. Although the agency\u2019s decision rested on credibility grounds, we need not reach that finding where, even if that finding was improper, remand would be an \"idle and useless formality.\u201d <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Wyman-Gordon Co., </em>394 U.S. 759, 766 n. 6, 89 S.Ct. 1426, 22 L.Ed.2d 709 (1969). To the extent that this Court applies the law in effect at the time of the decision, <em>N.L.R.B. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co\u201e </em>55 F.3d 74, 78 (2d Cir.1995), we apply our holding in <em>Shi Liang Lin </em>and deny the petition for review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
