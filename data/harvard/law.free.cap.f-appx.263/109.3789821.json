Aug. 29, 2003), <em>aff'g </em>No. A22 954 651 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo Feb. 20, 2003). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">The sole issue raised by Petitioner is her claim that she should have been granted a continuance by the IJ while she pursued a collateral attack, pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 440, in state court on her state drug conviction. Between the time Petitioner sought that continuance and the present, the Erie County Court denied Petitioner\u2019s \u00a7 440 motion, <em>People v. Curatalo, </em>No. 99-1638 (N.Y. Erie County Ct. Oct. 23, 2003), the Appellate Division, Fourth Department denied leave to appeal, <em>People v. Curatalo, </em>No. 03-02426 (N.Y.App.Div. Dec. 18, 2003), and Judge George Bundy Smith of the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal, <em>People v. Curatalo, </em>1 N.Y.3d 626, 777 N.Y.S.2d 25, 808 N.E.2d 1284 (2004) (table). This petition is accordingly moot, and we DISMISS it as such.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
