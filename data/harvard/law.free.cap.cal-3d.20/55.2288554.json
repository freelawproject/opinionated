Code, \u00a7 1253, subd. (c).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because the court employed an erroneous standard of \u201cavailability\u201d in reviewing the board\u2019s determination, we conclude the judgment denying the writ must be reversed. Moreover, since the decision of the board also clearly applies an interpretation of section 1253, subdivision (c), which conflicts with other provisions of the code, we direct the superior court to issue the writ in order to give the board an opportunity to apply the appropriate standard of availability to the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">Claimant Sanchez applied for benefits from the Department of Employment Development on or about September 11, 1974.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At her \u201cclaim status interview\u201d it was established that her last employment, as a restaurant waitress, had been terminated after a dispute between claimant and her supervisor as to work scheduling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Claimant also informed the department that she could not accept work on either Saturdays or Sundays because on those days she must care for her four-year-old son. Sanchez\u2019s sister, who had previously looked after the child on weekends, had departed for Mexico a few days earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">The department concluded that Sanchez was not \u201cable to work and available for work,\u201d in that her self-imposed exclusion from weekend employment eliminated a \u201cmajor portion of her labor market\u201d as a waitress. Her claim for benefits was denied with a citation to section 1253 of the code.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Sanchez pursued an administrative appeal from this determination, and at the subsequent hearing she gave the only testimony. Her statements may be summarized as follows: During the previous nine years she had worked mainly in restaurants as a waitress or manager, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>although she had some factory work experience. As a restaurant worker she had usually worked on weekends, although in her <em>last </em>employment she had not worked on Sundays. She was ready to accept either restaurant or factoiy work during the week when her sister-in-law was available to tend to the child, and she imposed no time restrictions on such weekday work. Indeed, Sanchez had looked for both restaurant and factory employment without success; moreover, if her sister returned from Mexico she was prepared to accept weekend work as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Aside from Sanchez\u2019s own testimony, no evidence was received at the hearing concerning the size of the potential market for waitress labor within claimant\u2019s time restrictions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nor was evidence adduced as to the potential weekday market for factory work.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">In affirming the department\u2019s denial of benefits, the hearing referee declared that in order to satisfy the availability requirement a claimant \u201ccannot impose restrictions on suitable work, such as limitations on hours, days, shifts or wages, which will materially reduce the possibility of obtaining employment.\u201d He further found that \u201cthe evidence established that Saturday work in restaurants is required.\u201d Conceding that claimant might \u201cbe compelled to care for her child because she has no other person at this time,\u201d the referee nevertheless held that the \u201crestriction substantially reduces her attachment to the labor market\u201d and that she was \u201cnot available for work within the meaning of section 1253 (c) of the Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">On claimant\u2019s further appeal, the board adopted the referee\u2019s opinion as its own and affirmed his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The administrative record so far described was submitted with claimant\u2019s application for a writ of mandate to the superior court. In addition, the court \u201cjudicially noticed that restaurants in Los Angeles County and environs are generally open on Saturdays and Sundays.\u201d On this basis, the court found the board\u2019s decision supported by a preponderance of the evidence. The court concluded that claimant, \u201cby not being able to work on weekends, was not available for work within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>the meaning of Unemployment Insurance Code section 1253 (c) in that she materially reduced her opportunities for employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\n<em>\u201cAvailabilityfor Work\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">This appeal revives basic issues regarding the meaning of the availability requirement of section 1253 and its relationship to the code\u2019s penalties for rejection of offers of \u201csuitable work\u201d without \u201cgood cause.\u201d While the requirement that an applicant for unemployment benefits be \u201cable to work and available for work\u201d establishes a prerequisite to eligibility for any benefits, the code also provides a temporary disqualification from eligibility for an individual who \u201cwithout good cause, refused to accept suitable employment when offered to him, or failed to apply for suitable employment when notified by a public employment office.\u201d (\u00a7 1257, subd. (b).) Under section 1260, subdivision (b), this disqualification extends for \u201cnot less than 2 nor more than 10 consecutive weeks.\u201d Sections 1258, 1258.5, and 1259 either elaborate or qualify the \u201csuitable employment\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Confronted with this statutory scheme claimant contends that where \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d to restrict employment exist, a determination of availability should not turn on whether such a restriction has \u201cmaterially reduced\u201d the chances of claimant\u2019s employment, but should instead involve an examination of whether, in spite of the restriction, reasonable prospects for employment remain. It is further urged that the availability provision should not be read so as to require claimants to be available for w;ork which would not be \u201csuitable\u201d under section 1257, subdivision (b), or which a claimant would have \u201cgood cause\u201d to refuse under that provision. Claimant\u2019s analysis concludes that both board and case-law precedents establish a two-step approach to availability questions. First, to be eligible under section 1253, subdivision (c), a claimant need be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>available only for \u201c \u2018suitable work which the claimant has no good cause for refusing.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Garcia </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com. </em>(1945) 71 Cal.App.2d 107, 113, 114 [161 P.2d 972].) Second, before finding a claimant \u201cavailable\u201d on this basis the department must also inquire whether he or she has thereby attached him or herself to a potential labor market of sufficient size so that \u201creasonable prospects for employment remain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">The board, in response, alludes to at least three possible interpretations of the \u201cavailability\u201d requirement which would justify the denial of benefits to Sanchez. First it is suggested, in keeping with the standard applied by both the court below and the hearing referee, that any restriction which would \u201cmaterially reduce\u201d the possibilities for claimant\u2019s employment renders her unavailable within the meaning of section 1253, subdivision (c). Next the board potentially qualifies this broad rule with a second restriction, which would declare that a claimant need \u201cbe available for work throughout the week as is customarily or ordinarily required by work in his usual occupation.\u201d Finally, the claimant\u2019s previous work history is offered as a consideration, the board emphasizing here that \u201cappellant worked weekends at her last previous employment, and she generally worked on weekends during her restaurant career.\u201d None of the interpretations advanced by the board would take into account whether the work that was the subject of a claimant\u2019s restrictions was in fact \u201csuitable work\u201d or work which the claimant would not have \u201cgood cause\u201d to refuse under section 1257, subdivision (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The threshold question which we must resolve, then, is whether the availability requirement of section 1253, subdivision (c), imposes upon claimants an obligation to declare themselves available for work which is either \u201cunsuitable\u201d or which they would have \u201cgood cause\u201d to refuse. The answer required by the structure of our unemployment insurance scheme\u2014and the answer consistently given by both the courts and the board heretofore\u2014is in the negative. Any other result would frustrate the policies inherent in the several statutory provisions regarding \u201csuitable work\u201d and \u201cgood cause\u201d to refuse work. (\u00a7\u00a7 1257, subd. (b), 1258, 1258.5, 1259.)</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">The combined effect of those sections is to allow a claimant to refuse, without risk of disqualification, work which is either unsuitable or which the claimant has other \u201cgood cause\u201d to refuse. Yet the board would hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>that while a claimant who refuses specific referrals may not be temporarily disqualified, he may be declared unavailable arid totally ineligible merely because he asserts in advance that he will refuse certain specific referrals which by hypothesis he could refuse without risk of disqualification.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, since a refusal of specific work might constitute evidence of general unavailability for similar work, if the suitability and good cause provisions do not limit the scope of the availability requirement, then refusals of unsuitable work or \u201cgood cause\u201d refusals could become the basis of routine determinations of unavailability under section 1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">It is not an overstatement to declare that such a rule \u201cwould render nugatory the \u2018suitable work\u2019 provisions\u201d of the statute. (Freeman, <em>Able to Work and Available for Work </em>(1945) 55 Yale L.J. 123, 125.) Those provisions reflect a clear legislative policy that claimants shall not be required, at the risk of their benefits, to accept every job opportunity which may become available. For example, an applicant for benefits need not accept work which presents a risk to his \u201chealth, safety, and morals,\u201d or which fails to correspond to his \u201cphysical fitness and prior training\u201d or his \u201cexperience and prior earnings.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Legislature has not indicated that a claimant must nevertheless accept work at hours which threaten his \u201chealth, safety, and morals\u201d if such work falls within the work week \u201ccustomarily or ordinarily required by work in his usual occupation,\u201d or if such work comprises a \u201cmaterial\u201d part of the market for his labor, or if he has performed such work in the past. The pervasive policies behind sections 1257 through 1259 admit no such arbitrary qualifications. The alternative would be to compel unemployed workers, upon pain of benefit loss, to make themselves available for work which the Legislature has defined either as \u201cunsuitable\u201d or as inherently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>providing \u201cgood cause\u201d for refusal. It would make little difference that this result was achieved by a threatened determination of \u201cunavailability\u201d under section 1253, subdivision (c), rather than \u201cdisqualification\u201d under section 1257, subdivision (b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Undoubtedly, these compelling considerations led the Court of Appeal in <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>California Emp. Stab. Com. </em>(1945) <em>supra, </em>71 Cal.App.2d 107, 113, 114, to declare that \u201c \u2018[a]vailability for work requires no more than availability for suitable work which the claimant has no good cause for refusing.\u2019 \u201d Parallel conclusions have been reached in other jurisdictions having unemployment insurance laws with similar \u201cavailability\u201d provisions. (See, e.g., <em>Beaman </em>v. <em>Safeway Stores </em>(1954) 78 Ariz. 195 [277 P.2d 1010, 1013]; <em>Harper </em>v. <em>Unemployment Insurance Appeal Board </em>(Del. 1972) 293 A.2d 813, 815-816; <em>Inter-Island Resorts, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Akahane </em>(1962) 46 Hawaii 140 [377 P.2d 715, 722]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Employment Security Agency </em>(1959) 81 Idaho 560 [347 P.2d 764, 766]; <em>Raborn </em>v. <em>Heard </em>(La.App. 1956) 87 So.2d 146, 148; <em>Dubois </em>v. <em>Maine Employment Security Commission </em>(1955) 150 Me. 494 [114 A.2d 359, 365]; <em>In re Troutman </em>(1965) 264 N.C. 289 [141 S.E.2d 613, 616]; <em>Roukey </em>v. <em>Riley </em>(1950) 96 N.H. 351 [77.

The purpose of the requirement has frequently been described as a way of assuring that a claimant is \u201cattached to the labor market.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Beaman, supra, </em>277 P.2d at p. 1013; <em>Inter-Island Resorts, supra, </em>377 P.2d at p. 722; <em>In re Dunn, supra, </em>305 A.2d at p. 605; see also Freeman, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>at p. 124.) The description is hardly transparent, but it is helpful because it implies that \u201cavailability\u201d makes some reference to the functions and needs of the economy as well as to the requirements of a particular worker. One consequence of this policy is that availability normally entails accessibility to work for which there is some social demand. (See, e.g., <em>Dubois, supra, </em>114 A.2d at pp. 365-366; <em>Roukey, supra, </em>77 A.2d at p. 32; Altman, <em>op. cit. supra, </em>at pp. 107-111.) Thus, a second element of the inquiry into availability consists of the determination whether, after a claimant has restricted his market to \u201csuitable work which he has no good cause for refusing,\u201d he remains available for work for which there is a substantial field of potential employers. Both the <em>Garcia </em>case and the past decisions of the board contemplate that the initial test of willingness to accept suitable employment will be followed by an inquiry into the size of the market for such suitable labor.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">In <em>Garcia </em>the claimant refused a job referral because she had no means of getting to the proffered work. The board held that her lack of transportation rendered her \u201cunavailable.\u201d In reversing, the Court of Appeal rejected the notion that the claimant\u2019s inability to accept the job offer in itself made her \u201cunavailable\u201d since that refusal was, by the board\u2019s own finding, for \u201cgood cause.\u201d However, the court recognized that before the claimant could be declared \u201cavailable,\u201d the case had to be remanded to the board for a determination as to whether \u201cthere was not available in [claimant\u2019s community] such work as she had done the previous year or . . . some suitable work for which she was reasonably fitted or could have accepted.\u201d (71 Cal.App.2d at pp. 111-112.) <em>Garcia </em>thus stands for the principle that a claimant cannot be required to be available for unsuitable work, or work which could be justifiably refused, as long as he remains available to a substantial employment field.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The board\u2019s own decisions also sharply delineate the outlines of this two-step inquiry. In Precedent Benefit Decision P-B 170 (1976) <em>supra, </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>page 3, the board declared \u201cThere must be a dual finding where availability for work is at issue; first, that there is a willingness as well as readiness and ability to work, and, second, that there exists some reasonable probability in the claimant\u2019s locality for obtaining suitable employment so that the willingness to work, coupled with <em>some </em>prospects of work, can result in a finding that during the weeks for which benefits are claimed, the claimant has been ready, willing, and able to accept suitable employment in a labor market where, that willingness may result in gainful employment.\u201d (Italics in original.) This approach was again applied in Precedent Benefit Decision P-B 172 (1976) <em>supra, </em>at page. 3, in which the board concluded that the claimant could exclude unsuitable employment \u201cwithout rendering herself unavailable for work, provided there remained a labor market in which there were reasonable prospects that the claimant could obtain the type of work she sought.\u201d Finally, the board has approved the eligibility of a student who restricted her availability to such work as would not \u201cinterrupt her attendance at school,\u201d noting that \u201ca labor market, although small, does exist for the claimant.\u201d (Precedent Benefit Decision P-B 313 (1976) p. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">In support of its position in the instant case the board relies on two opinions of the Attorney General, in particular on a statement to the effect that \u201cif an individual\u2019s usual occupation, or work for which he is reasonably fitted, customarily, normally, or ordinarily calls for a seven-day work week, then such individual must be able to work and available for work each day of the week.\u201d (10 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 208, 210 (1947); see also 24 Ops. Cal.Atty. Gen. 81 (1954).) We are, of course, not bound by the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of the statute <em>(Smith </em>v. <em>Anderson (1967) 67 </em>Cal.2d 635, 641, fn. 5 [63 Cal.Rptr. 391, 433 P.2d 183]), nor are we persuaded by his argument. In his earlier opinion the Attorney General declares, citing <em>Garcia, </em>that \u201cAvailability for work as used in section 57(c) [predecessor to section 1253, subdivision (c)] requires no more than availability for suitable employment.\u201d (10 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. at p. 210.) However, the opinion then fails to consider the range of factors which might be taken into account in determining suitability (see \u00a7 1258) as well as <em>Garcia\u2019s </em>additional qualification of the availability requirement by the concept of \u201cgood cause.\u201d Moreover, the opinion is ambiguous as to whether a claimant is merely required to be available on days on which all employees in an occupation are customarily required to work, or whether an employee must be available to fill every customary work shift in every suitable field.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>In either case, however, the opinion would substitute a rigid notion of \u201ccustomary\u201d requirements for the more realistic and flexible tests of \u201csuitability,\u201d \u201cgood cause,\u201d and actual labor market exposure. Thus, if a claimant, in limiting himself to \u201csuitable work which he has no good cause for refusing\u201d were to restrict his availability to daytime work for which there was a substantial market, the Attorney General\u2019s opinion would nevertheless deny him benefits solely because other employers \u2014perhaps more numerous\u2014\u201ccustomarily, normally, or ordinarily\u201d required different work schedules. Such reasoning ignores the possibility that within a given occupation \u201ccustomary\u201d hours might gradually adjust to meet evolving n\u00e9'eds of employers and employees, with the result that there would be no single standard weekly schedule. We refrain from adopting the opinion of the Attorney General, and the position of the board in this case, which would require importing into the statutory measure of availability an extraneous concept of \u201ccustomary, normal, or ordinary\u201d work schedules.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">We therefore decline the department\u2019s invitation to disapprove the interpretation of section 1253, subdivision (c), contained in <em>Garcia. </em> While the construction of a statute by the officials charged with its administration is entitled to great weight <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) 67 Cal.2d 733, 748 [63 Cal.Rptr. 689, 433 P.2d 697]), here the board\u2019s adoption of the referee\u2019s decision contradicts its own prior rulings. In any case, \u201c \u2018whatever the force of administrative construction... final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see also <em>Whitcomb Hotel, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cal. Emp. Com. </em>(1944) 24 Cal.2d 753, 757 [151 P.2d 233, 155 A.L.R. 405].)  \u201cAvailability for work\u201d within the meaning of section 1253, subdivision (c), requires no more than (1) that an individual claimant be willing to accept suitable work which he has no good cause for refusing and (2) that the claimant thereby make himself available to a substantial field of employment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>In denying claimant\u2019s motion for a writ of administrative mandamus, the trial court concluded that her restrictions on weekend work rendered her ineligible under section 1253, subdivision (c) \u201cin that she materially reduced her opportunities for employment.\u201d The court thus committed legal error in holding that claimant could be declared \u201cunavailable\u201d without a prior inquiry into whether the evidence established that she had \u201cgood cause\u201d to refuse weekend work and whether such work was \u201csuitable\u201d for her under sections 1257 through 1259. The factual findings of the trial court are.insufficient as a matter of law to sustain its legal conclusion, and the judgment denying the writ must therefore be reversed. (See, e.g., <em>Merrill </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 907, 915, 917 [80 Cal.Rptr. 89, 458 P.2d. 33]; <em>Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 67, 74, fn. 7 [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553].)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Furthermore, it is apparent that the board, in adopting the opinion of the hearing referee, applied similarly incorrect criteria of availability. The referee supported his conclusion with the finding that \u201cAlthough [claimant] may be compelled to care for her child because she has no other person at this time, that restriction substantially reduces her attachment to the labor market. Her search for work in factories does not necessarily alter the restrictions which materially reduce the possibilities of obtaining employment . . . .\u201d The referee and the board manifestly believed that such a \u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201csubstantial\u201d reduction was sufficient to support a conclusion of unavailability. At no time during the administrative process was a determination made that weekend work was suitable work which the claimant lacked good cause to refuse. No evidence was taken which might support a conclusion that claimant did not remain available to a substantial field of weekday factory and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>restaurant employers.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In these circumstances it is appropriate to return the case to the board for further proceedings and the application of the proper standard of availability. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 43 and 1094.5, subd. (e).)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">Nevertheless, for the guidance of the board in this and future cases, we confront two issues implicated in this appeal which concern the application of the proper availability standard. First, we consider whether a parent has \u201cgood cause\u201d for refusing to accept work which would conflict with duties to care for a minor child. A second problem is the appropriate allocation of the burden of proof on the issue of whether a claimant has made himself available to a substantial field of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>Parental Duties as Restricting Availability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Numerous statutes emphasize the responsibilities of parents or guardians in the care and upbringing of children. Civil Code section 197 establishes a right of custody in the parents of an unmarried minor child. Other sections of our law provide for the designation of a particular adult or adults as custodians of a child should the initial status of the mother and father be disturbed by divorce, adoption, or other causes. (See Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 228, 229, 4600; Prob. Code, \u00a7 1407.) The parents of a child are under an obligation to \u201cgive him support and education suitable to his circumstances.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 196, 196a.) And they may be subject to criminal penalties if they neglect their responsibilities. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 270, 270f.) Because of the crucial importance of parental responsibility and supervision, it would be anomalous if the Legislature intended that the obligation of the prospective claimant of unemployment benefits to accept work be irreconcilable with the duties of parenthood.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">In the unemployment insurance system, the need to balance such duties and the burdens of work is appropriately recognized in the \u201cgood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>cause\u201d qualification to the availability requirements of the code.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\n                   \u201c \u2018[T]he term \u201cgood cause\u201d as used in the statute means an adequate cause, a cause that comports with the purposes of the Unemployment Insurance Code and with other laws.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Syrek </em>v. <em>California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board </em>(1960) 54 Cal.2d 519, 529 [7 Cal.Rptr. 97, 354 P.2d 625].) The responsibilities our laws place on parents, and the importance to their children and society that those duties be discharged, mandate that the \u201cgood cause\u201d concept not be defined so narrowly as to compel unemployed parents who remain available to a significant labor market to fulfill their parental responsibilities only upon pain of losing their unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">We conclude that a claimant who is parent or guardian of a minor has \u201cgood cause\u201d for refusing employment which conflicts with parental activities reasonably necessary for the care or education of the minor if there exist no reasonable alternative means of discharging those responsibilities.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Indeed, \u201cIt is difficult to imagine \u00e1 better cause for rejection of employment . . . .\u201d <em>(In re Watson </em>(1968) 273 N.C. 629 [161 S.E.2d 1, 7]; see also <em>Yordamlis </em>v. <em>Florida Industrial Commission </em>(Fla. 1963) 158 So.2d 791; <em>Tung-Sol Electric </em>v. <em>Board of Review etc. </em>(1955) <em>supra, </em>114 A.2d 285, 288; see also Annot., 35 A.L.R.3d 1129, 1137-1145.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">\n<em>Burden of Proof on \u201cSubstantiality\u201d of Employment Field</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">It has been repeatedly stated that the burden is generally on a claimant to prove his availability for work. <em>(Loew\u2019s Inc. </em>v. <em>California Emp. etc. Com. </em>(1946) 76 Cal.App.2d 231, 238 [172 P.2d 938]; <em>Ashdown </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1955) 135 Cal.App.2d 291, 300 [287 P.2d 176]; <em>Spangler </em>v. <em>California Unemp. Ins. App. Bd. </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 284, 287 [92 Cal.Rptr. 266]; but cf. <em>Prescod </em>v. <em>Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 29, 37-38 [127 Cal.Rptr. 540].) The allocation corresponds to the general rule that \u201ca party has the burden of proof as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense that he is asserting.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7 500.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>However, this rule by its own terms applies only \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by law.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus we have held that \u201cWhere the evidence necessary to establish a fact essential to a claim lies peculiarly within the knowledge and competence of one of the parties, that party has the burden of going forward with the evidence on the issue although it is not the party asserting the claim.\u201d <em>(Morris </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1967) <em>supra, 61 </em>Cal.2d 733, 760; see also <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>Industrial Accident Com. </em>(1953) 41 Cal.2d 689, 694 [263 P.2d 8].) We are satisfied here that the second step of the determination of availability\u2014i.e., whether the claimant has made himself available to a \u201csubstantial field of employment\u201d\u2014calls for testimony regarding the size and character of the labor market which is \u201cpeculiarly within the knowledge and competence\u201d of the department. The average unemployed claimant with obviously limited resources cannot be expected to provide evidence which may be relatively complicated, expert, or difficult to obtain regarding local and area economic conditions. Nor would it be efficient to require the presentation of such data in every case on an issue which might be the subject of dispute in but a few.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Accordingly, once a claimant has shown he is available for suitable work which he has no good cause for refusing, the burden of proof on the issue of whether he is available to a \u201csubstantial field of employment\u201d lies with the department. If the department believes that a given claimant, despite his availability for such suitable work, is nevertheless not attached to a labor market of sufficient dimension, it may be expected to explain its position and support it with appropriate evidence.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The rule of availability accepted by the board and the court below, if approved and generalized, might exclude from the coverage of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>unemployment compensation insurance system thousands of parents who actively seek work but who must nevertheless reserve some time to fulfill essential parental obligations. Here the board claims authority to declare that a mother, who seeks employment in restaurants and factories, day or night, Monday through Friday, is not sufficiently attached to the labor market if she is unable also to accept weekend work which conflicts with her responsibilities to her child. Such insensitivity to the need of claimants to balance availability for work with parental duty is impossible to reconcile with the underlying social purposes of the unemployment insurance law. As <em>Garcia </em>recognized over 30 years ago, in the \u201cgood cause\u201d and \u201csuitable employment\u201d provisions of the code the Legislature has sought to accommodate the differing circumstances of individual claimants in a manner which necessarily qualifies the general requirement that a claimant be \u201cavailable for work.\u201d In the present context, the term \u201cgood cause\u201d must be construed consistent with other expressions of legislative policy declaratory of the elementary obligations of parenthood.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">The judgment is reversed with directions to issue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding respondent to set aside its decision and to reconsider the case in light of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Bird, C.

Any work offered under such conditions is suitable if it gives to the individual wages at least equal to his weekly benefit amount for total unemployment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u201cIn any particular case in which the director finds it impracticable to apply one of the foregoing standards he may apply any standard which is reasonably calculated to determine what is suitable employment.\u201d (See also fn. <em>8,post.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Of course, this result might be rationalized as an attempt to force claimants into a particularistic confrontation with each job opportunity, rather than allowing a categorical advance rejection of given types of work as \u201cunsuitable.\u201d We-do not believe, however, that the intent of the Legislature was to produce an administrative charade whereby claimants would be encouraged to first announce their availability for every type of job and then reject every offer in a given category as \u201cunsuitable\u201d or the subject of a \u201cgood cause\u201d refusal. .The criteria of \u201csuitability\u201d set forth in section 1258, for example, are capable of generating meaningful classifications, and it is reasonable to assume the Legislature recognized the possibility that a claimant might be able to impose valid categorical restrictions under section 1258.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Indeed, in 1975 the Legislature \u00e1dded language to section 1258 providing that in determining whether work is suitable for an individual, the \u201cdirector shall consider . . . <em>such other factors as would influence a reasonably prudent person in the individual\u2019s circumstances\u2019\u2019 </em>(Italics added.)

(Fn. 6, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In view of the requirement of reading section 1253, subdivision (c), with reference to section 1257, subdivision (b), it was not necessary for the Legislature to provide an explicit \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201csuitable work\u201d qualification in section 1253 itself, and we do not view the absence of such a clause as dispositive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Moreover, the need to harmonize the eligibility and disqualification provisions of the statute has been recognized by the board itself. In Precedent Benefit Decision P-B 172 (1976) the board awarded benefits to a claimant who restricted her employment to five hours of work a day because of physical impairments. A referee had ruled that this restriction rendered claimant unavailable for work under the predecessor to section 1253, subdivision (c). The board reasoned, however, that \u201cfrom the record before us, employment in excess of five hours would not be suitable for the claimant and she therefore could exclude such employment without rendering herself unavailable for work. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 3.) Thus claimant\u2019s restrictions did not destroy her eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>because she \u201cwas ready, willing and able to accept suitable employment which she had no good cause to refuse .. . <em>(ibid.) </em>(See also Precedent Benefit Decision P-B 170 (1976) p. 3.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The term \u201cfield\u201d is used to avoid any implication that the measure of availability is necessarily the likelihood of employment in a given market. This approach is consistent with the precise purpose of the Unemployment Insurance Code, which is to provide relief for those unable to obtain suitable work (see \u00a7 100). While a concern for the \u201cprospects\u201d for employment was apparent in Precedent Benefit Decisions P-B 170 (1976) <em>supra, </em>and P-B 172 (1976) <em>supra </em>(fn. 10, <em>ante), </em>in Precedent Benefit Decision P-B 313 (1976) <em>supra, </em>at page 4, the board stated that \u201cthe test of availability may not be predicated upon the lack of openings for a claimant, but rather must be based upon whether there is a potential employment field.\u201d At the same time, our use of the qualifying term \u201csubstantial\u201d is not meant to foreclose the possibility that even if an employment field is not large in absolute terms, it may nevertheless satisfy the availability requirement if it presents a substantial employment opportunity for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">We express no opinion as to whether and under what circumstances, if any, a claimant might be \u201cavailable for work\u201d within the meaning of section 1253, subdivision (c), despite the fact that he either is not available for all suitable work which he has no good cause for refusing (cf. Altman, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>at pp. 107-109; Freeman, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>55 Yale L.J. at p. 126) or is not available to a substantial field of employment. This latter possibility might arise when, for example, a small town\u2019s principal employer shuts down its entire operation, both leaving its former employees unemployed and by hypothesis effectively removing the area\u2019s only significant field of potential employment. Were the two-step inquiry outlined here conceived as a definitive test of availability, the employees left behind in such a move might be declared ineligible for benefits. Yet arguably it is just such \u201cpersons unemployed through no fault of their-own\u201d who are appropriate recipients of unemployment benefits. (See \u00a7 100; see also Freeman, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>at pp. 127-128; Altman, <em>op. cit., supra, </em>at pp. 122-138, especially fn. 50 at p. 130 and accompanying text.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The referee\u2019s finding that \u201cthe evidence established that Saturday work in restaurants is required\u201d was without support in the record, if by that statement it was meant that claimant could not obtain restaurant work unless she was willing to work Saturdays.
