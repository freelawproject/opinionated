Three theories, to be examined in detail by us below, were advanced in support of the award: the so-called \u201ccommon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>fund\u201d theoiy, the \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d theory, and the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">. A hearing on the issue of entitlement to fees was held on January 6, 1975, and on January 27 the <em>trial </em>court entered an interim order in which it announced its intention to award reasonable attorneys fees to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on the private attorney general theoiy only, declining to apply the other two theories advanced. The matter was continued until April 14, 1975, for briefing and argument upon the issue of the amount of fees to be awarded. On that date the court received testimony and, upon stipulation of the parties, additional evidence by affidavit. At the conclusion of this hearing the court announced its intention to award $400,000 as reasonable attorneys fees to Public Advocates, Inc. and $400,000 as reasonable attorneys fees to Western Center on Law and Poverty. Upon timely request by Public Advocates, Inc. the court ordered the preparation of findings of fact and conclusions of law. On August 1, 1975, the court filed its \u201cOrder Concerning Attorneys\u2019 Fees,\u201d which was consistent in all relevant respects with its previous rulings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as its \u201cFindings of Fact and Conclusions of Law Concerning the Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees\u201d\u2014of which there were 219 of the former and 28 of the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Two notices of appeal from the order were filed, one by Public Advocates, Inc. and Western Center on Law and Poverty, as \u201ccounsel for plaintiffs,\u201d and one by defendants Unruh, Cory, and Riles. On October i, 1975, we transferred the appeal to this court and ordered it consolidated with the then-pending appeal in <em>Serrano II. </em>The latter appeal having been fully briefed, however, we proceeded to hear argument and render our decision in <em>Serrano II, </em>deferring our consideration of the instant appeal until the judgment in <em>Serrano II </em>had become final.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">On January 28, 1977, after the rendition of our decision in <em>Serrano II </em>but prior to the issuance of the remittitur, a motion was filed in this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with the appeal of this cause. This motion was filed by \u201crespondents\u201d (designated in the caption as plaintiffs John Serrano, Jr. et al.) by their attorneys, Public Advocates, Inc. and Western Center on Law and Poverty. Prior to issuance of the <em>Serrano II </em>remittitur we modified our judgment to reserve jurisdiction for the purpose of passing upon this motion in conjunction with the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We summarize the contentions advanced in the briefs of the parties:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Defendants contend that the award of attorneys fees was improper on any of the grounds considered. Thus, they urge that whereas the trial court was correct in determining that such an award cannot be sustained on either the common fund theoiy or the substantial benefit theory, it erred in concluding that an award should be made on the private attorney general theoiy. Additionally they argue that even if such an award based on any of these theories were proper in a case in which the prevailing litigant had incurred an obligation to pay for legal services, it could not be justified in a case in which, as here, the plaintiffs had incurred no obligation for such services which were provided without charge by organizations receiving public or tax-exempt charitable funding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, defendants urge, the award in this case is excessive. Finally, defendants also oppose the granting of the motion for attorneys fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Plaintiffs and their attorneys, while agreeing with the trial court\u2019s award of fees on the private attorney general theory, contend that the court erred in refusing to base its award additionally on the common fund and substantial benefit theories. The fact that plaintiffs are represented by organizations receiving public or other tax-exempt funding, they urge, should have no effect upon their eligibility for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>award. Public Advocates, Inc., in an argument in which Western Center on Law and Poverty does not join, also urges that the award is inadequate. Finally, plaintiffs and their attorneys contend that their motion for attorneys fees on appeal should be granted on each of the three theories here in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Recently in <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10], we had occasion to point out: \u201cSection 1021 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides in relevant part: \u2018Except as attorney\u2019s fees are specifically provided for by statute, the measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties . . . .\u2019 No state statute provides for the award of attorney\u2019s fees in a case of this nature, and there has been no express or implied agreement concerning attorney\u2019s fees in this case. However, appellate decisions in this state have created two nonstatutoiy exceptions to the general rule of section 1021, each of which is based upon inherent equitable powers of the court. The first of these is the well-established \u2018common fund\u2019 principle: when a number of persons are entitled in common to a specific fund, and an action brought by a plaintiff or plaintiffs for the benefit of all results in the creation or preservation of that fund, such plaintiff or plaintiffs may be awarded attorney\u2019s fees out of the fund. (See, e.g., <em>Estate of Stauffer </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 124, 132 [346 P.2d 748]; <em>Estate of Reade </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 669, 671-672 [191 P.2d 745]; see generally 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed\u201e 1971) Judgment, \u00a7\u00a7 129-133, pp. 3278-3283.) The second principle, of more recent development, is the so-called \u2018substantial benefit\u2019 rule: when a class action or corporate derivative action results in the conferral of substantial benefits, whether of a pecuniary or nonpecuniary nature, upon the defendant in such an action, that defendant may, in the exercise of the court\u2019s equitable discretion, be required to yield some of those benefits in the form of an award of attorney\u2019s fees. (See, e.g., <em>Knoff </em>v. <em>City etc. of San Francisco </em>(1969) 1 Cal.App.3d 184, 203-204 [81 Cal.Rptr. 683]; <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>A. J. Industries, Inc. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 313, 318-325 [72 Cal.Rptr. 146]; see also <em>Sprague </em>v. <em>Ticonic Bank </em>(1939) 307 U.S. 161 [83 L.Ed. 1184, 59 S.Ct. 777]; see generally 4 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Judgment, \u00a7 134, pp. 3283-3284.)\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 25.) Mindful of these observations, we proceed first to determine whether the trial court was correct in concluding that an award of reasonable attorneys fees could not be supported in the instant case under either of the aforementioned exceptions to the rule of section 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>(a) <em>The Common Fund Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u201cAlthough American courts, in contrast to those of England, have never awarded counsels\u2019 fees as a routine component of costs, at least one exception to this rule has become as well established as the rule itself: that one who expends attorneys\u2019 fees in winning a suit which creates a fund from which others derive benefits, may require those passive beneficiaries to bear a fair share of the litigation costs.\u201d <em>(Quinn </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 162, 167 [124 Cal.Rptr. 1, 539 P.2d 761]; fns. omitted.) This, the so-called \u201ccommon fund\u201d exception to the American rule regarding the award of attorneys fees (i.e., the rule set forth in section 1021 of our Code of Civil Procedure), is grounded in \u201cthe historic power of equity to permit the trustee of a fund or property, or a party preserving or recovering a fund for the benefit of others in addition to himself, to recover his costs, including his attorneys\u2019 fees, from the fund of property itself or directly from the other parties enjoying the benefit.\u201d <em>(Alyeska Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 240, 257 [44 L.Ed.2d 141, 153, 95 S.Ct. 1612]; fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">First approved by this court in the early case of <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Hale &amp; Norcross S. M. Co. </em>(1895) 108 Cal. 475 [41 P. 328], the \u201ccommon fund\u201d exception has since been applied by the courts of this state in numerous cases. (See, e.g., <em>Glendale City Employees\u2019 Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Glendale </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 328, 341, fn. 19 [124 Cal.Rptr. 513, 540 P.2d 609]; <em>Estate of Reade, supra, </em>31 Cal.2d 669, 671-672; <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Harold G. Ferguson Corp. </em>(1944) 25 Cal.2d 274, 277 [153 P.2d 714]; <em>Farmers etc. Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1936) 5 Cal.2d 601, 607 [55 P.2d 867]; <em>Estate of Kann </em>(1967) 253 Cal.App.2d 212, 223 [61 Cal.Rptr. 122]; see generally Dawson, <em>Lawyers and Involuntary Clients: Attorney Fees from Funds </em>(1974) 87 Harv.L.Rev. 1597.) In all of these cases, however, the activities of the party awarded fees have resulted in the preservation or recovery of a certain or easily calculable sum of money\u2014out of which sum or \u201cfund\u201d the fees are to be paid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We can find no such \u201cfund\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In relevant findings of fact the trial court found that plaintiffs \u201chave proven that the sum of money available for public education in California is not being spent in accordance with the California Constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tion\u201d and \u201chave protected the sum of money available for public education\u201d in the state. Plaintiff Urges that these findings are tantamount to a determination that a fund of money for educational use was created bv their efforts. The trial court, however, concluded otherwise, reasoning that whatever additional monies are made available for public education as a result of the <em>Serrano </em>judgment will flow from legislative implementation of the judgment, not from the judgment itself. That judgment requires substantial equality in educational opportunity for the school children of this state without regard to the taxable wealth per student in the particular district in which a student lives. It does not require any particular level of expenditure.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, it cannot be said that the efforts of plaintiffs have created or preserved any \u201cfund\u201d of money to which they should be allowed recourse for their fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">Plaintiffs place great emphasis on the trial court\u2019s finding that under the 1972 and 1973 legislation which we have referred to in our <em>Serrano II </em>opinion as \u201cS.B. 90 and A.B. 1267\u201d (see <em>Serrano II </em>at pp. 736-737, 741-744), passed in response to our decision in <em>Serrano I, </em>an annual pool of some $550 million has come into existence for purposes of education and property tax relief. Moreover, they point out, it is quite likely that under subsequent legislation substantial further sums of money will become available for these purposes. Again, however, we point out that any such increases in the total educational budget, while they may be termed a \u201cresponse\u201d to our <em>Serrano </em>decisions, are by no means <em>required </em>by them. It is for the Legislature to determine, in its conjoined political wisdom, whether the achievement of that degree of equality of educational opportunity which is required by the state Constitution is to be accompanied by an overall increase in educational funding.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Finally, even if it were determined that the monies to become available for education in the wake of <em>Serrano </em>should be considered a \u201cfund\u201d for these purposes, plaintiffs and their attorneys nowhere suggest that payment should be made to them out of such monies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Instead they seem to indicate, with perhaps intentional vagueness, that their fees should be paid by \u201cthe State.\u201d Apparently th\u00e9ir primary authority in this respect is the case of <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>School Board of City of Norfolk, Virginia </em>(4th Cir. 1972) 456 F.2d 943 (cert. den. (1972) 406 U.S. 933 [32 L.Ed.2d 136, 92 S.Ct. 1778]), in which the Court of Appeals ordered the award of reasonable attorneys fees against a school district after determining that its desegregation plan was inadequate insofar as it failed to provide a practical method of free transportation for students assigned to schools beyond normal walking distance from their homes. There the court, stating that this was a case for \u201cat least a quasi-application of the \u2018common fund\u2019 doctrine\u201d (456 F.2d at p. 951), reasoned that whereas each of the students involved had secured a right worth approximately $60 per year to each of them, it would \u201cdefeat the basic purpose of the relief provided\u201d to impose a charge against them for a proportionate share of the attorneys fees <em>(id., </em>at p. 952). \u201cThe only feasible solution in this particular situation,\u201d the court held, \u201cwould seem to be in requiring the school district itself to supplement its provision of free transportation with payment of an appropriate attorney\u2019s fee to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys for securing the addition of such a provision to the plan of desegregation.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">We, along with the concurring judge in <em>Brewer </em>(Winter, Cir. J., conc. specially, 456 F.2d at pp. 952-954), are of the view that the <em>Brewer </em>case, to the extent that it relies upon the terminology used, represents an improper application of the \u201ccommon fund\u201d theory. (See also Dawson, <em>Lawyers and Involuntary Clients in Public Interest Litigation </em>(1975) 88 Harv.L.Rev. 849, 895-896; Comment, <em>Equal Access, supra, </em>122 U.Pa.L. Rev. 636, 695-696.) In any event it is not consistent with the law of this state. We hold that here, where plaintiffs\u2019 efforts have not effected the creation or preservation of an identifiable \u201cfund\u201d of money out of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>they seek to recover their attorneys fees, the \u201ccommon fund\u201d exception is inapplicable. The trial court was correct in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">(b) <em>The Substantial Benefit Theory</em></p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">As we indicated in our opinion in <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 1, 25, the courts have fashioned another nonstatutory exception to the general rule on the award of attorneys fees. This exception, which may be viewed as an outgrowth of the \u201ccommon fund\u201d doctrine, permits the award of fees when the litigant, proceeding in a representative capacity, obtains a decision resulting in the conferral of a \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d of a pecuniaiy or nonpecuniary nature. In such circumstance, the court, in the exercise of its equitable discretion, thereupon may decree that under dictates of justice those receiving the benefit should contribute to the costs of its production. Although of fairly recent development in California, this exception to the general rule is now well established in our law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Although the seminal California case on this subject, <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>A. J. Industries, supra, </em>266 Cal.App.2d 313, arose, in the context of corporate litigation,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> more recent decisions have applied the \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d theory in a wide variety of circumstances, including those involving governmental defendants. Thus in <em>Knoff </em>v. <em>City etc. of San Francisco, supra, </em>1 Cal.App.3d 184, a class action, the plaintiffs had secured the issuance of a writ of mandate requiring the board of supervisors to order a full investigation into the loss of property taxes during certain previous years, including the identification of taxable property which had escaped taxation for any reason, and to take appropriate action to recover the taxes due. The Court of Appeal affirmed a judgment awarding the plaintiffs their attorneys fees out of tax revenues to be collected \u201cin consequence of. . . compliance\u201d with the writ of mandate <em>(id. </em>at p. 203), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>citing <em>Fletcher </em>for the proposition that the award was proper even in the absence of an existing \u201cfund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In the more recent case of <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Hodges </em>(1976) 54 Cal.App.3d 596 [127 Cal.Rptr. 244], the plaintiff, a state employee, had successfully challenged the state\u2019s practice of giving its employees time off with pay on Good Friday as a violation of constitutional prohibitions against the establishment of religion. The Court of Appeal, affirming an award of attorneys fees against the state, held that a substantial benefit had accrued to the state in the form of the future saving of funds formerly expended for work not performed, and that the trial court, exercising its equitable powers in a suit brought in a representative capacity, had properly shifted the cost burden of producing that benefit to the party enjoying it.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Finally, in <em>Card </em>v. <em>Community Redevelopment Agency </em>(1976) 61 Cal.App.3d 570 [131 Cal.Rptr. 153], the plaintiff taxpayers had secured a judgment declaring invalid a city ordinance purporting to amend an existing redevelopment plan by including areas not covered by the original plan. As a result, certain property tax increment revenues otherwise payable to the redevelopment agency under the amending ordinance became available to various city and county taxing agencies. The Court of Appeal approved a portion of the judgment awarding attorneys fees to be paid by the various taxing agencies in proportion to their respective shares in the tax increment funds, holding that \u201c[t]his result substantially benefits the affected taxing agencies, named in the judgment (and through them their taxpayers), since it reduces both the occasion for the [redevelopment agency\u2019s] expenditure of such funds and the [agency\u2019s] source of such funds as well.\u201d (61 Cal.App.3d at p. 583.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\"> Relying on these and other<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> cases, plaintiffs and their attorneys urge that the award in this case was justified on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>\u201csubstantial benefit\u201d rationale and that the trial court erred in concluding otherwise.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>\n                   In urging that such a benefit was conferred upon the state as a result of this litigation, they make reference to various factual findings of the trial court on the general subject, the most significant of which are set forth in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To the extent, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>that the subject findings are susceptible of the reading that substantial benefits in the form of increased educational opportunities have been bestowed upon the school children of this state as a necessary result of the <em>Serrano </em>decision\u2014or that benefits in the form of tax savings have been bestowed upon the taxpayers\u2014they are without support. The fundamental holding of Serrano\u2014i.e., that the existing school finance system, insofar as it operates to deny equality of educational opportunity to the school children of this state, is thereby violative of state equal-protection guarantees\u2014does nothing in and of itself to assure that concrete \u201cbenefits\u201d will accrue to anyone. Only in the event that implementing legislation, in establishing the equality of educational opportunity required by <em>Serrano, </em>does so at a level higher than that presently enjoyed by the <em>least </em>favored student under the present system will concrete \u201cbenefits\u201d accrue to <em>any </em>school child; only in the event that that level rises above the level of opportunity available to the <em>most </em>favored student under the present system will the required \u201cbenefits\u201d accrue to <em>all </em>of the school children. By the same token, relative \u201cbenefits\u201d to taxpayers will depend wholly upon the tax structure that the Legislature chooses to establish in order to finance its new system. In short, concrete \u201cbenefits\u201d can accrue to the state or its citizens in the wake of <em>Serrano </em>only insofar as the Legislature, in its implementation of the command of equality which that case represents, chooses to bestow them.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>It is also urged, however, that while <em>Serrano </em>may not have had the direct effect of producing increased educational opportunity or tax savings, it did produce benefits of a conceptual or doctrinal character which are shared by the state as a whole. Certain findings of the trial court\u2014notably those numbered 5, 167, and 176 (set forth in fn. 11, ante)\u2014support this contention. Common sense as well speaks in favor of the proposition that plaintiffs and their attorneys, as a result of the <em>Serrano </em>litigation, have rendered an enormous service to the state and all of its citizens by insuring that the state educational financing system shall be brought into conformity with the equal protection provisions of our state Constitution so that the degree of educational opportunity available to the school children of this state will no longer be dependent upon the taxable wealth of the district in which each student lives.  We have concluded, however, that to award fees on the \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d theory on the basis of considerations of this nature\u2014separate and apart from any consideration of actual and concrete benefits bestowed\u2014would be to extend that theory beyond its rational underpinnings.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\n                   If the effectuation of constitutional or statutory policy, without more, is to serve as a sufficient basis for the award of attorneys fees in this state, the rationale for such awards must be found in a theory more directly concerned with considerations of this nature. It is to such a theory that we now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">In <em>D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 1, plaintiffs had sought an award of fees not only on the \u201ccommon fund\u201d and \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d theories <em>but also </em>on two additional theories, both of which were grounded largely on federal case law. The first of these, involving awards against an opponent who has maintained an unfounded action or defense \u201c \u2018in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly or for oppressive reasons\u2019 \u201d (11 Cal.3d at p. 26), is not involved in the instant case and we do not address ourselves to it. However, the second, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>so-called \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d concept, was adopted by the trial court as the basis for its award, and we are now called upon to determine its applicability in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In addressing ourselves to the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory in <em>D\u2019Amico, </em>we said \u201cThis concept, as we understand it, seeks to encourage suits effectuating a strong congressional or national policy by awarding substantial attorney\u2019s fees, regardless of defendants\u2019 conduct, to those who successfully bring such suits and thereby bring about benefits to a broad class of citizens.\u201d (11 Cal.3d at p. 27.) Noting, however, that such doctrine was then under examination by the United States Supreme Court, we thought it prudent to await \u201can announcement by the high court concerning its limits and contours on the federal level\u201d <em>(id) </em>before determining its possible applicability in this jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The announcement has now been made. In <em>Alyeska Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society, supra, </em>421 U.S. 240,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> a five to two opinion authored by Justice White, the Supreme Court held that the awarding of attorneys fees on a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory, in the absence of express statutory authorization, did not lie within the equitable jurisdiction of the federal courts. Such awards, the court held, \u201cwould make major inroads on a policy matter that Congress has reserved for itself.\u201d (421 U.S. at p. 269 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 159].)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">The high court rested its conclusion on two bases. The first, involving the interpretation of an 1853 court costs act, need not long concern us here, for the act in question (presently 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1920, 1923) bears little resemblance to the governing statute in this state, section 1021 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  In any event the fashioning of equitable exceptions to the statutory rule to be applied in California is a matter within the sole competence of this court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The second basis on which the Supreme Court grounded its decision, however, dealing with the manageability and fairness of such awards in the absence of legislative guidance, goes directly to the heart of the determination here before us. The making of such awards in the absence of statutory authorization, the high court indicated, would leave the courts \u201cfree to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>fashion drastic new rules with respect to the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party ... or to pick and choose among plaintiffs and the statutes under which they sue and to award fees in some cases but not in others, depending upon the courts\u2019 assessment of the importance of the public policies involved in particular cases.\u201d (421 U.S. at p. 269 [44 L.Ed.2d at pp. 159-160].) This, the court suggested, would represent an unacceptable and unwise intrusion of the judicial branch of government into the domain of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">It is with this consideration foremost in mind that we must assess the arguments advanced by plaintiffs and amici curiae in support of our adoption of the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d concept in our state. Those arguments may be briefly summarized as follows: In the complex society in which we live it frequently occurs that citizens in great numbers and across a broad spectrum have interests in common. These, while of enormous significance to the society as a whole, do not involve the fortunes of a single individual to the extent necessary to encourage their private vindication in the courts. Although there are within the executive branch of the government offices and institutions (exemplified by the Attorney General) whose function it is to represent the general public in such matters and to ensure proper enforcement, for various reasons the burden of enforcement is not always adequately carried by those offices and institutions, rendering some sort of private action imperative. Because the issues involved in such litigation are often extremely complex and their presentation time-consuming and costly, the availability of representation of such public interests by private attorneys acting <em>pro bono publico </em>is limited. Only through the appearance of \u201cpublic interest\u201d law firms funded by public and foundation monies, argue plaintiffs and amici, has it been possible to secure representation on any large scale. The firms in question, however, are not funded to the extent necessaiy for the representation of all such deserving interests, and as a result many worthy causes of this nature are without adequate representation under present circumstances. One solution, so the argument goes, within the equitable powers of the judiciary to provide, is the award of substantial attorneys fees to those public-interest litigants and their attorneys (whether private attorneys acting <em>pro bono publico </em>or members of \u201cpublic interest\u201d law firms) who are successful in such cases, to the end that support may be provided for the representation of interests of similar character in future litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">In the several cases in which the courts, persuaded by these and similar arguments, have granted fees on the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>theory, various formulations of the rule have appeared. In spite of variations in emphasis, all of these formulations seem to suggest that there are three basic factors to be considered in awarding fees on this theory. These are in general: (1) the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision. (See generally, Comment, <em>Equal Access, supra, </em>122 U.Pa.L.Rev. 636, 666674.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus it seems to be contemplated that if a trial court, in. ruling that a motion for fees upon this theory, determines that the litigation has resulted in the vindication of a strong or societally important public policy, that the necessary costs of securing this result transcend the individual plaintiff\u2019s pecuniary interest to an extent requiring subsidization, and that a substantial number of persons stand to benefit from the decision, the court may exercise its equitable powers to award attorney fees on this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">It is at once apparent that a consideration of the first factor may in instances present difficulties since it is couched in generic terms, contains no specific objective standards and nevertheless calls for a subjective evaluation by the judge hearing the motion as to whether the litigation before the court has vindicated a public policy sufficiently strong or important to warrant an award of fees. We are aware of the apprehension voiced in some critiques that trial courts, whose function it is to apply existing law, will be thrust into the role of making assessments of the relative strength or weakness of public policies furthered by their decisions and of determining at the same time which public policy should be encouraged by an award of fees, and which not\u2014a role closely approaching that of the legislative function. (See generally, Comment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number><em>Equal Access, supra, </em>122 U.Pa.L.Rev. 636, 670-671; Comment, <em>The Supreme Court, 1974 Term </em>(1975) 89 Harv.L.Rev. 1, 178-180.)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Since generally speaking the enactment of a statute entails in a sense the declaration of a public policy, it is arguable that, where it contains no provision for the awarding of attorney fees, the Legislature was of the view that the public policy involved did not warrant such encouragement. A judicial evaluation, then, of the strength or importance of such statutorily based policy presents difficult and sensitive problems whose resolution by the courts may be of questionable propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Such difficulties, however, are not present in the instant case.  The trial court, in awarding fees to plaintiffs, found that the public policy advanced by this litigation was not one grounded in statute but one grounded in the <em>state Constitution. </em> Thus, the trial court concluded as a matter of law: \u201cIf as a result of the efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys rights created or protected by <em>the State Constitution </em>are protected to the benefit of a large number of people, plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys are entitled to reasonable attorney\u2019s fees from the defendants under the private attorney general equitable doctrine.\u201d (Italics added.)  Its factual findings, which are not here challenged, establish that the interests here furthered were <em>constitutional </em>in stature.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>\n                   Those findings also make clear that the benefits flowing from this adjudication are to be widely enjoyed among the citizens of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>state<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and that the nature of the litigation was such that subsidization of the plaintiffs is justified in the event of their victory.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In these circumstances we conclude that an award of attorneys fees to plaintiffs and their attorneys was proper under the theory posited by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">So holding, we need not, and do not, address the question as to whether courts may award attorney fees under the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory, where the litigation at hand has vindicated a public policy having a statutory, as opposed to, a constitutional basis. The resolution of this question must be left for an appropriate case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">In sum, we hold that in the light of the circumstance of the instant case, the trial court acted within the proper limits of its inherent equitable powers when it concluded that reasonable attorneys fees should be awarded to plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> on the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">It should be clear from what we have said above that the eligibility of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys for the award of fees granted in this case is not affected under the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory by the fact that plaintiffs are under no obligation to pay fees to their attorneys, or the further fact that plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys receive funding from charitable or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>public sources.  Because the basic rationale underlying the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory which we here adopt seeks to encourage the presentation of meritorious constitutional claims affecting large numbers of people, and because in many cases the only attorneys equipped to present such claims are those in funded \u201cpublic interest\u201d law firms, a denial of the benefits of the rule to such attorneys would be essentially inconsistent with the rule itself. (See generally Comment, <em>Awards of Attorney\u2019s Fees to Legal Aid Offices, supra, </em>87 Harv.L.Rev. 411.) The propriety of such awards under statutory provisions is already well-established in this state (see <em>Horn </em>v. <em>Swoap, supra, </em>41 Cal.App.3d 375, 383-384; <em>Trout </em>v. <em>Carleson </em>(1974) 37 Cal.App.3d 337, 342-343 [112 Cal.Rptr. 282]), and similar considerations are applicable when the award is made under the court\u2019s equitable powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">We reject the contention of Public Advocates, Inc.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> that the fee awarded it was inadequate in light of all the circumstances. It is urged that the trial court, in limiting its award to Public Advocates to the admittedly substantial amount of $400,000, failed to take adequate account of the novelty and extreme difficulty of this litigation, its extremely contingent character, the significance of the issues determined, and the standard which the award in this case will set for similar awards in future cases. However, the record clearly indicates that the court considered all of these factors, among many others, in making its determination. Fundamental to its determination\u2014and properly so<footnotemark>23</footnotemark>\u2014was a careful compilation of the time spent and reasonable hourly compensation of each attorney and certified law student involved in the presentation of the case. That compilation yielded a total dollar figure of $571,172.50, of which $225,662.50 was applicable to Public Advocates, Inc., $320,710 to Western Center on Law and Poverty, and $24,800 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>time spent by certified law students. Using these figures as a touchstone, the court then took into consideration various relevant factors, of which some militated in favor of augmentation and some in favor of diminution. Among these factors were: (1) the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the skill displayed in presenting them; (2) the extent to which the nature of the litigation precluded other employment by the attorneys; (3) the contingent nature of the fee award, both from the point of view of eventual victory on the merits and the point of view of establishing eligibility for an award; (4) the fact that an award against the state would ultimately fall upon the taxpayers; (5) the fact that the attorneys in question received public and charitable funding for the purpose of bringing law suits of the character here involved;<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> (6) the fact that the monies awarded would inure not to the individual benefit of the attorneys involved but the organizations by which they are employed; and (7) the fact that in the court\u2019s view the two law firms involved had approximately an equal share in the success of the litigation. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the court proceeded to make a total award in the amount of $800,000, to be shared equally by each of the two law firms representing plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The \u201cexperienced trial judge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and while his judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless the appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong.\u201d <em>(Harrison </em>v. <em>Bloomfield Building Industries, Inc. </em>(6th Cir. 1970) 435 F.2d 1192, 1196; see <em>Mandel </em>v. <em>Hodges, supra, </em>54 Cal.App.3d 596, 624.)  We find no abuse of discretion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">As indicated at the outset of this opinion, in <em>Serrano II </em>we specifically reserved jurisdiction for the purpose of determining plaintiffs\u2019 motion filed in this court on January 28, 1977, for attorneys\u2019 fees for services rendered in connection with the <em>Serrano II </em>appeal-which appeal was prosecuted only by certain officers of the County of Los Angeles and certain intervening school districts. (See 18 Cal.3d at p. 777.) On July 7, 1977, plaintiffs filed a letter request, which we treat as a supplementary motion, seeking additional fees for services rendered in opposing an unsuccessful petition for writ of certiorari filed by the aforesaid appellants in the United States Supreme Court. Finally, on October 31, 1977, plaintiffs filed a motion in this court for attorneys\u2019 fees for services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>rendered in connection with the instant appeal-which appeal was prosecuted only by certain state officers. All of these motions are now before us for decision. We have determined, however, in the interest of avoiding further delay in the finality of the instant decision while permitting all parties to be fully heard in these matters, that all of the aforesaid motions should be remanded to the trial court with directions to hear and determine them in light of the principles set forth in this opinion. (See <em>Bozung </em>v. <em>Local Agency Formation Com. </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 483, 485; <em>No Oil, Inc. </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 486, 487.) In each instance, the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, if any, shall be made and assessed only against said defendants and appellants appealing in the respective appeal, or such of them as the trial court in the exercise of its equitable discretion shall determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The order concerning attorneys\u2019 fees filed August 1, 1975 is affirmed. The cause is remanded to the trial court with directions to hear and determine plaintiffs\u2019 motions for attorneys\u2019 fees filed in this court on January 28, 1977, July 7, 1977, and October 31, 1977, in conformity with the views herein expressed and to make and enter all necessary and appropriate orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Tobriner, Acting C.

IV, \u00a7 16 and art. I, \u00a7 7 respectively . . .), our state equal protection provisions. Indicating the respects in which the system before it was violative of our state constitutional standard, the court set a period of six years from the date of entry of judgment as a reasonable time for bringing the system into constitutional compliance; it further held and ordered that the existing system should continue to operate until such compliance had been achieved. The jiidgment specifically provided that it was not to be construed to require the adoption of any particular system of school finance, but only to require that the plan adopted comport with the requirements of state equal protection provisions. Finally, the trial court retained jurisdiction of the action and over the parties \u2018so that any of such parties may apply for appropriate relief in the event that relevant circumstances develop, such as a failure by the legislative and executive branches of the state government to take the necessary steps to design, enact into law, and place into operation, within a reasonable time from the date of entry of this Judgment, a California Public School Financing System for public elementary and secondary schools that will fully comply with the said equal-protection-of-the-law provisions of the California Constitution.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Serrano II </em>at pp. 748-750.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">The order provided in relevant part: IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Public Advocates, Inc. and Western Center on Law and Poverty, attorneys for Plaintiffs, are each entitled under the private attorney general doctrine to receive reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees from the defendants, Jesse M.

The equal-protection-of-the-laws provisions of the California Constitution mandate nothing less than that all such persons shall be treated alike. If such uniformity of treatment were to result in all children being provided a low-quality educational program, or even a clearly <em>inadequate </em>educational program, the California Constitution would be satisfied. This court does not read the <em>Serrano </em>[I] opinion as requiring that there is any constitutional mandate for the State to provide funds for each child in the State at some magic level to produce either an adequate-quality educational program or a high-quality educational program. It is only a disparity in treatment between equals which runs afoul of the California constitutional mandate of equal protection of the laws.\u201d As our opinion in <em>Serrano II </em>makes clear, this is a correct characterization.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Such an award, of course, would necessarily bring about a diminution in educational funding, a result which plaintiffs and their attorneys might be presumed to oppose.

On the contrary, all of the argument has been it is going to cost the taxpayers millions of dollars more in order to carry out the Court\u2019s decision. Now, it can do that if it is carried out in one way. I don\u2019t know what the Supreme Court will say, but I will carefully point out in the approach which I took, which was that the Constitution will guarantee equality of educational opportunity but no minimum level, and the billions of dollars that we are talking about depends upon the decision to bring all school districts in terms of income up to where Beverly Hills is. <em>That is a political decision, in my opinion, and not a constitutional one. </em>If the financial affairs of the State won\u2019t support such a decision, then I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>could well see a different approach, in which all school districts would be at a much lower level to come within the State\u2019s finances.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The decisions of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Mills </em>v. <em>Electric Auto-Lite, supra, </em>396 U.S. 375, and <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Cole, supra, </em>412 U.S. 1, are not inconsistent with this conclusion.

The majority, however, in responding to this suggestion,- point out that to impose this limitation would result in an expanded version of the \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d rule rather than a true \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d rationale. \u201cWhen Congress has provided for allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees for the private attorney general,\u201d the majority stated,, \u201cit has imposed no such common-fund conditions upon the award.

We find this reasoning persuasive. The \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory must be accepted or rejected on its own merits\u2014i.e., as a theory rewarding the effectuation of significant policy\u2014rather than as a policy-oriented extension of the \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d theory burdened with the limitations of that rationale.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Thus in rejecting the private attorney general theory in <em>Alyeska, </em>the high court deplared that such a rule \u201cwould make major inroads on a policy matter that Congress has reserved for itself\u2019 and that federal courts \u201care not free to fashion drastic new rules with respect to the allowance of attorneys\u2019 fees to the prevailing party in federal litigation or to pick and choose among plaintiffs and the statutes under which they sue and to award fees in some cases but not in others, depending upon the courts\u2019 assessment of the importance of the public policies involved in particular cases.\u201d <em>(Alyeska Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society, supra, </em>421 U.S. 240, 269.[44 L.Ed.2d 141, 159-160].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The trial court found, inter alia, that \u201c[t]he plaintiffs ... have proven that the sum of money available for public education in California is not being spent in accordance with the California Constitution\u201d and that \u201c[t]he efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys . . . have assured that the billions of dollars spent every year in California on education will be spent in accordance with the California Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The determination that the public policy vindicated is one of constitutional stature will not, of course, be in itself sufficient to support an award of fees on the theory here considered.

In the absence of any statutory authority therefor, the majority awards substantial attorneys\u2019 fees to plaintiffs on the ground that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel acted in the capacity of \u201cprivate attorneys general\u201d in vindicating constitutional rights for a large segment of our state\u2019s population. I have previously, in my dissenting opinion in <em>Serrano II (Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest </em>(1976) 18 Cal.3d 728, 777-785 [135 Cal.Rptr. 345, 557 P.2d 929]), expressed the reasons for my disagreement with the majority\u2019s premise that plaintiffs were denied equal protection of the laws under the state Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">However, accepting as I must the <em>Serrano II </em>holding of a constitutional infringement, again with due deference, in considering the majority\u2019s proposed \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d doctrine, I find more persuasive the rationale of the United States Supreme Court expressed recently in <em>Alyeska Pipeline Co. </em>v. <em>Wilderness Society </em>(1975) 421 U.S. 240 [44 L.Ed.2d 141, 95 S.Ct. 1612], in which it declined to approve the doctrine in the absence of statutory guidance in this area. In passing, I note a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>touch of irony in the fact that very recently we likewise and unanimously refused an invitation to adopt the identical \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d doctrine herein approved by the majority, observing that \u201cthe doctrine is currently under examination by the United States Supreme Court . . . and, pending an announcement by the high court concerning its limits and contours on the federal level, we decline to consider its possible application in this state.\u201d <em>(D\u2019Amico </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 1, 27 [112 Cal.Rptr. 786, 520 P.2d 10].) The Supreme Court now has spoken, but the majority, ignoring its awaited reasoning and lessons, adopts a rule which the high court carefully considered and rejected. To me, <em>Alyeska\u2019s </em>thesis is both compelling and fully applicable here for reasons which I briefly develop.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">First, the high court noted that \u201cAlthough ... Congress has made specific provision for attorneys\u2019 fees under certain federal statutes, it has not changed the general statutory rule that allowances for counsel fees are limited to the sums specified by the costs statute.\u201d (421 U.S. at pp. 254-255 [44 L.Ed.2d at pp. 151-152].) The high tribunal, cognizant of broad congressional authority over the matter of attorneys\u2019 fees and court costs, reasoned further that \u201cUnder this scheme of things, it is apparent that the circumstances under which attorneys\u2019 fees are to be awarded and the range of discretion of the courts in making those awards are matters for Congress to determine.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 262 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 156], fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Similarly, California, acting through its Legislature in parallel fashion, has expressly limited the manner of the award of attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>\u201cExcept as attorney\u2019s fees are specifically provided for by statute, </em>the measure and mode of compensation ... is left to the agreement, express or implied, of the parties . . . .\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1021, italics added.) As with the Congress under the federal scheme, the California Legislature has clearly and \u201cspecifically provided ... by statute\u201d for attorneys\u2019 fees to be recovered in particular actions; as examples, in the Code of Civil Procedure, defamation (\u00a7 836), condemnation, abandonment and dismissal (\u00a7 1268.610), wage claim in municipal court (\u00a7 1031), partition (\u00a7 874.010, subd. (a)), and, in the Civil Code, dissolution of marriage (\u00a7 4370). It has not elected as yet to provide for such recoveiy in actions such as the present one. The federal and California patterns are closely parallel. I think the better procedure is to accept the <em>Alyeska </em>model and, by recognizing the demonstrated legislative interest, to refrain from developing our own nonstatutory bases for such awards, thus deferring to the Legislature in this area in the same manner as the Supreme Court has deferred to the Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Second, I am further persuaded of the wisdom of the <em>Alyeska </em>reasoning by the high tribunal\u2019s anticipation of the very considerable difficulty which courts would experience in attempting to \u201cpick and choose,\u201d among the multitudinous enactments, those particular statutes in which the public policy at issue is sufficiently \u201cimportant\u201d to justify recoveiy on a \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d theory. The Supreme Court voiced its legitimate concern in these words: \u201c[I]t would be difficult, indeed, for the courts, without legislative guidance, to consider some statutes important and others unimportant and to allow attorneys\u2019 fees only in connection with the former.\u201d (421 U.S. at pp. 263-264 [44 L.Ed.2d at p. 157].) We face identical obstacles which are not lowered because they are of state rather than federal origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Furthermore, and finally, the majority\u2019s proposed refinement, limiting awards to cases involving <em>constitutional </em>rights, fails to avoid the pitfalls readily foreseen in <em>Alyeska. </em>A glance at our state Constitution discloses in article I alone, numerous \u201crights\u201d of varying degrees of importance, ranging from the inalienable right to life, liberty and property (\u00a7 1) to the right to fish in public waters (\u00a7 25). Each of them presumably is a \u201cconstitutional\u201d right.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Will the ambit of \u201crights\u201d to which the doctrine applies be narrow or wide ranging? The majority recognizes the need for refinement and limitation of the principle but defers the difficult inquiiy for an appropriate case,\u201d finding that the present matter has a constitutional rather than a statutory basis. One\u2019s lingering unease is not entirely allayed, however, since the majority in <em>Serrano II </em>in the course of its determination of those rights which it deemed \u201cfundamental\u201d for equal protection purposes stated, \u201cSuffice it to say that we are constrained no more by inclination than by authority to gauge the importance of rights and interests affected by legislative classifications wholly through determining the extent to which they are \u2018explicitly or implicitly guaranteed\u2019 ... by the terms of our compendious, comprehensive, and distinctly mutable state Constitution.\u201d <em>(Serrano </em>v. <em>Priest, supra, </em>18 Cal.3d 728, 767, fn. omitted.) The inescapable meaning of the foregoing language is that the \u201cimportance,\u201d nature and quality of \u201cconstitutional rights,\u201d in the sense used by the majority, is \u201copen ended\u201d\u2014a right is not necessarily \u201cfundamental\u201d merely because it is incorporated in the state Constitution. If such is the case, it is exceedingly difficult to understand why, for purposes of applying the \u201cprivate attorney general\u201d concept, vindication of every such \u201cconstitutional\u201d right will be considered important enough to qualify for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>In view of the foregoing considerations and uncertainties, and particularly because of the force and clear legislative expression of section 1021 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the cogent analysis of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Alyeska, </em>it seems to me much wiser to await further legislative guidance on the matter of attorneys\u2019 fees. In the final analysis, and as a practical matter, it is the Legislature, presumably, that must find the funds to pay the bill. The absence of any specific legislative authorization is especially troublesome in this case, because substantial sums ($800,000) are awarded from the public treasury to publicly or charitably supported attorneys to whom the plaintiffs themselves legally owe nothing for services. From a policy standpoint, other factors may render this result entirely appropriate but those considerations should be legislatively expressed and defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">I would reverse the judgment and deny the motion for attorneys\u2019 fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Clark, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b85-7\">CLARK, J., Dissenting.</author>\n<p id=\"ADF\">While joining the dissent of Justice Richardson, I add several considerations. Establishing an open-ended monetary-reward program to subsidize lawyers who successfully prosecute constitutional litigation, the majority opinion usurps the legislative function.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">The majority opinion points to neither constitutional nor statutory requirement that attorneys be compensated for successfully pursuing constitutional litigation in behalf of what they deem to be the public interest. Moreover, in the instant case the majority opinion frankly concedes that neither taxpayer nor school child is assured of any concrete benefit by the <em>Serrano II </em>decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Ante, </em>p. 41.) Rather, the majority decide for policy reasons, usually reserved to the Legislature, that constitutional litigation should be promoted in circumstances where the only real winners can be the subsidized attorneys. If the majority\u2019s goal is to promote constitutional litigation, they have chosen a productive formula. The majority\u2019s view that vindication of constitutional rights is important and that litigation to that end should be encouraged is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>laudable. But the majority\u2019s financial backing of that view constitutes an improper judicial prerogative that is unacceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Until today, California judges have entertained neither the dream nor the power to endorse a particular social program, appropriate the requisite money from the public treasury to fund it, and then order payment to those deemed deserving. I have always thought such authority to be vested exclusively in the Legislature. However, if the judiciary is to partake of the legislative process, should we not do so in a deliberative, parliamentarian manner? Should we not appoint committees and hold public hearings to determine whether, in the absence of reward money, charitable foundations, public-spirited attorneys or tax funded law firms, like the one before us, will adequately seek to vindicate constitutional rights? We should also be informed whether the subsidy will likely produce results commensurate with the costs, and whether other methods of financing constitutional litigation might be more effective. And the ultimate step in the budget-making process must be taken\u2014to determine whether other important social programs are more in need of limited tax funds. We, of course, have done none of these things because, unlike the Legislature, we are neither equipped nor empowered to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Finally, the majority in recognition of the dangers inherent in the private attorney general concept, purport to limit the concept to only those instances when constitutional rights are vindicated in the face of legislative or executive default. Not only is this a limitation without bounds, but the reward becomes nothing more\u2014nor is it less\u2014than a bounty for searching out and invalidating constitutionally vulnerable legislative or executive action. Our Constitution, of course, establishes a government of three equal branches\u2014legislative, executive, and judicial. Is it any more appropriate for the judiciary to offer a bounty for legislative or executive hide, than it is for those branches to seek ours?</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The petition of the defendants and appellants for a rehearing was denied November 17, 1977, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above. Bird, C. J., and Manuel, J., did not participate therein. Sullivan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Wright, J.,<footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark> participated therein. Clark, X, and Richardson, X, were of the opinion that the petition should be granted. Clark, X, did not concur in the modification.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b85-9\"> Essentially <em>Serrano II </em>requires a reallocation of tax resources and of educational funding. As pointed out in my dissent <em>(Serrano II, </em>18 Cal.3d 728, 785 [135 Cal.Rptr. 345, 557 P.2d 929]), the reallocation will primarily involve taking from the poor and giving to those more economically fortunate. While some taxpayers and some students may be expected to profit by <em>Serrano II </em>and others suffer, members of the two groups cannot be precisely identified. The award of attorney fees runs against the stte generally with no effort to apportion it between winners or losers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Retired Associate Justice of the Supreme Court sitting under assignment by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b86-8\">[Retired Chief Justice of California sitting under assignment by the Acting Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
