We conclude that under our decision in <em>Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 286 [124 Cal.Rptr. 204, 540 P.2d 44], defendants; having made a prima facie showing of their claim of discriminatory enforcement, are entitled to pursue discovery with respect to their defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">Defendants Griffin and Pounds are former Riverside County sheriff\u2019s deputies. Griffin, who is black, and Pounds, who is white, were jointly charged in July 1976 with violating Penal Code section 147 (willful inhumanity or oppression of a prisoner).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A declaration filed in support of defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss stated that the charges arose from allegations that defendants locked a juvenile in a closed patrol car on a hot evening in July with the automobile heater running. Griffin alleges that the charges would not have been filed against him if he were not black; Pounds alleges that no criminal charges would have been filed against him if his partner for that evening had been white, or if he had acted alone. Defendants\u2019 declarations stated on information and belief that in the preceding 10 years many white deputies acting alone or in concert with other white officers had committed acts of inhumanity without legal sanction. The declarations alleged nine unprosecuted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>incidents of prisoner beatings and mistreatment by white officers and the approximate dates on which those incidents took place.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">In September 1976, defendants filed substantially similar discovery motions seeking production of all sheriff\u2019s department records, notes, or memoranda of departmental investigations into incidents of violent, cruel, or inhuman conduct toward prisoners during the preceding 10 years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial court granted the motions after an <em>in camera </em>review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>some of the allegedly privileged records requested,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but the Court of Appeal ordered the discovery orders set aside on the grounds that the defense requests were \u201coverly broad and [permit] the Real Parties in Interest to engage in a fishing expedition.\u201d We denied a hearing in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Griffin responded to this adverse ruling by narrowing his discovery request and filing a new motion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This supplemental motion, which incorporated the declarations defendants had filed with their original motions to dismiss (see fn. 3, <em>ante), </em>requested a statistical summary of sheriff\u2019s department records for the preceding 14 years,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> disclosing, inter alia, annual figures as to (1) the number and percentage of black officers employed by the department, (2) the number and percentage of black officers terminated by the department, (3) the total number of investigations conducted by the department into alleged violations of section 147 and the number of such investigations which involved a black officer, and, finally (4) the total number of prosecutions commenced by the county for violation of section 147 and the number of such prosecutions which involved a black officer.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In addition, defendants applied for and received a subpoena duces tecum which paralleled the earlier broad request. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>On the People\u2019s motion, however, the municipal court quashed the subpoena and denied in its entirety defendants\u2019 motion for supplementary discovery. The superior court and the Court of Appeal thereafter denied defendants\u2019 petitions for writs of mandate, the Court of Appeal concluding that \u201c[njeither the District Attorney nor the Sheriff is required to prepare a statistical summary for use by petitioners. Moreover, the breadth of the discovery sought remains excessive.\u201d We granted defendants\u2019 petition for hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">As we explain, we believe that defendants correctly contend that the denial of their motion for statistical summaries of police records deprives them of evidence which might support a defense to the criminal charge pending against them and therefore denies them their right to a fair trial. Accordingly, we have concluded that defendants are entitled to obtain such statistical information from the prosecutorial authorities.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>In <em>Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 286, we followed a principle, long recognized in federal law,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that discriminatory enforcement of the laws may be a Valid defense in a case in which the defendant can establish deliberate invidious discrimination by prosecutorial authorities. We found that defendants\u2019 discriminatory enforcement defense did not \u201crest simply upon allegations of l\u00e1xity of enforcement; instead, defendants . . . clearly alleged that the Kern County law enforcement authorities undertook a practice of \u2018intentional, purposeful and unequal enforcement of penal statutes\u2019 against [defendants].\u201d <em>(Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 286, 301.) Since defendants had established a specific prima facie showing of such discriminatory prosecution, they were entitled to pursue discovery against the prosecution with respect to the claim of discriminatory enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Unlike civil discovery, criminal discovery in California is strictly a judicial creation. In <em>Pitchess </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 531, 536-537 [113 Cal.Rptr. 897, 522 P.2d 305], we held that in contrast to the formal statutory requirements for civil discovery, \u201can accused in a criminal prosecution may compel discovery by demonstrating that the requested information will facilitate the ascertainment of the facts and a fair trial. [Citations.] The requisite showing may be satisfied by general allegations which establish some cause for discovery other than \u2018a mere desire for the benefit of all information which has been obtained by the People in their investigation of the crime.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Applying this reasoning to the defense of discriminatory enforcement, we held in <em>Murgia </em>that the defendants\u2019 right to discovery should be given effect according to \u201ctraditional principles of criminal discovery.\u201d <em>(Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 286, 306.)  While at the pretrial stage we are not able to determine what evidence a defendant will ultimately proffer in support of his claim, a motion for discovery \u201cmust nevertheless describe the requested information with at least some degree of specificity and must be sustained by plausible justification.\u201d <em>(Ballard </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 159, 167 [49 Cal.Rptr. 302, 410 P.2d 838, 18 A.L.R.3d 1416].) We concluded in <em>Murgia </em>that defendants\u2019 prima facie showing of a conscious policy of selective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>enforcement against them satisfied that requirement of \u201cplausible justification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">In the present case, the declarations filed by defendants are clearly sufficient to justify discovery under the foregoing standard. In the declarations, defendants specify several incidents of misconduct as serious as or more serious than their own involving nine named white officers which did not result in prosecution, and thereby establish \u201cplausible justification\u201d for believing that invidious discrimination may have played a role in the decision to pursue the present prosecution. Defendants\u2019 supplemental motion itself limits the discovery request to a statistical summary of the data necessary to prepare the defense of discriminatory enforcement, and requires disclosure only of the information relating to incidents of mistreatment of prisoners.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Such a statistical summary will avoid the possibility of impairing the confidentiality of sensitive information irrelevant to the asserted defense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, it is evident that defendants cannot readily obtain the information requested through their own efforts, since, as was the case in <em>Pitchess, </em>the sheriff\u2019s department maintains exclusive control over the records necessary to substantiate the asserted defense. (See also <em>Hill v. Superior Court </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 812, 817 [112 Cal.Rptr. 257, 518 P.2d 1353].)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Finally, a statistical summary is clearly relevant since it would tend to show, directly or circumstantially, the application of different policies for disposition of cases involving white and black officers. The first step in the present defendants\u2019 proof of discrimination may well be to demonstrate a significant disparity between blacks\u2019 representation, in the population of Riverside County sheriff\u2019s deputies, and blacks\u2019 representation in the group of disciplined, discharged, and prosecuted deputies. Past discriminatory prosecution cases uniformly accept a defendant\u2019s use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>of statistical proof in this way to make out a prima facie case of invidious discrimination. (See, e.g., <em>Murgia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 286, 305 and fn. 17; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gray </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 256, 260-261 [63 Cal.Rptr. 211]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d Supp. 837, 839 [5 Cal.Rptr. 852]; cf. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Louisiana </em>(1972) 405 U.S. 625, 629-631 [31 L.Ed.2d 536, 92 S.Ct. 1221].)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The rulings on defendants\u2019 discovery motions have placed defendants in an impossible position. These rulings decree in essence that defendants cannot properly claim the raw data necessary to the defense because this procedure would permit a \u201cfishing expedition,\u201d and that defendants have no right to a summary of that data because the prosecution is under no duty to prepare one. It may be that granting defendants\u2019 requests will cause embarrassment to the sheriff's department. Yet no unreasonable incursion or publication of irrelevant, confidential information is likely to occur. And denial to defendants of their discriminatory enforcement defense by the means employed in these proceedings would nullify defendants\u2019 legal right to present a defense which we have declared available.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that defendants\u2019 allegations concerning the prior practice of the Riverside County Sheriff\u2019s Department constitute a prima facie showing of discriminatory enforcement entitling defendants to the statistical summaries they seek.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue, directing the trial court to vacate its order denying discovery and to proceed in accordance with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Bird, C. J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., Richardson, J., Manuel, J., and Newman, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b334-10\">Although defendants in the underlying criminal prosecutions are technically petitioners in the instant discovery proceedings, for convenience we shall refer to these individuals as \u201cdefendants\u201d throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b334-11\"> Penal Code section 147 provides that \u201c..

I am informed and believe the officers\u2019] names, alleged acts, and disposition of allegation are as follows: 1. Deputy [J. W.], while working in the Indio jail during 1971 or 1972, severely beat a prisoner. Deputy [W.], according to my information, was terminated but not prosecuted. 2. Deputy [S. A.], while working in the Riverside jail during 1975, threatened to and did break the arm of a prisoner. Deputy [A.], according to my information, was terminated, not prosecuted and later reinstated. 3. Deputy [J. L.], while working in the Indio jail during 1972 or 1973 (date uncertain) severely beat a prisoner. Deputy [L.], according to my information, was not disciplined, discharged or prosecuted. 4. Deputy [H. H.], while working in the Indio jail during 1972 or 1973 (date uncertain) severely beat a prisoner along with Deputy [L.] (referred to in paragraph 3 above). Deputy [H.], according to my information, was not disciplined, discharged or prosecuted. 5. Deputy [D. R.], while working in the Indio jail during 1971 or 1972 (date uncertain), severely beat and mistreated a prisoner. Deputy [R.], according to my information, was disciplined, but not discharged or prosecuted. 6. Deputy [G. M.], while working in the Indio jail during the past five years (date uncertain), severely beat and mistreated a prisoner. Deputy [M.], according to my information, was not disciplined, discharged or prosecuted. 7. Deputy [K. C.], while working in the Indio jail during 1975 or 1976 (date uncertain) severely beat and mistreated a prisoner. Deputy [C.], according to my information, may have been disciplined, but was not discharged or prosecuted. 8. Deputy [W.], while working on patrol duties on or about July 4, 1976, mistreated a juvenile prisoner taken into custody at Lake Cahuilla. This occurred in the presence of one lieutenant and two sergeants of the Riverside Sheriff\u2019s Office. According to my information, Deputy [W.] was not disciplined, discharged, or prosecuted. 9. Deputy [D. N.], while working patrol duties on July 3, 1976, observed and participated to the same extent as I in the events which form the basis for this prosecution. Deputy [N.] was interviewed in connection with the instant matter and the information obtained from him parallels the information I gave in my interviews to the Riverside Sheriff\u2019s Office. These interviews demonstrate that our roles, if any, were identical. Deputy [N.] was not disciplined, discharged or. prosecuted.\u201d Griffin\u2019s declaration was nearly identical.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The discovery motions\u2019 paragraph 16, which the sheriff\u2019s department challenged, sought the following material: \u201cAll records, reports, handwritten or typewritten notes, memoranda, correspondence, inter-office memos, transcripts of tape recorded interviews, photographs, tape recordings, oral or written statements and physical evidence relating to all investigation by any officer of the Riverside Sheriff\u2019s office, into incidents of alleged violent, cruel, inhuman or oppressive conduct committed by any other officers of the Riverside Sheriff\u2019s office upon any prisoner in custody of the Riverside Sheriff\u2019s office or any other law enforcement agency during the period September 1, 1966 through September 1, 1976, whether or not administrative, disciplinary or criminal prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>resulted therefrom. <em>Murguia </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1975) 15 C3 286; 124 Cal.Rep. 204.\u201d The department also objected to paragraphs 20 to 23, which essentially restated paragraph 16 somewhat more specifically.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The prosecution requested <em>in camera </em>review pursuant to Evidence Code section 1040, which provides in relevant part that \u201c(b) A public entity has a privilege to refuse to disclose official information, and to prevent another from disclosing such information, if the privilege is claimed by a person authorized by the public entity to do so and: ...

As we stated in <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 767, 770-771 [22 Cal.Rptr. 206, 371 P.2d 982], \u201cin the orderly administration of justice, and in support of a sound judicial policy, a court, in the absence of unusual or changed circumstances,... is justified, in its discretion, in refusing to consider repetitive applications of the same petition.\u201d The subpoena request in question precisely parallels the request that was rejected in defendants\u2019 earlier writ proceeding (see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>and constitutes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>\u201crepetitive application\u201d for the same relief. Accordingly, without passing on\"the merits of the subpoena request, we conclude that this aspect of the municipal court\u2019s ruling should not be overturned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">See, e.g., <em>Oyler </em>v. <em>Boles </em>(1962) 368 U.S. 448 [7 L.Ed.2d 446, 82.

It simply is those records, etcetera, which apply to any allegations of a violent, cruel, inhuman or oppressive conduct toward any prisoner. Now, this doesn\u2019t go into going through the personnel file of every deputy, or going through the personnel of the deputy, that might have been charged with having committed some violent, cruel, inhuman or oppressive conduct toward a prisoner. It\u2019s just those reports that relate to that incident.\u201d (Transcript of hearing for clarification of court\u2019s order, Nov. 18, 1976.) While the trial court did not have the issue of the supplemental motion before it at the time, its reasoning that the discovery allowed would avoid divulgence of potentially privileged material is even more apposite to the statistical summary at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
