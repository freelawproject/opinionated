We think he erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-19\">Much of the briefs is concerned with the question, of whether the state court in which the suit was filed was entirely without jurisdiction of the cause, or had jurisdiction but was prevented from proceeding upon considerations wholly of comity. Appellee insists that appellant is on the horns of a dilemma. If the court was wholly without jurisdiction, so that the filing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the suit there, was a void act, its filing did not toll the statute, while if that court had jurisdiction, the saving statute which applies only in case the dismissal was because of want of jurisdiction, cannot avail the state. On its part, the state insists; that the first suit was with jurisdiction, so as to toll the statute and remained such a suit until the leave to sue was denied and it intervened, in the federal court, when it continued in the federal court as the same suit, and that if not, it then became one which had to be dismissed for want of jurisdiction and the federal court intervention was protected under the saving statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">In the view we take of the case, we need not enter into a dialectional discussion of whether after permission to sue was refused, the state court was prevented from proceeding further because of want of jurisdiction, or because of considerations of comity, or into too nice an analysis of the two statutes in question. The case can and should be disposed of in the state\u2019s favor, upon the simplest of general considerations. The statute limiting the time for suit was not an enabling act, for the state needs no enabling act to permit it to sue upon a claim. It was a statute o f limitations putting a time limit to the right the state had to sue. As such statute, while the state is of course, bound by it, it must, as between the receiver and the state, be strictly construed against the receiver and in favor of the state. Empire Gas &amp; Fuel Co. v. State, 121 Tex. 138, 47 S.W.2d 265; Magnolia Petroleum Co. v. Walker, 125 Tex. 430, 83 S.W.2d 929; DuPont Co. v. Davis, 264 U.S. 456, 44 S.Ct. 364, 68 L.Ed. 788; McCarthy Co. v. Commissioner, 9 Cir., 80 F.2d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The discretion of a court to refuse 'to grant leave to sue the receiver in other courts is not an absolute but a regulated discretion which cannot be abused. Petaluma Savings Bank v. Superior Court, 111 Cal. 488, 44 P. 177, and this principle is of such force as between state and federal courts, that modernly, permission to sue, unless upon strong considerations, is practically never refused. American Brake Shoe Co. v. Interborough Co., D. C., 10 F.Supp. 512, at 521 and cases cited; Cf. Driver-Harris Co. v. Industrial Furnace Corp., D.C., 12 F.Supp. 918. When then, the state elected to file its suit in the state court at the seat of government where such suits would ordinarily be filed, its doing so was not, and could not be \u201can intentional disregard of jurisdiction\u201d, for the state had the right, under the circumstances disclosed, to assume that the leave to sue would be granted, and the failure to grant it was an abuse of discretion. The suit was properly begun within the period of limitations fixed by law and but for the action of the federal court in improperly interfering with its prosecution by failure to grant leave, the suit would and should have continued where brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The failure to grant leave together with the making of the order requiring all claimants to intervene in the federal court, was in effect a stay of the slate court suit, and the filing of the intervention thereafter in the federal court, was not the institution of a new, but the continuance of the old suit, effectually tolling the statute. Cf. Union Steamboat Co. v. Chaffin\u2019s Administrators, 7 Cir., 204 F. 412; Friederichsen v. Renard, 247 U.S. 207, 38 S.Ct. 450, 62 L.Ed. 1075. If however, we are mista,ken in this view and the intervention be considered not the same but a new suit, we think it equally plain that the defense of limitation may not be sustained. For, when the order denying leave was passed, the state court could not in the face of that order proceed further with the suit, and when upon the receiver\u2019s plea in abatement, it dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction over the person of the receiver, but without prejudice to the right of the state to institute a new suit or to intervene in the receivership proceedings, the matter fell directly within the provisions of the saving statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The judgment is reversed and the caus\u00bb is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-12\"> J.
