The first subdivision of \u00a7 386, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 786, docs indeed require that this shall be done and that the estate shall be liquidated, and the second presupposes that the plan shall be altered or modified generally; but the third subdivision demands neither, it looks only to the specific correction of the wrong done if that may be accomplished without affecting \u201cadversely\u201d the interests of innocent parties. Under the power so conferred the bankruptcy court may, if the circumstances permit, grant what the creditor here demands; i. e, that his claim shall be scheduled and allowed, and that the plan shall provide for it according to its proper priority, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-25\">The petition at bar does not indeed allege the fraud with as much particularity as is desirable. But the omission is not fatal; it is only a pleading, and Rule 8(f), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c, demands that it \u201cshall be so construed as to do substantial justice.\u201d Its general purport is plain enough, and if the debtor had really any doubt about its meaning \u2014 which plainly it had not' \u2014 it had, and still has, relief under Rule 12(e); the day has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>passed when substantial interests stand or fall for such insubstantial reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
