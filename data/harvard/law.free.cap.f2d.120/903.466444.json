The board then issued its complaint against Hawk &amp; Buck, as to these transfers and discharges, and also complaining in some detail that respondent has engaged and is engaging in a continuous plan and course of action, for the purpose and with the result of interfering with the self-organization of its employees and of discouraging their membership in United Garment Workers Local No. 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-11\">Respondent, pleaded in abatement that the matters involved had been presented in a prior proceeding\u2019 which was res judicata of this, and that all of the matters set out in Paragraph 14 of the complaint, had been remedied and cured by a notice respondent had published<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by agreement between respondent, the union and the board. Respondent further filed pleas, exceptions and denials. There was a full hearing, an intermediate report adverse to respondent and findings and order<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>the board also adverse. The board found; that late in April, 1938, the union began an organizational drive among respondent\u2019s employees; that shortly thereafter respondent took steps designed in large part to impede the growth of the union and to otherwise discourage the exercise by its employees of the rights guaranteed by the act. These steps arc set out at length in the findings and it may not be doubted that if they were taken, they had the purpose and effect to impede the growth of the union and discourage membership in it and that they were in violation of the act,</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">\u2019Hie board also found that Bertha Shelnutt, Lula Godsey and Roxie Moser, were discriminated against in regard to hire and tenure of employment on account of union activities in violation of the act. Upon the issue tendered in the plea in abatement, that respondent had adjusted the unfair labor practices, by posting a notice, by agreeing not to commit further unfair labor practices, and by its reinstatement at that time, of Godsey, the board found that the respondent had not observed its agreement but had breached it by continuing to engage in unfair labor practices after its making. The board, as petitioner, seeking enforcement of its order, urges upon us that the evidence sustained its findings and that its order is appropriate under the statute. The respondent, opposing enforcement and seeking vacation of the order, vigorously complains that the board has erroneously given consideration, to what transpired before, as well as to what transpired after, and as vigorously insists; that the evidence as to what transpired after the agreement, affirmatively establishes beyond question, that the transfers and discharges of the three employees named, were made for good and sufficient cause, and for reasons having nothing to do with their offices or activities in tile union; and that the findings and order of the board are without support in the evidence, and wholly inappropriate to effect the policies of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">We cannot agree with the respondent. The board was right in its holding that it is not controlling that there was an agreement to refrain from unfair labor practices and a posting of notices that such practices will be refrained from. What is controlling is whether that agreement has been complied with, the unfair practices have been discontinued. It was therefore entirely proper for it, in determining the matters at issue before it, to view the evidence as a whole, including the practices before, as well as those after the agreement and posting.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\"> So viewed, we think it may not be at all doubted that the evidence fully sustains the findings of the board and that there is no inappropriateness in its order. This being our view and our function being to enforce the board\u2019s order, unless its findings are without support in the evidence, or its order is inappropriate, it can serve no useful purpose for us to set out the evidence here. It will suffice to say that it affords ample basis here for the conclusions the board drew; that the discharges were unfair labor practices; and that same were a part of a system of unfair labor practices which also should be restrained.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-11\">The petition of the board will be granted and a decree enforcing its order as written may be presented for entry.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-4\"> \u201cl.
