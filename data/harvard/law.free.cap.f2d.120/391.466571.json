The examiner refused such registration on the ground that the word \u201cChantelle\u201d is merely a geographical name which under section 5 of said act is forbidden registration. The examiner stated that the word \u201cChautelle\u201d is found in Lippincott\u2019s Gazetteer where it is referred to as the name of a town in France w/\u00edh a population of 2,000; that he was unable to find any other meaning for the word, and that he presumed that it was a generally accepted geographical word.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-25\">Upon appeal, the Commissioner of Patents in his decision, affirming that of the examiner, had the following to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-26\">\u201cApplicant points to several recent Patent Office decisions to the effect that the statutory prohibition against registration of \u2018merely a geographical name or term\u2019 is inapplicable unless such name or term has a generally accepted geographical significance, and argues that \u2018Chantelle\u2019 should thus be held registrable because its meaning is perhaps not widely known. However, as was stated by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia in the case of In re Crescent Typewriter Supply Co., 30 App.D.C. 324, the \u2018provision of the statute is broad enough to prohibit the use of any word that has an exclusive geographical significance\u2019; and in such cases there would seem to be no room for exception. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>If a word has no other meaning it is necessarily \u2018merely\u2019 geographical, regardless of the extent to which it is known.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-4\">\u201cIt is stated in applicant\u2019s brief that \u2018we find \u201cChantelle\u201d to be a French word meaning a feudal collector of taxes who has the right to live and operate in a feudal manor.\u2019 No publication is cited in support of this statement, however, and no such definition appears in modern French dictionaries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Upon petition for rehearing the commissioner made the following observation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-6\">\u201cIn a decision rendered January 24, 1940, I affirmed the examiner\u2019s ruling, observing that \u2018Chantelle\u2019 is the name of a town in France and appears to have no other meaning. In support of the petition for rehearing attention is directed to a French dictionary, published in 1771, wherein the word is defined as a term referring to customs, and in certain provinces is said to mean \u2018a personal tax to the lord from his bond-servants because of their servitude to him, giving them the permission to live on his land and to possess certain inheritances.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-7\">\u201cAs stated in my previous decision with respect to another asserted meaning of the word, \u2018no such definition appears in modern French dictionaries;\u2019 and whatever significance it may have had a century and a half ago, \u2018Chantelle\u2019 is now the name of a town in France, has no other meaning, and is \u2018merely\u2019 geographical.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Appellant has appealed here, and in its original brief and its brief in reply to the solicitor\u2019s brief argues at considerable length that \u201cChantelle,\u201d although the name of a town in France, is not merely geographical for reasons stated in its petition for rehearing before the commissioner, and argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-9\">\u201cThere is no town or place named \u2018Chantelle\u2019 in the United States or in any of its territorial possessions. So far as we know the small town in France to which the Examiner has referred is the only place in the world bearing the name \u2018Chantelle.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">\u201cThe village of \u2018Chantelle\u2019 is not shown in the well known World Atlas published by the Literary Digest in the year 1931. We have examined all. of the school Atlases and geographies used in the Chicago schools, but have not found it mentioned in any of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-11\">\u201cThe name \u2018Chantelle\u2019 was not found in any modern English or French dictionary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-12\">It further argues that the word \u201cChantelle\u201d has no geographical significance to people of the United States and that the only purpose of the use of the term as a trade-mark is to designate the origin of the cheese produced by appellant in Illinois. A number of decisions are relied upon for support, none'of which we think sustain appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-13\">The record discloses nothing, and we have found nothing elsewhere, which indicates that the term \u201cChantelle\u201d means anything other than the name of a town in France. We have not examined the French authority published in 1771 which, according to appellant, defined the term as relating to some kind of tax. It was pointed out by the commissioner in his decision on the petition for rehearing that no such definition appears in any modern French dictionary \u201cand whatever significance it may have had a century and a half ago, \u2018Chantelle\u2019 is now the name of a town in France, has no other meaning, and is \u2018merely\u2019 geographical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-14\">We are in full accord with the views expressed by the commissioner and the fact that the town is little known in this country does not change the situation. The statute, in prohibiting the registration of geographical terms made no exemption in favor of those which lacked importance or of those which were not well known by the people in this country. The Patent Office and the courts are not privileged to read unwarranted exemptions into the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-15\">It would seem that the correct decision of the issue is so clear that no extended citation of authority is required. We think, however, that the following cases support our conclusion: Elgin National Watch Company v. Illinois Watch Case Company et al., 179 U.S. 665, 21 S.Ct. 270, 45 L.Ed. 365; Montevallo Mining Company v. Little Gem Coal Co. et al., 57 App.D.C. 100, 17 F.2d 688; In re Crescent Typewriter Supply Co., 30 App.D.C. 324; In re California Perfume Co., Inc., 56 F.2d 885, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1028 and Columbia Mill Co. v. Alcorn, 150 U.S. 460, 14 S.Ct. 151, 37 L.Ed. 1144, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-16\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
