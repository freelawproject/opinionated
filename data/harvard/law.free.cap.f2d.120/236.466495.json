Appendix, \u00a7 301 et seq., and the regulations thereunder, is clear under the decisions sustaining similar legislation of 1917, 50 U.S.C.A. Appendix, \u00a7 201 et seq. Selective Draft Law Cases, 245 U. S. 366, 38 S.Ct. 159, 62 L.Ed. 349, L.R.A. 1918C, 361, Ann.Cas.l918B, 856; Cox v. Wood, 247 U.S. 3, 38 S.Ct. 421, 62 L.Ed. 947; Hamilton v. Regents of the University of California, 293 U.S. 245, 262, 55 S.Ct. 197, 79 L.Ed. 343; United States ex rel. Bergdoll v. Drum, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 897, 129 A.L.R. 1165, certiorari denied 310 U.S. 648, 60 S.Ct. 1098, 84 L.Ed. 1414. To attempt a distinction because the present Act applies, though no formally declared war exists, is to import a difference which does not appear in the Constitution itself, Art. 1, Sec. 8, cl. 12, and which was definitely repudiated in the cited cases. Coqapare the well-reasoned opinions of Bondy, D. J., in ruling on demurrers to the indictments herein, United States v. Rappeport, D.C.S.D.N.Y., 36 F.Supp. 915, and of Fee, D. J., in Stone v. Christensen, D.C.Or., 36 F.Supp. 739. The indictments were adequate to give fair notice of the crime charged, Ruthenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 480, 483, 38 S.Ct. 168, 62 L.Ed. 414; there was no reason for a continuance to procure evidence as to an emergency vel non, since that was ir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>relevant to the validity of the law; and the trials of those accused who did not eventually plead guilty were as fair and adequate as possible under the circumstances of obstruction which the accused felt themselves obliged to present. Indeed, appellants\u2019 guilt was indisputable once the Act was found valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
