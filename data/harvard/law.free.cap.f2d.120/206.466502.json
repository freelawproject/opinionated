His contention that the prosecutor failed to produce sufficient evidence to substantiate the charge contained in count 5 of the indictment cannot prevail. An examination of the record convinces us that the offense was thoroughly proven and that no prejudicial error was committed at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-22\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
