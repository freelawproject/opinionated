They read :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-25\"><em>\u201c4. An </em>alloy steel pisfon ring for internal combustion engines which is highly resistant in service to wear, scuffing, scoring aud loss of tension, said steel containing from an effective amount to about <em>4% </em>of metal of the group consisting of: vanadium, molybdenum, chromium, manganese, silicon, nickel, copper and aluminum, the balance of said steel consisting substantially of iron.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-27\">\u201c12. A piston ring for internal combustion engines made from an alloy steel containing: about .3 to 4% chromium, about .05 to 1% vanadium, and about .5 to 1.5% carbon, the balance of said steel consisting substantially of iron.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-28\">The references are: Fay, 1,284,279, Nov. 12, 1918; Marshall, 1,965,294, July 3, 1934.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-29\">The patent to Fay relates to a packing ring composed of tungsten steel in which \u201ctungsten constitutes from eighteen to twenty-five per cent, of the total weight of the steel.\u201d The packing ring is \u201cada.pt ed for use with bodies of relatively small diameter (such as sliding sleeve valves and pistons for small-bore cylinders).\u201d The object of the invention, as stated by the patentee, is to \u201cproduce a ring of this character of great heat-resisting capacity, whereby the ring will he able to withstand high temperatures without losing its elasticity; also to produce a ring which is particularly <em>free from </em>abrasion.\u201d (Italics not quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-30\">The patent to Marshall relates to packing or piston rings made of high carbon steel (steel containing over .3% carbon) for use in internal combustion engines. The patentee states that he has found that piston rings of high carbon steel \u201cmay be run for a far longer time, even under the ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>acting conditions of a continuous uninterrupted run, than does the ordinary cast iron ring, outlasting the latter many times, acquiring a high polish, and causing no appreciable wear or scoring of the cylinder wall,\u201d and that he has \u2018\u2018devised a practical process which results in the production of perfect rings from ductile material such, for example, as high carbon steel, <em>including so-called \u2018alloy steels,\u2019 such rings having all of the desired physical characteristics requisite in a piston ring </em>and being capable of production at a cost which is substantially less than that involved in making ordinary cast iron rings.\u201d (Italics not quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">All of the appealed claims were rejected by the Primary Examiner on the references of record, and appealed claims 4 and 11 were also rejected on the ground that they were indefinite and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Relative to the form of claims 4 and 11, the examiner stated that they call for an alloy steel piston ring \u201ccontaining,\u201d as stated in each of those claims (except as to the order in which the metals are enumerated), \u201cfrom an effective amount to about 4% of metal of the group consisting of: vanadium, molybdenum, chromium, manganese, silicon, nickel, copper and aluminum\u201d; that as those elements do not constitute or belong to a recognized chemical or metallurgical group \u201ctheir specific inclusion in the claims appears to be due merely to the fact that applicant has experimented with many elements and has found these to be satisfactory\u201d; and that \u201cSuch grouping according to experimental results of substances which do not form a known chemical or metal-urgical group does not conform to the practice authorized in Ex parte Markush, 340 O.G. 834, as construed in Ex parte Burke, <em>441 </em>O.G. 509 and renders the claims indefinite and ambiguous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">In holding that the appealed claims were unpatentable over the references of record, the Primary Examiner said: \u201cPatent-ability for such claims could be predicated only on one or two theories \u2014 first\u2014that the alloy itself was patentably novel and that applicant in specifying the article made therefrom had unnecessarily limited himself and- \u2014 second\u2014that there has been a new use of an old material, which produced new, unexpected and useful results.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">\u201cThe first theory is rendered untenable by the fact that, applicant originally presented claims for the alloy (claims 1 and 2) that they were rejected on prior art and were canceled.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">\u201cThe second theory seems to be the one on which applicant relies. The qualification of utility is conceded to be established by applicant\u2019s arguments and affidavit. The requirement of novelty is, in general, negatived by Marshall\u2019s suggestion of the use of alloy steels for piston rings. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\u201cNow the suggestion of Marshall that alloy steels be used .for internal combustion engine piston rings and the use of one such alloy by Fay for a pump piston ring clearly negative the idea that such use is an innovation and the fact that applicant, with constructive knowledge of Marshall\u2019s suggestion and Fay\u2019s use, decided to try out numerous alloys and found that many, perhaps most, of them were suitable, seems to negative any very great element of surprise for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">The Board of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Primary Examiner rejecting the appealed claims on the prior art and also rejecting appealed claims 4 and 11 on the ground that they were not in proper form. With reference to the prior art cited, the board called attention to the fact that the patentee Marshall\u2019s piston rings were stated to be made not only of high carbon steel but also of \u201calloy steels.\u201d The board then said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-12\">\u201cIn general, the physical characteristics of the commoner steel alloys are well-known and it is our view that the selection of one of these alloys, broadly suggested by Marshall, does not amount to invention.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-13\">\u201cCertain of the claims are rather specific as to the proportions of the alloying metal but we are not satisfied that there is anything especially critical about the proportion used and therefore affirm the examiner\u2019s action as to claims 4, 7, 11, 12, 13 and 14.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">Although it is stated in appellant\u2019s fifth reason of appeal that \u201cThe B'oard of Appeals <em>erred in considering </em>the Examiner\u2019s objections to the claims 4 and 11 as to form, and <em>erred in not refusing to consider said objections as to form, </em>inasmuch as said claims were never finally rejected on any such ground, the Examiner\u2019s objection on this ground first appearing in his \u2018Examiner\u2019s Statement\u2019 addressed to the Board of Appeals,\u201d it is not argued here that the board was without authority to consider the examiner\u2019s rejection of claims <em>4 </em>and 11 on the ground that they were improper as to form. (Italics not quoted.) The question of whether claims 4 and 11 were proper as to form was raised for the first time in the Primary Examiner\u2019s state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>ment to the Board of Appeals, and as appellant did not withdraw his appeal to the Board of Appeals and present that question to the Primary Examiner, which he had a right to do, the board had authority to consider that ground of rejection as to those claims. See Ex parte Mevey, 1891 C.D. 115, 56 O.G. 805; In re Mulligan, 83 F.2d 917, 23 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1220, 1222. Fitrthermore, the question as to whether claims 4 and 11 are proper in form is not raised in appellant\u2019s reasons of appeal. Accordingly, the decision of the Board of Appeals, affirming the decision of the Primary Examiner holding that claims 4 and 11 were not in proper form, must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">It is contended here by counsel for appellant that appellant\u2019s inventive concept \u201cconsists essentially in discovering the cause of piston ring scuffing and scoring and devising a remedy based on this information, the remedy consisting in substituting for the materials \u2014 cast iron and plain carbon steel \u2014 theretofore employed in piston rings, a material new for this purpose and one <em>developing new and unexpected properties when so used, namely, an alloy steel having the relatively narrow range of analysis specified in the claims. </em>The courts have held such contributions to be inventive.\u201d (Italics ours.) It is further contended by counsel for appellant that in neither of the references of record is the matter of piston ring scuffing and scoring referred <em>to; </em>and that \u201cA substitution of materials in an old article <em>developing new and unexpected properties </em>and uses of the articles or greater utility or more efficient action is inventive,\u201d and cases are cited in support of the latter contention. (Italics not quoted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Appellant states in his application that an object of his alleged invention is to provide a piston ring \u2014 \u201cwhich possesses to an extent not heretofore attained, the <em>qualities requisite to satisfactory performance </em>in internal combustion engines for automotive and like uses, namely: resistance to wear, to scuffing, to scoring, and the ability to retain high strength at high temperatures, such that the ring will not soften or temper at motor operating temperatures, thereby to prevent excessive wear and <em>loss </em>of <em>tension </em>with resulting leakage and loss of compression.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\"><em>\"Scoring is a wearing or abrading </em>of the piston ring surface in contact with the cylinder wall. Scuffing is the occurrence on the wearing surface of the ring, of bright spots which appear harder and which stand out in relief against the surrounding surface areas. Both scuffing and scoring by permitting an escape of gases from the cylinder, result in loss of compression.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Appellant further states in his application that scoring and scuffing of pis <em>ton </em>rings may be prevented by adding alloying elements to plain carbon steels, such alloying elements being molybdenum, chromium, manganese, silicon, nickel, copper, aluminum, and vanadium.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">It will be observed that the patentee Fay stated that a piston ring composed of an alloy steel, tungsten steel, has great heat resisting capacity and is particularly free from abrasion; that is, scoring or wearing or abrading of the piston ring surface in contact with the cylinder wall. However, no reference is made in the Fay patent to the prevention of scuffing by the use of his particular alloy steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">The patentee Marshall states that, although <em>cast iron piston rings </em>have many of the desired characteristics necessary in a piston ring, such, for example, as the \u201cability to maintain a good bearing surface against the cylinder wall without scoring or abraiding the latter when run at high speeds,\u201d piston rings made of cast iron have other characteristics not so desirable, among which, he states, is extreme brittleness. The patentee pointed out that in an effort to avoid the undesirable characterislics of cast iron piston rings, the art employed other materials such as low carbon steel, but that piston rings composed of low carbon steel possess one vital defect, the inability to \u201cform a good wearing surface with the cylinder wall, resulting in rapid scoring and destruction of the cylinder,\u201d and that piston rings made of high carbon steel, including so-called \"alloy steels,\u201d have all the \u201cdesired physical characteristics requisite in a piston ring * * * for forming a good bearing against the cylinder wall.\u201d The patentee did not state, however, that his rings were resistant in service to scuffing and scoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">No contention is made here by counsel for appellant that the Primary Examiner was in error in stating that appellant was not entitled to claims covering his alloy steels per se, or that the Board of Appeals was in error in stating in its decision that \u201cIn general, the physical characteristics of the commoner steel alloys are well known.\u201d Nor can it be successfully contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the patentee Marshall did not suggest that piston rings made of alloy steels had all the \u201cdesired physical characteristics requisite in a piston ring * * * for forming a good bearing against the cylinder wall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">. Appellant states in his application that \u201cI have <em>.observed for example that generally speaking small additions, </em>i. e. up to about 4% of one or more of the alloying elements above noted <em>me sufficient; </em>and <em>more specifically that highly satisfactory results are obtained by additions to plain carbon steels of \u00a1about: </em>.05 to 1% vanadium; .05 to <em>2% </em>molybdenum; .3 to 25% chromium; .3 to 2% manganese; .5 to 4% silicon; .25 to 3% nickel; .2 to 2% copper; or .1 to 2% aluminum. <em>Certain further beneficial results may be obtained by combinations of two or more of the elements above enumerated.\" </em>(Italics ours.) It is apparent, therefore, that appellant does not teach that the percentages of one or more of the alloying elements enumerated in the appealed claims are critical.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">That appellant\u2019s piston rings are new in the sense that the prior art did not teach the percentages of the alloying elements set forth in the appealed claims and that they are useful, is not questioned. However, in view of the facts hereinbefore set forth, we are unable to hold.that the use of alloy steels in the manufacture of piston rings, as set forth in the appealed claims, produced unexpected results and that the board erred in holding that the appealed claims were not patentable over the references of record.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
