Appeal was taken to the Commissioner of Patents by appellee herein, and the commissioner reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences who had sustained the opposition, held that the word \u201cNippy\u201d was descriptive of the opposer\u2019s goods, that the goods of the respective parties were not of the same descriptive properties, but affirmed the adjudication of the Examiner of Interferences that applicant was not entitled to the registration applied for, the latter holding of the commissioner being upon the ground that the mark was either descriptive or misdescriptive of applicant\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-25\">The appellee took no appeal from the adverse decision of the commissioner holding that it was not entitled to the registration of its mark, but appellant has here appealed and challenges the correctness of the holding of the commissioner that the goods were not of the same descriptive properties and that the word \u201cNippy\u201d was descriptive of the opposer\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-26\">Appellee in this court moves to dismiss appellant\u2019s appeal upon the ground that this court has no jurisdiction to consider the case. It rests its motion upon the authority of Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., v. Dextora Company, 103 F.2d 924, 928, 26 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1244, and the cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-27\">The facts in said Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., case are almost identical with those at bar, and the case is so fully in point on the issues here involved that extended discussion of the same is not required. We think it sufficient to quote the following from that case: \u201c* * * In view of the fact, however, that appellee did not appeal from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents holding its trade-mark not register-able, the commissioner\u2019s decision became final, and, therefore, the issue of the registerability of appellee\u2019s mark is not before us for consideration. Accordingly, the issue of confusing similarity of the marks of the parties raised in this court by appellant\u2019s appeal has become moot since the taking of the appeal, and any views we might express with regard thereto would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>not be binding upon the Patent Office tribunals in another action under another statute. Mills v. Green, 159 U.S. 651, 16 S.Ct. 132, 40 L.Ed. 293; Jones v. Montague, 194 U.S. 147, 24 S.Ct. 611, 48 L.Ed. 913; Richardson v. McChesney, 218 U.S. 487, 31 S.Ct. 43, 54 L.Ed. 1121; Frigidaire Corporation v. Nitterhouse Bros., supra [63 F.2d 123, 20 C.C.P.A., Patents 865] ; 1 C.J.S., Actions, \u00a7 17, pp. 1012 to 1018.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">The cases cited in the Frankfort Distilleries, Inc., case, supra, are also in point on the issue at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">We hold that the issues which appellant seeks to present have become moot, and that this court cannot properly consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We think it proper to say that appellant in this court frankly expresses the view that there was at least very grave doubt as to whether or not the court had jurisdiction to pass upon the issues it seeks to present but felt that it would be in a better position with reference to possible future Patent Office action if appeal were taken to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">For reasons stated hereinbefore, and upon the authorities cited, we hold that appellant\u2019s appeal should be and it is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
