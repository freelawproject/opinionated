Kenyon.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-31\">The interference is between appellant\u2019s application, serial No. 736,566, filed July 23, 1934, and appellee\u2019s application, serial No. 9,689, filed March 6, 1935.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-32\">The invention defined in the counts in issue relates to a directional indicator for aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-33\">The interference, as originally declared, consisted of four counts, reading as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-34\">\u201cCount 1. In a flight instrument for aircraft the combination of means for indicating a turn of the craft, an air driven turbine for actuating said indicating means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>and means responsive to rate of turn for regulating the air drive of the turbine to actuate said indicating means whereby the latter indicates the rate of turn integrated with respect to time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">\u201cCount 2. In a flight instrument for aircraft the combination of means for indicating a turn of the craft, a turbine for operating said indicating means, air jet means for driving the turbine, and gyroscopically controlled means responsive to rate of turn for regulating the air jet drive of the turbine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">\u201cCount 3. A directional indicator for aircraft showing the direction and amount of deviation from course, comprising a constrained gyroscope mounted for precession through an angle proportional to the rate of turn of the craft, a fluid driven indicator and fluid actuated means controlled by the precessional position of said gyroscope for turning said indicator at a rale and direction proportional to the extent of precession of said gyroscope, whereby said indicator shows the amount of course change.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">\u201cCount 4. A directional indicator for aircraft showing the direction and amount of deviation from course, comprising a constrained gyroscope mounted for precession through an angle proportional to the rate of turn of the craft, an air turbine, air flow means adapted to drive the same in either direction at variable rates, and means turned by the precession of said gyroscope governing said flow means to drive said turbine at a rate and direction proportional to the extent of precession thereof, and an indicator actuated by said turbine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">Counts 1 and 2 originated in appellee\u2019s application, and counts 3 and 4 in appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">After the interference was declared, another count (No. 5) was added on motion of appellant, reading as follows: \u201cCount S. An aircraft flight instrument comprising a turn indicating member, an air driven turbine operatively connected to the member for actuating the member, means for pneumatically driving the turbine, gy~ roscopically controlled means responsive to rate of turn for regulating the pneumatic drive according to the right and left turn of the supporting aircraft, and means magnetically damping the turbine, whereby to actuate the turn indicator for designating degree of turn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-12\">As to this count judgment on the record was entered against appellee, from which no appeal was taken by him to the Board of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-13\">It will be observed <em>that counts 1 and 2 </em>are limited to a device for \u201cindicating a turn of the craft,\u201d while counts 3 and 4 embrace a \u201cdirectional indicator for aircraft showing the direction and <em>amount </em>of deviation from course.\u201d (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b437-14\">Appellee is the junior party, and the burden was upon him to establish priority of invention by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-15\">Counsel for appellee moved to dissolve the interference as to counts 3 and 4 on the ground that appellant had no right to make the claims constituting the counts in issue. The motion was denied by the Primary Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-16\">Considerable evidence was introduced by the parties, some of which was directed to the issue of the right of appellant to make the claims constituting the counts in issue. The Examiner of Interferences, however, declining to pass upon that issue, stated in his decision that as the Primary Examiner had held that appellant\u2019s application disclosed the subject matter defined in the counts here involved and as no \u201cadditional evidence or arguments\u201d were \u201cbefore the Examiner of Interferences other than those previously presented\u201d he was precluded <em>by </em>the provisions of rule 130 of the Rules of Practice in the United States Patent Office from considering and deciding that issue. After reviewing the evidence, the Examiner of Interferences apparently held that appellee was the first to conceive the invention but that he had failed to establish an actual reduction to practice, and that as he had not established diligence in reducing the invention to practice at the time appellant filed his application, July 23, 1934, appellant was entitled to an award of priority of invention of the subject matter defined by the counts then in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-17\">On appeal the Board of Appeals affirmed the decision of the examiner awarding to appellant priority of invention of the subject matter of counts 1 and 2, and reversed his decision with respect to counts 3 and 4, the ground of such reversal being that appellant\u2019s application does not disclose the subject matter defined in said last-named counts. From the decision of the board with respect to counts 3 and 4 appellant took the appeal before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The sole issue before us, as stated by counsel for each of the parties, is whether the counts are readable on appellant\u2019s disclosure. If they are, the decision of the Board of Appeals should be reversed. If they are not, the decision should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">It was the contention of counsel for appellee before the Primary Examiner and the Board of Appeals, and it is their contention here, that appellant does not disclose in his application \u201cA directional indicator for aircraft <em>showing the </em>* * * <em>amount </em>of deviation from course,\u201d as called for by each of the involved counts. (Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">It is not contended here that appellant\u2019s application does hot disclose the other structural elements defined in the counts in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">It is stated in appellant\u2019s application that the instrument disclosed therein is intended to aid the pilot of an airplane in \u201cblind flying\u201d by indicating any'turning movement of the craft from its normal course, and that for this purpose appellant discloses an illuminated screen so arranged with other structural elements that an image in the form. of \u201ccheckered squares\u201d is projected upon the screen, which image is normally stationary; that is, it is stationary until a turning movement of the aircraft occurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">The details of appellant\u2019s device need not be set forth here. It is sufficient to say that the image is projected upon the illuminated screen by the use of an \u201cinterrupted surface located in the path of light which illuminates the screen.\u201d The \u201cinterrupted surface\u201d is \u201cin the form of a peripheral toothed disk,\u201d every fifth tooth on the disk being \u201cforeshortened\u201d to cause an \u201cinterruption of the image or a darkening\u201d of the series of checkered squares on the screen. When the aircraft deviates either to the right or left of its normal course, the image is instantly animated and passes across the screen so as to \u201cvisually indicate to the pilot the occurrence of a change or deviation from the course.\u201d Appellant states in his application that as \u201cthis movement is comparable in its rate to the rate of turn, the pilot is enabled <em>to determine </em>by watching the movement of the image the approximate extent to which the turning movement has changed the course of the ship and generally locate his position thereby.\u201d (Italics not quoted.) When the ship has been turned back to its normal course, the image on the screen again becomes stationary. Appellant also states in his application that \u201cIn all cases where blind flying is required due to lack of visibility, this ability to determine the extent of any turning movement is important. This is particularly true in approaching a landing field, where the general position of the craft with respect to the field may be located by a two-way radio. Appropriate directions from the field coupled with the indication of position afforded by the image, affords the pilot sufficient information to in all probability make a successful landing, even in those cases where there is a total lack of visibility. * * * <em>By observing the image and coordinating the number of interruptions which traverse the screen, he [the </em>pilot] <em>can readily estimate the extent to which the turning movement has altered the original direction of the craft. Obviously the number of interruptions corresponding to any given angle of turn would depend on the adjustment of the instrument and the number of toothed spaces at which interruptions occur. </em>With the number of interruptions which correspond to any given angle [of turn] once determined, however, the instrument functions to provide a sufficiently accurate measure of the turning movement.\u201d (Italics ours.) It is further explained in .appellant\u2019s application that the movement of the toothed disks or image across the screen corresponds to the rate of turn and that by counting \u201cthe number of interrupted squares which pass before him\u201d the pilot \u201ccan readily gauge the amount of the turning movement\u201d of the aircraft.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">It is apparent from appellant\u2019s application and from the evidence of record that appellant\u2019s instrument may be so adjusted that as each of the foreshortened teeth passes across the screen and causes an interruption of the image thereon, a ten-degree turn is indicated. It is also apparent from appellant\u2019s application and from the evidence of record that it is necessary in the use of appellant\u2019s instrument that the pilot watch the image on the screen in order that he may be informed that his craft is turning from its normal course, and that he must at least count the number of \u201cforeshortened\u201d teeth passing across the screen in order that he may be informed as to the amount of deviation from his course. However, if the instrument is accurately adjusted, it is evident that by observing the image on the screen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>and counting the number of interrupted squares which pass across the screen, the pilot is informed as to the amount of deviation from course as well as the direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">That appellant\u2019s application discloses an instrument showing the direction of deviation from course, is not questioned here.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In his decision holding that appellant\u2019s application discloses a directional indicator for aircraft which shows the amount of deviation from course, the Primary Examiner said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-7\">\u201cFrom a reading of the Kenyon specification it is obvious that the mutually normal, interrupted bars of light thrown upon the screen by the projector and interposed toothed discs constitute indications and that the number of said bars crossing the field of view during a given turn is proportional to the angular extent of said turn. On Page 13, line 18 et seq. of his application Kenyon explains that \u2018By watching the movement of the image and counting the number of such interruptions which pass across the screen, the pilot can readily estimate the extent to which the craft has been turned from its original course at any given instant.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-8\">\u201cAs this statement is thought substantially correct, it is believed unnecessary to satisfy the terms of the counts, that Kenyon be required to show graduations on the teeth 144 or adjacent the field of view thereof. It is sufficient if the pilot can dei ermine the turn, to a degree of accuracy, by noting the number of tooth shadows passing across the field of view. For these reasons it follows that Crane\u2019s motion to dissolve must be and accordingly is, denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">In its decision holding that appellant\u2019s application did not disclose a directional indicator for aircraft showing the amount of deviation from course, the Board of Appeals said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-10\">\u201cClaims 24 and 25 of Kenyon, corresponding to cotints 3 and 4, were introduced by amendment C into the Kenyon application one day before the Crane application was filed. By amendment D it is clear that Kenyon\u2019s position is that the image is the indicator. The image is apparently one of a series of checkered squares referred to in amendment D2 and in Kenyon\u2019s brief as vertical black and white bars. Certain of these squares are interrupted at regular intervals and by watching the number of the interruptions which pass across the screen, the pilot can estimate the angle of turn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-12\">\u201cKenyon\u2019s so-called indicator or image <em>does not make or provide a mark, record or sign to indicate the position of the craft relative to a course. </em>The position of the craft can only be estimated, because with Kenyon\u2019s arrangement no zero point of reference is possible. There was something said at the hearing of using element 186 as a reference point. Kenyon\u2019s application on which the claims must be based makes no such contention, but even if 186 were used as a zero point, there is no zero image to go with it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-13\">\u201cIn brief, counts 3 and 4 cannot be read on the Kenyon application disclosure. Kenyon\u2019s exhibits do not change the situation as to his right to make the counts nor does Kenyon\u2019s argument that Crane cannot malee the counts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-14\">\u201cThe question of Crane\u2019s right to make the counts is not before us but we might state that Crane does show a reference line 55 for reading off degrees of the compass card. Saunier\u2019s testimony (XQ.\u2019s 112 and 113, pages 64 and 65, Crane\u2019s Record) refers to a change in Exhibit 12 <em>which probably would permit an indication of the amount of deviation from course.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">The board was mistaken as to the time appellant made claims corresponding to counts 3 and 4. They were made nearly one year after appellee\u2019s application was filed, but we deem this fact to be immaterial as there is no suggestion that at the time of filing said amendment appellant had any knowledge of appellee\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-16\">Appellee\u2019s directional indicator differs materially from that of appellant. It comprises an indicating dial and, among other things, a rotatable calibrated disc, calibrated, as stated by counsel for appellee, \u201cin terms of from 0 to 7 with corresponding degree indications from 0 (or 360) to 315,\u201d hence, the naught is directly above the zero point, the numeral 1 above the 45 degree marking, the numeral 2 above the 90 degree marking, etc. When the aircraft deviates from its course, the calibrated disc rotates to the right or left, depending upon the direction of deviation with respect to the stationary zero point which serves as a \u201clubber\u2019s line\u201d for reading off the degree markings which appear on the disc. Accordingly, when appellee\u2019s instrument is used and the plane deviates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>from its normal course to an extent of 45 degrees for example, the pilot, by merely observing the instrument, is informed that his craft is off its course to the extent of 45 degrees and it is unnecessary for him to watch the instrument constantly. However, if the aircraft deviates from its course to a degree between the degrees shown on the calibrated disc, the pilot must in part estimate the amount of deviation, although, in order to return to the normal course, it is only necessary to turn the craft until the dial shows the cipher to be directly over the zero point or the \u201clubber\u2019s line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">However, the comparative merits of the two instruments is not the issue before us. The question here to be determined is whether appellant\u2019s application discloses a directional <em>indicator </em>for aircraft <em>showing the amount </em>of deviation from course.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">It is suggested, although not argued, in the brief of counsel for appellant that the first clause in each of the appealed claims, which reads \u201cA directional indicator for aircraft showing the direction and amount of deviation from course,\u201d is merely an introductory clause' and is not to be regarded as a structural limitation of the invention defined by the counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We think it is sufficient to say that the introductory clause in each of the counts in issue is clearly an essential element of the invention defined by the counts, and is not merely introductory for the purpose of explaining the environment in which the other structural elements of the counts are designed to be used (Clarence A. Hall v. Genzo Shimadzu, 59 F.2d 225, 19 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1288; In re Buttolph, 73 F.2d 936, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 802, and that the instant case is clearly distinguishable from the decisions in the cases of Lorenz K. Braren v. George Horner, 47 F.2d 358, 18 C.C.P.A., Patents, 971; In re Beplate et al., 77 F.2d 506, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1232; Deutsch et al. v. Ball, 77 F.2d 930, 22 C.C.P.A., Patents, 1322; In re Mason, Deceased, 94 F.2d 220, 25 C.C.P.A., Patents, 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\"> It is well settled that counts in an interference should be given the broadest construction their language will reasonably permit, but that expressly defined limitations cannot be. ignored. Furthermore, in the event the language of a count or a vital term therein is susceptible of more than one construction or interpretation, as the case may be, and, therefore, ambiguous, the meaning to be given to such language or term must be that disclosed in the application in which the counts originated.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">It is our opinion that there is nothing ambiguous in the phrase of each of the counts: \u201cA directional indicator for aircraft showing the direction and amount of deviation from course.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-11\">The term \u201cindicator\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, 2d Edition, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-12\">\u201cindicator * <em>* * n. * * * </em>1. One that shows or points out; an indication or sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-13\">\u201c2. Specif., any device or apparatus, usually automatic in action, for indicating something; as <em>a </em>An index hand or pointer. <em>b </em>A gauge, as to show pressure, <em>c A </em>speed counter for an engine, <em>d A </em>registering dial, as on a dial telegraph, or in a railroad station to show the positions of trains. <em>e Eng. </em>In some libraries, a device indicating whether a book is out or in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Obviously the term as used in the counts is in the sense of the definition above given under (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary defines the term \u201cindicator\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-16\">\u201cindicator * * * \u00bb. 1. One who or that which indicates or points out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-18\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-19\">\u201cSpecif. Any contrivance or apparatus, automatic or otherwise, which makes a mark, record, or sign to indicate the condition or position of something; as (1) a water-gage; (2) a speed-indicator for an engine; (3) dials showing the position of elevators, cages in a mine-shaft, etc; (4) devices for recording the arrival and departure of trains, the number of fares collected in street-cars, or for testing the running of spindles for any eccentricity, etc.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">The terms \u201cshow\u201d and \u201cshowing,\u201d according to the same dictionaries, have various meanings, depending upon the context with which they are used. Upon the question before us the term \u201cshowing,\u201d as used in the counts, must be considered in connection with the term \u201cindicator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-21\">In other words, the counts call for an indicator which shows the amount of deviation from course, and among the many definitions of the terms \u201cshow\u201d and \u201cshowing\u201d given by Webster\u2019s and Funk &amp; Wagnalls dictionaries above referred to, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>one that, in our opinion, is appropriate when the term \u201cshoving\u201d is used in connection with the term \u201cindicator,\u201d viz., to \u201cgive an indication by record; as, a clock shows the hour.\u201d (Webster).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">A clock is an indicator of time. If the hour hand were to be removed from the face of a clock, we do not think it could be claimed that the clock shows the hours of the day because one could watch the minute hand, count its revolutions around the face of the clock, and, from knowing the hour when he began observation, compute the hours of the day by the number of revolutions which the minute hand had made.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Another illustration is the speedometer of an automobile. Undoubtedly in the pioneer days of speedometers the first invention was that of registering the speed per hour when placed in an automobile, with no registering of the distance travel-led. Later, no doubt, came the invention of registering such disiance. With a speedometer registering only the speed per hour, one by constantly observing the instrument and maintaining it at a constant speed, could, by also consulting his watch at the beginning and at the end of his trip, compute the distance travelled; but could it therefore be said that a speedometer showed the distance travelled when it registered only the speed per hour? We think not, and yet it seems to us that appellant\u2019s disclosure is of the same character.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Surely the man who first invented a speedometer merely showing the speed per hour travelled would not be entitled to a patent including a claim for a speedometer showing not only the speed per hour but also showing the distance travelled.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">If the eye of the pilot is distracted for the merest moment during a turn, even by computation he could not determine the amount of the turn for he could not know how many times the illumination of the screen had been interrupted.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">We are in agreement with the view of the Board of Appeals that appellant\u2019s application does not disclose an indicator showing <em>the \u201camount </em>o\u00ed deviation from course\u201d; and to award him priority of invention of the subject matter of counts 3 and 4 would reward him for an invention which he has not disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">Appellant discloses no structure to support counts 3 and 4 different from that dis-dosed by him to support counls 1 and 2. Priority of invention of the subject matter of counts 1, 2 and 5 has been awarded to appellant, and in our opinion these counts embrace the full measure of the invention disclosed by appellant in so far as this interference is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">We are of the opinion that <em>the </em>Board of Appeals came to the right conclusion, and its decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b441-13\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AJM\">(dissenting)-</p>\n<p id=\"b441-14\">As stated in the majority opinion, the terms \u201cshow\u201d and \u201cshowing\u201d have various meanings, depending upon the context in which they are used. For instance, they mean to \u201cexhibit,\u201d \u201cdisplay,\u201d \u201cdisclose,\u201d \u201creveal,\u201d \u201cmake known,\u201d \u201cexplain something,\u201d \u201cteach,\u201d \u201cinform,\u201d \u201cinstruct; as, he showed me how to solve the problem\u201d; to make \u201capparent or clear by evidence, testimony, or reasoning; to prove; demonstrate ; as, to show the truth of a statement ; to show that the sun moves\u201d; to \u201cconstitute evidence or proof of; indicate; as, his clothes show bad taste\u201d; to \u201cmake known the way to (a person) ; hence, to direct; guide; usher; conduct; as, to show a person into a parlor; to show one to the door\u201d; to \u201cgive indication of by record; as, a clock shows the hour; industrials show an advance.\u201d Synonyms for the word \u201cshow\u201d are: \u201cManifest, betoken, demonstrate, evidence, divulge; lead, escort.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary, Second Edition. For further illustration of the use of the words \u201cshow\u201d and \u201cshowing,\u201d see 39 Words and Phrases, Permanent Edition, pp. 240 to 246, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-16\">It appears, therefore, that the words \u201cshow\u201d and \u201cshowing\u201d mean to make apparent or clear, either to the eye or to the understanding or to both, by display, by evidence, by illustration, or by other means.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-17\">It is stated in the majority opinion that the term \u201cshowing\u201d is not ambiguous when used in connection with the phrase \u201cA directional indicator for aircraft,\u201d and that when interpreted in the light of that phrase it means to \u201cgive an indication by record; as, a clock shows the hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-18\">The only markings on appellee\u2019s indicator to show the amount of deviation from course are 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, and 315 degrees. Accordingly, if an aircraft upon which appellee\u2019s directional in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>dicator is used deviates from course to a degree not shown on the calibrated disk, that is, for example, to a degree between the cipher, which is directly over the zero point or the \u201clubber\u2019s line,\u201d and the forty-five degree marking on the disk, then the pilot can only estimate the amount of deviation, the indicator does not show it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">Now, of course, \u201ca clock shows the hour.\u201d But appellee\u2019s indicator, if I may pursue the analogy of the majority, is somewhat similar to a clock without a minute hand, such a clock does not show the \u201chour\u201d in the common understanding of that term; that is, it does not show the \u201ctime of day as expressed in hours and minutes.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Appellant\u2019s directional indicator does not \u201cgive indication * * * by record\u201d of either the direction or the amount of deviation from course in the sense that \u201ca clock shows the hour\u201d of day.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Accordingly, it would seem to be clear that if the term \u201cshowing\u201d be given the interpretation placed upon it by the majority of the court neither of the parties can make the claims constituting the counts in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">I am of opinion that the term \u201cshowing,\u201d as used in the counts in issue, is ambiguous and, therefore, should be interpreted in the light of appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">It is clear from appellant\u2019s application that his directional indicator for aircraft discloses to an observing pilot both the direction and the amount of deviation from course. It is true that in order that the pilot be informed of the amount of deviation from course he must have knowledge of how appellant\u2019s indicator is adjusted, but, having that knowledge and counting the number of long or, when necessary, the number of \u201cforeshortened\u201d teeth passing across the screen, he is informed as to the exact number of degrees the craft has deviated from its course. Accordingly, construing the language \u201cA directional indicator for aircraft showing the direction and amount of deviation from course\u201d in the light of appellant\u2019s application in which the counts in issue originated, I am of opinion that appellant\u2019s application discloses an indicator which shows the aircraft pilot the amount as well as the direction of deviation from course; that appellant is entitled to make the claims corresponding to the counts in issue; and that the decision of the Board of Appeals should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-11\">I am authorized to say that Presiding Judge GARRETT concurs in the views herein expressed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
