The property in question belonged to George F. Jackson, who died intestate June 12, 1917. James Jackson, a brother of George, died in 1908, leaving a daughter, Mabel Young, appellee herein. Upon the death of George F. Jackson the title to the property in question passed, according to the Probate Court records, to Mabel Young, who entered into possession thereof, claiming it as sole owner and sole heir of George F. Jackson. She has occupied it continuously up to the present time, over twenty years. During her occupancy she paid all taxes and assessments levied against the property; mortgaged it, and used the proceeds in remodeling and improving it. Until the present suit was filed in 1939, no claim was ever asserted by appellant to the property, or to any interest therein.</p>\n<p id=\"pAqm\">Appellant claims to be a son of James Jackson and a brother of Mabel Young. His entire case rests upon that claim. The District Court found against him, however, and we have discovered no reason to disturb its findings; especially in view of the fact that appellant waited until after the death of the material witnesses to assert his claim.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"APZ\">Moreover, apart from the main question of the case, appellant\u2019s claim is barred both by his own laches,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and by appellee\u2019s continuous adverse possession of the property for more than fifteen years<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> under claim of title<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and without knowledge or reason to know of appellant\u2019s claim, first asserted in 1939.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\"> Sweet v.
