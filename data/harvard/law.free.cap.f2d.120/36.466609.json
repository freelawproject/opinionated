This employment was temporary, for a period of four weeks, to give appellant an opportunity to see whether she could work out an advertising sales plan consisting of a marketing news advertising page. At the end of the four weeks appellant confessed that she had failed. Thereafter, she worked out some ideas for the improvement of the plan previously discussed and persuaded appellee to give her two weeks\u2019 additional temporary employment further to test the feasibility of the plan. At the end of the two weeks she had' succeeded in selling the desired space; the new feature was adopted by the newspaper; and appellant was employed upon a \u201cpermanent\u201d basis. She continued in the employ of appellee newspaper company for a number of years, during all of which time the advertising plan which she had worked out was continued , in use by appellee and, in fact, became a very profitable feature of the company\u2019s Evening Star newspaper. Thereafter, appellant was discharged and paid four weeks\u2019 salary in advance.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-28\">This action was commenced in the lower court on the theory, set out in appellant\u2019s complaint, that she had entered into a contract with appellee calling for permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>employment, and that such employment could not be terminated at the will of appellee, as was done in the present case. Two questions are presented on appeal: (1) What elements are necessary in order to constitute a contract of permanent employment? (2) Are the, facts of the present case sufficient to prove that such a contract was made ?</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The rule is that unless the parties reveal an intent to enter into a contract for permanent employment, it will be regarded as terminable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where the intent is not clearly revealed by the express terms of the agreement, the courts will look to evidence of surrounding circumstances to determine what was in the minds of the contracting parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, when one who enters into a contract of employment, promises not only that he will give his services but also additional consideration \u2014 as, for example, by making an investment in the business,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by resigning from government service,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by giving up his own business,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or by relinquishing an acknowledged right to recover for injury which he has suffered<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u2014 such facts may be sufficient, in each case, to show the intent of the parties to enter into a contract for permanent employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Some of the courts have reasoned from these cases that, to prove a contract of permanent employment, <em>two </em>considerations <em>must </em>be shown; that is, a consideration in addition to the services to be performed; and that in the absence of two considerations there can be no such contract.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This misconception results from mistaking the form for the substance. If it is their purpose, the parties may enter into a contract for permanent employment \u2014not terminable except pursuant to its express terms \u2014 by stating clearly their intention to do so, even though no other consideration than services to be performed is expected by the employer or promised by the employee. The meaning of the cases previously referred to is that where no such intent is clearly expressed and, absent evidence which shows other consideration than a promise to render services, the assumption will be that \u2014 even though they speak in terms of \u201cpermanent\u201d employment \u2014the parties have in mind merely the ordinary business contract for a continuing employment, terminable at the will of either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-25\">A careful examination of the evidence in the present case fails to reveal anything more than such an ordinary business contract for an indefinite period, subject to the continuing satisfaction of both parties, and terminable by either upon reasonable notice. The most persuasive language in support of appellant\u2019s contention, which appears in the record, is the statement made by Mr. Newbold, the business manager of the Evening Star: \u201cIf you go out and sell this and make yourself a permanent position, you can have it as long as it is a success.\u201d At the same time it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>clearly understood that if appellant failed to sell the necessary advertising space, during the four weeks\u2019 trial period, there would be no opening on the Star. The letter of authorization which was given to appellant contained no specification whatever concerning the term of employment. At the end of the four weeks\u2019 period she admitted her failure. Thereafter, appellant wrote a letter to Mr. Newbold in which she asked: \u201cWould it be possible for you to give me a position in any of the departments on your paper.\u201d To this he replied regretfully, \u201cthere is no position that I could offer you.\u201d ' He suggested that she see Colonel Herron, the advertising manager of the Evening Star, concerning the possibility of \u201cstraight soliciting for new business.\u201d But Colonel Herron said \u201cthere was nothing.\u201d Thereafter, appellant revised the plan which she had previously failed to sell. At this point in the record her testimony reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">\u201c * * * I took that down and showed it to the Colonel, and with that second appeal he gave me another try of two weeks, and. Mr. Newbold consented to do that also, with the remark that he thought it was throwing good money after bad, but he would give me a second opportunity, and I took the second opportunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-5\">\u201cQ. Now, what arrangements were made at that time with respect to what employment, if any, you should receive there if you succeeded in selling it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-6\">\u201cMr. Jones: I would like to know what was said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">\u201cBy Mr. Hilland:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-8\">\u201cQ. All right, go ahead. What was said ? A. The same arrangement as in the first place, that if I went out and succeeded I would make for myself 'a permanent position, if I sold the page and made a success of it. There was no stipulation as to how I should make a success of it, or anything of the kind. I was to do that. The thing was that I was to get a .permanent position as long as the page was sold and a success.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-9\">\u201cQ. Now, did you succeed in selling the whole page during that additional period of two weeks? A. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The page of advertising upon which appellant worked became very popular; there was a waiting list to get on the page; appellant\u2019s salary was raised from $35 a week to $55 a week. Thereafter, appellant was taken off this particular work and was put to work soliciting advertising \u201con the street.\u201d She asked several times to be restored to her work on the special page. After nine months she was discharged on the ground that she had not been \u201cbringing in enough business.\u201d This charge, she testified, related to her soliciting, not to the special page.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Appellant\u2019s testimony is far from sufficient, under the law as previously stated, to prove an employment contract of greater permanence than for continuing employment terminable at will on reasonable notice. Her testimony on cross-examination reveals that the free-lance advertising business which she had conducted prior to her employment by appellee was not profitable; she was supporting three children; she was very anxious to get employment; she applied to Colonel Herron of the Star because she had worked for him twenty years before; she told him things were very serious with her although, at that time, she didn\u2019t want to let down her pride too much or let him see how desperate she was. On a later visit, however, she made clear to him that she was desperate, that she must have employment in order to feed her children. Whereupon Colonel Herron took her in to see Mr. Newbold. Then followed the conversations upon which she relies. The evidence shows beyond dispute that appellant was so far from being in a position to bargain for a contract of unusual character in the business world, that she revealed to appellee her desperate willingness to take any position which she could get upon the staff of appellee\u2019s paper. While her lack of bargaining power may be regrettable, it, together with the other surrounding circumstances, shows clearly that the minds of the two parties never met upon an agreement for employment, permanent in other than the ordinary sense. Consequently, the lower court properly directed a verdict in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\"> Boatright v.
