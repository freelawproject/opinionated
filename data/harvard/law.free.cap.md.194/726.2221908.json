Petitioner is confined in the Maryland House of Correction for a period of three years. He claims that he was convicted for a crime that he did not commit. He says he was convicted on a chain of circumstances all tending, when connected, together, to establish an illogical inference or conclusion that such facts do exist, and that there was no direct evidence in the case; that one of the witnesses against him told two conflicting stories.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">The question of guilt or innocence and credibility and weight of the evidence cannot be tried on habeas corpus. <em>Rountree v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 292, 55 A. 2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
