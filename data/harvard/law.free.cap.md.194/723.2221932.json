Petitioner is imprisoned in the Maryland Penitentiary under sentence of twenty years for robbery with a deadly weapon in three cases. He alleges in this Court that he was arrested for one thing and tried for another, that the arresting officer searched his house without a search warrant, that the Court had not sufficient evidence to find the petitioner guilty, that the Court did not make it known to the public that they were using a toy pistol against the petitioner as evidence at his trial, that the facts are not sufficient to convict him of robbery with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">An illegal arrest does not prevent one from being validly indicted and tried. <em>State ex rel. Zell v. Warden, </em>191 Md. 745, 59 A. 2d 737. The question of whether his house was searched without a search warrant cannot be raised on habeas corpus, <em>State ex rel. Minter v. Warden, </em>193 Md. 715, 66 A. 2d 919. The question of guilt or innocence and weight of the evidence cannot be tried on habeas corpus. <em>Rountree v. Wright, </em>189 Md. 292, 55 A. 2d 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
