Petitioner argues that the sentence of 15 years imposed upon him is \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of Article 25 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">It has been said by this Court that if it should ever happen that the punishment imposed by the trial court is grossly and inordinately disproportionate to the crime, so that the sentence was manifestly dictated by prejudice or passion and not by a sense of public duty, the judgment should be reversed, and the case remanded for a more just sentence. <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>82 Md. 527, 534, 34 A. 246. But usually any punishment authorized by a statut\u00e9 and imposed by a court within the statutory limits is not cruel and unusual punishment and is not subject to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>view by the Court of Appeals even on appeal from the judgment. <em>Apple v. State, </em>190 Md. 661, 59 A. 2d 509.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-3\">This Court has held that a sentence which is merely excessive is not void <em>ab initio </em>because of the excess, if the court which imposed it had jurisdiction of the person and subject matter, but such sentence is good in so far as the power of the court extended and is invalid only as to the excess. Therefore, a person in custody under such a sentence cannot be discharged on habeas corpus until he has performed as much of it as was within the power of the court to impose. <em>State ex rel. Johnson v. Wright, </em>192 Md. 734, 65 A. 2d 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">In this case there is no question that the Criminal Court had jurisdiction of the person and the subject matter. Petitioner\u2019s contention, even if true, is not sufficient to entitle him at this time to discharge from custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">\n<em>Application denied, without costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
