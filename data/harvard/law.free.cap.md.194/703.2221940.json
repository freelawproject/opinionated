Petitioner is imprisoned under sentences of six years for burglary and carrying a deadly weapon. He alleges that he had previously been convicted and sentenced for the same deadly weapon charge, that while he was in the police station the police unlawfully searched his apartment without a search warrant, that he was not given a separate trial or a trial by jury, and \u201cwas not confronted with prosecuting witness,\u201d nor w;as he \u201cgiven a chance to bring in a witness\u201d for himself. The quoted charges are not explained or amplified. From his brief in this court it appears that at the trial he was represented by counsel, whom he accuses of soliciting employment and incompetency, but not collusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">. .This application is denied on Judge Bailey\u2019s. opinion below:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-12\">\u201cThe petitioner in this case asks for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus on the following grounds: '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-13\">' \u201c(1) Because his apartment was entered without a search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-14\">\u201c(2) Because of certain irregularities at the trial. ..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-15\">\u201cAll of these objections should have been made at the trial.
