They allege the constitutional sections provide for a judicially-enforceable right to an education of \"some quality\" for all public school children, and, alternatively, that the Legislature is currently violating its constitutional obligations to \"provide for\" and \"keep up and support\" the \"system of common schools\" by its current educational financing system. However, we find no support for finding implied constitutional rights to an education of \"some quality\" for public school children or a minimum level of expenditures for education, as appellants urge us to read into sections 1 and 5 of article IX. To the contrary, the language of these constitutional sections do not include qualitative or funding elements that may be judicially enforced by the courts. Rather, the constitutional sections leave the difficult and policy-laden questions associated with educational adequacy and funding to the legislative branch. Consequently, we must affirm the trial court's dismissal of the complaints as appellants have failed to state a claim for which judicial relief may be accorded them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The two lawsuits before us were deemed related but not consolidated in the trial court. In\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education v. State of California\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    CQE\n   </em>\n   ), plaintiffs are several nonprofit associations and guardians ad litem for minor students attending public schools in California, as well as one adult taxpayer and homeowner and two adult taxpayers and homeowners who are parents of students attending public schools in California. Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Maya Robles-Wong v. State of California\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Robles-Wong\n   </em>\n   ), plaintiffs are several nonprofit associations and guardians ad litem for several students attending public schools in California, as well as several California school districts. Intervener California Teachers Association filed a complaint-in-intervention in the\n   <em>\n    Robles-Wong\n   </em>\n   action. Defendants in each action are the State of California and various named persons sued in their official capacities as state officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In their operative complaints, all named plaintiffs and intervener (collectively appellants) seek declaratory and injunctive relief based, in pertinent part, on allegations that all named defendants (collectively respondents) are violating sections 1 and 5 of article IX. The overarching nature of the causes of actions sought to be reinstated are based on allegations that all public school children have a constitutional right to an education of \"some quality,\" and, alternatively, that the Legislature is currently failing to meet its constitutional duty by employing an irrational educational funding scheme. According to appellants, the Legislature's current method of funding education fails to ensure that all public school children have the opportunity to become educationally proficient according to current legislatively-mandated academic standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Resolving respondents' separate demurrer and motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court sustained the demurrer and granted the motion for judgment on the pleadings, without leave to amend, as to those portions of the causes of action alleging that respondents are violating sections 1 and 5 of article IX. The court granted appellants the right to amend their complaints relative to other causes of action, but appellants declined to do so. Accordingly, the court entered judgments\n   dismissing the lawsuits in their entirety. Appellants' timely appeals ensued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In ruling on a demurrer or motion for judgment on the pleadings, the trial court examines the pleading to determine whether it alleges facts sufficient to state a cause of action under any legal theory, with the facts being assumed true for purposes of this inquiry.

Indeed, at the very start, article IX of our 1849 Constitution created the office of Superintendent of Public Instruction; required the Legislature to encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral and agricultural improvement; required the Legislature to establish a system of common schools; and established a fund for the support of the common schools. (See Stats. 1849, p. 32.) ... Section 1 of article IX of the Constitution now provides, as it has since 1879: 'A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.' Section 5 of article IX presently mandates, as it has since 1879: 'The Legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district at least six months in every year, after the first year in which a school has been established.' \" (\n   <em>\n    California Teachers Assn. v.

The question before us is whether the right to an education of \"some quality\" is enshrined, as a\n   <em>\n    constitutional\n   </em>\n   right, under sections 1 and 5 of article IX. Having properly framed the issue, we now analyze Appellants' claims under well-settled principles that guide our interpretation of the California Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At the outset we note that our Supreme Court has not addressed the issue raised by appellants-to wit, whether the right to an education of \"some quality\" is enshrined under sections 1 and 5 of article IX. Appellants ask to find that such a constitutional right is judicially enforceable based on the language in sections 1 and 5 of article IX, and as found by courts in other states that have analyzed constitutional provisions similar to article IX. However, as we now discuss, we conclude the language of sections 1 and 5, when read singly or together, in the context of article IX, does not provide for such an enforceable right, based on our constitutional language and persuasive decisions of other states that have analyzed almost identical constitutional language.

Rather, the question of educational quality is inherently one of policy involving philosophical and practical considerations that call for the exercise of legislative and administrative discretion. [\u00b6] To hold that the question of educational quality is subject to judicial determination would largely deprive the members of the general public of a voice in a matter which is close to the hearts of all individuals in [the State]. Judicial determination of the type of education children should receive and how it can best be provided would depend on the opinions of whatever expert witnesses the litigants might call to testify and whatever other evidence they might choose to present. Members of the general public, however, would be obliged to listen in respectful silence. We certainly do not mean to trivialize the views of educators, school administrators and others who have studied the problems which public schools confront. But nonexperts-students, parents, employers and other[s]-also have important views and experiences to contribute which are not easily reckoned through formal judicial fact-finding.

I am writing separately to address my particular impressions and observations of the nature of the plaintiffs' claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   There is no question that this case is largely about the adequacy of state financial support for California public schools. The defendants are the State of California,\n   the Governor, State Controller and the Director of the State Department of Finance. The Superintendent of Public Instruction and the State Board of Education are not parties. The complaints seek declaratory and injunctive relief to require the state to \"set apart the revenues\" to \"provide and support an education finance system\" that will provide students \"the opportunity to obtain a meaningful education and to learn the academic content standards.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The plaintiffs allege that our state's constitutionally recognized right to education brings with it an obligation of the state to fund education at a qualitative level-an obligation that arises organically and by implication from a reading of article IX sections 1 and 5 of our state constitution together. They say, \"Taken as a whole, the language and history of article IX make clear that the fundamental right to an education must have some qualitative meaning, and it is the duty of the State to keep up and support an educational system that provides all California school children that fundamental right.\" This implicit constitutional obligation is yet inchoate and undefined, and no court of our state has yet recognized it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As much as I can appreciate the plaintiffs' frustration and dissatisfaction with the overall adequacy of California's public schools, and recognize our Legislature's challenges in adequately funding schools to meet the standards it sets, I cannot agree that article IX provides a right to command the state to fund schools at some qualitative level. I so conclude for three principal reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Our state constitution contains provisions that, the plaintiffs acknowledge, explicitly set a minimum level of funding to public schools. But it also contains provisions that set a maximum. Proposition 98 passed by the voters in 1988 and Proposition 111 passed in 1990 established a minimum level of funding commonly known as the minimum funding guarantee, but also established a limit of excess revenues that can go to the schools. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 8.5.) Moreover, as recently as 2014, voters approved a measure placed on the ballot by the Legislature to add section 21 to article XVI of the state constitution to create a state reserve for schools and community colleges and thereby lessen the impact of any economic downturn on the amount of money available to the schools under constitutional formulas. For me, these express provisions conflict with the plaintiffs' argument that an implicit constitutional right to educational adequacy mandates some other minimum specific level of state support to the schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Second, I have no quibble with the plaintiffs' position that the state must afford students the \"opportunity to obtain a meaningful education and to learn the academic content standards.\" For me, assessing whether that obligation has been fulfilled begins and ends with whether our educational system enables sufficient numbers of students to meet the standards articulated in state statutes. The Superintendent of Public Instruction is required by law to develop an Academic Performance Index that measures the performance of school districts, schools and pupils. This index is required to take into account results of statewide achievement tests administered to students in grades 2 through 11. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52052, subd. (a)(1) &amp; (a)(4)(A).) In 2013, this system of assessment was modified to utilize a new testing method. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52052 as amended by Stats. 2013, ch. 489 (A.B. 484).) The new testing and assessment scheme reflects the \"intent of the Legislature that the state's system of public school accountability be more closely aligned with both the public's expectations for public education\n   and the workforce needs of the state's economy. It is therefore necessary that the accountability system evolve beyond its narrow focus on pupil test scores to encompass other valuable information about school performance, including, but not limited to, pupil preparedness for college and career, as well as the high school graduation rates already required by law.\" (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52052, subd. (a)(4)(H).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The plaintiffs say the academic standards articulated in our Education Code inform the constitutional right to a quality education but do not prescribe it. I disagree. It seems to me that our state's obligation to ensure that most students perform at adequate levels is prescribed in the statutory academic standards. In the event that large numbers of students cannot meet expected levels of achievement, an action should arise under the statutes to improve the performance of our public schools without resort to the general language of article IX as authority. Such a statutory basis for an action would also be in accord with the general principle of judicial restraint that courts should not decide constitutional questions where other grounds are available and dispositive of the issues. (\n   <em>\n    Santa Clara County Local Transportation Authority v. Guardino\n   </em>\n   (1995)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1960664\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/11/220/#p230\">\n    11 Cal.4th 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20207\">\n    45 Cal.Rptr.2d 207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=902%20P.2d%20225\">\n    902 P.2d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The plaintiffs did not allege any statutory theory for a cause of action in this case, so the parameters of such a claim must await another day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, also in 2013, our Legislature modified our school funding formula to better address needs based upon differences between school district populations and appropriated an additional $2 billion to the public schools. (Stats. 2013, ch. 47.) Whatever this may mean for the future, one thing seems clear to me. State policymakers are working on the problem, and an action that primarily seeks to increase the amount of state funds provided to the schools may not be the prescription for success. Rather, the balance between more resources and operational and organizational change in the schools may need to be differently struck. Recognition of some duty to support and fund the schools at some particular level may, in the end, do little to advance the cause of educational adequacy.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Section 1 of article IX of the California Constitution states: \"A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Section 5 of article IX of the California Constitution states: \"The Legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district at least six months in every year, after the first year in which a school has been established.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"dissent\">\n  <author id=\"p-66\">\n   Pollak, Acting P.J., Dissenting.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Of the numerous issues presented by this difficult case, two are fundamental: Do sections 1 and 5 of article IX of the California Constitution compel the state to maintain an elementary school system for grades kindergarten through grade 12 (K-12) that meets some minimal qualitative standard and, if so, is the claim that the present school system fails to meet that standard justiciable-that is, may the courts entertain that claim and seek to compel the appropriate state agencies to correct the deficiency? Neither question is susceptible to a facile response. The same issues have been considered at length under similar provisions of other state constitutions by the highest courts of numerous states-with different outcomes. Most state supreme courts addressing the question have read their state constitution implicitly to mandate a minimum qualitative educational system which they have struggled to enforce,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   while a lesser number\n   have either held the mandate lacking or the courts unsuited to articulate and enforce any such qualitative standard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the parties here attempt to distinguish many of these out-of-state cases based on differences in the terminology of the respective state's constitutional provisions, as a general proposition these differences in phraseology are insignificant. All of the constitutions, like the California Constitution, in substance require the state to support a system of public or common schools. Although some state constitutional provisions refer to the maintenance of \"efficient\" or \"thorough and efficient\" schools or school systems, or like terms, none explicitly indicate a particular level of achievement that is required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The different outcomes result less from differences in the wording of the respective constitutions than from different perceptions of the role properly played by the courts in overseeing compliance with the state's basic charter.

Nor does the state's funding scheme take into account the learning needs of certain populations of students, including English Learners and economically disadvantaged children, to ensure that all children receive an opportunity to achieve the state's educational goals and thus have an opportunity to participate in civic life and become productive participants in the economy. Instead, the state bases funding for its education program on formulas that were cobbled together decades ago for a very different educational program and very different needs.\" Plaintiffs quote the 2007 report of the Governor's Committee on Education Excellence, \" 'California's current K-12 education finance system is the most complex in the nation but yields little benefits. Core funding is based on anachronistic formulas, neither tied to the needs of individual students nor to intended academic outcomes.' \" The same report characterizes the educational system as \"fundamentally flawed. It is not close to helping each student become proficient in mastering the state's clear curricular standards, and wide disparities persist between rich and poor, between students of color and others,\n   and between native English Learners and native English speakers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under the current system and the minimum funding guarantee of Proposition 98\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   -which plaintiffs allege \"has become an artificial cap on education spending whose formulas are routinely manipulated by the state for further reductions or delays in funding\"-per pupil spending in California in 2008-2009, adjusted for regional cost differences allegedly \"was $2,856 less per pupil than the national average, or an abysmal 47th in the country.\" In 2007-2008, according to the allegations in one complaint, \"California ranked at or near the bottom in the nation in staffing ratios: 49th in total school staff; 47th in principals and assistant principals; 49th in guidance counselors; 50th in librarians; and 49th in access to computers. California educates over 1.7 million students more than Texas, but does so with 16,700 fewer teachers.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Besides insufficient and undertrained staff, plaintiffs allege that the state's public schools suffer from inadequate instructional programs, insufficient materials, equipment and facilities, inadequate data systems and an inadequate system for ensuring uniform teacher quality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Consequently, the complaints allege: \"California students are directly harmed by the state's failure to meet its constitutional obligation to support its system of public schools. In 2008-09, only 50% of California's students were proficient in English-Language Arts; only 37% of African-American students, 37% of Hispanic students. 36% of economically disadvantaged students, and 20% of English Learners reached this level. Only 46% of California's students were proficient in Mathematics; this percentage dropped to 30% for African-American students, 36% for Hispanic students, 37% for economically disadvantaged students, and 32% for English Learners. By eleventh grade, students in these groups had fallen even farther-in English language Arts, only 25% of African-American students, 26% of Hispanic students and economically disadvantaged students, and 5% of English Learners reached proficiency. Even for California students who are not economically disadvantaged, California still ranks tied for 43rd in fourth grade reading and tied for 41st in eighth grade math. [\u00b6] These dismal statistics reflect only the students who remain in school through eleventh grade. ... Fewer than 70% of California students graduate from high school. The graduation rates are even lower for African-American and Hispanic students, whose graduation rates are both less than 60%. Less than half of African-American males graduate from high school.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The lengthy complaints and extensive briefing, filled with references to a multitude of official reports and academic studies and papers, provide considerably more specifics, criticisms, and proposals than would be profitable to set out at this point. Among other reasons why further specificity here would be pointless is that in the several years that these cases have been pending, there have been legislative and funding changes that may affect the present accuracy of plaintiffs' allegations. Should these actions proceed to trial, the focus would of course be on current conditions to the extent that relevant data is available. Nonetheless, despite changes-\n   hopefully improvements-that have occurred more recently, the fundamental issues raised by the complaints remain: Does the California Constitution imply minimum qualitative requirements for the state's educational system, and is it for the courts to determine whether those requirements are satisfied and to enforce them if they are not?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The contention that the current system fails to satisfy a constitutional mandate necessarily supposes a standard by which to define a minimally acceptable quality of education.

The court reviewed the history of public education in Massachusetts and noted the importance attached to such education. The court concluded that \"[w]hat emerges from this review is that the words are not merely aspirational or hortatory, but obligatory.

The record in that case \"show[ed] clearly that, while the present statutory and financial schemes purport to provide equal educational opportunity in\n   the public schools for every child, rich or poor, the reality is that children in the less affluent communities (or in the less affluent parts of them) are not receiving their constitutional entitlement of education as intended and mandated by the framers of the Constitution.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 552.)

Inadequate transportation fails to convey children to school or home in a manner conducive to even minimal academic achievement. Students in the Plaintiff Districts receive instruction in many cases from a corps of unprepared teachers. Students in these districts are grouped by economic class into what amounts to no more than educational ghettos, rated by the Department of Education's guidelines as substandard. Large percentages of the students in the Plaintiff Districts-over half in some instances-are unable to meet minimal benchmarks on standardized tests, but are nonetheless pushed through the system to 'graduate.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 175.) The court held that \"South Carolina's educational funding scheme is a fractured formula denying students in the Plaintiff Districts the constitutionally required opportunity [for a basic education].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 173.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   As have the courts of these many states and others, I too conclude that the provisions of our state Constitution requiring the state to support a system of common schools is not without substance, and that the Constitution requires a system that provides students with a meaningful basic education in reality as well as on paper. As demonstrated by the experience in those states in which their Constitution has been interpreted to mandate an educational system meeting a qualitative standard, a standard such as those articulated in the opinions quoted above, though general, permits meaningful evaluation of a school system by educational professionals and experts. \"These standards import a wide spectrum of considerations and are admittedly imprecise, but they are not without content. ... The constitutional standards provide an appropriate basis for judicial review and determination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra,\n   </em>\n   176 S.W.3d at pp. 778-779.) As noted by the Connecticut Supreme Court, its \"explication of a constitutionally adequate education\" (quoted above) was \"crafted in broad terms.\" (\n   <em>\n    Conn. Coalition for Justice in Educ. Funding, Inc. v. Rell, supra\n   </em>\n   , 990 A.2d at p. 254.) But, the court points out, this breadth reflects not only the \"recognition of the political branches' constitutional responsibilities, and indeed, greater expertise, with respect to the implementation of specific educational policies\" and that \"the specific educational inputs or instrumentalities suitable to achieve this minimum level of education may well change over time,\" but that \"like any other principle of constitutional law, this broad standard likely will be refined and developed further as it is applied to the facts eventually to be found at trial in this case.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at pp. 254-255.) Using such a standard, the courts can determine whether the existing system of funding and governing California's public\n   schools complies with the constitutional mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Is the claim that the public school system fails to comply with the constitutional standard justiciable?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Defendants here make the same contention that other states have made in most of the cases cited above. As in the South Carolina case, they argue that \" 'the term \"minimally adequate education\" is purposely ambiguous, objectively unknowable, and unworkable in a judicial setting,' and that determining whether the Defendants are meeting their constitutional duty presents a non-justiciable political question.\" (\n   <em>\n    Abbeville County Sch. Dist. v. State, supra\n   </em>\n   , 767 S.E.2d at p. 163.) My two colleagues essentially adopt this view but, like the Supreme Court of South Carolina, I respectfully disagree. As the court there stated, \"Courts may experience difficulty in determining the precise parameters of constitutionally acceptable behavior; however, this imprecision does not necessarily signify that courts cannot determine when a party's actions, or the results of those actions, fall outside the boundaries of such constitutional parameters. ...

While plaintiffs' complaints surely indicate that additional funding is required to bring the public schools up to minimal constitutional quality, there are several reasons for which this limitation on judicial authority and respect for the role of the legislative and executive branches of government do not compel the dismissal of the action. Initially, the complaints address more than the level of present funding. Plaintiffs do not allege simply that the amount of funds appropriated to the schools is insufficient, but that the system by which funds are allocated among schools and school districts is significantly responsible for the inadequacies in the educational system. \"[M]oney is only one of a number of elements that must be studied in giving definition and content to the constitutional promise of a thorough and efficient education.\" (\n   <em>\n    Robinson v. Cahill, supra,\n   </em>\n   355 A.2d at p. 132.) An observation of the Texas Supreme Court may well apply here: following trial, the court there was convinced \"that defects in the structure of the public school finance system expose the system to constitutional challenge. Pouring more money into the system may forestall those challenges, but only for a time. They will repeat until the system is overhauled.\" (\n   <em>\n    Neeley v. West Orange-Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra,\n   </em>\n   176 S.W.3d at p. 754, fn. omitted.) Plaintiffs here point, for example, to the reliance on average daily attendance to determine the amount of base funding each school receives, rather than on the educational needs of each school's student population. At the same time (and perhaps somewhat inconsistently) plaintiffs allege that approximately one-third of educational funds are distributed in the form of categorical grants that impose unduly restrictive conditions and reduce available teaching hours by requiring excessive paperwork and administrative chores. The current funding system, they allege, provides insufficient flexibility to the individual schools and school districts to fashion their curriculum and programs to meet the particular educational needs of the students in their school or school district. Plaintiffs allege that the present system incorporates inadequate teacher training, and some plaintiffs also attribute deficiencies to the methods of teacher evaluation, promotion and discipline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even if one assumes that full correction of the alleged deficiencies in the educational system cannot be achieved without additional\n   funding, it does not follow that causative defects cannot be identified in judicial proceedings and steps ordered to correct them without overstepping the proper limits of judicial authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Furthermore, to the extent that more funds are necessary to provide all students with the basic education mandated by the Constitution, the court's inability to compel the Legislature to appropriate those funds is no reason for the court to refrain from exercising its proper authority to determine whether the state is complying with the constitutional mandate. We need not presume that the Legislature will fail to respond appropriately if the court should ultimately determine that the Constitution is being violated by the lack of sufficient funding. Indeed, our Supreme Court has previously expressed its confidence that \"the Legislature, aided by what we have said today ... will be able to devise a public school financing system which achieves constitutional conformity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Serrano v. Priest\n   </em>\n   (1976)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2286287\" index=\"242\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/18/728/#p748\">\n    18 Cal.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 775, fn. 54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"243\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20345\">\n    135 Cal.Rptr. 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20P.2d%20929\">\n    557 P.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Many other courts, while recognizing the need for deference to the role of the Legislature, have echoed this view. (E.g.,\n   <em>\n    Ex Parte James\n   </em>\n   (Ala. 1997)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11813798\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/713/869/#p882\">\n    713 So.2d 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 882 [\"[T]he judiciary should not presume\n   <em>\n    at the outset\n   </em>\n   of litigation of this nature that legislative and executive officials will be derelict in their duties. Indeed, it must assume the contrary.\"].) Moreover, as the experience in other states confirms, various forms of relief are available short of ordering the Legislature to appropriate funds. Courts have required plans to be developed to address and correct adjudicated deficiencies. The intensive examination of the system that trial of plaintiffs' allegations would necessarily entail may be expected to yield other specific forms of relief. I would not at this preliminary stage attempt to predict the outcome of further proceedings, but I do not assume that no meaningful relief is possible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   It is true that the experience in some states where the courts have ordered relief has not been entirely positive. In the State of Washington, the Supreme Court has held the state in contempt for failing to comply with its orders. (\n   <em>\n    McCleary v. State of Washington\n   </em>\n   (Supreme Ct. No. 84362-7, Order Sept. 11, 2014.)) In Kansas, school closings have been threatened as the result of judicial intervention. (Eveld,\n   <em>\n    Kansas Supreme Court voices aggravation at Legislature in school funding case\n   </em>\n   , The Kansas City Star (Nov. 6, 2015) &lt; http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article43417731.html&gt; [as of Apr. 20, 2016].) Litigation in Texas has given rise to multiple decisions from the Texas Supreme Court since 1989, producing this dissenting opinion in 2005: \"Of course, the true goal of this litigation is to put pressure on the Texas Legislature. We demanded legislative changes by holding the Texas school-finance system unconstitutional in [three separate cases] ... [and] warned that we might do so again soon in [two other cases]. The Court fulfills that threat today. But there is no end in sight; if the past is any indication, the new funding will not last long, and public education will not change much.\" (\n   <em>\n    Neeley v. West O\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    range\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cove Consolidated Independent School Dist., supra,\n   </em>\n   176 S.W.3d at pp. 800-801 (dis. opn. of Brister, J.), fns. omitted.) Litigation in those states is still ongoing, however, so that it cannot yet be said to what extent the court's involvement will have improved the quality of education in those jurisdictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   In other states extended litigation following the court's recognition of a constitutional mandate for quality education has produced meaningful improvements in the educational system. In Massachusetts, for example, in 1993 its highest court directed entry of a declaration that the provisions\n   of the Commonwealth's constitution \"impose an enforceable duty on the magistrates and Legislatures of this Commonwealth to provide education in the public schools for the children there enrolled\" and \"that the constitutional duty is not being currently fulfilled by the Commonwealth.\" (\n   <em>\n    McDuffy v. Secretary of Executive Office of Education, supra,\n   </em>\n   615 N.E.2d at p. 555.) The court articulated broad guidelines, and \"assume[d] that the Commonwealth will fulfill its duty to remedy the constitutional violations that [it] identified.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 554.) The court declared that \"it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to take such steps as may be required in each instance effectively to devise a plan and sources of funds sufficient to meet the constitutional mandate\"(\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 555-556 ) and authorized the lower court to \"retain jurisdiction to determine whether, within a reasonable time, appropriate legislative action has been taken\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 556 ). In 2005, although the lower court had ruled that the state had not yet fully met its constitutional obligations, a majority of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court concluded, \"In the twelve years since\n   <em>\n    McDuffy\n   </em>\n   was decided, the elected branches have acted to transform a dismal and fractured public school system into a unified system that has yielded, as the judge found, 'impressive results in terms of improvement in overall student performance.' She found that 'spending gaps between districts based on property wealth have been reduced or even reversed. The correlation between a district's median family income and spending has also been reduced.' Public dollars for public education are now being allocated to where they are the most effective: defining core educational goals for all students, evaluating student performance toward those goals, and holding schools and school districts accountable for achieving those goals. ...

It may well be that the extent to which proven deficiencies in California's educational system ultimately are corrected will depend on the good faith of legislators and other public officials and the play of political forces.

The plaintiffs include dozens of students of various races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic backgrounds, from first graders to twelfth graders, all of whom attend public schools throughout the state. Citing a wide range of studies and indicators, these schoolchildren allege that the state is failing to provide access to a meaningful education that prepares them to meet the state's academic standards, to achieve economic and social success, and to participate in the political and civic life of their communities. This failure, they contend, violates the education clauses of the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 1 [\"A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the people, the Legislature shall\n   encourage by all suitable means the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.\"], 5 [\"The Legislature shall provide for a system of common schools by which a free school shall be kept up and supported in each district at least six months in every year, after the first year in which a school has been established.\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Court of Appeal, in a 2-1 decision, affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education v. State of California\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776651\" index=\"254\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/246/896/\">\n    246 Cal.App.4th 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education\n   </em>\n   ).) The panel produced three opinions. The majority, in an opinion by Justice Jenkins, held that \"sections 1 and 5 of article IX do not provide for an education of 'some quality' that may be judicially enforced by appellants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 906.) Those provisions, the majority explained, \"do not allow the courts to dictate to the Legislature, a coequal branch of government, how to best exercise its constitutional powers to encourage education and provide for and support a system of common schools throughout the state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 915-916.) Justice Siggins, in a concurring opinion, took the view that \"the academic standards articulated in our Education Code\" essentially define \"the constitutional right to a quality education\" and that any claims of systemic inadequacy \"should arise under the statutes ... without resort to the general language of article IX.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 918 (conc. opn. of Siggins, J.).) Justice Pollak dissented, saying that \"if [article IX] is to have meaning, it must imply that the system of common schools must provide some minimum qualitative level of education. Such a reading of article IX is fully consistent with, if not compelled by, the importance that our Supreme Court historically has placed on the role of education and the recognition that it is a fundamental right of all the state's children.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 922 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Because this case presents unsettled questions of the utmost importance to our state and its schoolchildren, the petition before us readily meets our criteria for review. We are clearly being asked \"to settle an important question of law.\" (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.500(b)(1).) Plaintiffs have made serious allegations of chronic deficiencies in California's K-12 education system, and they have asserted constitutional claims that only this court can definitively resolve. The issues are ones that divided our colleagues in the Court of Appeal, whose three opinions illuminate the momentous and complex nature of the controversy. That court ultimately held that the constitutional adequacy of the largest function of our state government is not an issue within the judiciary's purview. A holding of this magnitude, whether correct or not, warrants a full and reasoned examination by the state's highest court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The high courts in more than two-thirds of the states have addressed these issues over the past three decades in cases arising under the education clauses of their state constitutions. A substantial majority of these courts have decided it is their duty to resolve the constitutional issues; the minority that have found the issue nonjusticiable have done so in published opinions. Many courts have articulated standards for educational adequacy, and such standards have led to progress in some states but not others. All of this experience is available to aid our resolution of this case. Yet this court today decides that the issues presented do not merit our review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   It is not the judiciary's job to make educational policy or to run the public schools. Those functions are constitutionally committed to the political branches (\n   Cal. Const., art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 1 -3, 5, 7 ), and no system will ever be perfect. But plaintiffs do not complain of mere imperfections. They allege that systemic deficiencies have deprived large numbers of children of the most basic educational opportunities, have disproportionately harmed the least advantaged children, and have persisted not only for years but for decades-even as \"there can be no doubt that the fundamental right to a public school education is firmly rooted in California law ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 906.) It is regrettable that this court, having recognized education as a fundamental right in a landmark decision 45 years ago (\n   <em>\n    Serrano v. Priest\n   </em>\n   (1971)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2324364\" index=\"255\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-3d/5/584/#p592\">\n    5 Cal.3d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"256\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=96%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20601\">\n    96 Cal.Rptr. 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=487%20P.2d%201241\">\n    487 P.2d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), should now decline to address the substantive meaning of that right. The schoolchildren of California deserve to know whether their fundamental right to education is a paper promise or a real guarantee. I would grant the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   In order to understand the significance of this case, it is useful to have some historical context. Fifty years ago, California's public schools were the envy of the nation. As an eminent scholar of California history has written, \"[i]n the so-called Golden Age following World War II, the schools of California were considered among the best in the nation, and test scores proved it.\" (Starr, California: A History (2005) p. 335.) During that period, \"[p]ublic schools were being built by the hour, and dedicated. And public school architecture was at its best. An entire generation of talented young men and women went into public school teaching and administration. There was a sense that a utopia was being formed in the classroom.\" (Learning Matters,\n   <em>\n    First to Worst\n   </em>\n   (2004) [video program; Kevin Starr interview].) So confident were the state's leaders in the educational future of California's schoolchildren that they devised and executed a \"Master Plan\" to build what many regard as the best public university system in the world. (Starr, Golden Dreams: California in an Age of Abundance (2009) pp. 217-244.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   \"But by the early 1990s, California had dropped to the lowest rankings in terms of scores and dollars spent on K-12 education. In 1993, for example, fourth-graders in California were vying with fourth-graders in Mississippi for the dubious distinction of being the worst readers in the nation.\" (Starr, California: A History,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at p. 335.) This decline of California's K-12 education system, as the student population has become more diverse, is well-documented. (See Carroll et al., Rand Corp., California's K-12 Public Schools: How Are They Doing? (2005).) For two decades now, California has trailed most states on student achievement and education funding. (See\n   <em>\n    Quality Counts\n   </em>\n   , Education Week (1997-2016) &lt; http://www.edweek.org/ew/qc/&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) The allegations in the complaints, which we must accept as true at this stage of the litigation (\n   <em>\n    Schifando v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   (2003)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"18298\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/31/1074/#p1081\">\n    31 Cal.4th 1074\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1081,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20457\">\n    6 Cal.Rptr.3d 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"260\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20P.3d%20569\">\n    79 P.3d 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), paint a sobering picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   According to one of the complaints (there are two in this case), \"[d]espite having one of the most diverse and challenging student population [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] in the nation, California per pupil spending in 2008-09 was $2,131 below the national average, ranking the State 44th in the country. California's per pupil spending was less than each of the largest 10 states in the nation, with New York spending almost $6,000 more per pupil.\" The staffing of California's public schools reflects the\n   state's low spending levels. In 2007-2008, plaintiffs allege, \"California ranked at or near the bottom in the nation in staffing ratios: 49th in total school staff; 47th in principals and assistant principals; 49th in guidance counselors; 50th in librarians; and 49th in access to computers. California educates over 1.7 million students more than Texas, but does so with 16,700 fewer teachers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The test scores of California students, on average and disaggregated by subgroups, are among the lowest in the nation, as measured by the federally administered National Assessment of Educational Progress. On the 2009 assessment, one complaint alleges, \"California tied for 47th of fourth grade reading and tied for 46th in eighth grade math. [\u00b6] Academic performance is low for all subgroups of students. Even for students who are not academically disadvantaged, California ranks tied for 43rd in fourth grade reading and tied for 41st in eighth grade math. For California students whose parents graduated from college, the rank is still 40th in fourth grade reading and 39th in eighth grade math. ... [\u00b6] ... California's economically disadvantaged students rank 49th in fourth grade reading and 48th in eighth grade math when compared to economically disadvantaged students in other states.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In addition, plaintiffs allege, large majorities of our African American, Latino, and low-income students as well as English learners do not achieve proficiency according to the state's own academic standards: \"In 2008-09, only 50% of California's students were proficient in English-Language Arts; only 37% of African-American students, 37% of Hispanic students, 36% of economically disadvantaged students, and 20% of English Learners reached this level. Only 46% of California's students were proficient in Mathematics; this percentage dropped to 30% for African-American students, 36% for Hispanic students, 37% for economically disadvantaged students, and 32% for English Learners. By eleventh grade, students in these groups had fallen even farther-in English language Arts, only 25% of African-American students, 26% of Hispanic students and economically disadvantaged students, and 5% of English Learners reached proficiency.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Moreover, according to one complaint, California sends a smaller percentage of its high school graduates to four-year colleges and universities than all but three states: \"Of those California students who do graduate from high school, many fail to successfully complete the course requirements (known as 'A-G requirements') needed to even\n   <em>\n    apply\n   </em>\n   for admission to California's four-year public universities. Of 550,000 students who enrolled in California public schools as ninth graders in the fall of 2004, only about one quarter completed the A-G requirements and graduated eligible for a four-year college or university. [Rogers et al., California Educational Opportunity Report (2010) p. 7]. ... [\u00b6] Among those graduates who do gain admission into California's university system, many are unprepared to succeed there. Sixty percent of freshmen in the California State University system are not proficient in either Math or English, or both, and beginning in 2012, will be required to take remedial courses in these subjects before they can begin college.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Although the legislative process has produced a variety of education initiatives over the years, none has yet to substantially reverse these indicators. The passage of Proposition 98 in 1988 and Proposition 111 in 1990, which guarantee K-12 education a minimum share of the state's General Fund, was arguably the last time\n   the policymaking process sought to establish a constitutional minimum for the state's commitment to public schools. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 8.) In 1992, the Legislature passed the Charter Schools Act, which launched the growth of charter schools in California. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 47600 et seq. ) In 1996, the Legislature enacted the Class Size Reduction program, which seeks to limit class sizes to 20 students per certificated teacher. (Ed. Code, former \u00a7 52120 et seq.) In 1999, the Legislature passed the Public School Accountability Act, which set the stage for California's compliance with the federal No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 by introducing a comprehensive system of assessments and accountability mechanisms to track and facilitate student progress toward statewide academic standards. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 52050 et seq. ) Also in 1999, the Legislature created the California High School Exit Exam (Stats. 1999, 1st Ex. Sess. 1999-2000, ch. 1, \u00a7 5, p. 8075), but in 2015, the Legislature suspended it, and it is no longer a condition of receiving a diploma (Stats. 2015, ch. 572, \u00a7 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   More recently, the voters in 2012 passed Proposition 30, which imposed temporary tax increases to support K-12 education and community colleges. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 36, subd. (e).) And in 2013, the Legislature restructured the school finance system by creating the Local Control Funding Formula, which is designed to improve the ability of school districts to flexibly use state education dollars to address the most pressing areas of need. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 42238.02.) Each district now receives a base funding allocation per student, plus supplemental funding depending on the district's population of English learners and low-income students as well as the concentration of those students in the district. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   As these efforts suggest, educational policymaking in California has not been a tale of intransigence. At the state and local levels, many educational leaders have labored mightily to provide all children with access to a decent education, and we should not ignore their successes. (See Cal. Dept. of Education Success Stories &lt; http://www.cde.ca.gov/nr/re/ss/&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) However, as the complaints allege, the past two decades have not produced a tale of overall efficacy either. It is of course unrealistic to expect a major turnaround of any large school system to occur overnight; such \"miracles\" are properly met with skepticism. But some states have made significant gains in education over the past 20 years (see Hanushek et al., Achievement Growth: International and U.S. State Trends in Student Performance (2012) pp. 5-16), even as student achievement in California, despite some progress, has remained generally low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   It is against this backdrop that plaintiffs have turned to the courts for an elaboration of the Legislature's duty to provide for a system of common schools. The schoolchildren who brought these actions do not claim they are entitled to a world-class education. They ask only whether the California Constitution protects them from being deprived of a minimally adequate education. They are asking the judiciary, as the ultimate guarantor of constitutional rights, to define and safeguard their fundamental right to education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Despite recognizing that education is a fundamental right under the California Constitution, the Court of Appeal found \"no explicit textual basis [in section 1 or section 5 of article IX] from which a constitutional right to a public school education of a particular quality may be discerned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 909.) The court said that section 1 is \" 'general and aspirational' \" and that section 5 does not \" 'delineate or identify any specific outcome standards.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 908-909.) The court also refused to read sections 1 and 5 together to find a right to an education of some quality. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 909.) Further, the Court of Appeal invoked separation of powers principles in finding the controversy nonjusticiable, concluding that \" '[t]he quandary described in the complaint[s] is lamentable, but the remedy lies squarely with the Legislature, not the judiciary.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 916.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   As Justice Pollak argued in dissent, there is significant reason to question the Court of Appeal's holdings that article IX's education clauses do not imply any minimum standard of quality and do not impose any duties on the Legislature that are judicially discernible or enforceable. These holdings reflect the minority view among the more than 30 state high court opinions addressing similar issues under their state constitutions. (See\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 920 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.) [\"The different outcomes [among state high courts] result less from differences in the wording of the respective constitutions than from different perceptions of the role properly played by the courts in overseeing compliance with the state's basic charter.\"].) A significant number of these courts have recognized a judicially enforceable right to an adequate education. The adequacy standards articulated by the high courts of Connecticut, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, West Virginia, and Wyoming are reviewed in Justice Pollak's dissent.

Judicial formulation of broad and general standards \"reflects not only the 'recognition of the political branches' constitutional responsibilities,\n   and indeed, greater expertise, with respect to the implementation of specific educational policies' and that 'the specific educational inputs or instrumentalities suitable to achieve this minimum level of education may well change over time,' but that 'like any other principle of constitutional law, this broad standard likely will be refined and developed further as it is applied to the facts eventually to be found at trial in this case.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 929-930.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Apart from its concerns about formulating an adequacy standard, the Court of Appeal worried that adjudication of plaintiffs' claims would potentially put the judiciary on a collision course with the Legislature in violation of the separation of powers. Two points from Justice Pollak's dissent are pertinent here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   First, \"[t]o a large extent,\" this worry \"rest[s] on the premise that plaintiffs are seeking to compel the California Legislature to appropriate additional funds for K-12 education, which is beyond the constitutional province of the judiciary.\" (\n   <em>\n    Campaign for\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Quality Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 931 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).) However, \"[p]laintiffs do not allege simply that the amount of funds appropriated to the schools is insufficient, but that the system by which funds are allocated among schools and school districts is significantly responsible for the inadequacies in the educational system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, \"[p]laintiffs allege that the present system incorporates inadequate teacher training, and some plaintiffs also attribute deficiencies to the methods of teacher evaluation, promotion and discipline.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 932.) At this point, it is far from clear that any remedy for a proven violation would require the courts to order increased spending on education. \"[A]s the experience in other states confirms, various forms of relief are available short of ordering the legislature to appropriate funds. Courts have required plans to be developed to address and correct adjudicated deficiencies. The intensive examination of the system that trial of plaintiffs' allegations would necessarily entail may be expected to yield other specific forms of relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 932-933.) Indeed, it may be that reforms designed to make more efficient use of existing funds would provide an important measure of relief if plaintiffs were to prove a violation. (See\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 918-919 (conc. opn. of Siggins, J.) [\"the balance between more resources and operational and organizational change in the schools may need to be differently struck\"];\n   <em>\n    Vergara v. State of California\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775911\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/246/619/#p640\">\n    246 Cal.App.4th 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640-641 [trial court found that hiring and retention of grossly ineffective teachers severely hamper students' educational progress].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Second, and more fundamentally, whatever limitations on judicial authority may constrain a court's ability to order remedies for proven violations, \"[w]e need not presume that the Legislature will fail to respond appropriately if the court should ultimately determine that the Constitution is being violated by the lack of sufficient funding.\" (\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 246 Cal.App.4th at p. 932 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).) Although courts in some states have clashed with their legislatures over educational adequacy remedies (e.g., Kansas and Washington), there are also examples of such litigation resulting in interbranch collaboration and important reform (e.g., Kentucky and Massachusetts). Like Justice Pollak, \"I would not presume to predict the long-term consequences of permitting plaintiffs' disturbing allegations to be examined at trial and the appropriateness of any remedy for confirmed inadequacies evaluated on appeal. ... It may well be that the extent to which\n   proven deficiencies in California's educational system ultimately are corrected will depend on the good faith of legislators and other public officials and the play of political forces. Nonetheless, I would not assume that a judicial edict, entered and upheld after the searching inquiry demanded by our court system, would be for naught.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 935.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   This last point bears emphasis. The potential for conflict between courts and the political branches is inherent in the power of judicial review. Even so, \"[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\" (\n   <em>\n    Marbury v.

I do not underestimate the uncertainties that might attend a judicial declaration of the law in this context. But it has always been the case that \"[t]he judiciary ... has no influence over either the sword or the purse .... It may truly be said to have neither Force nor Will, but merely judgment; and must ultimately depend upon the aid of the executive arm even for the efficacy of its judgments.\" (The Federalist No. 78 (Cooke ed., 1961) p. 523 (Hamilton).) We ought to proceed in this case, as we do in all constitutional cases, with a strong presumption that public officials-having taken the same oath we have taken to \"support and defend the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of California\" (Cal. Const., art. XX, \u00a7 3 )-will work in good faith to effectuate any judgment duly entered by the courts. This understanding is not only a matter of the respect we owe the coordinate branches of government, but also an essential underpinning of the rule of law as practiced in our constitutional tradition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The challenges facing California's K-12 education system remain within the purview of the Governor, the Legislature, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, and other state and local officials. This court's passivity in the face of plaintiffs' claims should not be understood as an implied judgment that those claims are unmeritorious or unfit for judicial resolution. Our denial of review suspends, for now, the prospect of judicial elaboration of what the fundamental right to education entails. But it is possible that the complexion of the issue and, in turn, this court's posture may change if our education system further stagnates or worsens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   At the same time, my vote to grant review should not be construed as a judgment that plaintiffs have established a constitutional violation. Apart from the unsettled questions of justiciability and interpretation of article IX, plaintiffs' allegations have not been tested at trial, and it appears that some of the conditions alleged in the complaints have changed. Since 2010, the year plaintiffs filed their complaints, state funding of K-12 education has risen significantly. Proposition 98 funding per pupil is projected to exceed $10,000 in 2015-2016, a 28 percent real increase since 2010-2011. (Legis. Analyst, The 2016-17 Budget, EdBudget Tables, K-12 Education, K-12 Proposition 98 Funding Per Pupil &lt; http://lao.ca.gov/Publications/Report/3326#8&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) The current budget returns our K-12 system to the funding level that existed in 2007-2008, before the economic downturn. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) Whether education funding will continue its current upward trajectory remains to be seen. (See Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 36, subd. (f) [Proposition 30's\n   tax increases to fund education will expire in 2016 (sales tax) and 2018 (personal income tax) ].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As a result of the Local Control Funding Formula, enacted in 2013, a significant portion of education dollars are now allocated to districts according to their numbers of low-income students and English learners as well as the concentration of those students in the district. (Ed. Code, \u00a7 42238.02.) The formula replaced what many believed to be an outdated and arbitrary funding scheme with a more rational and equitable distribution. School districts now have more discretion in spending their funds, and each district is responsible for adopting a three-year local control and accountability plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 52060 et seq.) This devolution of control and accountability marks a pronounced shift from the decades of centralized education governance catalyzed by Proposition 13 and reinforced by the federal No Child Left Behind Act. Time will tell whether these reforms prove effective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Meanwhile, student achievement remains low. On the 2015 National Assessment of Educational Progress, California ranked 48th in fourth-grade math, 49th in fourth-grade reading, 41st in eighth-grade math, and 44th in eighth-grade reading. (U.S. Dept. of Education, Nat. Center for Education Statistics, NAEP State Comparisons &lt; http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/statecomparisons/&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) These low rankings persist when test scores are disaggregated by subgroups. In fourth-grade reading, for example, California students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch ranked 48th compared to their counterparts in other states; students who were not eligible ranked 40th. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Although the initiatives above are significant, none of them directly addresses the fundamental question of adequacy at the heart of plaintiffs' complaints. Proposition 98 funding is designed to increase with growth in the economy and K-12 attendance, but the funding level is not based on what resources are needed to provide a minimally adequate education to all students. The Local Control Funding Formula aims to distribute funds more equitably according to student needs, but it does not purport to prescribe adequate funding levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In order to identify a concerted effort to examine the adequacy of California's K-12 education system, one has to go back a full decade. In 2005, a bipartisan group of state leaders-the President Pro Tem of the Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly, the Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Governor's Committee on Education Excellence, and the Secretary of Education-commissioned a comprehensive review of California's school finance and governance systems. Funded by four major foundations, this initiative enlisted dozens of scholars throughout California and the nation, and resulted in over 20 research papers not only on resource adequacy and equity, but also on state and local governance, teacher policies, and data and information systems. (Stanford Center for Education Policy Analysis, Getting Down to Facts &lt; https://cepa.stanford.edu/ gdtf/overview&gt; [as of Aug. 22, 2016].) This unprecedented body of research was completed in 2007, but its potential impact in the policymaking arena was largely eclipsed by a severe recession. Now that economic conditions have improved, there have been calls to renew the wide-ranging inquiry that began a decade ago. (Cal. School Boards Assn., California's Challenge: Adequately Funding Education in the 21st Century (2015).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Today this court declines to decide whether our state Constitution lends urgency\n   or guidance to such inquiry.

And rightly so: Meaningful access to public education is foundational not only to economic opportunity for millions of students, but to our shared civic life. But what good are such judicial exhortations if that right has no meaningful content?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Arguing that such content must exist to render meaningful the fundamental right to education, plaintiffs allege that the California public schools fail to provide large numbers of students with a level of minimally acceptable education in violation of article IX of the California Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   According to plaintiffs, California does too little to define a minimally adequate education for its students. It ranks at or near the bottom relative to other states in terms of educational outcomes and staffing ratios. It provides inadequate teacher training, and fails to provide the resources students need to succeed. As a result of these deficiencies, plaintiffs allege, California students are directly harmed: nearly two-thirds of low-income and minority students fail to meet the state's own standard of proficiency in mathematics or language arts; and fewer than 60 percent of African-American and Latino students even graduate from high school. (See\n   <em>\n    Campaign for Quality Education v. State of California\n   </em>\n   (2016)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6776651\" index=\"307\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/246/896/\">\n    246 Cal.App.4th 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 924-925 (dis. opn. of Pollak, J.).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Whether plaintiffs could have proven as much at trial-this case having been squelched at the pleading stage-remains unanswered. So do the important questions of state constitutional law presented by this case that our court is best suited to resolve. (See Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.500(b)(1).) Indeed, the question whether our state Constitution demands\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   minimum level of educational quality, as opposed to resolving precisely how schools should be administered, lies at the core of what this institution is empowered to adjudicate. And because plaintiffs' claims here concern a range of state activities affecting education, the key question in this case implicates more than simply an exercise in defining the appropriate level of funding or of any other single input to support an adequate education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   We consider that question against the backdrop of separation of powers principles that are vital to our government. Yet never have these principles meant that we should strain to avoid our responsibility to interpret the state Constitution simply because the right at issue touches on concerns the Legislature might ultimately address, or because the task of resolving a case implicating the right to education demands careful attention to the proper role of courts as well as our sister branches. We routinely treat as justiciable those challenges based on other fundamental rights, such as the right to marry, vote, or engage in free speech. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    In re Marriage Cases\n   </em>\n   (2008)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884087\" index=\"308\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/43/757/#p809\">\n    43 Cal.4th 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 809,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"309\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20683\">\n    76 Cal.Rptr.3d 683\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"310\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=183%20P.3d%20384\">\n    183 P.3d 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [right to marry];\n   <em>\n    Fashion Valley Mall, LLC v.

The right to education is no less fundamental, nor is it any less worthy of protection. Courts of other states, when faced with similar challenges based on this right, overwhelmingly agree. (See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Gannon v. State\n   </em>\n   (2014)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417354\" index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/1107/\">\n    298 Kan. 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12417354\" index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/298/1107/\">\n    319 P.3d 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1226 [\"Most state supreme courts have rejected the nonjusticiability argument ...\"].)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   It is especially important for California's highest court to speak on this issue. Our state educates one-eighth of all public school students in the country. (See Nat. Ed. Assn., Rankings of the States 2015 and Estimates of School Statistics 2016 (May 2016) p. 11.) Many of those kids who come from low-income families find themselves concentrated in particular schools or districts that, despite the best intentions, fail to deliver an education remotely worthy of the students they are serving. These realities make it all the more critical that the representative branches play the crucial role that belongs to them, but with greater clarity about the scope of the right to\n   education-clarity only this court can provide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Respectfully, I would grant review.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    A general description of the California Assessment of Student Performance and Progress System along with reports of the most recent scores can be found on the Department of Education website at: &lt; http://www.cde.ca.gov/ta/tg/ca/&gt; (as of April 20, 2016).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    E.g.,\n    <em>\n     Conn.
