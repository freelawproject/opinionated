On February 26, 2007, Defendant-Appellant Robert W. Melina (\u201cMelina\u201d) obtained and memorialized in a note (the \u201cNote\u201d) a loan from Wall Street Mortgage Bankers Ltd. for $591,000 in principal. As security for this loan, Melina executed a mortgage on his property at 1245 77th Street in Brooklyn, New York. Wall Street Mortgage Bankers indorsed the Note to the order of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (\u201cIndyMac\u201d), and IndyMac later indorsed the Note in blank.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-11\">In July 2008, the Office of Thrift Supervision closed IndyMac and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d) as its receiver. That same day, the Office of Thrift Supervision created a new entity, IndyMac Federal Bank, F.S.B. (\u201cIndyMac Federal\u201d), transferred Indy-Mac\u2019s assets to IndyMac Federal, and appointed FDIC as IndyMac Federal\u2019s conservator. FDIC later also became IndyMac Federal\u2019s receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">On March 19, 2009, FDIC as IndyMac Federal\u2019s receiver entered into a Loan Sale Agreement (\u201cLSA\u201d) to sell substantially all of IndyMac Federal\u2019s assets to Plaintiff-Appellee OneWest Bank, N.A. (\u201cOneWest\u201d). Section 2.05 of the LSA, titled \u201cClosing,\u201d contemplates that transfer of the subject notes \u201cshall\u201d take place at some future time. <em>See </em>App. 76. Section 3.04(b) of the LSA requires that all notes subject to transfer pursuant to the LSA bear a specific form of endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">Around the same time that OneWest acquired Melina\u2019s loan, OneWest contracted with Deutsche Bank National Trust Company for Deutsche Bank to serve as document custodian for Melina\u2019s original Note and mortgage. In that capacity, Deutsche Bank had physical possession of Melina\u2019s original Note and mortgage from 2009 until April 2011, at which point Deutsche Bank sent them to OneWest. OneWest returned Melina\u2019s Note and mortgage to Deutsche Bank in May 2011, and Deutsche Bank sent them back to OneWest in June 2014. OneWest then transmitted Melina\u2019s original Note and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>mortgage to its foreclosure counsel at Gross Polowy, LLC, on June 19, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On August 1, 2009, Melina defaulted on his loan by failing to make the payment due that day. He did not cure the default after receiving notice from OneWest.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On July 21, 2014, CIT Group Inc. entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger between CIT Group and IMB HoldCo LLC, the parent company of OneWest. CIT Group is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business located at 11 West 42nd Street, New York, New York. Article V, Section 5.2 of the Agreement and Plan of Merger requires that, during the period between the date of the agreement and the actual closing, OneWest seek CIT Group\u2019s written permission prior to undertaking almost two dozen significant corporate decisions. These decisions include opening, closing, or relocating a branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">On September 10, 2014, OneWest commenced a foreclosure action against Melina in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York, invoking the court\u2019s diversity jurisdiction. On that day, Melina\u2019s original Note and Mortgage were in the physical possession of OneW-est\u2019s counsel at Gross Polowy. On October 13, 2014, OneWest filed an amended complaint containing substantively the same allegations as the original complaint. On February 3, 2015, Melina filed an answer, and on April 2, 2015, he filed an amended answer. OneWest thereafter moved for summary judgment, and Melina cross-moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">On June 18, 2015, the District Court heard oral arguments on the motions. In a memorandum and order dated August 31, 2015, the District Court denied Melina\u2019s cross-motion to dismiss and granted OneWest\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court held that a national bank such as OneWest is a citizen only of the state in which its main office is located \u2014 not also of the state of its principal place of business \u2014 and that OneWest\u2019s main office is indisputably in California. The District Court concluded further that, even if the principal place of business of a national bank mattered for jurisdictional purposes, OneWest\u2019s was California.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">The District Court also disagreed with Melina\u2019s standing arguments on the basis of its finding that OneWest was the legal \u201cholder\u201d of Melina\u2019s Note and entitled to enforce it under the New York Uniform Commercial Code. This finding was based on the affidavits of OneWest\u2019s corporate representative and counsel, which established that OneWest was in physical possession of Melina\u2019s original Note at the time it commenced its lawsuit. Additionally, the District Court found that OneWest had proven it was entitled to enforce Meli-na\u2019s loan as the loan\u2019s assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">Melina timely appealed the District Court\u2019s memorandum and order and sought review of the District Court\u2019s holdings on subject matter jurisdiction and standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">DISCUSSION<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">Diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 is proper \u201conly if diversity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>of citizenship among the parties is complete, <em>i.e., </em>only if there is no plaintiff and no defendant who are citizens of the same State.\u201d Wis. <em>Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Schacht, </em>524 U.S. 381, 388, 118 S.Ct. 2047, 141 L.Ed.2d 364 (1998). Diversity is measured as of the time the action is brought, and thus a post-filing change of citizenship does not destroy diversity jurisdiction. <em>See Wolde-Meskel v. Vocational Instruction Project Cmty. Servs., Inc., </em>166 F.3d 59, 62 (2d Cir. 1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">A corporation\u2019s principal place of business under \u00a7 1332 is \u201cthe place where a corporation\u2019s officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation\u2019s activities.\u201d <em>Hertz Corp. v. Friend, </em>559 U.S. 77, 92-93, 130 S.Ct. 1181, 175 L.Ed.2d 1029 (2010). In practice, this \u201cshould normally be the place where the corporation maintains its headquarters \u2014 provided that the headquarters is the actual center of direction, control, and coordination, <em>i.e., </em>the \u2018nerve center.\u2019-\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93,130 S.Ct. 1181.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348 provides that national banks shall \u201cbe deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\u201d The Supreme Court has held unequivocally that a national bank is \u201clocated,\u201d for diversity jurisdiction purposes, in the state designated in its articles of association as the locus of its main office \u2014 not in every state in which it has branch offices. <em>See Wachovia Bank v. Schmidt, </em>546 U.S. 303, 307, 126 S.Ct. 941, 163 L.Ed.2d 797 (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In <em>Wachovia Bank, </em>the Supreme Court left open the question of whether a national bank is also a citizen of the state of its principal place of business. <em>See id. </em>at 315 n. 8, 126 S.Ct. 941. The Court did observe, however, that although 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 provides that a corporation \u201cshall be deemed to be a citizen of every State and foreign state by which it has been incorporated and of the State or foreign state where it has its principal place of business,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1), \u201c[t]he counterpart provision for national banking associations, \u00a7 1348, ... does not refer to \u2018principal place of business,\u2019 \u201d <em>Wachovia Bank, </em>546 U.S. at 317 n. 9, 126 S.Ct. 941. The Court then dismissed this difference as one \u201cof scant practical significance\u201d because \u201cin almost every case ... the location of a national bank\u2019s main office and of its principal place of business coincide.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">Several federal courts of appeals to have considered this issue in the wake of <em>Wa-chovia Bank </em>have held that a national bank is a citizen only of the state listed in its articles of association as its main office. <em>See, e.g., Rouse v. Wachovia Mortg., FSB, </em>747 F.3d 707, 708 (9th Cir. 2014) (\u201cLooking to the Supreme Court\u2019s treatment of the issue and to the history and sequence of the enactment and amendment of the statute, we conclude that, under \u00a7 1348, a national bank is \u2018located\u2019 only in the state designated as its main office.\u201d); <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. WMR e-PIN, LLC, </em>653 F.3d 702, 706-10 (8th Cir. 2011) (analyzing <em>Wachovia Bank </em>and \u00a7 1348\u2019s statutory history to \u201creject [the] claim that Wells Fargo is a citizen of both South Dakota and California\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Even the Fifth and Sev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>enth Circuits, which had held prior to <em>Wa-chovia Bank </em>that a national bank\u2019s principal place of business is an independent basis for its citizenship, have now agreed that a national bank\u2019s citizenship is to be determined with reference to its main office. <em>See, e.g., Tu Nguyen v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>516 Fed.Appx. 332, 334 n. 1 (5th Cir. 2013) (\u201cA national bank may be considered a citizen of \u2018the State designated in its articles of association as its main office.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Wachovia Bank, </em>546 U.S. at 318, 126 S.Ct. 941)); <em>Hicklin Eng\u2019g, L.C. v. Bartell, </em>439 F.3d 346, 348 (7th Cir. 2006) <em>(\u201cWachovia Bank </em>held that national banks are citizens only of the states in which their main offices are located, and that decision saves this case from a jurisdictional dismissal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">We agree with our sister circuits that a national bank is a citizen only of the state listed in its articles of association as its main office. Though <em>Wachovia Bank </em>did not conclusively resolve whether a national bank is a citizen of the state in which it has its principal place of business, the Supreme Court in that case did provide some indication that, for diversity purposes, a national bank\u2019s citizenship should be limited to the location of its main office. <em>See </em>546 U.S. at 307, 126 S.Ct. 941 (\u201cWere we to hold ... that a national bank is additionally a citizen of every State in which it has established a branch, the access of a [national] bank to a federal forum would be drastically curtailed....\u201d). This is consistent with both the statutory history of \u00a7 1348 and canons of construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">Congress first addressed jurisdiction for national banks in 1882, when it enacted the statutory predecessor to the current \u00a7 1348. This 1882 statute ensured jurisdictional parity between national banks and state-chartered banks by \u201cprovidfing], in clear and unmistakable terms, that the courts of the United States should not have jurisdiction ... unless they would have jurisdiction under like circumstances of suits by or against a state bank doing business in the same state with the national bank.\u201d <em>Leather Mfrs.\u2019 Nat'l Bank v. Cooper, </em>120 U.S. 778, 781, 7 S.Ct. 777, 30 L.Ed. 816 (1887) (emphasis omitted). The 1882 statute remained in effect until 1887, at which point the language tying national bank jurisdiction to state bank jurisdiction was removed. Rather than focusing on parity with state banks, the 1887 statute evoked jurisdictional parity between national banks and individual citizens. <em>See </em>Act of Mar. 3, 1887, ch. 373, \u00a7 4, 24 Stat. 552,'554-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">In 1911, Congress once again entertained the issue and provided, in relevant part, that \u201call national banking associations established under the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them ... be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\u201d Act of Mar. 3, 1911, ch. 231, \u00a7 16, 36 Stat. 1087, 1093. It was not until 1948 that Congress arrived at the current version of this statute, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ll national banking associations shall, for the purposes of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>other actions by or against them, be deemed citizens of the States in which they are respectively located.\u201d Act of June 25, 1948, ch. 646, \u00a7 1348, 62 Stat. 869, 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Though Congress did not tinker further with the citizenship of national banks after 1948, it did dramatically shift the understanding of diversity jurisdiction with respect to the citizenship of state-chartered corporations in 1958. That year, Congress enacted a provision stating that a state-chartered corporation \u2014 which includes state-chartered banks- \u2014 -is a citizen of both the state of incorporation and the state of its \u201cprincipal place of business.\u201d Act of July 25, 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-554, sec. 2, \u00a7 1332, 72 Stat. 415. That provision is now codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The meaning of a statute\u2019s terms is to be determined as of the time that it became law. <em>See MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>512 U.S. 218, 228, 114 S.Ct. 2223, 129 L.Ed.2d 182 (1994). At the time that Congress employed the word \u201clocated\u201d in \u00a7 1348, the statutory concept of \u201cprincipal place of business\u201d had not yet come into existence. Canons of statutory construction thus counsel against interpreting \u201clocated\u201d in \u00a7 1348 as providing a basis for subject matter jurisdiction based on a national bank\u2019s principal place of business. <em>See WMR e-PIN, </em>653 F.3d at 709 (\u201cWe will not import a jurisdictional concept into \u00a7 1348 that was unknown at the time of its adoption.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">As observed by our sister circuits, \u201c[njothing in the current version of the statute or in its history suggests that Congress intended to revive the principle of jurisdictional parity between state-chartered banks and national banks\u201d once it affirmatively deleted that parity from earlier versions of the statute. <em>Rouse, 747 </em>F.3d at 715. We agree that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-7\">when Congress introduced principal-place-of-business citizenship for state banks and corporations in \u00a7 1332(c)(1), it made no reference to jurisdictional parity, nor to national banks or \u00a7 1348. And nothing in \u00a7 1348 indicates that it would incorporate by reference any subsequent change in the statutes governing jurisdiction over state banks and corporations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-10\"><em>WMR e-PIN, </em>653 F.3d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">If Congress wishes to amend \u00a7 1348, then of course it is free to do so. That task, however, is not for us. <em>See Rouse, </em>747 F.3d at 715. We again share our sister circuits\u2019 view that \u201cshould Congress wish to link the jurisdiction for national and state banks, the statute can easily be amended,\u201d <em>id. </em>and that \u201c[wjhether [jurisdictional parity between national and state banks] ought to be revived is a policy question for Congress, not the federal courts,\u201d <em>WMR e~ PIN, </em>653 F.3d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Melina argued before the District Court that OneWest\u2019s principal place of business is in New York, and thus that there could be no diversity jurisdiction between the parties. He argued further that CIT Group\u2019s proposed acquisition of OneWest\u2019s parent company warranted use of CIT Group\u2019s principal place of business instead of OneWest\u2019s for purposes of diversity jurisdiction. The District Court rejected these arguments, concluding instead that (1) OneWest had successfully shown \u201cthat its main office and principal place of business is in California based on an affidavit submitted by Jon Dickerson, the First Vice President of its foreclosure department, and an application to the Federal Reserve System,\u201d App. 167, and (2) \u201cthe citizenship of any actual or proposed parent of OneWest does not control OneW-est\u2019s citizenship for purposes of diversity jurisdiction,\u201d App. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">On appeal, Melina argues that \u201ca national association is a citizen of the state of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>principal place of business\u201d as evidenced by \u201c[c]ongressional intent to maintain parity between national and state banks, Supreme Court dictum, this Court\u2019s reluctance to limit said citizenship to only the state designated as the main office, and federal government agency interpretation of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1348.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 9. As support for his argument, Melina relies primarily on two of this Court\u2019s previous <em>decisions </em>\u2014 World <em>Trade Ctr. Props., L.L.C. v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>345 F.3d 154, 161 (2d Cir. 2003) and <em>Lemer v. Fleet Bank, N.A., </em>318 F.3d 113, 124-25 (2d Cir. 2003) \u2014 as well as a 2002 interpretive letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">We do not find Melina\u2019s arguments persuasive. The cases that Melina cites, which he concedes do not \u201cdirectly settle[] the issue of whether a national association\u2019s] principal place of business is relevant for diversity purposes,\u201d- Appellant\u2019s Br. 12, undermine rather than support his points. <em>World Trade Center Properties </em>was directly abrogated by <em>Wachovia Bank. See Wachovia Bank, </em>546 U.S. at 309, 126 S.Ct. 941 (recognizing <em>World Trade Center Properties </em>as representing one side of a circuit split and holding in favor of the other side of that split). <em>Lemer, </em>too, was decided before <em>Wachovia Bank, </em>and it does not even so much as mention \u00a7 1348.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The interpretive letter from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency does not fare much better. Though Melina is correct that the letter allows for a national bank\u2019s citizenship to be determined by its principal place of business, the letter explicitly relies on and parrots the reasoning of <em>Firstar Bank, N.A. v. Faul, </em>253 F.3d 982 (7th Cir. 2001), a case that did not survive the Seventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation of <em>Wa-chovia Bank. See Hicklin Eng\u2019g, </em>439 F.3d at 348 (holding, in accord with <em>Wachovia Bank, </em>that \u201cnational banks are citizens only of the states in which their main offices are located\u201d); <em>see also WMR e-PIN, </em>653 F.3d at 708 (\u201cThe Seventh Circuit has gone further, reading <em>Wachovia Bank </em>to reject the proposition embraced in its <em>Firstar Bank </em>decision that a national bank\u2019s principal place of business is an independent basis for citizenship.\u201d). Moreover, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency repudiated its own letter at oral argument in <em>Wachovia Bank, </em>stating clearly that \u201cwe don\u2019t think that a national banking association is a citizen of a State in which its principal place of business is found, insofar as that might be different from the State in which its main office is located.\u201d <em>WMR e-PIN, </em>653 F.3d at 710 (quoting Oral Arg. Tr. at 18:22, <em>Wachovia Bank, </em>546 U.S. 303, 126 S.Ct. 941, 163 L.Ed.2d 797).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Furthermore, the District Court correctly held that OneWest\u2019s principal place of business is, like its main office, in California. Melina does not directly dispute this fact. Instead, he argues that OneWest\u2019s principal place of business was New York because OneWest\u2019s parent company, IMB HoldCo, was being purchased by CIT Group \u2014 a company headquartered in New York \u2014 at the time that OneWest filed its complaint. Melina claims that when OneW-est filed its original complaint on September 10, 2014, the Agreement and Plan of Merger between CIT Group and IMB HoldCo, dated July 21, 2014, had already \u201ctransferred responsibility for major corporate decisions to New York State, which in turn means New York is the place where One[W]est\u2019s officers direct, control, and coordinate corporate activities.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">OneWest responds that \u201cCIT Group\u2019s future acquisition of OneWest\u2019s parent company could not affect OneW-est\u2019s principal place of business because ... \u2018[w]hen formal separation is main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>tained between a corporate parent and its corporate subsidiary, federal court jurisdiction over the subsidiary is determined by that corporation\u2019s citizenship, not the citizenship of the parent.\u2019 \u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. 13 (quoting <em>Schwartz v. Elec. Data Sys., Inc., </em>913 F.2d 279, 283 (6th Cir. 1990)). OneWest is correct. It is well established in other circuits<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> that \u201ca subsidiary corporation has its own principal place of business for purposes of diversity of citizenship jurisdiction, unless it is merely an \u2018alter ego\u2019 or agent of the parent corporation,\u201d Charles Alan Wright, et al., 13F <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3625 (3d ed.), and we agree. Melina does not argue that OneWest was an alter ego or agent of its parent company, and thus his argument that OneWest assumed its parent company\u2019s principal place of business holds no water.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Melina also contends that the express terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger \u201ceffectively transferred One[W]est[\u2019]s principal place of business to New York, New York.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 18. In making this argument, Melina relies heavily on \u00a7 5.2\u2019s restriction on OneWest\u2019s freedom to open, close, or relocate any branch office. He argues that this restriction means that OneWest, IMB HoldCo as its parent, and CIT Group as its proposed parent all \u201chave the same principal place of business <em>[\u25a0i.e., </em>New York].\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">This argument, too, must fail; a corporate subsidiary does not assume the principal place of business of its future corporate parent solely as a result of its subsidiary status. The merger agreement between IMB HoldCo and CIT Group says nothing about OneWest\u2019s principal place of business. Though \u00a7 5.2 requires OneWest to obtain approval before undertaking certain transactions, this provision does not morph OneWest into an alter ego or agent of its parent, IMB HoldCo \u2014 and thus it does not mean that OneWest assumes IMB HoldCo\u2019s principal place of business.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Finally, Melina argues that the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment \u201cshould be reversed because there is a genuine issue of material fact as to plaintiff[\u2019]s standing to commence a foreclosure action.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 19. The \u201cgenuine issue of material fact,\u201d in Melina\u2019s view, is whether OneWest was the holder or as-signee of the mortgage or underlying Note at the time the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Under New York law, \u201c[a] plaintiff establishes its standing in a mortgage foreclosure action by demonstrating that, when the action was commenced, it was either the holder or assignee of-the underlying note.\u201d <em>Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Rooney, </em>132 A.D.3d 980, 981, 19 N.Y.S.3d 543 (2015). \u201cEither a written assignment of the underlying note or the physical delivery of the note prior to the commencement of the foreclosure action is sufficient to transfer the obligation, and the mortgage passes with the debt as an inseparable incident.\u201d <em>U.S. Bank, N.A. v. Collymore, </em>68 A.D.3d 752, 754, 890 N.Y.S.2d 578 (2009); <em>accord Aurora Loan Servs., LLC v. Taylor, </em>25 N.Y.3d 355, 361, 12 N.Y.S.3d 612, 34 N.E.3d 363 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Melina does not contest OneW-est\u2019s possession of the Note at the time it filed its complaint. Instead, Melina argues that OneWest\u2019s failure \u201cto provide the exact date the Note was transferred, or any details at all regarding the delivery of the Note prior to commencement of a foreclosure action\u201d is fatal to its claim for summary judgment. Appellant\u2019s Br. 24. This argument, however, has already been re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>jected by the New York State Court of Appeals. In <em>Aurora Loan Services, LLC v. Taylor, </em>25 N.Y.3d 355, 12 N.Y.S.3d 612, 34 N.E.3d 363 (2015), the New York State Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[although the better practice would have been for [the plaintiff] to state how it came into possession of the note in its affidavit in order to clarify the situation completely,\u201d the plaintiff was not precluded from obtaining summary judgment by not having provided these details. <em>Aurora Loan Servs., </em>25 N.Y.3d at 362, 12 N.Y.S.3d 612, 34 N.E.3d 363. Following <em>Aurora, </em>New York courts have repeatedly held that proof of physical possession \u2014 such as the affidavits of OneWest\u2019s corporate representative and counsel in this case \u2014 is sufficient on its own to prove a plaintiffs standing to foreclose on the mortgage associated with the note. <em>See, e.g., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v. Charlaff, </em>134 A.D.3d 1099, 1100, 24 N.Y.S.3d 317 (2015); <em>Rooney, </em>132 A.D.3d at 982, 19 N.Y.S.3d 543; <em>HSBC Bank USA N.A v. Spitzer, </em>131 A.D.3d 1206, 1207, 18 N.Y.S.3d 67 (2015); <em>Deutsche Bank Natl Tr. Co. v. Abdan, </em>131 A.D.3d 1001, 1002, 16 N.Y.S.3d 459 (2015). OneWest thus had no obligation to provide details pertaining to the transfer or delivery of Melina\u2019s Note in order to prove its standing to foreclose on the associated mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Moreover, OneWest was the assignee of Melina\u2019s loan. In New York, standing to foreclose may be established by \u201ca written assignment of the underlying note.\u201d <em>Onewest, F.S.B. v. Goddard, </em>131 A.D.3d 1028, 1029, 17 N.Y.S.3d 142 (2015). \u201cNo special form or language is necessary to effect an assignment as long as the language shows the intention of the owner of a right to transfer it.\u201d <em>Suraleb, Inc. v. Int\u2019l Trade Club, Inc., </em>13 A.D.3d 612, 612, 788 N.Y.S.2d 403 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the LSA provided that FDIC, as receiver and conservator for IndyMac Federal, would \u201csell[ ], transfer ], convey[ ], assign[ ] and deliver[ ]\u201d to OneWest, and OneWest would \u201cpur-ehase[.], accept[ ] and assume[ ] from [FDIC] ... all of [FDIC\u2019s] rights, title and interests in, to and under\u201d certain defined assets. App. 73 (\u00a7 2.01(a)). The LSA thus assigned to OneWest all of the rights that FDIC previously had to Melina\u2019s loan as the conservator and receiver of IndyMac Federal \u2014 and this assignment sufficed to give OneWest standing to foreclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-8\">.
