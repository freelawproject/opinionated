CABRANES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Defendant-appellant Rafael Antonio Ga-ravito-Garcia appeals from the July 22, 2015 judgment of conviction entered against him by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Jed S. Rakoff, Judge) on counts of narcoterrorism conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960a (Count One); cocaine-importation conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 963 (Count Two); conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, namely the <em>Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia </em>(the \u201cFARC\u201d), in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2339B(a)(l) and (d)(1) (Count Three); and conspiracy to acquire and transfer anti-aircraft missiles, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2332g (Count Four).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-12\">Garavito-Garcia raises four issues on appeal: (1) that the District Court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the indictment for lack of jurisdiction resulting from Colombia\u2019s violation of its extradition treaty with the United States; (2) that the evidence at trial was insufficient to prove he knowingly participated in any of the conspiracies with which he was charged; (3) that a supplemental instruction the District Court gave in response to a jury note was improper; and (4) that Count Three of the indictment was \u201cmultiplicitous\u201d of Count One. Finding each of these arguments unpersuasive, we AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b270-14\">On January 8, 2013, the Government filed a four-count superseding indictment against Garavito-Garcia, which contained the charges described above.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charges stemmed from Garavito-Garcia\u2019s participation in a conspiracy \u201cto ship ton-quantities of FARC-owned cocaine across the Atlantic Ocean to Guinea[-]Bissau, and then to store the cocaine in Guinea[-]Bissau before its shipment to other locations, including the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Throughout the course of the conspiracy, Garavito-Garcia \u201cinteracted with two individuals who purported at all times to be representatives and/or associates of the FARC,\u201d but who were actually \u201cconfidential sources working for the Drug Enforcement Administration\u201d (the \u201cDEA\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-15\">The Government further alleged that Garavito-Garcia \u201cleveraged his connections to senior officials in Guinea[-]Bissau <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>... to facilitate ... the purchase of military-grade weapons by the FARC\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2014 specifically, \u201can explosive and incendiary rocket and missile that is guided by a system designed to enable the rocket and missile to seek and proceed toward energy radiated and reflected from an aircraft arid toward an image locating an aircraft,\u201d as well as other equipment necessary for their use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The senior Bissau-Guinean officials in question included General Antonio Indjai, the commander of Guinea-Bissau\u2019s armed forces, and General Indjai\u2019s \u201cright-hand man,\u201d Captain Julio M\u2019Bali.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Garavito-Garcia was arrested in Colombia on April 5, 2013.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Soon thereafter, the Government formally requested his extradition to the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Colombian authorities ordered Garavito-Garcia\u2019s extradition on October 28, 2013, but he appealed, \u201carguing, among other things, that he should not be extradited because he was in poor health.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Colombian authorities confirmed the extradition order on December 26, 2013, but also \u201cinstructed the Colombian Attorney General to obtain a medical report on the feasibility of transferring Garavito-Garcia before the Colombian authorities surrendered him.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Ga-ravito-Garcia suffered a stroke five days later.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">On February 14, 2014, before any medical report had issued, the Colombian authorities authorized the United States to remove Garavito-Garcia.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Less than two weeks later, before Garavito-Garcia had been removed, a Colombian government agency, the National Institute of Legal Medicine and Forensic Science in Colombia (the \u201cNational Institute\u201d), provided its opinion that he would have to be transported in a medicai aircraft to ensure his safety.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Upon receipt of the National Institute\u2019s report, the Colombian authorities \u201csuspended\u201d the \u201cavailability\u201d of Garavito-Garcia until proper arrangements could be made.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b271-16\">\u201cNotwithstanding the fact that th[is] delay was designed to accommodate his health issues, Garavito-Garcia then challenged his continued detention in Colombia on the ground that he should have been extradited sooner.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Garavito-Garcia\u2019s challenge was based on Article 511 of Colombia\u2019s Criminal Code, which provides that \u201c[t]he requested person will be released unconditionally by the Attorney General, ... if after a term of thirty (30) days from the day the person was made available to the requesting State, the latter did not move forward with his transfer.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Colombian Attorney General responded to Garavito-Garcia\u2019s challenge by explaining that Article 511\u2019s time limit had been suspended in accordance with the National Institute\u2019s report and the Colombian authorities\u2019 confirmation of the extra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>dition order.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> But Garavito-Garcia continued to press his argument, claiming in an April 2, 2014 letter to the Colombian Attorney General that Article 511 contains \u201cneither explicit ] nor implicit[ ]\u201d exceptions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> \u201cThe Colombian Attorney General was unpersuaded,\u201d however, \u201cand Garavi-to-Garcia remained in detention.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">On June 13, 2014, the National Institute issued a new report, in which it informed the Colombian authorities that \u201cthe risk of complications would be reasonably low if Garavito-Garcia travelled on a medical airplane with trained personnel,\u201d which caused the Colombian authorities to once again make Garavito-Garcia available for extradition to the United States.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> On July 22, 2014, Garavito-Garcia was transported in this manner to the Southern District of New York, where he stood trial.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> On March 26, 2015, a jury convicted him on all four counts,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and on July 22, 2015, judgment was entered.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">I. Extradition Treaty</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">We begin with Garavito-Garcia\u2019s first argument. \u2018We .:. review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions, including those ... involving the interpretation of a treaty.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">\u201c[T]he United States and Colombia have had a formal extradition treaty since 1982....\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Article 12(4) of that treaty reads as follows: \u201cIf a warrant or order for the extradition of a person sought has been issued by the competent authority and the person is not removed from the territory of the Requested State within such time as may be prescribed by its laws ..., that person shall be set at liberty....\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Colombian law that \u201cpre-seribe[s]\u201d \u201csuch time\u201d is Article 511 of the Criminal Code. As noted, Article 511 provides that \u201c[t]he requested person will be released unconditionally by the Attorney General, ... if after a term of thirty (30) days from the day the person was made available to the requesting State, the latter did not move forward with his transfer.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Garavito-Garcia argues that, because he was not extradited within 30 days of being made available to the United States, Colombia violated Article 511; and because Article 12(4) incorporates Article 511 by reference, Colombia violated the treaty as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">This argument fails for at least two independent reasons. First, as we have explained, \u201cabsent protest or objection by the offended sovereign, a defendant has no standing to raise the violation of international law as an issue.... These concerns apply equally [when] a criminal defendant objects .-.. based on the interpretation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>an extradition treaty....\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Here, because \u201cthe Government of Colombia [has not] first [made] an official protest,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Garavi-to-Garcia lacks standing to invoke the extradition treaty as a basis for the dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Garavito-Gareia argues that this principle does not apply to him, because it is only <em>\u201cin the absence of express language to the contrary\u201d </em>that treaties \u201cdo not create privately enforceable rights,\u201d and \u201c[h]ere, there is express and self-executing language <em>in the Extradition Treaty </em>itself mandating that the subject of extradition be released within thirty days upon being made available.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> But in so arguing, Ga-ravito-Garcia conflates two distinct concepts: treaty language \u201cdirectly benefiting private persons,\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> which international agreements regularly feature; and treaty language indicating \u201cthat the intent of the treaty drafters\u201d was that such benefits \u201ccould be vindicated\u201d through private enforcement,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> which is far less common. The extradition treaty at issue in this case may contain language meeting the former description, but Garavito-Gareia has not identified, nor can we locate, language meeting the latter. Standing is therefore lacking.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">Second, international comity precludes us from considering Garavito-Gar-cia\u2019s argument, because Colombia has already rejected his contention that Article 511 prevented his extradition.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It is well established that, \u201calthough courts of the United States have authority to determine ... whether an accused should be extradited from the United States, ... our courts cannot second-guess another country\u2019s grant of extradition to the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Here, in order to find that Colombia violated the extradition treaty, we would \u25a0 necessarily \u25a0 have to disagree with the Colombian Attorney General\u2019s determination that no violation of Article 511 occurred. This we may not do. The \u201cdeference\u201d we must accord the Colombian Attorney General\u2019s determination is \u201cessential to the maintenance of cordial international relations. It could hardly promote harmony to request a grant of extradition and then, after extradition is granted, have the requesting nation take the stance that the extraditing nation was wrong to grant the request.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> For these reasons, we must reject Garavito-Garcia\u2019s first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">II. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">We turn next to Garavito-Garcia\u2019s argument that the evidence at trial was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>cient to prove that he knowingly participated in any of the conspiracies with which he was charged. Specifically, Garavito-Garcia argues that \u201c[t]he record at trial is all but bereft of any indication that [he] assented to, or even expressed interest in, the aspects of the scheme involving weapons or importing narcotics to the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u201cWe review claims of insufficient evidence <em>de novo,\u201d </em>but \u201c[a] defendant bears a heavy burden in seeking to overturn a conviction on [these] grounds,\u201d as we \u201cwill affirm if any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> As concerns Garavito-Gareia\u2019s particular insufficiency claim, \u201c[t]he government may prove the defendant\u2019s knowing participation in a conspiracy through circumstantial evidence,\u201d which \u201cmay include, for example, a defendant\u2019s association with conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy\u201d or \u201chis presence at critical stages of the conspiracy that cannot be explained by happenstance.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Here, the Government introduced sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have inferred Garavito-Gareia\u2019s knowing participation in those aspects of the scheme that involved weapons and importing narcotics into the United States. For example, with respect to weapons, the Government introduced evidence that, during a November 13, 2012 conversation with Captain M\u2019Bali, Garavito-Gar-cia explained why the FARC wanted to obtain anti-aircraft missiles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">[T]he problem, Captain ... see? [T]he problem is the Americans. The gringos come to our country.... to fumigate. ... They start to fumigate the land so they can\u2019t cultivate.... They are damaging the soil.... Damaging the soil, for many after.... Then they turn, ... turn it into, like, Mauritania, into a desert. There was nothing. The Americans don\u2019t care. So these people [ (the FARC) ] want to show that they have power to send them [ (the Americans) ] to hell because right now they are talking about making peace with the government. See?<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-12\">This explanation from Garavito-Garcia took place in the context of an extended discussion about anti-aircraft missiles between Garavito-Garcia, M\u2019Bali, a DEA confidential source, a Colombian narcotics trafficker, and two Bissau-Guinean narcotics traffickers.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> The discussion is but one example among many instances in which Garavito-Garcia made statements that a rational trier of fact could interpret as evincing his knowing participation in the weapons scheme. To choose just one additional example, Garavito-Garcia had earlier assured General Indjai on July 2, 2012 that, insofar as the potential weapons deal was concerned, the FARC would \u201c[p]ay for everything.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b274-13\">There was also sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have inferred Garavito-Gareia\u2019s knowing participation in the aspect of the scheme that involved importing narcotics into the United States. As the Government correctly points out, a rational trier of fact could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>have determined \u201cthat Garavito-Garcia believed what the [DEA] sources told him, namely, that on the FARC\u2019s behalf, they planned to move tons of cocaine into the United States_ Knowing this, [Garavi-to-Garcia] went back and forth across the Atlantic Ocean with the confidential sources, to broker a deal with his contacts in Guinea[-]Bissau.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Garavito-Garcia\u2019s second argument thus fails to convince.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">III. Supplemental Jury Instruction</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Garavito-Garcia\u2019s third argument is equally unavailing. He argues that \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s initial \u2018mere presence\u2019 jury instruction evidently resulted in confusion amongst the jurors, as reflected in the jury note sent to the district court soon after deliberations had commenced,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s supplemental [\u2018]mere presence^] instruction ... failed to address the source of the jury\u2019s confusion, that is, whether proof of mere acquiescence was enough.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Garavito-Garcia\u2019s argument relates to a note that the jury sent to the District Court during deliberations, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">I would like more clarification on conspiracy charges in general. I am unclear whether someone\u2019s presence during a conversation without specific participation is enough to convict someone of those charges. Is the only way that someone could escape such a situation to physically leave the room, or to specifically state their lack of consent to the.... topic under discussion? I feel unable to differentiate different situations in which someone is implicated in a conspiracy or not.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">Contrary to Garavito-Garcia\u2019s assertion, the District Court addressed the source of the jury\u2019s confusion head-on, through a supplemental instruction that was both directly responsive and objectively correct. After reiterating several general conspiracy principles, the District Court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">Because the burden of proof is always on the Government, a defendant who is present where a conspiratorial agreement is being planned by others does not have any burden to show that he affirmatively denied consent to the agreement or physically left the room when it was being discussed; the burden is always on the Government and mere presence without participation in the unlawful plan is not sufficient to meet that burden.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-14\">The District Court thus clearly did not fail to \u201caddress the question as to whether or not a person has to physically leave the room in order to escape being considered a conspirator, or whether or not a person has to explicitly state [his or her] lack of consent to the discussion.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-15\">IV. \u201cMultiplicitous\u201d Counts</p>\n<p id=\"b275-16\">Lastly, we consider Garavito-Garcia\u2019s argument that Count Three of the indictment (conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2339B(a)(l) and (d)(1)) was \u201cmultiplicitous\u201d of Count One (narcoterrorism conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960a), which resulted in dupli-cative punishment prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> This guarantee \u201cprohibits multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Whether two offenses are in fact the same for Double Jeopardy purposes is determined by reference to the so-called \u201csame-elements\u201d test that the Supreme Court established in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This test \u201casks whether each offense contains an element not contained in the other,' and provides that, if not, they are the same offen[s]e and double jeopardy bars additional, punishment.\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Critically, \u201c[i]n applying the <em>Blockburger </em>test, we are required to focus on the statutory elements of each offense. If each <em>statute </em>requires proof of a fact that the other does not, the <em>Blockburger </em>test is satisfied, even if the same proof is used at trial to establish both crimes.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Here, it is clear that \u00a7 960a and \u00a7 2339B each require proof of a fact that the other does not. Section 960a requires the Government to prove that the defendant engaged in certain conduct \u201cknowing or intending to provide, directly or indirectly, anything of pecuniary value to any person or organization <em>that has engaged or engages in terrorist activity </em>(as defined in section 1182(a)(3)(B) of Title 8) <em>or terrorism </em>(as defined in section 2656f(d)(2) of Title 22).\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> This means that, in every prosecution under \u00a7 960a, the Government is required to prove that the person or organization to which the defendant provided a pecuniary benefit has engaged in terrorist activity or terrorism.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">But this requirement does not apply to \u00a7 2339B, which criminalizes \u201cknowingly provid[ing] material support or resources to <em>a foreign terrorist organization, </em>or attempting] or conspiring] to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> For purposes of \u00a7 2339B, \u201cthe term \u2018terrorist organization\u2019 means an organization designated as a terrorist organization under section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Accordingly, in every prosecution under \u00a7 2339B, the Government is required to prove that the foreign terrorist organization to which the defendant provided material support has been designated as such by the Secretary of State.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> It is not, however, required to prove that the organization has engaged in terrorist activity or terrorism. Indeed, once the Secre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>tary\u2019s designation becomes effective, \u201ca defendant in a criminal action ... shall not be permitted to raise any question concerning the validity of the issuance of such designation as a defense or an objection at any trial or hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">Additionally, just as \u00a7 960a\u2019s terrorist-aetivity-or-terrorism requirement is not required by \u00a7 2339B, so too is \u00a7 2339B\u2019s designation requirement not required by \u00a7 960a. In other words, in no prosecution under \u00a7 960a is the Government required to prove that the person or organization to which the defendant provided a pecuniary benefit has been designated as a terrorist organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Therefore, because \u00a7 960a and \u00a7 2339B each require proof of a fact that the other does not, duplicative punishment prohibited by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment was not imposed on Ga-ravito-Garcia.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">We have considered all of Garavito-Gar-cia\u2019s arguments on appeal and found them to be without merit. The July 22, 2015 judgment of the District Court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b270-10\">. A-21-32.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b270-17\">.
