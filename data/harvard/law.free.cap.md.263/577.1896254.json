In August 1970 the \u201cair conditioning unit\u201d stopped running and, as a result, the house became \u201cvery hot.\u201d It seems the unit had given yeoman service during the seven year period despite the fact it had never been serviced. Indeed Stander conceded he \u201c[n]ever did a thing to it.\u201d Early on 3 August he telephoned B &amp; B, stated his problem and asked for a mechanic to come and set it right.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-11\">Gaines Lloyd, B &amp; B\u2019s mechanic, turned up around midafternoon. He said his inspection of the unit led him to suspect that the \u201crunning capacitor\u201d might be defective so he disconnected it, tested it, and found that it was indeed so. Since Stander was not at home and could not be reached Lloyd left with Stander\u2019s son David an invoice stating he had checked the unit, that he had dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>covered the cause of the trouble, and that the capacitor would have to be replaced. The indicated charge for the call (and one-half hour of labor) was $18. The invoice also disclosed an estimate of $35 for the capacitor plus the cost of the labor. It was signed by David.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Lloyd returned several hours later, having been given \u201cthe okay to do the work.\u201d He said he removed the defective capacitor and replaced it with one that was serviceable. Another invoice was made out showing a charge of $35 for the capacitor and $38 for labor (including the $18 shown on the earlier invoice). Above Stander\u2019s signature there is printed on the invoice, \u201cI hereby accept above performed service, and charges, as being satisfactory and acknowledge that equipment has been left in good condition.\u201d On the reverse side is a guaranty that \u201cthe parts installed by * * * [B &amp; B] will perform satisfactorily under conditions of normal usage for a period of ninety days.\u201d Lloyd said that when he left Stander\u2019s house the unit \u201cwas running and cooling.\u201d Stander gave Lloyd his check for $73 ($35 -f- $38).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">On the next day (Tuesday) when Stander returned home from work the unit was not running. Before leaving for work on Wednesday morning he telephoned B &amp; B \u201cand told them to send somebody * * * to take care of it.\u201d Lloyd arrived late that afternoon and after inspecting the unit he left with David still another invoice stating that the \u201ccondenser fan motor * * * [was] froze up.\u201d A labor charge of $18 was indicated and there also appeared the notation that the motor was \u201cnot under [the B &amp; B] guaranty.\u201d Stander says he told Lloyd not to replace the motor. He bought one from another company and installed it himself. For the remainder of the season the unit \u201cwas functioning satisfactorily.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Stander testified that in the course of replacing the fan motor he noticed \u201ca little smuck of yellow paint that was on the outside of the\u201d capacitor. This led him to suspect that Lloyd had not replaced it but had merely put back the old one. He complained to B &amp; B and when Thomas, its vice president and general manager, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>puted his contention Stander stopped payment on his $73 check.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Thomas said Lloyd had brought back to the shop the capacitor he removed from Stander\u2019s unit and that he handed it to the man in charge of the stock room. Thomas was \u201cwith the service manager\u201d when it was checked and \u201cit was bad.\u201d Ordinarily, he said, they throw out defective capacitors. He saved this one because, after Stander\u2019s call, he thought there might be trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Stander did not dawdle. He filed suit against B &amp; B on 10 September. There are two counts in his declaration. In \u201cCount One\u201d he alleged that \u201cupon learning that * * * [Lloyd] had not changed the capacitor * * * [he] ordered his bank to stop the check he had issued in payment, at a cost * * * [to him] of $2.00.\u201d He alleged also that Lloyd \u201cfraudulently and deceitfully claimed to have replaced but in fact did not replace\u201d the capacitor. \u201cCount One\u201d concludes with a demand for \u201cjudgment in the sum of $2.00\u201d and the return of the $73 check upon payment by Stander \u201cof a reasonable charge for labor actually performed by\u201d B &amp; B. In \u201cCount Two,\u201d after incorporating by reference all of the allegations in \u201cCount One,\u201d he further alleged that he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">\u201crelied on the honesty of * * * [Lloyd] to perform the work for which * * * [he] hired * * * [B &amp; B] and that * * * [Lloyd] deceitfully violated the trust and confidence that * * * [he] had in * * * [B &amp; B] by fraudulently removing the capacitor which was in * * * [the] air conditioning unit, pretending to replace the capacitor with a new one and in fact putting the same capacitor that he had removed back into the unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">\u201cIn spite of the fact that there was nothing wrong with the capacitor that was in the air conditioning unit, * * * [Lloyd] not only claimed to have changed the capacitor and charged * * * [him] $35.00 for a new capacitor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>which * * * [Stander] say[s] was not needed, but did not supply a new capacitor, all constituting an unlawful practice in violation of Article 83, Section 21 of the Maryland Code.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">\u201cCount Two\u201d concludes with a demand for $15,000 punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">B &amp; B responded with the general issue plea and a counterclaim for $91 to which Stander pleaded the general issue and a special plea in which he admitted being indebted to B &amp; B \u201cfor such reasonable charge for labor actually performed\u201d by B &amp; B.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">The case came on for trial before Miller, J., and a jury on 17 February 1971. We have read and re-read the testimony of Stander and his son David but we did not see anything which could be said to support a finding that Stander has sustained any loss or damage. He has not paid out any money. During the argument before us counsel for Stander agreed no damage had been shown and that there was not even any proof in respect of the two dollar bank charge claimed in the declaration. Even if we assume, as Stander contends, that Lloyd put back the same capacitor he took out, Stander still has it and it continues to work satisfactorily. Nor can he say anything B &amp; B did or did not do in any way deprived him of the use of his unit. Lloyd was able to start it up again and there is no doubt it performed satisfactorily until <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the motor \u201cfroze up.\u201d Lloyd told him that it needed a new fan motor and so it did. Stander himself installed the new motor and he agreed that for the remainder of the season the unit worked well. Standees admission that he owes B &amp; B the \u201creasonable charge for labor actually performed\u201d suggests he was entirely satisfied with Lloyd\u2019s services and that his complaint stems solely from his belief that the capacitor was not replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Upon what theory or upon what evidence the jury arrived at its award of \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d in the amount of $55 we are unable to say. Thomas testified B &amp; B\u2019s charges were \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d He said they were \u201ccompetitive with most anyone in the trade\u201d and that B &amp; B \u201calways check [ed] around to find out what everybody is charging\u201d and that it tried to stay \u201ccompatible.\u201d Stander made no effort to contradict or controvert this testimony and, as we have pointed out, he admits his obligation to pay a reasonable charge for labor actually performed. It would seem to follow therefore that he is indebted to B &amp; B in the amount, at least, of $56 ($91 less the $35 charge for the capacitor). Even if we were to assume that the jury, by prestidigitation perhaps, was able to transmute a virtually admitted debt of $56 into a pecuniary loss of $55 we could not overlook the fact that by their verdict in favor of Stander on B &amp; B\u2019s counterclaim they have found that Stander owes B &amp; B nothing. In short, since the jury nullified its \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d verdict the ensuing judgment must be expunged. It is settled that, in cases like the case at bar, punitive damages are not recoverable in the absence of proof of actual loss. <em>Kneas v. Hecht Company, </em>257 Md. 121, 125 (1970); <em>Delisi v. Garnett, </em>257 Md. 4, 9 (1970), and the cases there cited. This, of course, leaves the punitive damages judgment without the requisite foundation so it too must fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">There remains for our consideration only the matter of the counterclaim. Since we think it is clear that B &amp; B restricted its appeal to the judgments for compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>tory and punitive damages, we shall not disturb Standees judgment against B &amp; B for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">\n<em>Judgments for damages reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>Judgment for costs in the counterclaim affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">\n<em>Remainder of the costs below and the costs in this Court to be paid by appellees.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-8\">. \u201cThe act, use or employment by any person of any deception, fraud, false pretense, false promise, misrepresentation, or the concealment, suppression, or omission of <em>any </em>material fact with intent that others rely upon such concealment, suppression or omission, in connection with the sale or advertisement of any merchandise, or service whether or not any person has in fact been misled, deceived or damaged thereby, is declared to be an unlawful practice; provided, however, that nothing herein contained shall apply to the owner or publisher of newspapers, magazines, publications or printed matter wherein such advertisement appears, or to the owner or operator of a radio or television station which disseminates such advertisement when the owner, publisher or operator has no knowledge of the intent, design or purpose of the advertiser; and provided, further, that nothing herein contained shall apply to any advertisement which is subject to and complies with the rules and regulations of, and the statutes administered by the Federal Trade Commission.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
