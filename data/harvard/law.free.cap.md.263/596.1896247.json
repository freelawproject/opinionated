We shall here reverse judgment entered in favor of defendant Marine Midland when its motion for summary judgment was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">It all began back in May of 1969 when appellant, James D. Barrier (Barrier), bought a new Pontiac au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>tomobile which he financed through Marine Midland. He moved to Maryland, taking up his residence in Montgomery County. Marine Midland believed him to be in default. Through State National Bank of Bethesda (State National) Barrier\u2019s car was repossessed, the repossession being described by Barrier as having taken place \u201cin the early dawn or predawn hours of May 24, 1970.\u201d Barrier filed suit against Marine Midland, State National, and two individuals. The declaration contained counts for trespass <em>d.b.a., </em>libel, and slander, claiming $5,000 for compensatory damages and $150,000 for punitive damages on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">A settlement agreement was reached by which the sum of $1,000 was to be paid to Barrier plus reimbursement to him of $100 of costs for a public apology by the banks to be published in a Washington area newspaper for a period of one week.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Unfortunately, that did not dispose of the matter because, through what Barrier\u2019s counsel describes as \u201cinadvertency\u201d, Barrier\u2019s check for his October payment on the car was not honored by the bank on which it was drawn. Barrier did not get his settlement and Marine Midland declared the contract relative to the car in default, demanded the balance due, and demanded Barrier\u2019s automobile which he does not wish to surrender.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">At this point, the situation can best be understood by referring to certain dates and what transpired on those dates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-6\">October 7\u2014Barrier\u2019s October payment to Marine Midland was due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-8\">October 15\u2014Barrier\u2019s attorney responded to settlement proposals by advis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ing that his client was prepared to settle on either of two bases, namely $1,000 plus public apology, with him designating the newspaper to print the apology, or $5,000 without a public apology.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-5\">October 19\u2014Barrier\u2019s check dated October 5 for his October payment was dishonored the first time by his bank.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-7\">October 19\u2014Counsel for Marine Midland accepted on behalf of his client the $1,000 plus public apology proposal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">October 22\u2014Barrier\u2019s counsel forwarded release executed by his client and \u201cline of satisfaction\u201d (\u201cPotomacese\u201d for an order dismissing the case as \u201cpaid, settled, and satisfied\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>October 29\u2014Counsel for Marine Midland advised counsel for Barrier that he had written to Marine Midland for money and expected to be in a position to disburse about the middle of the following month.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-4\">November 2\u2014October payment again dishonored by the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">November 7\u2014Another payment due.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">November 8\u2014Date of check originally intended for November payment, but which would have been for October payment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">Week of November 8\u2014Public apology printed in <em>The Washington Post.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">November 16\u2014November 8 check cleared the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">November 25\u2014Marine Midland\u2019s attorney advised Barrier\u2019s attorney that Barrier \u201cwas in default for his October and November payments and told him that unless there was a satisfactory explanation Marine Midland was going to call the loan.\u201d Barrier\u2019s attorney said that this came as a surprise to him, that he would speak to Barrier and get back to Marine Midland\u2019s attorney. He called back the same day, stated that there was an explanation, and asked that nothing be done for a week inasmuch \u00e1s he was departing for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>a vacation. Marine Midland\u2019s attorney \u201cagreed to hold off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">November 80\u2014On or about this date Barrier received a notice from Marine Midland that his payment of November 7 was past due and the total amount due including \u201cany accrued late charges\u201d was $151.90.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">November 30\u2014Barrier drew check to Marine Midland in the amount of $151.90 as per the notice. This check was received by Marine Midland but has never been deposited.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">December 21\u2014Counsel for Marine Midland wrote the attorney for Barrier as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">\u201cI\u2019ve researched and poked and looked.

A judgment by default was entered in favor of State National against Marine Midland \u201csubject to ex parte proof.\u201d In granting the motion of Marine Midland for summary judgment the circuit court also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-10\">\u201cORDERED that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">(1) The Line attached to the Plea on Equitable Grounds marking the case Paid, Settled and Satisfied be filed in this case, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">(2) The Release executed by the Plaintiff be retained by Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-13\">(3) Judgment be awarded to defendant Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>New York in the amount of $2,152.22, together with $45.00 of repossession costs and $322.82 attorney\u2019s fees, plus interest and costs, and it is further</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">\u2018ORDERED that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">(4) The Plaintiff deliver the automobile, being one 1969 GTO Pontiac 8 cylinder, Model GTO Judge, convertible, Serial No. 242679B162901 to Defendant Marine Midland Trust Company for sale by it with reasonable notification to the Plaintiff of time and place of any public or private sale, and that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">(5) The Defendant Marine Midland Trust Company report the proceeds of said sale and, if there be any differences, from the judgment awarded Defendant Marine Midland Trust Company satisfy said deficiency from the $1,100.00 held by Defendant Marine Midland Trust Company for the account of Plaintiff, and that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">(6) Defendant Marine Midland Trust Company disburse any balance held by it after the conclusion of the proceedings set forth in paragraph 4 and 5 above, and if there be any deficiency owed by the Plaintiff to the Defendant, the Plaintiff is hereby ordered and directed to pay the same forthwith, and that,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">(7) The Plaintiff and his attorney, shall cease and desist from further public comment concerning this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">MOTION TO DISMISS</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Marine Midland urges that the appeal should be dismissed on two grounds. First, it suggests that the judgment in the trial court is not on appeal as to the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>three counts of the declaration (the original suit). Assuming that he could appeal, which we do not decide, the appeal does not purport to be from that portion of the judgment. Therefore, there is no appeal to dismiss and the determination by the trial judge that the first three counts have in fact been settled disposes of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">Secondly, Marine Midlands says that the appeal is premature as to the final two counts in the declaration, pointing out that the judgment ran to only one of the two defendants, Marine Midland, when both Marine Midland and State National were sued. Only Marine Midland had moved for summary judgment. It states that in <em>Madden v. Clouser, </em>262 Md. 144, 277 A. 2d 60 (1971), we \u201creaffirmed the point that summary judgment is not final when all of the claims have not been adjudicated below, citing and quoting from Rule 605 a.\u201d In <em>Madden </em>we cited <em>Cotham and Maldonado v. Board, </em>260 Md. 556, 273 A. 2d 115 (1971), and <em>St. Michelle v. Catania, </em>252 Md. 647, 250 A. 2d 874 (1969), as examples of the proper way under Maryland Rule 605 a to handle cases involving multiple claims. That rule provides that \u201cthe court may direct the entry of a final judgment upon one or more but less than all of the claims only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Although a perfectionist might have desired the compliance with the rule here to have been handled a bit more precisely, nevertheless the record at one point states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I grant the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">\u201cMR. TOPF: Would your Honor make such a final determination so there is no delay warranted in the taking of an appeal if one chose to proceed ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Yes. Yes indeed. Today will be final as to the motion and pleadings, and you' might note your appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Accordingly, the motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>THE MERITS</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Barrier suggests, somewhat obliquely, that since Marine Midland was indebted to him in more than the amount of the October payment once the settlement agreement was reached the latter part of October, that there can be no default on his part since he is entitled to set-off. As it was put in <em>Lane v. Volunteer Co-operative Bank, </em>307 Mass. 508, 30 N.E.2d 821 (1940), \u201c[S]etoff is an incident of judicial proceedings in which both parties become actors and is accomplished only by judicial action.\u201d <em>See also </em>20 Am. Jur.2d <em>Counterclaim, Recoupment, etc. </em>\u00a7 7 (1965). As that work puts it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">\u201cThe right of setoff is an exercisable right, not a fixed or natural right conclusively established by the mere fact that each of the parties has a claim against the other; until the right is exercised, either party may do as he pleases with his property. The right to a setoff is not an incident to a debt, but to the remedy to secure payment of the debt; setoff is an incident of judicial proceedings in which both parties became actors, and is accomplished only by judicial action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In <em>Annan v. Houck, </em>4 Gill. 325 (1846), Judge Magruder said for our predecessors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">\u201cA set-off means a \u2018cross-claim, for which an action might be maintained against the plaintiff, and is very different from a mere right to a deduction from, or reduction of, his demand, on account of some matter connected therewith.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">There was no suit here by Marine Midland against Barrier. The settlement of the action between Barrier and Marine Midland as the result of which Marine Midland was indebted to Barrier in more than the amount of the October payment due from Barrier to Marine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Midland could not be. set up here as a bar to a determination that Barrier was in default.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">Marine Midland\u2019s position is that it formally declared Barrier in default because of his failure to pay in accordance with the terms of the contract, thus accelerating the maturity date, thereby producing a debt of Barrier to Marine Midland in excess of the sum otherwise due Barrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">The acceleration clause in this instance was an optional clause. It provided \u201cwhen the Buyer is in default * * * then, at the option of the Holder, * * * the entire amount * * * shall become due.\u201d In <em>Kleiman v. Kolker, </em>189 Md. 647, 655, 57 A. 2d 297 (1948), this Court held that the breach of a condition in a mortgage would not accelerate the date of its payment unless the mortgagee so elected. In <em>Gerber v. Karr, </em>231 Md. 180, 189 A. 2d 353 (1963), the option given the holder of a note to accelerate the due date of principal upon any default was held exercised by its choice to foreclose and \u201c[t]he unequivocal, overt act of filing proceedings for the collection by sale of the property of [the debt due] evidenced on the record, to all interested persons, that the privilege of acceleration had been [exercised].\u201d A like holding is found in <em>Santini v. Fritkin, </em>240 Md. 542, 214 A. 2d 578 (1965). <em>See also </em>11 Am. Jur.2d <em>Bills and Notes </em>\u00a7 294 (1963), and 47 Am. Jur. <em>Sales </em>\u00a7\u00a7 897-898 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Since the acceleration clause was not self-executing, it follows that the maturity date did not in fact accelerate until the secured party treated it as accelerated. It did not treat the maturity date as accelerated until its attorney wrote the December 21 letter to Barrier\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Marine Midland\u2019s notice to Barrier that the November 7 payment was past due and setting forth the sum then due including accrued late charges was inconsistent as of that time with an intent to accelerate. As we have said, that notice and Barrier\u2019s November 30 payment in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>sponse to that notice were prior to the December 21 letter which for the first time declared Marine Midland\u2019s intent to accelerate the maturity date. The situation is similar to that in <em>Cole v. Hines, </em>81 Md. 476, 32 A. 196, 32 L.R.A. 455 (1895), where there was a sale under an installment plan and a default. The seller promised to wait two weeks for the payment of the arrears, but two days before the expiration of the period granted seized the goods. As Judge Briscoe put it, the seller \u201ccontend [ed] that his promise to grant an extension of time for the payment of the two instalments being a voluntary promise without consideration, was not binding, but that, notwithstanding such promise, he was at liberty to annul the contract, retake the goods and forfeit the purchase money already paid by the [buyer].\u201d The Court held otherwise stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">\u201cIn all contracts where time is of the essence, a breach of the contract in that respect by one of the parties may be waived by the other party\u2019s subsequently treating the contract as still in force. [Citing authorities.] In these cases of conditional sales, the acceptance by the seller of an instalment of the purchase money after default is a recognition of the contract as still subsisting, and a waiver of the forfeiture. [Citing authorities.] And other acts than acceptance may have the same effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-5\">\u201cA party cannot take two inconsistent positions. If he has a right either to rescind a contract on account of a breach by the other party or to continue it in force, and he elects to continue it in force, he thereby abandons the right to rescind, and is bound by the election so made. [Citing authorities.] * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\u201cIn such cases of a waiver of a forfeiture, or of a right to rescind a contract, there is no necessity for a consideration, but the question turns rather upon the principle of election be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>tween two inconsistent rights. [Citing authorities.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479-80.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">\u201c* * * He made his election to continue the contract in force by his notification to the appellant, who had a right to rely upon it, and having thus waived the forfeiture on account of this particular default, it follows that he could not subsequently insist upon it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 482.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-7\"><em>See also </em>47 Am. Jur. <em>Sales </em>\u00a7 899 (1943), and <em>Geroy v. Upper, </em>182 Or. 535, 187 P.2d 662, 174 A.L.R. 1355 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Marine Midland in effect made a conditional offer to Barrier to continue the account in force without acceleration if Barrier would pay the November 7 payment together with accrued late charges. Barrier did this\u2014 and made his December payment\u2014prior to any effective action on the part of Marine Midland to accelerate and, therefore, prior to withdrawal by Marine Midland of its offer, because the attempt to take effective action to accelerate came in the letter of Marine Midland\u2019s attorney to Barrier\u2019s attorney which recited the receipt of both payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">It must be remembered, as was observed in <em>Tellez v. Canton R.R., </em>212 Md. 423,129 A. 2d 809 (1957):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201cThe function of the summary judgment procedure is not to try the case or to decide issues of fact. It is merely to determine whether there is an issue of fact to be tried, and if there is none, to cause judgment to be rendered accordingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-11\">The check dated November 30 sent in response to the demand of Marine Midland for payment of the November 7 payment together with accrued late charges has never been presented to the bank upon which it was drawn for payment. There was no trial, so we do not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>know whether the check was good. If that check at the time it was drawn was a check which would have been honored then by the bank upon presentation, it follows from what we have said that as of that time there would have been no default. With no default, there could not have been an acceleration. Accordingly, a triable issue of fact was presented, whether the check was good. Therefore, it was improper to grant a motion for summary judgment on behalf of Marine Midland.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Barrier has raised questions concerning the applicability of Code (1969 Repl. Vol.) Art. 83, \u00a7\u00a7 128 to 153, the Maryland Retail Installment Sales Act, to this contract which admittedly was executed in New York. We do not find it necessary to reach those questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and case remanded for trial on counts U and 5 of the declaration; costs to abide the final result.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-10\">. The exact language specified in the release agreement was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5p\">\u201cWe, State National Bank of Bethesda and Marine Midland Trust Company of Southern New York, do publicly apologize to James D.

Precisely when Barrier learned of this does not appear. In one of the court papers he says that he learned of this subsequent to October 19, \u201cthat the Plaintiff was verily of the belief that there were sufficient funds in his said checking account but that he directly deposited additional funds therein to make good the October 5, 1970 check as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b621-12\">.

Although Barrier\u2019s attorney requested answers several times, it does not appear that he ever sought to invoke the penalty of Maryland Rule 417 d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
