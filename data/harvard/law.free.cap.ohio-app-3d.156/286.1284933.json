Plaintiff-appellee is Mark A. Leavers.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-15\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b323-16\">{\u00b6 2} On December 5, 2001, appellee filed a petition pursuant to R.C. 4123.512 in the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas. Therein, appellee sought review of the November 1, 2001 order of the Industrial Commission of Ohio, which denied further appeal of the denial of his application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and which affirmed a finding that appellee was not an employee of defendant Bruce Daniels Construction on December 7, 2000, when he sustained injuries as a result of a fall at the construction job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The matter came on for trial on March 13 and 14, 2003. The parties stipulated that the sole issue for the jury was whether appellee was an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction or a self-employed subcontractor on the date of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">{\u00b6 4} R.C. 4123.01(A)(1)(c) sets forth the criteria to determine whether a construction worker is an employee. The statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c(A)(1) \u2018Employee\u2019 means: * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201c(c) Every person who performs labor or provides services pursuant to a construction contract, as defined in section 4123.79 of the Revised Code, if at least ten of the following criteria apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(i) The person is required to comply with instructions from the other contracting party regarding the manner or method of performing services;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(ii) The person is required by the other contracting party to have particular training;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(iii) The person\u2019s services are integrated into the regular functioning of the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(iv) The person is required to perform the work personally;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(v) The person is hired, supervised, or paid by the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(vi) A continuing relationship exists between the person and the other contracting party that contemplates continuing or recurring work even if the work is not full time;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(vii) The person\u2019s hours of work are established by the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-15\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c(viii) The person is required to devote full time to the business of the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-16\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(ix) The person is required to perform the work on the premises of the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-17\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(x) The person is required to follow the order of work set by the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-18\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(xi) The person is required to make oral or written reports of progress to the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-19\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(xii) The person is paid for services on a regular basis such as hourly, weekly, or monthly;</p>\n<p id=\"b324-20\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(xiii) The person\u2019s expenses are paid for by the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>{\u00b6 20} \u201c(xiv) The person\u2019s tools and materials are furnished by the other contracting party;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(xv) The person is provided with the facilities used to perform services;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">{\u00b6 22} \u201c(xvi) The person does not realize a profit or suffer a loss as a result of the services provided;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c(xvii) The person is not performing services for a number of employers at the same time;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(xviii) The person does not make the same services available to the general public;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(xix) The other contracting party has a right to discharge the person;</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201c(xx) The person has the right to end the relationship with the other contracting party without incurring liability pursuant to an employment contract or agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">{\u00b6 27} At the close of evidence, the trial court recessed the jury and reviewed the jury instructions, verdict form, and interrogatory with the parties. A lengthy discussion commenced regarding the form of the interrogatory. The trial court proposed a single interrogatory, which set forth the 20 factors listed in R.C. 4123.01(A)(1)(c) with a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d to be circled for each, and concluded with a single set of eight signature lines for the jurors. Counsel for appellant proposed that each factor be followed by eight signature lines. The trial court ultimately agreed with counsel for appellant and revised the interrogatory form to include eight signature lines under each criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">{\u00b6 28} Counsel for the parties proceeded to debate how the jury\u2019s answers to the interrogatory should correlate to the general verdict. Counsel for appellant argued that each individual juror who signed the verdict form was required to respond appropriately to the 20 interrogatory factors, explaining that because appellant needed at least six signatures on the verdict form, each juror who signed the verdict form was required to find ten or more of the factors applied. Counsel noted that although the verdict-signing jurors did not have to agree on each criterion, each juror\u2019s verdict had to comport with the number of affirmatively answered interrogatories. Thus, a juror finding ten or more factors could not enter a verdict against appellee, nor could a juror finding fewer than ten enter a verdict in favor of appellee. Counsel for appellee disagreed, arguing that it was irrelevant which individual juror voted on each of the factors and how many factors that individual found and that there need be only a majority on each factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">{\u00b6 29} The trial court responded:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201cI understand. So, [counsel for appellant], your position is clear that you wanted and will get after each of the factors or criteria- \u2014 I will modify that and place eight lines under each of those factors or criteria and we\u2019ll see what happens to each of those. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cAnd then there will be a verdict form and there\u2019ll be eight signature lines and we\u2019ll see whose names are on there and depending on what the * * * the breakout is * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cOkay. And the fact of the matter is if we get a verdict form back for [appellee] we\u2019re going to know who\u2019s signed that verdict form for [appellee], which is going to circle the portion indicated, and then of course you can check and we\u2019ll all check as to which jurors signed the individual factors and then you\u2019ll make your argument if you feel there\u2019s one that needs to be made that it\u2019s not legitimate verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT: Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cTHE COURT: And, [counsel for appellee], you\u2019ll make yours to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cCOUNSEL FOR APPELLEE: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">{\u00b6 36} Thereafter, the jury was returned to the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\">{\u00b6 37} The trial court proceeded to instruct the jury as to the law to be applied to the instant action:</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cIn order for [appellee] to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation fund he must establish in this case by the greater weight of the evidence that he was an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction Company on December 7, 2000, when he suffered the work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c[Appellant] oppose[s] [appellee\u2019s] claim and assert[s] or contend[s] that on December 7, 2000, [appellee] was not an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction Company but instead was an independent contractor and as such is not entitled to. participation in the Workers\u2019 Compensation fund of Ohio. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b326-14\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cAn employee, * * * means every person who performs labor or who provides services pursuant to a construction contract if at least 10 of the following 20 criteria or factors apply. And I\u2019m going to read those to you now * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-15\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c* * * [A]n independent contract on the other hand carries on an independent business and agrees to do specific jobs without direction or control by the party who hired him or her. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b326-16\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c* * * [T]he independent contractor has the right of control over the performance of the work and the methods used.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>{\u00b6 43} \u201cThe principal inquiry then in determining the character of the working relationship between [appellee] * * * and Bruce Daniels Construction Company is whether the employer has reserved the right to control the manner or means of doing the work. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c* * * [I]f you find that [appellee] has proved to you by the greater weight of the evidence that at least 10 of the criteria or factors relating to the work relationship between [appellee] and [Bruce Daniels Construction Company] on December 7, 2000, did apply and your answer to Interrogatory No. 1 \u2014 and I\u2019ll talk to you about Interrogatory No. 1 in a moment \u2014 is yes to at least 10 of the criteria or factors, then [appellee] has proved again by the preponderance of the evidence that he was an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction Company and thus is entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund of Ohio, and your verdict must be for [appellee]. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 45} \u201c[However, if] your answer to Interrogatory No. 1 is no to at least 11 of these criteria or factors, then [appellee] has failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he was an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction Company and is not entitled to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund of Ohio, and your verdict must be for [appellant]. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cI\u2019m now going to discuss with you the verdict form and the interrogatory. The interrogatory is a jury question although it\u2019s a fairly involved one. I\u2019ll go over that in a moment. * * * One verdict form\u2019s going to be available and it reads, \u2018we, the Jury, duly impaneled and sworn, find that the Plaintiff, Mark A. Leavers,\u2019 \u2014 and then there\u2019s a breakout \u2014 and it says, \u2018was\u2019 and there\u2019s another \u2018was not\u2019 so was or was not an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction Company on December 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cI tell you to circle one, that\u2019s how were going to know your verdict. You\u2019ll circle either was or was not an employee and you\u2019ll have, of course, eight signature lines and the date. And at least six of your number have to agree upon whatever verdict you choose in order to have a legitimate or a lawful verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cAny questions about that, folks? Fairly straightforward. Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cNow, little less straightforward, but nonetheless an important consideration. This document I\u2019m holding up to you now is called a Jury Interrogatory, it\u2019s a question. And it reads, \u2018Do you find by the greater weight of the evidence that Plaintiff has proved that the following criteria factors apply to the work relationship between Mark A. Leavers and Bruce Daniels construction company on December 7, 2000, at the time of Mr. Leavers\u2019 injury?\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cAnd I tell you, \u2018Circle yes or no relating to each of the factors or criteria.\u2019 Those 20 factors or criteria I read to you in the instruction they are identical on this interrogatory. Those are the 20 I\u2019m talking about.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>{\u00b6 51} \u201cNow, what you\u2019ll do, * * * is you\u2019ll go through these 20 criteria or factors and when six of your number have agreed on an answer, yes or no, that a particular factor either applied on December 7, 2000, or did not, you will circle it and then those jurors who have agreed, at least six again have to agree before you have an answer to any of these criteria, you\u2019ll sign your name on the signature lines. We\u2019ll provide eight \u2014 after each of the criteria, but the six who agree, at least six, could have more, but if you don\u2019t have six, you don\u2019t have an answer. You\u2019ll put your names on those lines after each factor or criteria and you go through the list and we hope be able to get at least six to answer yes or no on either one your choice of course. If you can\u2019t get six to answer one, go on to the next one an if you get to a point where you don\u2019t believe you\u2019re going to be able to get six to answer one you can, of course, * * * contact me during these deliberations and you can ask me for instructions or directions * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c* * * [T]his interrogatory is something that you ought to go through and do the work that I\u2019ve just indicated you\u2019re to do before you sign the verdict. This document is to give us some assistance to make sure that the verdict that you\u2019ve returned is based on the instructions of law that I\u2019ve given and in this case that\u2019s the analysis of the 20 factors or criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cDo any of you have any questions about my explanation on this jury interrogatory? Okay. Good.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 54} The jury commenced deliberations. Several hours later, the jury advised the trial court it had reached a verdict. The trial court reconvened the jury and read the verdict, which reflected: \u201cWe, the jury, duly impaneled and sworn, find that [appellee] was an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction Company on 12-7-2000. We render this verdict upon the concurrence of at least 6 of our members, that being at least three-quarters or more. Each concurring juror signs his or her name hereto.\u201d The trial court read the jury\u2019s responses to each individual factor listed in Interrogatory No. 1 and noted the number of signatures correlating to each factor. The trial court calculated that six jurors answered \u201cyes\u201d to 11 of the factors, and \u201cno\u201d to the nine remaining factors. The jury foreman confirmed the trial court\u2019s calculations. The trial court then asked counsel for appellant whether he had any further requests of the trial court \u201cas it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>relates to polling the jury.\u201d Counsel for appellant responded in the negative. The trial court explained to the jury counsel for appellant had declined any further inquiry into his/her individual verdict and individual answers to the interrogatory. The trial court continued:</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cSo, what will happen now, ladies and gentlemen and [appellee], I will have this verdict and the interrogatories, of course, photocopied for counsel, filed at the Clerk\u2019s Office as the true work product of this jury in this case and then I\u2019ll reduce to judgment your verdict, meaning that this case will be resolved with a final judgment entry reflecting what you\u2019ve done and sending, of course, that judgment to [counsel for appellant, counsel for appellee, and Mr. Daniels]. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cNow, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you again * * * I want to wish you the very best. Have a good weekend and I hope your experience was a positive one. If not positive, at least educational, and I look forward to seeking you all again. * * * You\u2019re free to go. Good-bye.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 57} \u201c(JURY LEAVES THE COURTROOM)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cTHE COURT: Anything else before we adjourn?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT: May we see the interrogatories?</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cTHE COURT: Sure. Sure. I\u2019m going to have Pat make a copy of that for each of you.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT: Okay.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-12\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cTHE COURT: So as soon as that\u2019s done she\u2019ll deliver it to you and a copy of the verdict form and then she\u2019s going to file them and you\u2019ll have that to take home with you.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT: Okay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-14\">{\u00b6 64} On March 18, 2003, appellant filed a motion to fashion a judgment entry in accordance with the answers to interrogatories notwithstanding the general verdict and a memorandum in support thereof. Appellant argued that Jennifer Wilhelm, one of the jurors, had answered \u201cyes\u201d to only eight of the 20 factors, but, nonetheless, had signed the general form finding that appellee was an employee of Bruce Daniels Construction. Appellant maintained the answers to the interrogatory, therefore, were inconsistent with the general verdict reached by the jury. Appellee filed a memorandum in opposition. Via judgment entry filed April 2, 2003, the trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion and entered judgment for appellee consistent with the general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-15\">{\u00b6 65} It is from this judgment entry appellant appeals, raising the following assignments of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>{\u00b6 66} \u201cI. The court below erred when it failed to provide counsel with copies of the jury\u2019s responses to interrogatories and verdict vote before dismissing the jury, making timely objections impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cII. The court below erred by treating each interrogatory as a special verdict on each statutory factor so that each special verdict required the concurrence of six jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">(\u00b6 68} \u201cIII. Because R.C. 4123.01(A)(1)(c) sets forth the necessary findings of facts to determine whether the claimant was an employee, the same jury [sic] rule necessarily applied to the interrogatory answers and verdict in this case, and the court below erred in applying the any majority rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">{\u00b6 69} In its first assignment of error, appellant maintains that the trial court erred in failing to provide counsel with copies of the jury\u2019s responses to the interrogatory and verdict vote prior to dismissing the jury, thereby making a timely objection impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">{\u00b6 70} When the jury returned with its verdict, the trial court read aloud the verdict form and noted six signatures were affixed thereto. The trial court then read aloud the answer to each factor and the number of signatures. The trial court stated that it counted 11 \u201cyeses\u201d and nine \u201cnos\u201d and asked the jury foreman whether the verdict was correct as announced. The foreman answered affirmatively. The trial court then asked counsel for appellant whether he had \u201cany further requests of me as it relates to polling the jury?\u201d Counsel for appellant responded in the negative, and the trial court excused the jury. After the jury exited the courtroom, the trial court asked counsel whether there was \u201canything else before we adjourn?\u201d Counsel for appellant asked to see the interrogatory, and the trial court advised counsel that his secretary would make the copies of the interrogatory, which counsel promptly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">{\u00b6 71} Appellee asserts that appellant waived any objection to the interrogatory when it declined the opportunity to poll the jury. We disagree. We find waiving any further polling of the jury to be a separate and distinct issue from waiving the right to inspect the signed interrogatory and verdict. However, before the trial court released the jury, we find that counsel for appellant had an affirmative obligation to ask to see the interrogatory. By failing to do so, appellant waived all but plain error with respect to any possible discrepancy between the interrogatory and verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cIn appeals of civil cases, the plain error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the extremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was made at the trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself.\u201d <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 679 N.E.2d 1099, syllabus. Upon review of the record, we find no indication of plain error in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 73} Appellant relies upon the Ohio Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>O\u2019Connell v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio RR. Co. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 226, 569 N.E.2d 889, in which the Supreme Court found a jury\u2019s inconsistent answers to interrogatories were tantamount to plain error. Upon a thorough reading of <em>O\u2019Connell, </em>we find that it is distinguishable from the instant action. <em>O\u2019Connell </em>involved a comparative-negligence action. Under comparative-negligence principles, the participation of three-fourths of the jurors is required, such that a juror\u2019s failure to participate in answering an interrogatory could leave fewer than three-fourths of the jurors to participate in the apportionment of comparative negligence. In the case sub judice, although a juror found ten or fewer factors, the same juror was not precluded from finding that 11 of the factors had been answered affirmatively by the jury as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">{\u00b6 74} Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">{\u00b6 75} In its second assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in treating each factor or criterion set forth in the interrogatory as a special verdict, requiring the concurrence of six jurors on each statutory factor. Specifically, appellant maintains that the trial court confused interrogatory responses subject to Civ.R. 49(B) with special verdicts, which were abolished by Civ.R. 49(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-9\">{\u00b6 76} A special verdict is defined as \u201ca statement by the jury of the facts it has found \u2014 in essence, the jury\u2019s answers to questions submitted to it; the court determines which party based on those answers, is to have judgment.\u201d <em>Porada v. Garvin Group, Inc. </em>(May 12, 1993), Hamilton App. No. C-910268, 1993 WL 294006. We find the trial court did not determine judgment after the interrogatory was completed by the jury. Rather, the trial court presented the jury with a general verdict form that the jury was to complete following its completion of the responses to the interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-10\">{\u00b6 77} Furthermore, appellant requested that the trial court follow each factor with eight signature lines for the jury. The trial court agreed to appellant\u2019s request. Appellant cannot now allege error as to a procedure it requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">{\u00b6 78} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">{\u00b6 79} In its final assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court erred in applying the \u201cany majority\u201d rule rather than \u201csame juror\u201d rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">{\u00b6 80} During the discussions with the trial court and counsel for appellee, counsel for appellant raised the issue of the \u201csame juror\u201d rule. However, appellant did not object to the trial court\u2019s instruction as to the completion of the interrogatory and verdict form. Accordingly, we review this assignment of error under a plain-error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">{\u00b6 81} Again, appellant relies upon <em>O\u2019Connell v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio RR. Co., </em>supra, in support of its position. As discussed in assignment of error one, we note that <em>O\u2019Connell </em>involved a case of comparative negligence. We find the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale for applying the same juror rule inapplicable to the instant action.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">{\u00b6 82} Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">{\u00b6 83} The judgment of the Tuscarawas County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b332-10\">Farmer and John W. Wise, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-17\">. Defendant Bruce Daniels Construction is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b328-8\">. The trial court never fully explained to the jury how to correlate their verdict with their answers to the interrogatory. The trial court did not instruct before any juror could sign the general verdict that the same juror must first have been one of the six or more jurors who found for plaintiff on ten or more of the factors listed in the interrogatory. Likewise, the trial court did not instruct that a juror could sign the general verdict so long as any six or more of the jurors found for plaintiff on ten or more of the factors listed in the interrogatory even if any individual juror did not find for plaintiff on ten or more of the factors. In other words, the trial court never resolved the issue of whether the \"same juror rule\u201d or the \"majority rule\u201d applied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
