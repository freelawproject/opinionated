Cohen and his law firm, Clements, Mahin <em>&amp; </em>Cohen, LLP, to disqualify Geoffrey P. Damon as her counsel in the trial of her legal-malpractice claim against Cohen. In her single assignment of error, she contends that the trial court wrongly disqualified Damon after Cohen proposed to call him as a fact witness at trial. We hold that the trial court\u2019s written decision correctly applied DR 5-102(A) and that the court did not abuse its discretion when it ordered Damon\u2019s disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">{\u00b6 2} On June 20, 1996, Amos suffered injuries when she slipped and fell on water in the bathroom at the Motel 6 in Sharonville, Ohio. The motel manager claimed that during the night, occupants on the floor above had plugged a shower drain, causing water to leak into the bathroom in Amos\u2019s room.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">{\u00b6 3} A West Virginia attorney referred Amos to Cohen. He agreed to represent Amos and filed a complaint for damages on her behalf. In June 1999, however, he voluntarily dismissed her complaint without prejudice under Civ.R. 41(A). By a letter dated November 24, 1999, Cohen terminated the attorney-client relationship, stating, \u201cI simply do not see a viable avenue toward showing liability.\u201d His recommendation was that, perhaps, the case should \u201csettle for a nominal sum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-12\">{\u00b6 4} After Amos refiled her complaint for personal injuries pro se within the one-year savings statute, R.C. 2305.19, Damon succeeded Cohen as her counsel. On November 16, 2000, Damon also filed a complaint for attorney malpractice against Cohen and his law firm. On April 18, 2001, while discovery was still in progress, Damon voluntarily dismissed Amos\u2019s malpractice action against Cohen under Civ.R. 41(A). On April 8, 2002, he refiled the malpractice action against Cohen.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>{\u00b6 5} In her complaint for attorney malpractice, Amos alleged that Cohen\u2019s failure to conduct discovery and his decision to dismiss the action under Civ.R. 41(A) had resulted in the permanent loss of the responsible witnesses, documents, and evidence for use in her personal-injury action. As a consequence, she contended that the value of her claim for damages was reduced and that she was required to incur increased attorney fees and costs to achieve a settlement. Almost six months later, on October 1, 2002, Damon, with Amos\u2019s approval, settled her slip-and-fall case against the motel.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">{\u00b6 6} Although the motion is not in the record, the parties agree that, on November 19, 2002, Cohen moved for Damon\u2019s disqualification in the malpractice action pursuant to DR 5-102(A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a hearing on the motion, the trial court ordered Damon\u2019s disqualification \u201cto avoid a potential violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 7} An order disqualifying civil trial counsel is a final order that is immediately appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.02. See <em>Kala v. Aluminum Smelting &amp; Refining Co., Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1, 688 N.E.2d 258. Because the roles of advocate and witness are inconsistent, it is generally inappropriate for a trial attorney to testify on behalf of the client. See <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. v. Rubin </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 256, 257, 31 OBR 459, 510 N.E.2d 379. DR 5-102(A) states that \u201c[i]f, after undertaking employment in contemplated or pending litigation, a lawyer learns or it is obvious that he or a lawyer in his firm ought to be called as a witness on behalf of his client, he shall withdraw from the conduct of the trial and his firm, if any, shall not continue representation in the trial, except that he may continue the representation and he or a lawyer in his firm may testify in the circumstances enumerated in DR 5 \u2014 101(B)(1) through (4).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 8} The justification for the advocate-witness rule appears in the Ethical Considerations, which are aspirational in character and represent those objectives toward which every attorney should strive. EC 5-9 states that \u201c[a]n advocate who becomes a witness is in the unseemly and ineffective position of arguing his own credibility.\u201d See <em>155 N. High Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 423, 426-427, 650 N.E.2d 869. \u201cWhere the question arises, doubts should be resolved in favor of the lawyer testifying and against his becoming or continuing as an advocate.\u201d EC 5-10. Unlike other rules, DR 5-102(A) makes no allowance for a waiver by the client of the rule against a. lawyer serving in the dual rule of advocate and witness. The purpose of the rule is to protect the interests of the client and the adverse party, as well as the institutional integrity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>of the legal system. See Ohio Bd. of Commrs. on Grievances and Discipline Ops. 2003-5, at 4-5; see, also, <em>155 N. High Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 427, 650 N.E.2d 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 9} When a trial attorney in a pending case requests permission to testify or is called to testify, the trial court has a corresponding duty to supervise attorney conduct and to prevent potential violations of the Code of Professional Conduct. See <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. v. Rubin, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 259, 31 OBR 459, 510 N.E.2d 379. In <em>Mentor Lagoons, </em>the Supreme Court promulgated a two-step analysis in which the trial court must (1) without reference to DR 5-102(A), determine whether the attorney\u2019s testimony is admissible, and (2) if the testimony is admissible, decide whether the exceptions in DR 5 \u2014 102(B)(1) through (4) apply. See id., 31 Ohio St.3d at 260, 510 N.E.2d 379. Absent an abuse of discretion, the trial court\u2019s rulings will be affirmed. See <em>155 N. High Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 10} In its thorough and well-reasoned memorandum decision in this case, the trial court applied the two-step <em>Mentor Lagoons </em>test. It concluded that Damon\u2019s testimony was admissible, as Damon had personal knowledge \u201cconcerning what evidence, if any, was lost due to Cohen\u2019s alleged negligence, what efforts were made to retrieve such evidence, what bearing such evidence would have on Plaintiffs case, whether Plaintiff was comparatively negligent, and how Mr. Cohen\u2019s alleged negligence may have impacted Plaintiffs ability to recover damages.\u201d The trial court observed that Amos and Damon did not object to the admissibility of his testimony. In applying the second step of the <em>Mentor Lagoons </em>analysis, the trial court held that Damon\u2019s testimony might potentially have been prejudicial to Amos on the issues of liability and damages and that \u201cnone of the exceptions in DR 5-101(B) apply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 11} Damon argues that Cohen\u2019s motion was a bad-faith strategy to deprive Amos of her counsel of choice solely to gain a tactical advantage. The argument lacks merit, as once the trial court learned that Damon would be called to testify as a witness, it was incumbent upon the court to make an independent determination under DR 5-101(A). The trial court had this responsibility even if opposing counsel had not moved to disqualify Damon. See <em>Mentor Lagoons, Inc. v. Rubin, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 259, 31 OBR 459, 510 N.E.2d 379.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\"> {\u00b6 12} Amos and Damon also argue that Cohen\u2019s motion to disqualify Damon was not timely and that Cohen\u2019s failure to raise this issue in 2000, while the initial complaint for attorney malpractice was pending, is proof that Cohen was merely trying to gain a tactical advantage. Motions to disqualify counsel should be viewed with caution because of a party\u2019s right to counsel of his or her choice. See <em>155 N. High Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 429, 650 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>N.E.2d 869. The record, however, does not support their argument. When Amos voluntarily dismissed her initial attorney-malpractice complaint against Cohen on April 18, 2001, she had not responded to his request for discovery. It was not until she settled her underlying slip-and-fall claim on October 1, 2002, that Damon\u2019s testimony would have reasonably been deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 13} Amos maintains that the evidence sought from Damon was otherwise available from herself or from Motel 6. Her reliance on <em>Wasserman, Wasserman, Bryan &amp; Landry v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(Nov. 21, 1986), 6th Dist. No. L-86-135, 1986 WL 13178; and <em>Sneary v. Baty </em>(Aug. 14, 1996), 3d Dist. No. 1-96-13, 1996 WL 479579, for the proposition that a motion to disqualify counsel is inappropriate if other witnesses are available to testify to the same matter is misplaced. In this case, the trial court\u2019s independent determination concerning the admissibility of Damon\u2019s testimony was predicated on necessity and the court\u2019s finding that his testimony was \u201crelevant\u201d and within his \u201cpersonal knowledge of these matters.\u201d In <em>Wasserman, </em>a <em>pre-Mentor Lagoons </em>decision, the court found that the attorney\u2019s testimony was merely cumulative of other testimony. In <em>Sneary, </em>the court found that the attorney\u2019s remarks made in opening statement were inadmissible hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 14} Damon\u2019s zealous efforts to represent his client are commendable, but he could not serve as both advocate and witness in violation of the Code of Professional Responsibility. His testimony on behalf of Amos, as Cohen argues, was necessary to prove her claim with respect to liability and damages. Damon\u2019s identification of the lost witnesses and documents caused by Cohen\u2019s alleged failure to conduct discovery and his own efforts to locate them, his active part in the settlement negotiations of Amos\u2019s personal-injury case, and his evaluation of the settlement value because of Cohen\u2019s alleged negligence were all necessary to prove Amos\u2019s malpractice claim. These facts were known only to Damon and were not within the direct knowledge of either Amos or another source. His testimony, as the trial court correctly held, was, therefore, admissible and could have been prejudicial to his client\u2019s claim if Damon had to defend his own handling of her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">{\u00b6 15} Amos and Damon next contend that DR 5-101(B)(4) would have allowed Damon to testify without violating the Code of Professional Responsibility. This exception states that a lawyer \u201cmay testify * * * [a]s to any matter, if refusal would work a substantial hardship on the client because of the distinctive value of the lawyer or the firm as counsel in the particular case.\u201d The burden is on the attorney who invokes this exception to prove that his or her services in the case would work a substantial hardship on the client <em>and </em>that his or her services would provide a distinctive value. See <em>155 N. High Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>{\u00b6 16} In opposition to Cohen\u2019s motion to disqualify Damon, Amos filed her own affidavit with the trial court, claiming substantial hardship because she had unsuccessfully \u201cinterviewed approximately fifty lawyers either in person or over the telephone.\u201d Because no attorney would represent her, she claimed, she was forced to refile her personal-injury complaint pro se. She asked the trial court to allow Damon to continue as her attorney because \u201cI believe that there are very few attorneys who will take on an attorney malpractice case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 17} Despite a party\u2019s right to representation by counsel of his or her choice, the phrase \u201csubstantial hardship on the client because of the distinctive value of the lawyer\u201d in DR 5-101(B)(4) contemplates more than intimate familiarity with the case or the risk of added expenses. See <em>155 N. High Ltd. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., </em>syllabus. Rather, an attorney must show that he or she possesses some expertise in a specialized area such as patent law. See id., 72 Ohio St.3d at 429, 650 N.E.2d 869. Here, Amos did nothing to prove that Damon had expertise in a specialized area of the law. The malpractice claim alleged in the complaint was not complex or overly involved. Moreover, Amos maintains only that it would have been difficult to find an attorney to represent her in the malpractice case against Cohen. Her argument of financial hardship was insufficient to demonstrate the substantial hardship contemplated by the code. See <em>Pilot Corp. v. Abel, </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-1204, 2002-Ohio-2812, 2002 WL 1164114, at \u00b630.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 18} The assignment of error is overruled. Accordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it disqualified Damon from representing Amos. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-8\">Winkler, P.J., and Doan, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-7\">. On January 21, 2003, Damon filed a motion to withdraw as counsel for Amos because of the \"failure of the Plaintiff to cooperate with counsel.\u201d Damon withdrew the motion at the March 6, 2003 hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
