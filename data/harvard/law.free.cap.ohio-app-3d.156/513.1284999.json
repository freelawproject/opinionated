Sprowls, is not entitled to unemployment compensation benefits because he was discharged from his employment for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">{\u00b6 2} Sprowls began working as a truck driver for MRG Transport (\u201cMRG\u201d) on or about September 11, 2001. On May 22, 2002, Sprowls\u2019s truck collided with a horse-drawn buggy. Shortly thereafter, MRG received a letter from its insurance carrier stating that Sprowls no longer met the \u201cminimum driver underwriting guidelines\u201d and that this might effect MRG\u2019s insurance policy. On June 3, 2002, MRG terminated Sprowls because he was no longer insurable.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">{\u00b6 3} Sprowls filed an application for determination of benefits with the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (\u201cODJFS\u201d). On July 22, 2002, ODJFS made its initial determination denying unemployment benefits to Sprowls, finding that MRG had discharged Sprowls with just cause in connection with work.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">{\u00b6 4} Sprowls filed an appeal of this initial determination. On September 22, 2002, the Director of ODJFS issued a redetermination affirming the initial decision to deny benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">{\u00b6 5} Sprowls then filed an appeal of the director\u2019s redetermination. The director transferred Sprowls\u2019s case to the Unemployment Compensation Review Commission (\u201cReview Commission\u201d). On January 31, 2003, an appointed hearing officer for the Review Commission conducted an evidentiary hearing. In a decision mailed February 11, 2003, the hearing officer affirmed the director\u2019s initial decision and held that Sprowls had been discharged by MRG for just cause in connection with work.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-13\">{\u00b6 6} On April 18, 2003, Sprowls filed an appeal in the court of common pleas. On September 5, 2003, the court entered a decision overruling Sprowls\u2019s motion and affirming the Review Commission\u2019s findings. Sprowls filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred by not finding that the hearing officer\u2019s determination the appellant was fired for just cause was unlawful, unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">{\u00b6 8} The General Assembly has enacted the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Act, R.C. 4141.01 through 4141.47, 4141.99, to establish the policy and laws of the state regarding payments from a fund maintained by the state to persons who become unemployed. The purpose of the Act is to provide financial assistance to individuals who are able and willing to work but who find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own. <em>Alsip v. Klosterman Baking Co. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 439, 680 N.E.2d 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 9} R.C. 4141.29 provides that \u201c[e]ach eligible individual shall receive benefits as compensation for loss of remuneration due to involuntary total or partial unemployment * * * subject to the conditions stipulated in this chapter.\u201d Paragraph (D)(2)(a) of that section states that an individual may not be paid benefits when \u201c[t]he individual * * * has been discharged for just cause in connection with the individual\u2019s work * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 10} The Unemployment Compensation Board of Review found that Sprowls is not entitled to receive benefits because MRG terminated him for just cause. \u201cAn appellate court may reverse the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review\u2019s \u2018just cause\u2019 determination only if it is unlawful, unreasonable or against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Tzangas, Plakas &amp; Mannos v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 694, 653 N.E.2d 1207, paragraph one of syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cTraditionally, just cause, in the statutory sense, is that which, to an ordinarily intelligent person, is a justifiable reason for doing or not doing a particular act.\u201d <em>Irvine v. Unemp. Comp. Bd. of Review </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 15, 17, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587. Just-cause determinations in the unemployment compensation context, however, also must be consistent with the legislative purpose underlying the Unemployment Compensation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe [A]ct was intended to provide financial assistance to an individual who had worked, was able and willing to work, but was temporarily without employment through no fault or agreement of his own.\u201d <em>Irvine, </em>supra, 19 Ohio St.3d at 17, 19 OBR 12, 482 N.E.2d 587. \u201cThus, while a termination based upon an employer\u2019s economic necessity may be <em>justifiable, </em>it is not a <em>just cause </em>termination when viewed through the lens of the legislative purpose of the Act.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Tzangas, </em>supra, 73 Ohio St.3d at 697, 653 N.E.2d 1207.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe Act does not exist to protect employees from themselves, but to protect them from economic forces over which they have no control. When an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>employee is at fault, he is no longer the victim of fortune\u2019s whims, but is instead directly responsible for his own predicament. Fault on the employee\u2019s part separates him from the Act\u2019s intent and the Act\u2019s protection. Thus, fault is essential to the unique chemistry of a just cause termination.\u201d <em>Tzangas, </em>supra, 73 Ohio St.3d at 698-699, 653 N.E.2d 1207. The Review Commission found that Sprowls was discharged for just cause in connection with work. It reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[Sprowls] was discharged by MRG Transport when the employer was notified by the employer\u2019s insurance company that [Sprowls] was no longer insurable. Remaining insurable was a requirement of [Sprowls\u2019s] employment with MRG Transport. [Sprowls\u2019s] failure to remain insurable represents a breach of contract. Claimant was discharged by MRG Transport for just cause in connection with work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">{\u00b6 15} In its decision affirming the Review Commission\u2019s decision, the trial court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cThe first factor this court will determine is whether [Sprowls] was at fault, which would deny him protection of the Act. In this case, [Sprowls], due to an accident, was unable to be insured by MRG\u2019s insurance carrier. It is fundamental to the industry that a truck driver must carry insurance. That situation left [Sprowls] unable to perform his job duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe next issue to consider is whether [Sprowls\u2019s] inability to perform his job was due to an outside economic factor. The ultimate act that caused [Sprowls] to be uninsurable was an accident in which [Sprowls] received a citation for excessive speeding and failure to maintain assured clear distance. It is not unreasonable, unlawful or against the manifest weight of the evidence to determine that the discharge of [Sprowls] was due to fault on his own part and not due to an outside economic factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">{\u00b6 18} In finding fault on Sprowls\u2019s part, the trial court relied on evidence of a traffic citation issued in connection with the collision, which charged Sprowls with a violation of R.C. 4511.21(A) for failing to maintain assured clear distance ahead. However, no evidence was presented showing that Sprowls had been convicted of the violation or that he had incurred any other liability, civil or criminal, as a result of the accident. Sprowls testified that he was never served with the citation. He also introduced a copy of a written note, purporting to be from the prosecuting attorney in charge of the case, stating that the charges against Sprowls had been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">{\u00b6 19} It is undisputed that Sprowls\u2019s position as a truck driver required him to remain insurable under a policy of liability insurance that his employer maintained. Nor is it disputed that Sprowls was denied further eligibility for coverage by his employer\u2019s insurer, or that his employer could validly exercise its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>right to terminate Sprowls as a result for reasons of economic necessity. The issue presented is whether the grounds for termination portray some fault chargeable to Sprowls.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Mayes v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1986), 32 Ohio App.3d 68, 513 N.E.2d 818, a school bus driver was discharged for failure to maintain the insurable status her position required when her conviction for a DUI offense committed outside work hours rendered her uninsurable. Being uninsurable permitted her discharge, but just cause for the discharge was found because the claimant\u2019s conviction arose from conduct for which she was at fault. \u201cThere must be conduct of the employee causing the discharge for there to be just cause for [the] discharge. In addition, such conduct must be of a nature that it is not justifiable.\u201d <em>Morris v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1993), 90 Ohio App.3d 295, 300, 629 N.E.2d 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">{\u00b6 21} Like the claimant in <em>Mayes, </em>Sprowls was discharged when he could no longer be insured as a driver. In each case, the cause of the discharge was the employer\u2019s economic necessity that its drivers be insured. However, and unlike <em>Mayes, </em>the particular conduct from which Sprowls\u2019s uninsured status resulted has not been shown to be conduct which, in and of itself, is unjustifiable. <em>Morris. </em>No conviction for a violation of the traffic code or any other offense arising from the accident has been shown. Charges that may have been filed were dismissed. No other evidence was introduced showing that Sprowls was at fault in causing the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 22} An employer may terminate an employee for economic necessity when some condition prevents the employee from performing the duties of his job. But just cause for purposes of R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) imposes a different standard; in this context, the condition or circumstance which resulted in the termination must be a matter for which the employee was at fault. \u201cFault\u201d necessitates culpability, or blameworthiness, on the employee\u2019s part. A mere causal nexus between the termination and some circumstance or condition affecting the employee is insufficient to show that the termination was for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">{\u00b6 23} Appellee argues that \u201cfault\u201d for these purposes has been modified by the holding of <em>Tzangas. </em>There, a law firm fired a stenographer because she was unable to develop or maintain the level of typing skills her job required. <em>Tzangas </em>held that such unsuitability for a position constitutes fault sufficient to support a just-cause determination and a resulting denial of unemployment compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b624} <em>Tzangas </em>set out a four-prong test for unsuitability: that (1) the employee does not perform the required work; (2) the employer made known its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>expectations to the employee at the time of hiring; (3) the expectations were reasonable; and (4) the requirements of the job did not change substantially since the date the employee was hired for the position. Id., paragraph four of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">{\u00b625} The second, third, and fourth prongs of the unsuitability test are satisfied here. The first prong is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">{\u00b6 26} In <em>Tzangas, </em>the matter that prevented the employee from performing the required work was a defect in her skills chargeable to the employee. Here, the matter that prevents Sprowls from performing the required work is a loss of insurability because of a decision made by his employer\u2019s insurance carrier. The decision no doubt resulted from the accident involving the buggy. However, in order to show fault, there must be evidence that Sprowls may be blamed for the accident, that is, that he was at fault for causing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 27} There is no evidence that Sprowls was at fault in causing the accident, which in turn caused him to lose his eligibility for coverage under the liability insurance policy his employer maintains. Therefore, the just-cause condition on which R.C. 4141.29(D)(2)(a) permits denial of unemployment compensation benefits was not shown. The trial court erred when it affirmed the board\u2019s denial of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">{\u00b6 28} The assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the trial court is reversed. The case will be remanded to the trial court for entry of a judgment in favor of Sprowls on his claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-10\">Fain, P.J., and Frederick N. Young, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
