Appellant appeared, pled not guilty, and was appointed counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-13\">{\u00b6 3} On March 31, 2003, appellant again appeared and plaintiff-appellee, state of Ohio, indicated to the trial court that a plea agreement had been reached. Appellant agreed to plead no contest to driving under suspension, in violation of R.C. 4507.02, and driving under the influence of alcohol, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(1). Appellee agreed to dismiss failure to use turn signals, in violation of R.C. 4511.39, and driving under the influence, in violation of R.C. 4511.19(A)(6) (BAC over .17). Appellee also agreed to recommend a sentence of a $250 fine plus court costs and 180 days in jail with 177 of those days suspended on the DUI charge. On the DUS charge, appellee agreed to recommend a sentence of a $100 fine plus court costs and 180 days in jail with 180 of those days suspended. The recommended sentence also included probation and a six-month driver\u2019s license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>{\u00b6 4} The trial court accepted appellant\u2019s no contest pleas but gave a different sentence. The court suspended the $250 f\u00edne and suspended only 165 days of the sentence, leaving appellant to serve 15 days in jail rather than the recommended three. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">{\u00b6 5} Initially, it should be noted that appellee has failed to submit a brief in this matter. App.R. 18(C) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cIf an appellee fails to file the appellee\u2019s brief within the time provided by this rule, or within the times as extended, the appellee will not be heard at oral argument except by permission of the court upon a showing of good cause submitted in writing prior to argument; and in determining the appeal, the court may accept the appellant\u2019s statement of the facts and issues as correct and reverse the judgment if appellant\u2019s brief reasonably appears to sustain such action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred by failing to comply with R.C. 2937.07 and Criminal Rule 11 by failing to properly address the defendant in order to inform him of the effect of his plea and determine if the change in plea was voluntary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellant argues that, pursuant to Crim.R. 11(E), the trial court failed to enter into a meaningful dialogue in explaining the appellant\u2019s constitutional rights, which the appellant argues that the trial court was required to do. Crim.R. 11(E) states that the court \u201cshall not accept such pleas -without first informing the defendant of the effect of the plea of guilty, no contest, and not guilty,\u201d and determining that the defendant is making the pleas voluntarily. Crim.R. 11(E). Appellant contends that the \u201cno contest\u201d plea was not knowing, intelligent, and voluntary due to this lack of meaningful dialogue between appellant and the trial court. Therefore, appellant argues that his plea must be vacated and that the case must be remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">{\u00b6 10} This case raises the issue of what must be contained in the colloquy between a trial court judge and a criminal defendant when taking a plea of guilty or no contest for a misdemeanor traffic offense. The Ohio Supreme Court recently decided the issue in <em>State v. Watkins, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 12, 2003-Ohio-2419, 788 N.E.2d 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">{\u00b6 11} Prior to <em>Watkins, </em>at least nine of the 12 appellate districts held that in accepting a plea, regardless of whether it be a plea to a felony, a serious misdemeanor, or a petty misdemeanor, the trial court must advise the defendant of more than just a definition of a guilty plea and a no contest plea. Those courts noted that the three rights from <em>Boykin v. Alabama </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (jury trial, privilege against self-incrimination, and confrontation) and the additional right from <em>State v. Ballard </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 473, 20 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>O.O.3d 397, 423 N.E.2d 115 (compulsory process) must be disclosed to any pleading defendant to ensure that the plea is voluntary, knowing, and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Toledo v. Chiaverini </em>(1983), 11 Ohio App.3d 43, 11 OBR 76, 463 N.E.2d 56, the Sixth District stated that the court must advise all pleading defendants of the constitutional rights being waived. Specifically, the <em>Chiaverini </em>court held as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cThe court, when informing a defendant of the effect of a plea of guilty, no contest or not guilty, pursuant to Crim.R. 11(E), should advise the defendant of his right to a trial by jury or to the court; the burden upon the prosecution to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt if he were to go to trial; his right to cross-examine the witnesses called against him; his right not to testify; and his right to subpoena any witness he may have in his own defense. The court should further advise the defendant that, if he pleads no contest, the court will make a finding with regard to the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, based upon an explanation of the circumstances as they are set forth in the complaint, as they are presented by the prosecution, or as they are presented by the complainant.\u201d Id., 11 Ohio App.3d at 44, 11 OBR 76, 463 N.E.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Cleveland v. Wanzo </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 664, 718 N.E.2d 982, the Eighth District held that compliance with Crim.R. 11(E) requires the trial court to advise the defendant of the constitutional rights he is waiving. The Second and Tenth Appellate Districts disagreed with the other districts. In <em>State v. Lacy </em>(Apr. 12, 2002), 2d Dist. No. 2001-CA-130, 2002 WL 538912, the Second District found that a trial court must advise a petty-misdemeanor defendant of the effect of his plea by telling him what each plea means but need not advise the defendant of the constitutional rights he is waiving. The Tenth District believed that the \u201ceffect of a plea\u201d required more than the Second District did, stating that there must be dialogue between the court and the defendant and that the court must mention the possible penalties. However, the Tenth District simultaneously stated that it continued to disagree with <em>Chiaverini.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">{\u00b6 15} This court adhered to the approach requiring a more detailed colloquy. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lintner </em>(Sept. 21, 2001), 7th Dist. No. 732, 2001 WL 1126654 (meaningful dialogue); <em>State v. Jackson </em>(May 9, 2001), 7th Dist. No. 99-CO-57, 2001 WL 503064 (constitutional rights and maximum penalty to know effect of plea); <em>State v. Hlinovsky </em>(May 1, 2001), 7th Dist. No. 99 BA 65, 2001 WL 503210 (potential penalty); <em>State v. Payne </em>(Dec. 19, 2000), 7th Dist. No. 00 521 CA, 2000 WL 1902205 (applying <em>Boykin </em>and <em>Ballard </em>to misdemeanor pleas).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 16} The Ohio Supreme Court subsequently certified <em>State v. Watkins </em>(Nov. 16, 2001), 2d Dist. No. 2001-CA-15, 2001 WL 1461138, with <em>Chiaverini </em>and <em>Wanzo. </em>On May 16, 2003, the court issued its decision in <em>State v. Watkins, </em>99 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>Ohio St.3d 12, 2003-Ohio-2419, 788 N.E.2d 635, significantly abrogating <em>Chiaverini.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">{\u00b6 17} Initially, the court noted that Crim.R. 11 is inapplicable to traffic cases pursuant to Crim.R. 1(C)(3). Nonetheless, the court went on to explain how there are different requirements for different offenses (i.e., petty or serious misdemeanors and felonies). The court also noted that the requirements for taking a plea for a felony offense applied only to felony offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b6 18} Turning to the more specific issue before it, the court stated that \u201c[t]he protections that the Criminal Rules provide to felony defendants should not be read into the Ohio Traffic Rules, which deal only with misdemeanor offenses.\u201d Id., 99 Ohio St.3d 12, 2003-Ohio-2419, 788 N.E.2d 635, at \u00b628. The court concluded, holding that \u201c[w]hen a defendant charged with a petty misdemeanor traffic offense pleads guilty or no contest, the trial court complies with Traf.R. 10(D) by informing the defendant of the information contained in Traf.R. 10(B).\u201d Id., 99 Ohio St.3d 12, 2003-Ohio-2419, 788 N.E.2d 635, at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">{\u00b6 19} Traf.R. 10 addresses pleas and a defendant\u2019s rights when pleading. Traf.R. 10(D) addresses misdemeanor cases involving petty offenses. A \u201cpetty offense\u201d is defined in Traf.R. 2 as \u201can offense for which the penalty prescribed by law includes confinement for six months or less.\u201d Appellant was charged with driving under suspension in violation of R.C. 4507.02(B)(1), which is a misdemean- or of the first degree punishable by up to six months in jail. R.C. 4507.99(C). Therefore, appellant\u2019s offense was a petty offense. Traf.R. 10(D) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cIn misdemeanor cases involving petty offenses, except those processed in a traffic violations bureau, the court may refuse to accept a plea of guilty or no contest and shall not accept such pleas without first informing the defendant of the effect of the plea of guilty, no contest, and not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">{\u00b6 21} The effect of a no contest plea is defined in Traf.R. 10(B)(2):</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe plea of no contest is not an admission of defendant\u2019s guilt, but is an admission of the truth of the facts alleged in the complaint and such plea or admission shall not be used against the defendant in any subsequent civil or criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">{\u00b6 23} In this case, there was no colloquy between the trial court and appellant to indicate compliance with <em>Watkins </em>and Traf.R. 10(B)(2). The court did advise appellant of certain constitutional rights he would be waiving. However, the court never told appellant of the effect of his no contest plea as outlined in Traf.R. 10(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>{\u00b6 25} Appellant\u2019s plea of no contest is hereby vacated, and this matter is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings according to law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Plea vacated and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-6\">Vukovich and DeGenaro, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
