(\u201cReminger &amp; Reminger\u201d). Defendants Satullo and Reminger <em>&amp; </em>Reminger cross-appeal. Because we find no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 2} According to plaintiffs, attorney Tobias Elsass initially represented plaintiffs in a suit against Star Bank in federal district court, wherein plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file was the subject of litigation. Plaintiffs also retained Elsass in a suit against Domtar Gypsum that was prosecuted before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 3} However, because Elsass was subsequently suspended from the practice of law, plaintiffs later retained attorneys Philip Collins and Douglas Jennings to represent plaintiffs before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in plaintiffs\u2019 suit against Domtar Gypsum.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 4} On or about August 19,1999, plaintiffs notified Collins and Jennings of an impending legal malpractice action against them. Reliance Insurance Company (\u201cReliance\u201d), Collins and Jennings\u2019s malpractice insurer, then retained the law firm of Reminger &amp; Reminger to defend Collins and Jennings. Attorney Nicholas D. Satullo of Reminger &amp; Reminger was designated to represent Collins and Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 5} On November 30, 1999, on behalf of plaintiffs, attorney D. Joe Griffith sued Collins, Jennings, and others for legal malpractice. Because Satullo represented attorneys Collins and Jennings, Collins and Jennings forwarded to Satullo plaintiffs\u2019 Domtar Gypsum case file for use in Collins and Jennings\u2019 defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">{\u00b6 6} According to plaintiffs, during discovery in plaintiffs\u2019 legal malpractice action against attorneys Collins and Jennings, Griffith, on several occasions, requested Satullo to send the original case file pertaining to the Domtar Gypsum case. In January 2000, Satullo forwarded a copy of the Domtar Gypsum case file to Griffith. Satullo kept the original Domtar Gypsum case file, which Satullo had received from attorneys Collins and Jennings.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 7} Upon inspection of the copied case file that Satullo sent to Griffith, plaintiffs discovered a copy of their entire Star Bank credit file, which allegedly consisted of more than 400 pages of private and confidential documents and which plaintiffs claim should not have been included in the Domtar Gypsum case file, was included in the copied Domtar Gypsum case file that Satullo sent to Griffith.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">{\u00b6 8} Subsequently, plaintiffs retrieved from Elsass the ease file pertaining to the Star Bank litigation in which plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file was the subject of litigation. After reviewing the case file, plaintiffs discovered that the case file was complete, except for the missing bank credit file.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>{\u00b6 9} On or about April 5, 2000, attorney Griffith sent a copy of the Domtar Gypsum case file to attorney Satullo in exchange for the original file.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Affidavit of D. Joe Griffith dated August 20, 2002, at paragraph 16.) Prior to forwarding a copy of the Domtar Gypsum case file, attorney Griffith removed copies of the Hahns\u2019 TRW credit report, tax returns, loan applications, and updated financial statements because Griffith believed that defendants were not entitled to these documents. (See letter dated April 5, 2000, from attorney Griffith to attorney Satullo; Griffith affidavit dated August 20, 2002, at paragraph 16.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 10} Later, on April 12, 2000, plaintiffs moved for a protective order and requested return of the original Domtar Gypsum case file and the entire Star Bank credit file. On June 30, 2000, the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 11} According to plaintiffs, after the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a protective order, Satullo returned only portions of the disputed file to plaintiffs. (Affidavit of D. Joe Griffith dated August 20, 2002, at paragraphs 20 and 21.) Moreover, according to plaintiffs, the portions of the file that Satullo returned contained some of the pages that attorney Griffith had removed prior to sending Satullo the copied Domtar Gypsum case file on or about April 5, 2000, thereby suggesting that Satullo made copies of plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file despite Griffith\u2019s request not to do so. (Griffith affidavit dated August 20, 2002, at paragraph 22; letter dated March 9, 2000, from attorney Griffith to attorney Satullo.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 12} Furthermore, according to plaintiffs, after Satullo forwarded to Griffith the original Domtar Gypsum ease file that included plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file, at Satullo\u2019s request, Griffith then forwarded to Satullo a copy of the Domtar Gypsum case file and a copy of the bank credit file. (Complaint, at paragraph 21.) According to plaintiffs, Satullo claimed that the Star Bank credit file was part of the case file pertaining to the Domtar Gypsum case, and Satullo claimed that he was entitled to these documents. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 13} Defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger dispute plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that they returned only a portion of the Domtar Gypsum case file.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>Defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger also dispute plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that after Satullo forwarded to Griffith the original Domtar Gypsum case file, at Satullo\u2019s request, Griffith then forwarded to Satullo a copy of the Domtar Gypsum case file and a copy of the bank credit file.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 14} On July 26, 2001, plaintiffs filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, wherein plaintiffs alleged that attorney Nicholas Satullo violated the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d), Section 1601, Title 15, U.S.Code et seq.; Satullo without plaintiffs\u2019 authorization reviewed and disclosed plaintiffs\u2019 income tax returns; Satullo without plaintiffs\u2019 authorization used and disclosed plaintiffs\u2019 Social Security numbers; and Satullo invaded plaintiffs\u2019 privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 15} Plaintiffs theorized in their complaint that, at some point, Elsass transferred plaintiffs\u2019 entire bank credit file to attorneys Collins and Jennings for Collins and Jennings\u2019s use in defense of plaintiffs\u2019 legal malpractice action against Collins and Jennings. (Complaint at paragraph 11.) Defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger deny this allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 16} On September 27, 2001, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(C), defendants Satullo and Reminger <em>&amp; </em>Reminger moved for judgment on the pleadings. On October 4, 2001, plaintiffs moved for a protective order, wherein plaintiffs alleged that defendants Satullo and Reminger <em>&amp; </em>Reminger failed to comply with the court\u2019s protective order in the legal malpractice case that ordered the return of plaintiffs\u2019 financial information to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 17} On November 14, 2001, the trial court denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion of October 4, 2001, for a protective order. In denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the trial court observed that \u201c[r]ather than asking for protection against discovery sought in this case, the motion asks for return of documents provided in discovery in another case. That is not the purpose of a Civil Rule 26(C) motion for protective order.\u201d (Entry dated November 14, 2001.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 18} In its entry of November 14, 2001, the trial court also recognized a Pennsylvania court\u2019s order that liquidated Reliance Insurance Company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>stayed pending actions against Reliance. Accordingly, the trial court bifurcated the case by separating and staying plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 19} On April 16, 2002, the trial court partially granted defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims pertaining to unauthorized review and disclosure of income tax returns and Social Security numbers.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 20} Defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger later moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 21} On December 16, 2002, finding that Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger did not violate the FCRA or invade plaintiffs\u2019 privacy, the trial court partially granted Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court denied Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s summary judgment motion \u201cas to whether there has been an invasion of privacy by an alleged retention of in excess of 300 pages of the credit file, or alternatively, as to whether Defendants\u2019 conduct after the Court order is protected by an attorney\u2019s absolute or qualified privilege.\u201d (Decision and Entry filed December 16, 2002, at 9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b622} Subsequently, both plaintiffs and defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger moved the trial court to reconsider its decision of December 16, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 23} On January 15, 2003, upon reconsideration, the trial court granted Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s motion for reconsideration and also granted summary judgment in favor of defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger as to all plaintiffs\u2019 claims. In its decision and entry, the trial court \u201c[held] that an attorney\u2019s failure to return documents to an opposing party after being ordered to do so by a court, whether or not intending to violate the court order, is conduct that is \u2018reasonably related\u2019 to the litigation. Hence, absolute immunity applies in this case to bar Plaintiffs [sic] invasion of privacy claim.\u201d (Decision and Entry filed January 15, 2003, at 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 24} On February 18, 2003, plaintiffs appealed from the trial court\u2019s entries of April 16, 2002, December 16, 2002, and January 15, 2003. This court sua sponte dismissed the appeal for lack of a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">{\u00b6 25} On March 18, 2003, after the trial court journalized a final order, plaintiffs again appealed. Defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">{\u00b6 26} Pursuant to Loc.R. 9(D) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals, defendant Satullo moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 appeal for failure to timely file a brief and assignments of error. This court denied Satullo\u2019s motion to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>{\u00b6 27} On June 2, 2003, plaintiffs moved to strike Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s cross-appeal due to an alleged violation of App.R. 3(C)(1), which provides that a party that intends to defend a judgment and that seeks to change that judgment shall file a notice of cross-appeal within the time allowed by App.R. 4. Additionally, in a reply memorandum, plaintiffs also alleged that defendants violated Loc.R. 7(E) of the Tenth District Court of Appeals, which requires the attachment of unpublished opinions to briefs filed in this court. However, in their reply memorandum, plaintiffs admitted that after much effort, they obtained copies of the unpublished opinions that plaintiffs claim were not attached to defendants\u2019 brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 28} App.R. 3(C)(2) provides that \u201c[a] person who intends to defend a judgment or order appealed by an appellant on a ground other than that relied on by the trial court but who does not seek to change the judgment or order is not required to file a notice of cross appeal.\u201d Here, defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger seek to defend the trial court\u2019s judgment, although they seek to change some of the reasons underlying the trial court\u2019s judgment. Therefore, pursuant to App.R. 3(C)(2), we conclude that defendants are not required to file a notice of cross-appeal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 29} Furthermore, because after much effort plaintiffs obtained the unpublished opinions that they allege were not attached to defendants\u2019 brief, we find substantial prejudice did not result, and we do not find that plaintiffs\u2019 allegation related to Loc.R. 7(E) is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike is denied. However, we remind the parties that they carefully should follow the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure and this court\u2019s local rules for the purpose of promoting the administration of justice and eliminating undue delay.

Civ.R. 1(B); Crim.R. 1(B); Evid.R. 102; Juv.R. 1(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 31} In their appeal, plaintiffs assert six assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUX\">\u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 1: The Trial Court Erred as a Matter of Law in the Judgment Entry, Dated April 16, 2002, * * * in Finding That the Court Could Not Hear a Separate Cause of Action Pursuant to O.R.C. \u00a7 5747.18.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-9\">\u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 2: The Trial Court Erred as a Matter of Law in the Judgment Entry, Dated December 16, 2002 * * * In Granting Summary Judgments to Defendants in Finding That Defendants did not Wrongfully Obtain or Use Plaintiffs\u2019 Credit Report in Violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681b(f), When the Evidence Presents Genuine Issues of Material Fact as to Defendants\u2019 Receipt and Use of Plaintiffs\u2019 Credit Report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>\u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 3: The Trial Court Erred in the Judgment Entry, Dated December 16, 2002 * * * In Granting Summary Judgment to Defendants As to \u201cWhether Defendants Invaded Plaintiffs\u2019 Privacy By Then-Conduct Prior To Their Return of 89 Pages Of The Credit File.\u2019 \u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 4: The Trial Court Erred in the Judgment Entry, Dated January 15, 2003 * * * in Granting Summary Judgment and Absolute Immunity to Defendants For Their Intentional or Unintentional Violation of a Court Order Thus Barring Plaintiffs\u2019 Invasion of Privacy Claim. \u201cASSIGNMENT OF ERROR NO. 5: The Trial Court Erred in the Judgment Entries Dated December 16, 2002 and January 15, 2003 * * * in Granting Summary Judgment to Defendants By Weighing The Evidence in Favor of Defendants and Deciding the Credibility of Affiants, D.

Fairmount Presbyterian Church, </em>149 Ohio App.3d 769, 2002-Ohio-5833, 778 N.E.2d 1093, at \u00b6 27. \u201c <em>\u2018Be novo </em>review means that this court uses the same standard that the trial court should have used, and we examine the evidence to determine whether as a matter of law no genuine issues exist for trial.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Brewer v. Cleveland City Schools Bd. of Edn. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 378, 701 N.E.2d 1023, citing <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal Co., Inc. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 116, 119-120, 18 O.O.3d 354, 413 N.E.2d 1187, certiorari denied (1981), 452 U.S. 962, 101 S.Ct. 3111, 69 L.Ed.2d 973. Summary judgment is proper when a movant for summary judgment demonstrates that (1) no genuine issue of material fact exists; (2) the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) reasonable minds could come to but one conclusion and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>judgment is made, that party being entitled to have the evidence most strongly construed in its favor. Civ.R. 56; <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 34} Under Civ.R. 56(C), a movant bears the initial burden of informing the trial court of the basis for the motion and identifying those portions of the record demonstrating the absence of a material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once a movant discharges its initial burden, summary judgment is appropriate if the nonmoving party does not respond, by affidavit or as otherwise provided in Civ.R. 56, with specific facts showing that a genuine issue exists for trial. <em>Dresher, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 293, 662 N.E.2d 264; <em>Vahila v.

Only disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary judgment. Factual disputes that are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.\u201d <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc. </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202.

This section does not prohibit the publication of statistics in a form which does not disclose information with respect to individual taxpayers.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe primary duty of a court in construing a statute is to give effect to the intention of the legislature enacting it. In determining that intention, a court should consider the language used and the apparent purpose to be accomplished, and then such a construction should be adopted which permits the statute and its various parts to be construed as a whole and gives effect to the paramount object to be attained.\u201d <em>Humphrys v. Winous Co. </em>(1956), 165 Ohio St. 45, 49, 59 O.O. 65, 133 N.E.2d 780, citing <em>Cochrel v. Robinson </em>(1925), 113 Ohio St. 526, 149 N.E. 871. Moreover, \u201c[i]n reviewing a statute, a court cannot pick out one sentence and disassociate it from the context, but must look to the four corners of the enactment to determine the intent of the enacting body.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 334, 336, 673 N.E.2d 1347, citing <em>MacDonald v. Bernard </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 85, 89, 438 N.E.2d 410.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 39} Plaintiffs contend that R.C. 5747.18(C) provides plaintiffs with a cause of action against defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger based on Satullo\u2019s alleged disclosure of plaintiffs\u2019 state income tax returns and Social Security numbers. Specifically, in support of their contention, plaintiffs rely upon the following excerpt from R.C. 5747.18(C): \u201c[N]o person shall disclose such information, except for official purposes, or as provided by section 3125.43, 4123.591, 4507.023, or 5101.182, division (B) of section 5703.21 of the Revised Code, or in accordance with a proper judicial order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 40} When construing a statute, the primary duty of the court is to give effect to the intention of the General Assembly. <em>Humphrys, </em>165 Ohio St. at 49, 59 O.O. 65, 133 N.E.2d 780; <em>Wilson, </em>77 Ohio St.3d at 336, 673 N.E.2d 1347. Based upon the express language of R.C. 5747.18, the intention of the General Assembly in enacting R.C. 5747.18 was to provide the Tax Commissioner with enforcement and administration authority for R.C. Chapter 5747. See R.C. 5747.18 (\u201cThe tax commissioner shall enforce and administer this chapter.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 41} To this end, R.C. 5747.18(C) allows the Tax Commissioner to appoint personnel to assist him or her with the duties imposed by R.C. Chapter 5747, such as reviewing tax returns, and conducting investigations, hearings, or verifications.

Chapter 5747. To adopt plaintiffs\u2019 construction of R.C. 5747.18 would impermissibly disassociate R.C. 5747.18(C) from its context and impermissibly invite piecemeal interpretation of R.C. 5747.18.

Nor does the record contain evidence that the trial court conducted an in camera inspection of plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file. Thus, absent a copy of plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file, it cannot be determined whether plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file, or any portion of plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file, properly can be considered a \u201cconsumer report\u201d as this term is defined in Section 1681a(d) of the FCRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 50} Therefore, absent any evidence in the record that plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file, or any portion of plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file, properly can be considered a \u201cconsumer report\u201d as this term is defined in the FCRA, we find that plaintiffs have not met their burden in proving a violation of the FCRA.

Despite defendants Satullo and Reminger <em>&amp; </em>Reminger\u2019s admission, we do not find that employing a professional copying company to reproduce the Domtar Gypsum case file before defendant Satullo forwarded the copied case file to attorney Griffith constitutes a \u201cwrongful intrusion into one\u2019s private activities in such a manner as to outrage or cause mental suffering, shame or humiliation to a person of ordinary sensibilities.\u201d <em>Housh, </em>supra, at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 62} Moreover, construing the evidence in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, and even assuming that defendants Satullo utilized information contained in plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file as plaintiffs contend,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> plaintiffs failed to show malice to prevent application of qualified immunity as a bar to plaintiffs\u2019 invasion-of-privacy claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 63} In <em>Scholler v. Scholler </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 98, 10 OBR 426, 462 N.E.2d 158, the Ohio Supreme Court considered whether a mother on behalf of her son may maintain an action against the mother\u2019s former attorney in malpractice even though the son was a third party to the attorney-client relationship that existed between the mother\u2019s former attorney and mother. Id., 10 Ohio St.3d at 102-104, 10 OBR 426, 462 N.E.2d 158. The <em>Scholler </em>court held that \u201c[a]n attorney is immune from liability to third persons arising from his performance as an attorney in good faith on behalf of, and with the knowledge of his client, unless such third person is in privity with the client or the attorney acts maliciously.\u201d Id. at paragraph one of the syllabus. See <em>Simon v.

See, also, <em>Elam v.

As was stated by the court in <em>W.D.G., Inc. [v. Mut.

To allow indiscriminate third-party actions against attorneys of necessity would create a conflict of interest at all times, so that the attorney might well be reluctant to offer proper representation to his client in fear of some third-party action against the attorney himself.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 399-400.\u201d Id., 32 Ohio St.3d at 76, 512 N.E.2d 636.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 65} Here, we conclude that, at the time of the alleged disclosure, plaintiffs were not in privity with defendant Satullo\u2019s clients, plaintiffs\u2019 former attorneys against whom plaintiffs brought suit. See, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7th Ed.1999) 1217 (defining \u201cprivity\u201d as \u201c[t]he connection or relationship between two parties, each having a legally recognized interest in the same subject matter * * *\u201d). See, also, <em>Arpadi v. First MSP Corp. </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 453, 628 N.E.2d 1335, paragraph three <em>of the </em>syllabus (holding that \u201c[t]hose persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed are in privity with the fiduciary such that an attorney-client relationship established with the fiduciary extends to those in privity therewith regarding matters to which the fiduciary duty relates\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 66} Thus, absent a finding of privity, the issue resolves to whether defendant Satullo or defendant Reminger <em>&amp; </em>Reminger acted maliciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 67} As observed in <em>Luciani v. Schiavone </em>(Jan. 2, 2001), S.D. Ohio No. C-l-97-272, 2001 WL 1842457:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">\u201c* * * Ohio courts have provided precious little guidance in the interpretation of the maliciousness requirement of <em>Scholler </em>and similar cases. Two Ohio appellate courts have opined that an attorney may act maliciously when he acts with an ulterior motive separate and apart from his client\u2019s interests. <em>See Thompson v. R &amp; R Service Systems, Inc., </em>Nos. 96APE10-1277, 96APE10-1278, 1997 WL 359325, (Ohio Ct.App. Franklin Cty. June 19, 1997); <em>Fallang v.

Moreover, although the parties dispute whether defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger used plaintiffs\u2019 confidential bank records during litigation, we do not find evidence to support a contention that Satullo or Reminger &amp; Reminger <em>maliciously </em>used the information from plaintiffs\u2019 bank credit file as plaintiffs contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 69} Thus, absent any evidence of malice, we find that nothing prohibits application of qualified immunity to bar plaintiffs\u2019 claim of invasion of privacy. See first assignment of error on cross-appeal (arguing in favor of qualified immunity from plaintiffs\u2019 claim of invasion of privacy).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 70} Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 third assignment of error is overruled. Defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s first assignment of error on cross-appeal is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b6 71} Plaintiffs\u2019 fourth assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment and absolute immunity to defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger for \u201ctheir intentional or unintentional violation of a court order thus barring plaintiffs\u2019 invasion of privacy claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 72} Here, having previously found that plaintiffs\u2019 invasion of privacy claim is without merit and that qualified immunity pursuant to <em>Scholler, </em>supra, bars plaintiffs\u2019 invasion of privacy claim, even if the trial court incorrectly determined that absolute immunity applied, we find that such an error by the trial court related to its application of absolute immunity is harmless. See Civ.R. 61 (harmless error).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">{\u00b6 73} Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-12\">{\u00b6 74} Plaintiffs\u2019 fifth assignment of error asserts that the trial court in its decisions of December 16, 2002, and January 15, 2003, improperly weighed the evidence in favor of defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">{\u00b6 75} Based on our own independent review, we have already concluded that, as a matter of law, plaintiffs failed to meet their burden in support of their FCRA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>claim and plaintiffs\u2019 claim of invasion of privacy is without merit. Therefore, plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the trial court improperly weighed evidence in favor of defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger is not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 76} Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 77} Plaintiffs\u2019 sixth assignment of error asserts that the trial court deprived plaintiffs of due process in granting absolute immunity in favor of defendants Satullo and Reminger <em>&amp; </em>Reminger.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 78} In denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a second protective order, the trial court observed that \u201c[r]ather than asking for protection against discovery sought in this case, the motion asks for return of documents provided in discovery in another case. That is not the purpose of a Civil Rule 26(C) motion for protective order.\u201d (Entry dated November 14, 2001.)</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 79} \u201cA trial court has broad discretion to regulate discovery proceedings. * * * This discretion extends to the issuance of protective orders made pursuant to Civ.R. 26(C). * * * Absent an abuse of discretion, an appellate court must affirm a trial court\u2019s disposition of discovery issues. * * * An abuse of discretion connotes an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable decision.\u201d <em>Van-American Ins.

Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">{\u00b6 82} Furthermore, we find no due process violation as plaintiffs claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-13\">{\u00b6 83} \u201c[T]o establish a procedural due process violation, it must be shown that the conduct complained of deprived plaintiff of a liberty or property interest without adequate procedural safeguards. * * * As such, it is not the deprivation itself that is actionable, it is the deprivation without due process of law.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Madison Twp. </em>(Nov. 25, 1997), Franklin App. No. 97APE06-819, 1997 WL 746415, dismissed, appeal not allowed (1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 1495, 691 N.E.2d 1057.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-14\">{\u00b6 84} Here, evidence in the record supports a finding that plaintiffs were provided with an opportunity to litigate their case and that the trial court afforded adequate procedural safeguards to plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>{\u00b6 85} Accordingly, plaintiffs\u2019 sixth assignment of error is not persuasive and is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 86} Consequently, (1) having denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike defendants Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s cross-appeal; (2) having overruled all of plaintiffs\u2019 assignments of error; (3) having sustained defendants Satullo and Reminger <em>&amp; </em>Reminger\u2019s first assignment of error on cross-appeal; (4) having found that defendant Satullo and Reminger &amp; Reminger\u2019s second assignment of error on cross-appeal is moot; and (5) construing the evidence most strongly in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, we therefore find, as a matter of law, that the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 87} Because we find no reversible error, we hereby affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, although we affirm for different reasons than did the trial court. See <em>Phillips v. Dayton Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(1994), 93 Ohio App.3d 111, 115, 637 N.E.2d 963 (\u201cSince the reviewing court must independently determine, as a matter of law, whether summary judgment was properly rendered based upon the record made up in the trial court, it is legally immaterial whether the trial court has provided a sound analysis, or any analysis. A summary judgment based on a legally erroneous analysis of the issues must be affirmed if the appellate court independently determines that upon the record summary judgment should have been rendered as a matter of law, albeit for different reasons.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Motion to strike cross-appeal denied and judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b468-9\">Peggy Bryant and Watson, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\">.
