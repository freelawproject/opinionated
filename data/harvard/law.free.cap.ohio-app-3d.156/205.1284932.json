Groves appeals from his conviction and sentence for possession of crack cocaine, following a no-contest plea. Groves contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence, because the evidence was seized as a result of an illegal search by the police officer. We conclude that the state failed to meet its burden in establishing that the police officer had probable cause to seize the crack cocaine from Groves\u2019s sock during a patdown, because the police officer only \u201csuspected\u201d that the hard object in Groves\u2019s sock was crack cocaine. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in overruling Groves\u2019s motion to suppress. Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b242-13\">{\u00b6 2} On the evening of September 18, 2002, Officer Cromartie and Officer Pasquale were patrolling the area around Parkside Homes, an apartment community that is a part of the Dayton Metropolitan Housing Authority. Officer Cromartie observed a traffic violation when a vehicle made a turn without signaling. The vehicle then pulled into the apartment community and parked. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Officer Cromartie activated his overhead lights and approached the driver of the vehicle. When the driver of the vehicle explained that he did not have his driver\u2019s license, he was asked to step out of the vehicle. The driver was then patted down and placed in the police cruiser by Officer Cromartie.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">{\u00b6 3} Officer Pasquale gathered identification information from the remaining two passengers in the vehicle, including Jason Groves. After running the information through the computer, it was discovered that both passengers had a field interview card (\u201cFIC\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> indicating drug histories and weapons violations. Officer Cromartie called for assistance, and Officer Eversole responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">{\u00b6 4} Officer Cromartie informed Officer Eversole that the passengers had exited the vehicle and that the passengers had FICs indicating drug histories and weapons violations. Officer Eversole approached the passengers and conducted a patdown search of each passenger. Officer Eversole felt a hard object in Groves\u2019s sock and then retrieved his flashlight to illuminate the hard object. Officer Eversole then asked Groves what the hard object was, and Groves responded that he did not know. Officer Eversole retrieved the hard object from Groves\u2019s sock and discovered a white chunky substance in a plastic cellophane baggy. Officer Eversole placed Groves in handcuffs and in his police cruiser and then tested the substance, which tested positive as a cocaine derivative. Officer Eversole advised Groves of his rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694. While being read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Groves made several incriminating statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">{\u00b6 5} Groves was indicted on one count of possession of crack cocaine in an amount less than one gram, in violation of R.C. 2925.11(A). Thereafter, Groves filed a motion to suppress evidence. After a hearing, the trial court overruled Groves\u2019s motion to suppress, concluding that the evidence was seized as the result of a lawful search by the police. Groves then entered a plea of no-contest, was found guilty, and was subsequently sentenced to five years of community control sanctions. Groves was also assessed court costs and a supervision fine.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">{\u00b6 6} From his conviction and sentence, Groves appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">{\u00b6 7} Groves\u2019s sole assignment of error is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe trial court erred by overruling Mr. Groves\u2019 motion to suppress the evidence recovered as a result of the police illegally seizing and searching him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>{\u00b6 9} Groves contends that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to suppress, because the evidence seized by the police officer was the result of an illegal search. Groves contends that Officer John W. Eversole did not have probable cause to seize the crack cocaine from Groves\u2019s sock during his patdown.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b6 10} The state argues that Officer Eversole conducted a lawful search and seizure of the crack cocaine pursuant to the \u201cplain feel\u201d exception to the warrant requirement of the Fourth Amendment. The state also argues that Officer Eversole did have probable cause to seize the crack cocaine from Groves\u2019s sock based on Officer Eversole\u2019s training and experience, the reputation of the area, and Groves\u2019s FIC indicating a drug history and weapons violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Lander </em>(Jan. 21, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 17898, 2000 WL 43708, at * 4, we stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cFor purposes of analysis, therefore, we will assume that an object coming within a police officer\u2019s plain feel during a proper pat-down frisk for weapons may be seized if the officer has probable cause to believe that the item is contraband before seizing it. In the case before us, Officer House testified that he could feel a small, hard object in the lower corner of Lander\u2019s coat pocket when he was patting it down for weapons. In order to reach a conclusion that this object was a piece of crack cocaine, the State necessarily relies upon Officer House\u2019s training and experience with respect to crack cocaine, which appears to have been extensive. Significantly, Officer House made no claim that he had probable cause to believe that the object was crack cocaine. On each of the two occasions when he covered this point in his testimony, he used the word \u2018suspected\u2019 to describe his conclusion, clearly indicating that his conclusion that the object might be crack cocaine was merely a suspicion, rather than probable cause to believe, that the object was crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cPerhaps, if Officer House had been asked whether he had concluded that the object was more likely than not crack cocaine, he would have responded in the affirmative. He was never asked that question. Because this was a warrantless seizure, the State had the burden of proof on this issue, and the State failed to establish that Officer House had probable cause to believe that the object he felt was crack cocaine when he removed it from her coat pocket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">{\u00b6 14} We reach the same conclusion in the case before us. At the hearing, Officer Eversole testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cQ. Now, as a result of doing a pat down search for your safety on defendant Jason Groves, can you tell us what, if anything, you determined?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cA. Yes, I can. Um, after my contact with Mr. Rembers, with meeting negative results with him, Mr. Groves was still proned out [sic] actually on the trash can facing away from me. I worked my way from the top to the bottom, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>and as I approached his left ankle area, as I was bringing my hands down like this (indicating) across the left ankle area, I noted that he, um, had his\u2014 he was wearing gray sweat pants, and they were pulled up above his calf area, and he was wearing white tubular-type socks.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cUm, as I brought my \u2014 hand down, particularly my right hand, I brushed across a, um, a hard object. Um, I, um, I \u2014 after I felt the object, I retrieved my flashlight, which I carry on my duty belt, and shined it on there just to get a better illumination of it to see what I was actually looking at, and I could see a \u2014 an object protruding from the sock, um, to the right side of his \u2014 right side of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cI asked Mr. Groves what that was, and he indicated to me that he didn\u2019t know. I, uh, I suspected it to be crack cocaine. I have had prior dealings with crack cocaine being hid in socks as well as shoes. Um, based on that, this object was retrieved by me, and I did note it to be a white chunky substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cQ. Okay. And, um, you took the item out of the sock; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cA. That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">{\u00b6 22} On cross-examination, Officer Eversole also testified as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cQ. And you said as you got towards the bottom, you made a movement like this (indicating). You said you felt something down at the bottom?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA. That\u2019s correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cQ. Fair to say it was a small bulge?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cA. It was noticeable enough \u2014 it wasn\u2019t the largest of bulges, but it was noticeable enough that it was jagged in nature, and I felt it plainly as I was coming down his leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-15\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cQ. Okay. About \u2014 approximately how much, either based on your investigation or afterwards, how much crack cocaine was there?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-16\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cA. I believe the \u2014 the weight we had weighed it at was point eight five grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-17\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cQ. Less than a gram?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-18\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cA. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-19\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cQ. Size-wise, what would that look like \u2014 the size of a pea or\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b245-20\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cA. Um, a pea would be \u2014 it was \u2014 it would be small.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-21\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b245-22\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cQ. Would it be fair to say that it was apparent that that was not a weapon of any kind?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>{\u00b6 35} \u201cA. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cQ. And you said to get a better idea of what it may be, you pulled out your flashlight and illuminated that area?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cA. That is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cQ. And then after that, to further try to figure out what it was, you asked Mr. Groves what it was?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cA. I did.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cQ. And he said he did not know?</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cA. That is correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">{\u00b6 42} Officer Eversole conceded that it was apparent to him that the hard object in Groves\u2019s sock was not a weapon. However, \u201ca police officer conducting a pat-down frisk for weapons is permitted to retrieve any contraband that he feels during the course of the frisk, so long as its nature as contraband is immediately apparent through the officer\u2019s sense of touch.\u201d <em>State v. Lander </em>(Jan. 21, 2000), Montgomery App. No. 17898, 2000 WL 43708, at * 4, citing <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334. \u201cRegardless of whether the officer detects the contraband by sight or by touch, however, the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement that the officer have probable cause to believe that the item is contraband before seizing it ensures against successfully speculative seizures.\u201d Id., citing <em>Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. at 376, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">{\u00b6 43} Officer Eversole clearly stated that he \u201csuspected\u201d that the hard object was crack cocaine. Significantly, as in <em>Lander, </em>supra, Officer Eversole did not claim that he had probable cause to believe that the hard object in Groves\u2019s sock was crack cocaine. Officer Eversole\u2019s use of the word \u201csuspected\u201d indicates that Officer Eversole\u2019s conclusion that the hard object in Groves\u2019s sock might be crack cocaine was merely a suspicion, rather than probable cause to believe, that the hard object was crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">{\u00b6 44} Perhaps if Officer Eversole had been asked whether he had concluded that the hard object was more likely than not crack cocaine, he would have responded in the affirmative. Officer Eversole was never asked that question. Because this was a warrantless seizure, the state had the burden of proof on this issue. We conclude that the state failed to establish that Officer Eversole had probable cause to believe that the hard object he felt was crack cocaine when he removed it from Groves\u2019s sock. As a result of our conclusion, we need not reach the other arguments raised by Groves. Although the state argues that Officer Eversole was authorized to seize the crack cocaine because Groves consented to the patdown, the Fourth Amendment still requires that the officer have probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>cause to believe that the object felt during a proper patdown is contraband. See <em>Lander, </em>2000 WL 43708, at * 4, citing <em>Dickerson, </em>supra. Groves\u2019s consent to a pat-down search for safety did not extend to a consent to have items seized from his person on less than probable cause. We have previously concluded that the state failed to establish that Officer Eversole had probable cause to believe that the hard object he felt was crack cocaine when he removed it from Groves\u2019s sock.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">{\u00b6 45} We conclude that the trial court erred in overruling Groves\u2019s motion to suppress. Groves\u2019s sole assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">{\u00b6 46} Groves\u2019s sole assignment of error having been sustained, the judgment of the trial court is reversed. This cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-9\">Brogan and Wolff, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-12\">.
