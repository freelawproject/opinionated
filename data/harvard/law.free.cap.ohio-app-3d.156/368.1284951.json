Kilbane, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b405-17\">{\u00b6 1} This is an appeal and cross-appeal from a judgment entered by Judge Thomas J. Pokorny after a $560,443.02 jury verdict in favor of the appellees and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>cross-appellants Association of Cleveland Fire Fighters, Local 93 of the International Association Fire Fighters (\u201cunion\u201d), Eugene J. Carroll, Michael A. Darnell, David McNeilly, Robert S. Schindler, and Paul A. Stubbs<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (all plaintiffs collectively, \u201cAsst. Chiefs\u201d), and against the appellant/cross appellee, city of Cleveland. The award reflected back wages owed to assistant fire chiefs who had been improperly excluded from the union\u2019s bargaining unit. The city claims, among other things, that the judge had no subject-matter jurisdiction because the Asst. Chiefs\u2019 claim concerned an issue within the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Employment Relations Board (\u201cSERB\u201d). In its cross-appeal, the Asst. Chiefs claim that the judge erred in failing to amend the current collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) to include a 32 percent differential between those holding the rank of assistant chief and those holding the next lower rank, battalion chief, and in denying their request for attorney fees. We reverse the judgment and dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">{\u00b6 2} The union represented the assistant chiefs as part of the CBA bargaining unit until 1987, when an arbitrator ruled that officers of that rank should be excluded. Thereafter, the assistant chiefs were excluded from the CBA with the city from 1989 to 1998.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1996, however, SERB issued a ruling stating that it would not recognize changes to the bargaining unit that had not been accomplished through SERB\u2019S procedures. In 1998, the union filed a \u201cPetition for Clarification of Bargaining Unit\u201d and, on October 13, 1998, SERB issued a ruling that restored the assistant chiefs to the bargaining unit. In that action, however, the union did not seek back wages or the restoration of a wage differential.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">{\u00b6 3} In August 1999, the union and five individual assistant chiefs filed a complaint, and then an amended complaint, for declaratory judgment. In count one, they alleged that the wage differential between assistant chiefs and battalion chiefs had fallen to 12 percent after the assistant chiefs\u2019 wrongful removal from the bargaining unit and sought an order for back wages to restore the 32 percent differential for the time period in which the assistant chiefs had been excluded from the bargaining unit.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Count two was brought as a taxpayer\u2019s action<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with the same allegations and relief sought as count one, but it also sought attorney fees under R.C. 733.61. The complaint also contained a general plea for \u201cany and all other relief that this Court is empowered to grant * * *.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">{\u00b6 5} The city moved to dismiss the complaint and argued that the common pleas judge lacked subject-matter jurisdiction because the action was under SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction. It also contended that the claim for back wages was barred by the doctrine of res judicata because it should have been raised in the initial SERB action to reinstate the assistant chiefs to the bargaining unit. The judge denied the motion and later also denied both the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its renewed motion for summary judgment. The case went to trial, and the jury returned a verdict awarding the Asst. Chiefs back wages of $560,443.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">{\u00b6 6} The request for restoration of the wage differential in the CBA then in effect was not submitted to the jury but was sought through a post-trial motion for directed verdict.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The union requested that the judge order that the current CBA be amended to include the 32 percent wage differential between assistant chiefs and battalion chiefs. The judge denied the motion, holding that he had no authority to order such an amendment. He also denied their post-trial motion for attorney fees because, among other things, he found that the action did not provide a substantial benefit to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">{\u00b6 7} The city asserts six assignments of error in its appeal of the jury verdict, and the Asst. Chiefs assert four assignments concerning the denial of their post-trial motions, all of which are included in an appendix to this opinion. We find it necessary, however, to address only the issues of subject-matter jurisdiction and standing raised in the city\u2019s first and second assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">{\u00b6 8} The city contends that the judge had no subject-matter jurisdiction over claims alleging unfair labor practices under R.C. 4117.11, because such claims are within SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Asst. Chiefs counter that their claims are not expressly covered by the provisions of R.C. 4117.11 and that SERB does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>not have exclusive jurisdiction over claims that are only \u201carguably\u201d covered by R.C. 4117.11.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They contend that their claims for back wages and restoration of the wage differential are based on a right stated in R.C. 4117.06, because the city violated R.C. 4117.06 when it removed them from the bargaining unit without SERB\u2019s approval. They also claim, however, that because R.C. 4117.11 does not expressly include such a violation within its definitions of unfair labor practices, SERB does not have exclusive jurisdiction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">{\u00b6 9} In <em>East Cleveland v. East Cleveland Firefighters Local 500, </em>supra, the Ohio Supreme Court limited SERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction in a case where the parties had reached an impasse in negotiating a new CBA and, under the terms of the CBA then in effect, had submitted their dispute to an arbitrator.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The court ruled that, despite the fact that the city\u2019s conduct arguably could be described as a \u201crefusal to bargain\u201d prohibited under R.C. 4117.11(A)(5), the dispute was not within the SERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. It stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c[Ejxclusive jurisdiction to resolve charges of unfair labor practices is vested in SERB in two general areas: (1) where one of the parties files charges with SERB alleging an unfair labor practice under R.C. 4117.11; or (2) a complaint brought before the court of common pleas alleges conduct that constitutes an unfair labor practice specifically enumerated in R.C. 4117.11, and the trial court therefore dismisses the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">{\u00b6 11} The court placed special emphasis on the fact that the case involved an arbitration proceeding contemplated by the CBA and undertaken according to its terms, and it also noted that such arbitration provisions were expressly approved in R.C. 4117.10(A).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because allowing SERB to exercise jurisdiction over the dispute would effectively eliminate arbitration of disputes from CBA negotiations, it concluded that SERB\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction was not intended to be extended to include the \u201carguable\u201d claim at issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">{\u00b6 12} This case does not involve CBA negotiations covered by another statutory provision but involves an allegation that the city unfairly eliminated the assistant chiefs from the CBA bargaining unit under R.C. 4117.06. The decision in <em>East Cleveland Firefighters, Local 500 </em>must be considered and placed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>perspective in light of its particular facts and in light of other eases concerning the scope of SERB\u2019S jurisdiction. In <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Capital City Lodge No. 9, </em>supra, the Ohio Supreme Court held that SERB has exclusive jurisdiction over matters within R.C. Chapter 4117 in its entirety, not simply over unfair labor practices claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That court also held that \u201cif a party asserts claims that arise from or depend on the collective bargaining rights created by R.C. Chapter 4117, the remedies provided in that chapter are exclusive.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">{\u00b6 13} The decision in <em>East Cleveland Firefighters, Local 500, </em>does not suggest that a common pleas judge should be allowed to exercise jurisdiction in any case in which the complaint does not specifically allege an unfair labor practice, and we do not read the latter opinion to include such a holding. Instead, the focus of the jurisdictional question should be on whether the complaint, properly interpreted, alleges a claim within SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Even though SERB does not have jurisdiction over any claim that is only \u201carguably\u201d cast as an unfair labor practice, it should have jurisdiction over any complaint in which it can be shown that, even under the liberal pleading standards of Civ.R. 8(F), relief can be obtained only by proving a violation of a right protected under R.C. Chapter 4117.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 14} Although the Asst. Chiefs argue that their claims are based on an independent right stated in' R.C. 4117.06, this argument does not escape the exclusive jurisdiction stated in <em>Franklin Cty. Law Enforcement Assn., </em>because the claimed right is within R.C. Chapter 4117. Moreover, R.C. 4117.06 does not appear to provide an independent cause of action; the improper removal of employees from a bargaining unit is enforceable against the employer as an unfair labor practice under R.C. 4117.11(A)(8) and 4117.11(B)(6). Because the complaint does not allege a right to recover independent of R.C. Chapter 4117, the Asst. Chiefs\u2019 claims are within SERB\u2019S exclusive jurisdiction. Therefore, it was error to fail to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The city\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">TAXPAYER\u2019S ACTION</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 15} The Asst. Chiefs also claim to have standing to pursue their complaint as a taxpayer\u2019s action under R.C. 733.59. Athough a taxpayer\u2019s action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>is not prohibited merely because its proponent asserts rights that would confer a private, as well as a public, benefit, the claim may not go forward if it asserts rights that confer solely private benefits.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Asst. Chiefs argue that they are vindicating public rights and conferring a public benefit by restoring the wage differential between them and battalion chiefs. This wage differential, they maintain, is necessary to provide an incentive for qualified candidates to seek the position of assistant chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 16} We do not find the claimed public benefit sufficient to maintain a taxpayer\u2019s suit because the Asst. Chiefs\u2019 \u201cincentive\u201d argument is not significant, especially when viewed in light of the private benefit sought. When a union or its members seek to vindicate their rights or the rights of other union members, the benefit sought to be conferred is private, and a taxpayer\u2019s suit will not be recognized.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Without a more significant public interest at stake,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the attempt to gain standing under R.C. 788.59 appears to be a pretext for the assertion of a private cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 17} The enforcement of private rights often confers a public benefit, but the ability to contemplate a public benefit does not translate every private action against a municipality into a taxpayer\u2019s suit under R.C. 733.59. The city has no duty to maintain a wage differential between different ranks of safety officers in order to create an incentive for qualified individuals to seek a higher rank; therefore, an individual could not seek imposition of a wage differential in order to provide such an incentive.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The city\u2019s duty with respect to the wage differential must arise from the CBA and the rules governing collective bargaining, which are private rights enforceable by the union members.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 18} Although there may be circumstances in which enforcement of collective bargaining duties rises to the level of a public right, those circumstances are not present here. There is no showing of a right enforceable outside the mechanisms of R.C. Chapter 4117 and, therefore, we find that the Asst. Chiefs have no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>standing to assert an action under R.C. 733.59. The city\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">{\u00b6 19} Because the judge had no subject-matter jurisdiction over the unfair labor practice claims and the Asst. Chiefs have no independent standing to bring a taxpayer\u2019s suit, the complaint should have been dismissed. The city\u2019s remaining assignments of error are moot,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> and the assignments of error in the plaintiffs\u2019 cross-appeal are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 20} The judgment is reversed, and the complaint is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Judgment reversed and complaint dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b411-8\">Colleen Conway Cooney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b411-9\">James J.

Sweeney, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AhmG\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">{\u00b6 21} I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion which reverses and dismisses this matter. I disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the complaint as stating a cause of action within the exclusive jurisdiction of SERB and the majority\u2019s determination to dismiss the taxpayer\u2019s action on its finding that the plaintiffs failed to sufficiently establish a \u201cpublic benefit,\u201d although the jury found otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-12\">{\u00b6 22} The Ohio Supreme Court has delineated only two distinct areas in which SERB possesses exclusive jurisdiction, the first being \u201cwhere one of the parties files charges with SERB alleging an unfair labor practice under R.C. 4117.11.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-13\">{\u00b6 23} Plaintiffs did not file an unfair labor practice with SERB concerning the matters that gave rise to this lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-14\">{\u00b6 24} The alternative area that vests SERB with exclusive jurisdiction is when \u201ca complaint brought before the court of common pleas alleges conduct that constitutes an unfair labor practice specifically enumerated in R.C. 4117.11.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-15\">{\u00b6 25} The city believes that the pleadings essentially allege unfair labor practices arising under R.C. 4117.11(A)(1), (2), (5), and (8). I do not find that those provisions correspond to plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Additionally, plaintiffs pursued this action against the city in their capacities as taxpayers, that is, a claim that is recognized both by statute and common law. <em>State ex rel. Citizens for a Better Portsmouth v. Sydnor </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 49, 572 N.E.2d 649.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>{\u00b6 26} Even if plaintiffs could have pursued an unfair labor practice in their capacity as employees essentially arising from the same set of facts, this does not in and of itself automatically foreclose a viable taxpayer claim.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In other words, these claims are not mutually exclusive such that the existence of one necessarily eliminates the potential for bringing the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 27} Last, I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis and determination to dismiss the taxpayer\u2019s action for the alleged lack of a \u201csubstantial benefit to the public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 28} In order to maintain a taxpayer\u2019s suit, \u201cit is only necessary to show that the action of the city, as alleged, was an abuse of corporate power and that this abuse is prejudicial and injurious to [plaintiffs\u2019] rights as a taxpayer and others of [their] class.\u201d <em>Brauer v. Cleveland </em>(1963), 119 Ohio App. 159, 164, 191 N.E.2d 847. For that reason, this court has further determined that it is not necessary for a plaintiff taxpayer to exhaust personal administrative remedies if such would not benefit the class represented. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 29} The Ohio Supreme Court has held that an action is properly categorized as a \u201ctaxpayer\u2019s action\u201d where the plaintiff is seeking to benefit the general public <em>\u201cregardless of any private or personal benefit\u201d </em>(emphasis added) that the plaintiff may receive. <em>White v. Cleveland </em>(1973), 34 Ohio St.2d 37, 63 O.O.2d 79, 295 N.E.2d 665. Therefore, it is inappropriate to focus solely upon the monetary damages sought in this action. Instead, we must discern from the claims whether plaintiffs as taxpayers sought to benefit the general public through this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 30} The city referred to <em>Cleveland ex rel. O\u2019Malley v. White, </em>148 Ohio App.3d 564, 2002-Ohio-3633, 774 N.E.2d 337, claiming that it is dispositive on the standing issue. However, in <em>O\u2019Malley, </em>this court concluded that no public right was involved based on its finding that \u201cthe city was in full compliance with the bidding process.\u201d Id., 148 Ohio App.3d 564, 2002-Ohio-3633, 774 N.E.2d 337, at \u00b6 42. In contrast, the majority in this case acknowledges that a public right is involved but then concludes that it is not substantial enough to maintain the taxpayer\u2019s action. I cannot agree, particularly in light of the jury\u2019s findings, unchallenged in this appeal, as set forth in their responses to jury interrogatory Nos. 4-6.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">{\u00b6 31} Furthermore, other courts have rejected the same argument advanced by the city herein where it was determined that the city\u2019s actions were deemed an abuse of corporate power. <em>Cincinnati ex rel. Simons v. Cincinnati </em>(1993), 86 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>Ohio App.3d 258, 265, 620 N.E.2d 940, distinguishing <em>State ex rel. Caspar v. Dayton </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 16, 558 N.E.2d 49, holding that a taxpayer\u2019s lawsuit \u201cbenefitted the city as a whole by protecting the integrity of the civil service system and ensuring its fairness\u201d despite personal benefit that enured to plaintiffs. Applying the law to the facts and findings in this case, I can only conclude that the trial court did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion to dismiss and for summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">{\u00b6 32} Based upon the foregoing, I believe that the trial court properly retained jurisdiction over this matter and find, as the jury ultimately did, that the plaintiffs established a public benefit sufficient to sustain the taxpayer\u2019s action. I would affirm the judgment of the trial court in these respects and proceed to address the remaining issues raised in the appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">APPELLANT\u2019S ASSIGNMENTS OF ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u201cI.
