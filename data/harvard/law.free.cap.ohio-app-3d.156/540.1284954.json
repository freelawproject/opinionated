Grendell, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 1} Richard Mahan, Bernard Profato, Raymond Gorby, Richard Dixon, George Kaniclides, and Robert Miller (together \u201cthe appellants\u201d) appeal from the March 17, 2003 judgment entry of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas granting Board of Trustees, Ohio Police &amp; Fire Pension Fund\u2019s (\u201cboard\u201d) motion for summary judgment. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the judgment of the trial court in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">{\u00b6 2} The appellants are all retired members of the Niles Police Department who retired between February 2000 and April 2002. Pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, the appellants received \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d payments prior to retirement. Throughout their careers, the appellants contributed a percentage of their salary, as well as a percentage of the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d payments, to the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund (the \u201cfund\u201d). Likewise, the city of Niles paid a percentage of each appellant\u2019s salary, as well as a percentage of the appellant\u2019s \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d payments, to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">{\u00b6 3} Upon the appellants\u2019 retirement, Niles submitted the requisite report of contributions to the board but failed to separately identify the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d contributions from the salary contributions of each of the appellants. Based on this information, the board calculated the appellant\u2019s interim payments, which are payments made while the fund determines the final payment. Eventually, the board received a proper report of contributions, identifying both the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d contributions and the salary contributions. Upon receipt of this information, the board revised its calculations, excluding the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d payments from the calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">{\u00b6 4} The board also determined that the appellants had received overpayments. The appellants were then notified that the board would be reducing their interim benefits and that the board would be seeking to recover the overpayments. The appellants filed a mandamus action in the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas, as required by R.C. 742.46, seeking a writ directing the fund to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u201crecalculate [the appellants\u2019] pension benefits by including the Retirement Incentive and paying [the appellants] all back amounts owed.\u201d The appellants claimed that the board should have included the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d in calculating their pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">{\u00b6 5} The appellants and the board filed motions for summary judgment. On March 17, 2003, the trial court denied the appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment while granting the board\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The trial court found that \u201cit is within the authority of [the board] to determine the components of their pension calculations. The [board] is making that determination in this particular instance. The Court finds that the evidence is not clear and convincing to support the use of this extraordinary remedy.\u201d Thus, the trial court dismissed the appellants\u2019 petition for mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 6} The appellants timely appealed and raise the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe trial court erred by denying [the appellants\u2019] motion for summary judgment, granting the motion for summary judgment filed by Respondent Fund, and dismissing the Petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 8} In their sole assignment of error, the appellants argue that those employees that elect to retire under R.C. 742.3716 are entitled to have terminal pay included in the calculation of pension. The appellants further claim that they retired under R.C. 742.3716 and that the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d constitutes terminal pay. Thus, appellants assert that the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d should have been included in calculating the appellants\u2019 pensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 9} Summary judgment is appropriate when there is \u201cno genuine issue as to any material fact [and] * * * reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion,\u201d which is adverse to the nonmoving party. Civ.R. 56(C). In reviewing a motion for summary judgment, the court must construe the evidence in favor of the nonmoving party. Id. Moreover, an appellate court conducts a de novo review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment. <em>Doe v. Shaffer </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 388, 390, 738 N.E.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIn order for a writ of mandamus to issue, it must be shown that there is a clear legal right to the relief prayed for, that there is a clear legal duty upon respondent to perform the requested action, and that the relator has no adequate remedy at law.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Ohio Assn. of Pub. School Emp./AFSCME, Local 4, AFL-CIO v. Batavia Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 191, 198, 729 N.E.2d 743. \u201cThe facts submitted and the proof produced must be plain, clear, and convincing before a court is justified\u201d in granting a writ of mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 161, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Since all parties agree that terminal pay should be included in the calculation of appellants\u2019 pension, the only issue is whether the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d payments constitute terminal pay such that appellants have a clear legal right to have the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d payments included in their pension calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 12} Pursuant to R.C. 742.3716(B)(1), an eligible person can elect to have his or her pension \u201ccalculated on the basis of the member\u2019s recalculated average annual salary rather than the member\u2019s average annual salary.\u201d In so electing, the person forgoes any cost-of-living allowance. R.C. 742.3716(B)(3). \u201c \u2018Recalculated average annual salary\u2019 means the highest average annual compensation of a member of the Ohio police and fire pension fund during any three years of contributions, <em>including amounts included in terminal pay </em>attributable to such three years.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 742.3716(A)(1)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 742.01(E)(2) defines \u201cterminal pay\u201d as \u201c[pjayments deferred more than one year compensating the employee for holidays worked or for longevity.\u201d \u201c \u2018Longevity\u2019 is a regular, recurring payment received by an employee based on a years-of-service schedule.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 742-3-02(B)(6). \u201cRecur\u201d is defined as \u201c[t]o occur or come up again or repeatedly.\u201d Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 14} The applicable collective bargaining agreements (\u201cCBA\u201d) provide for \u201cLongevity Pay\u201d based upon a schedule of service. Longevity pay \u201cshall be added to the employee\u2019s base hourly wage and after such addition, shall be undistinguished from the employee\u2019s base rate.\u201d The CBAs also provide for a separate \u201cRetirement Incentive,\u201d based upon the number of years in service and payable at the time of retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 15} At oral arguments, the appellants further argued that the definition of terminal pay, as contained in R.C. 742.01(E)(4), includes the \u201cRetirement Incentive.\u201d R.C. 742.01(E)(4) defines terminal pay as:</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cOther payments that are not compensation for services rendered in the last pay period in which services were rendered <em>'and </em>are designated as terminal pay by rule of the board of trustees of the Ohio police and fire pension fund. The board shall not designate as terminal pay payments deferred one year or less compensating an employee for holidays worked or for longevity.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">{\u00b6 17} In this case, the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d was not compensation for services rendered in the last pay period and was deferred for longer than a year and, thus, <em>could </em>be deemed terminal pay, but only if the board of trustees so designates. Id.; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Solomon v. Bd. of Trustees of the Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Disability &amp; Pension Fund </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 62, 64, 647 N.E.2d 486 (\u201cThe administration, control, and management of the fund is vested in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>board.\u201d). The record fails to indicate that the board of trustees has designated the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d as terminal pay. Thus, the definition of \u201cterminal pay\u201d contained in R.C. 742.01(E)(4) does not encompass the \u201cRetirement Incentive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 18} We find that, because the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d is not a regular, recurring payment, it is not compensation for longevity, as defined in Ohio Adm.Code 742-3-02(B)(6). Thus, pursuant to R.C. 742.01(E)(2), the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d is not terminal pay. Moreover, because there is no indication that the board has designated the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d as terminal pay, the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d does not fall within the parameters of R.C. 742.01(E)(4). Since the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d is not terminal pay, it is not to be included in the recalculated average annual salary and, thus, it should not be considered in calculating the appellants\u2019 pension. We, therefore, find that the trial court did not err in finding that the appellants did not clearly establish a legal right to have the \u201cRetirement Incentive\u201d included in their pension calculation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">{\u00b6 19} For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the appellants\u2019 sole assignment of error is without merit. The judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b580-8\">Judith A. Christley and Cynthia Westcott Rice, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-17\">. It must be noted that, in so finding, we do not express an opinion as to the merits of any potential collateral claim, if any, that the appellants may have against the board. Rather, our holding is limited to the conclusion that the appellants are not entitled to the extraordinary remedy of a writ of mandamus.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
