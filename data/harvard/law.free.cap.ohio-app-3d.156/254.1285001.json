For the following reasons, we reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 2} At trial, the parties agreed to a declaration of their rights under the policy based on the following stipulated facts: (1) that McKeehan was the designated beneficiary under the policy; (2) that on July 15, 2000, Marcus was riding in the bed of a pickup truck on an interstate highway when he \u201ccame out of the pickup truck and landed on the pavement of 1-71, resulting in his death\u201d; (3) that based on the toxicology report from the Montgomery County Coroner, Marcus had a blood-alcohol content (\u201cBAC\u201d) of .183 percent subsequent to his death; and (4) that AFLAC had denied coverage based on an exclusion that stated, \u201cWe will not pay benefits for an accident or [s]ickness that is caused by or occurs as a result of a covered person\u2019s: 1. [participating in any activity or event, including the operation of a vehicle * * * while intoxicated (\u2018intoxicated\u2019 means that condition as defined by the law of the jurisdiction in which the accident occurred).\u201d The record reveals that AFLAC had determined that Marcus was intoxicated, as defined by Ohio law, when he died, because his BAC was greater than .10, the presumptive limit of intoxication with respect to operating a motor vehicle as set forth in R.C. 4511.19(A)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under the policy, however, the terms \u201cactivity\u201d and \u201cevent\u201d were not defined.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 3} In her single assignment of error, McKeehan now contends that the trial court erred when it determined that Marcus was not covered under the policy at the time of his death. Specifically, McKeehan argues that the phrase \u201cparticipating in any activity or event\u201d and the term \u201cintoxicated,\u201d as contained in the exclusion used to deny coverage, were ambiguous and that their meanings had to be construed in favor of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 4} The words and phrases contained in an insurance policy must be given their plain and ordinary meaning unless there is something in the contract that would indicate a contrary intention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But when provisions of a contract are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation, they must be construed strictly against the insurer and liberally in favor of the insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, \u201c[t]he insurer, being the one who selects the language in the contract, must be specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>in its use; an exclusion from liability must be clear and exact in order to be given effect.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we interpret an exclusion in an insurance policy as only applying to that which is clearly intended to be excluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">{\u00b6 5} In support of her assignment, McKeehan first contends that AFLAC did not prove that Marcus was \u201cparticipating in any activity or event.\u201d We agree. The trial court, based on the stipulated facts, determined that the \u201cactivity\u201d in this case had been riding in the bed of a pickup truck.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court made that determination after defining \u201cactivity\u201d as \u201cthe state of being active\u201d or \u201can occupation or pursuit in which a person is active.\u201d But based on those definitions, we cannot see how merely being a passenger in a motor vehicle is a \u201cstate of being active.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">{\u00b6 6} We hold that the exclusion at issue was ambiguous because it was unclear what AFLAC intended to exclude by the term \u201cactivity.\u201d For example, there was no definition of \u201cactivity\u201d or \u201cevent\u201d in the policy. Further, Carol Elmore, a claims adjustor for AFLAC, testified that AFLAC had no set guidelines to assist adjustors in determining whether something was an \u201cactivity\u201d or \u201cevent\u201d for purposes of coverage. Elmore testified that each adjustor made that decision on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6 7} Because the term \u201cactivity\u201d was ambiguous, it had to be liberally construed in favor of the insured and, thus, meant something more than passively riding in the back of a pickup truck or in a car. Therefore, because Marcus was not participating in an activity, AFLAC failed to meet its burden of proving that the exclusion at issue precluded coverage here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 8} Although AFLAC could not use the exclusion at issue here to preclude coverage, we briefly address McKeehan\u2019s argument that R.C. 4511.19, Ohio\u2019s drunk-driving statute, does .not define the term \u201cintoxicated\u201d and, therefore, could not be used by AFLAC to determine whether an insured was intoxicated for purposes of excluding coverage. Elmore had testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>AFLAC had denied McKeehan\u2019s claim because Marcus had a BAC of .183, a concentration above the legal limit for persons operating motor vehicles in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">{\u00b6 9} We agree with McKeehan that R.C. 4511.19(A)(2), which sets forth the blood-alcohol-concentration level at which a person can no longer operate a motor vehicle, could not have been the basis for denying coverage here. AFLAC\u2019s policy stated that \u201cintoxication\u201d meant \u201cthat condition as defined by the law of the jurisdiction where the accident occurred.\u201d Under common law in Ohio, the term \u201cintoxication\u201d is a term of art and is often used interchangeably with the phrase \u201cunder the influence.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> But Ohio law is also clear that operating a motor vehicle with a certain concentration of alcohol in one\u2019s blood does not mean that one is \u201cintoxicated\u201d or \u201cunder the influence\u201d of alcohol in other settings.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 10} Intoxication is defined as being \u201cexcited or exhilarated beyond self-control by alcoholic drinks,\u201d and \u201cintoxicate\u201d is defined as \u201cto excite or stupefy by alcoholic drinks or a narcotic specially to the point where physical and mental control is markedly diminished.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Although AFLAC presented evidence that Marcus had a BAC of .183, a concentration above the legal limit for persons operating motor vehicles in Ohio, it did not present any evidence to demonstrate that Marcus\u2019s physical and mental control was appreciably diminished by alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 11} AFLAC cites <em>Phelps v. Positive Action Tool Co.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for the proposition that evidence of a BAC level over the limit set forth in R.C. 4511.19(A)(2) can be used to deny coverage to insureds on the basis that they are intoxicated. In <em>Phelps, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that an employee who had a BAC of .21 when he crashed his car while driving to work was not entitled to workers\u2019 compensation benefits because he was \u201cgrossly intoxicated.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But the <em>Phelps </em>court did not rely solely on the employee\u2019s BAC level in determining that the employee was \u201cintoxicated.\u201d The court also .noted that the employee had been drinking several hours before the accident, that the employee could not remember how the accident had occurred, and that the employee had never hit the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>breaks in an attempt to avoid the accident (the evidence showed that there were no skid marks). Finally, the Supreme Court noted that intoxication alone did not mean that an employee could not recover benefits, but that intoxication that \u201crendered] an employee incapable of performing his work\u201d would usually lead to the loss of an entitlement to benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation system.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">{\u00b6 12} Here, AFLAC only presented evidence of Marcus\u2019s blood-alcohol content. The stipulated facts were silent concerning Marcus\u2019s conduct immediately prior to his death.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> And while we can speculate that a person with a BAC of .183 is most likely \u201cintoxicated,\u201d Ohio law requires more than a BAC level to prove that one is intoxicated for purposes other than operating a motor vehicle. It must also be shown that the alcohol has impaired one\u2019s physical or mental self-control.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 13} Based on the above circumstances, we hold that AFLAC did not prove that Marcus was intoxicated, as that term is defined under Ohio law, for purposes of excluding coverage under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, we sustain McKeehan\u2019s assignment of error. We reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this decision and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b295-9\">Sundermann, P.J., and Winkler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">.
