Its execution, delivery, and nonpayment are not denied, but defendant in his answer alleges that the note was given in part payment of the purchase price of a stock of goods in New York City, in which transaction the plaintiff falsely represented that he had purchased said stock of goods for the benefit of the defendant, paying therefor a certain sum, when in fact he had paid for it some one thousand five hundred dollars less than the sum represented. It is also alleged in the defendant\u2019s pleading that the note was without consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">Plaintiff, on the other hand, in his answer to the cross-complaint, denies that the note was without consideration, or that any fraud was practiced upon the defendant in the transaction concerning the purchase and sale of said stock of goods. He also avers that the note formed no part of that transaction, but was given as evidence of an indebtedness between the parties which sprang from an entirely different business dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>As to the issues in the case thus framed by the pleadings it is sufficient to say that while there is evidence in the record to support defendant\u2019s view of the case, on the other hand there is also evidence to sustain plaintiff\u2019s contention. This latter the trial court adopted. Being based upon conflicting evidence, this appellate court, under the rule well settled in this state, will not interfere with such court\u2019s finding and its appropriate judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
