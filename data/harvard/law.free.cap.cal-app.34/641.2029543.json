Consequently the filing of the amended complaint neither prejudiced the defendant nor contravened the provisions of section 1008 of the Penal Code. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rippe, </em>32 Cal. App. 514, [163 Pac. 506].)</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">The record does not sustain the contention of counsel for the defendant that the trial court refused to permit him to show upon cross-examination of the complaining witness that the latter was so drunk on the night of the assault with which the defendant is charged as not to be able to identify the defendant as one of the persons who assaulted him. That is all we think need be said as to that assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">No other point in the case requires discussion, and we are satisfied that the evidence sustains the verdict and judgment. The judgment and order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
