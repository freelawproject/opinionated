That statute, we think, must be regarded as a statute of limitations in so far as the right of the petitioner to apply for the writ is concerned, and the application has not been made within the statutory time. We are compelled, therefore, to dismiss the writ, and that will be the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
