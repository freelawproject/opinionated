And it being conceded that the misrepre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>sentations pleaded in the complaint suffice to constitute a cause of action for fraud, it follows that the evidence supports the findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">A petition to have the cause heard in the supreme court, after judgment in the district court of appeal, was denied by the supreme court on November 6, 1917.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
