Such inference is fairly deducible from this portion of Street\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">\u201cQ. Were you at Mr. Goddard\u2019s place last night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-6\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-7\">\u201cQ. Was Mr. Prisbie there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-9\">\u201cQ. Did Mr. Prisbie ask you in substance to say that he was your agent?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-10\">\u201cA. Well, I will tell you. He asked me this question. He says, \u2018Do you remember, Joe, the time that you sent up by me to get that whisky for you, that two bottles of whisky ? \u2019 and I stopped and studied a minute and I said, \u2018I believe I do, Bert, I believe I do remember about sending up by you to get the two bottles of whisky,\u2019 and he said, \u2018Will you swear to that effect?\u2019 and I said, \u2018I will swear to it as it comes along as I am asked that question.\u2019 I says, \u2018If I am asked that question I will swear to it that I did send by you to get two bottles of whisky and only paid you for one at the time being. I give you one dollar and a half, and of course the other last bottle I had not paid him for. \u2019 . . . He said, \u2018 That will make me an agent for you.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">It may be said also that there are some inconsistencies and contradictions in the testimony of these witnesses that cast suspicion upon their explanation of the transaction, and we think the jury were not unwarranted in holding that there was an actual sale by appellant to Street of the two bottles of whisky. Aside from that, in stating what occurred at the time he received one of the bottles, Street testified: \u201cThere was no words spoken. I laid the money down on the writing-desk and there was a bottle standing on the end of the writing-desk, and I laid down the money and put the bottle in my pocket, and he laid down the change and I put that in my pocket, and he said, \u2018You better have a drink before you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>go, \u2019 and he treated me to a couple of drinks, and treated my friend, and we walked out.\u201d It thus appears that appellant furnished Street with liquor that was not contained in said bottle. That it was whisky and belonged to appellant also sufficiently appears. Indeed, the language as to treating would, of course, imply a gift from appellant to Street. It is also true that Street was not a guest. This evidence brought out on cross-examination is sufficient to satisfy the charge of the indictment, and, hence, the question of agency as to the liquor furnished in the bottle is not of controlling moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">We think the conviction was just and the judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Chipman, P. J., and Hart, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
