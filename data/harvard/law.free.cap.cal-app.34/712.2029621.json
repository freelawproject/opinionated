Upon oral argument it is conceded that there is nothing in that point, so that is now out of the case. The only remaining contention is the alleged insufficiency of the evidence to support the finding of the commission. A perusal of the record convinces us that the evidence in this respect is sufficient. The writ is therefore denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
