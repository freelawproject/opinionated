The notice upon which plaintiff relies as a notice of appeal herein omits the words necessary to constitute a notice of appeal. It states that the plaintiff \u201cde<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>sires and intends to appeal\u201d from the judgment and that he \u201chas appealed therefrom,\u201d and closes by requesting that a transcript of the testimony, etc., be made up and prepared. This is not a notice of appeal. The law relating to this matter is clearly stated and the principal decisions on .the same point are cited in <em>Estate of Faber, </em>168 Cal. 491, [143 Pac. 737].</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\">The motion to dismiss is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">James, J., and Works, J., <em>pro tern., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
