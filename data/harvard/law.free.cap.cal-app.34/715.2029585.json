It is claimed by the plaintiff that the defendant agreed that said produce should arrive in a marketable condition at a distant foreign port; while the defendant, on the other hand, contends that San Francisco was the point of delivery to which the guar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>antee as .to the condition of the produce had reference. The evidence shows that part of the goods on their arrival at the foreign port was decayed and unmerchantable, but there is evidence to sustain the finding of the court that the extent of defendant\u2019s warranty was that the potatoes and onions should be in good, marketable condition at San Francisco. This court, therefore, under the familiar rule relating to the presence of a conflict in the evidence, will not disturb the finding of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
