BROWN, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"acz-dedup-0\">This is an action by four motor carriers (TSC, Herrin, Central and East Texas)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *to set aside certificates of public convenience and necessity, issued under \u00a7 207(a) of the ICC Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307(a), authorizing two additional motor carriers (Southern-Plaza and Strickland) <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to operate between Houston and New Orleans.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ****We uphold the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>awards, but with some modification, against a succession of attacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In 1954 Strickland applied for a certificate of public convenience and necessity for motor carriage of general commodities between Houston and New Orleans,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and in 1955 Southern-Plaza applied for a similar authority.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This followed on the heels of a recent major but unsuccessful attempt of these carriers to secure authority to operate between Houston and New Orleans.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Strickland\u2019s application sought Houston-New Orleans authority over two routes, the one via Beaumont, Texas, and Lafayette, Louisiana, called the \u201csouthern\u201d route, and the other via Beaumont and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, called the \u201cnorthern\u201d route. The Southern-Plaza application sought authority over the southern route only.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Both of the applicants, Strickland and Southern-Plaza, are large trucking concerns with operations extending into several states. Both serve a number of major cities in Texas, such as, Dallas, Fort Worth, San Antonio, and Houston and operate between those points (among others) and such centers as St. Louis and Chicago. Strickland now holds authority to operate from Houston to Beaumont, over the route involved here, but not in the reverse direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">After extensive hearings before Hearing Examiner Boss, the Examiner in a single report served in October 1957 recommended orders <em>denying </em>both applications. Exceptions and replies to the Examiner\u2019s report were filed, and the proceedings in the usual course were referred to Division 1 of the Commission \u201cfor action thereon.\u201d Thereafter, without any public report by Division 1 the matter was referred to the entire Commission. By a final <em>report</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>issued October 14, 1958, the full Commission, while substantially adopting the Examiner\u2019s detailed statement of the facts, rejected the Examiner's recommendation and granted both applications. Strickland was awarded the so-called \u201cnorthern\u201d route <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> between Houston and New Orleans and Southern-Plaza, the \u201csouthern\u201d route.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-16\">Petitions for reconsideration and further hearing filed by the protesting carriers were denied in April 1959 \u201cfor the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>reason that the findings of the Commission are in accordance with the evidence and the applicable law.\u201d The Commission made no other basic findings or conclusions in connection with its order denying reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The plaintiffs then filed this proceeding attacking the merits of the grants to Strickland and Southern-Plaza and also much of the procedure of the Commission in its handling of these applications. Specifically, the plaintiffs here complain of the procedure by which the Commission (1) issued its report without first having had Division 1 issue a report on the applications, (2) issued its report as the result of \u201cconstructive\u201d sessions at which the members were not physically present, (3) allegedly had certain of its Attorney-Advisers, who were not Hearing Examiners, review the proceedings and make recommendations to the Commissioner, and (4) failed to make any additional findings on the petition for reconsideration and further hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Procedure in Handling the Applications</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\"><em>A. Action by Division 1 </em>After the Hearing Examiner issued his report recommending <em>denial </em>of both applications, the matters (including exceptions to the report and replies) were submitted to Division 1 of the Commission \u201cfor action thereon.\u201d This is the normal procedure under the Commission\u2019s organizational rules<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which delegate \u00a7 207 proceedings to Division 1. Normally the division renders a decision and issues a dispositive report and order subject to the right of the parties to petition for reconsideration by the entire Commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Departing from the usual course here, however, Division 1 did not make an ofiicial formal report. The proceedings were rather submitted directly to the entire Commission. Plaintiffs contend that the matters were not properly before the full Commission and that the Commission violated its organizational rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-15\">The Commission\u2019s organizational rules allow a division to \u201ccall upon the whole Commission for advice and counsel, or for consideration of any case or question by * * * additional Commissioners * * By the same token, \u201cthe Commission may recall and bring before it as such any case, matter or question\u201d pending before any division.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commission never did enter an ofiicial order of recall. It seems to be generally assumed that the impetus for Commission action came from Division 1 who purported to certify the whole case to the full Commission.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>Plaintiffs have several objections to the purported certification by Division 1. First they claim that there is no authority for such a certification of the entire case. That can only be accomplished by an order of recall by the entire Commission. Second, even assuming that the Division could certify the whole case, the effort was ineffective here since the decision to certify was not properly recorded. Giving substance to their objections, plaintiffs argue that they had proceeded on the basis of Division action. Thus, briefs and other matters were prepared with Division 1, not the entire Commission, in mind. Had they known that it was to be the full Commission who would decide the case, the approach may have been quite different. Also, they contend that due to the abdication of Division 1, the protestants were deprived of a favorable<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> report by the Division or an opportunity, if the report were unfavorable,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to file a petition for reconsideration by the entire Commission together with additional briefs pointing out the errors of the Division report.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The certification of the cases to the Commission by Division 1 complies in all substantial respects with the Commission\u2019s organizational rules. This is so whether viewed as either a request by Division 1 for \u201cadvice and counsel\u201d or as the assignment of additional Commissioners to consider the case. In either . event, when the Commission accepted the certification and undertook to resolve the issues presented,. its action in effect amounted to a recall of that matter from the Division. The rule \u2014 whose purpose was to announce the orderly internal procedure of the Commission \u2014 provided its own exception: namely, consideration by the entire Commission whenever they deemed it expedient. Whether the initiating force for such a consideration by the entire Commission came from the Division or the Commission seems unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">The vote to request consideration by the entire Commission was recorded in a memorandum prepared by the clearance clerk for Division 1, note 13, supra. There is no minute entry reflecting the action and the clerk\u2019s memorandum was not publicly recorded or served on the parties. Plaintiffs argue the action was a nullity in violation of \u00a7 17(3) of the ICC Act which provides that \u201c[E]very vote and official act of the Commission, or any division * * * shall be entered of record, and such record shall be made public upon the request of any party interested.\u201d The purpose of this provision is to insure that parties have an opportunity to know of any action which may affect their rights. It is especially necessary in cases in which an order of the division may become final within 20 days if no exeep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>tions are filed by the parties.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is difficult to see how the plaintiffs could have been prejudiced by the failure to record the action of Division 1 since it resulted in a consideration by the entire Commission of the proceedings. What the whole Commission has delegated, it obviously could recall and consider as a body.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Moreover, the protestants could not have challenged the right of the Commission to take the whole case. They lost no right to complain nor to complain by a certain time. In the absence of prejudice, the action of the Commission must stand. See \u00a7 10(e), 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1009(e); ABC Freight Forwarding Corp. v. United States, D.C.S.D.N.Y. 1959, 169 F.Supp. 403, 406, citing Market Street Railway Co. v. Railroad Commission, 1945, 324 U.S. 548, 561-562, 65 S.Ct. 770, 89 L.Ed. 1171.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">Secondly, it is difficult to see how the plaintiffs could have been injured by the failure of Division 1 to issue a report. The referral to Division 1, in the first instance, was merely a permissive delegation of the Commission\u2019s responsibility to determine the case. The contention that if the circulated but undisclosed report was unfavorable, the protestants were deprived of an opportunity to file a petition for reconsideration by the entire Commission overlooks the fact that this is exactly what occurred \u2014 the matter was considered by the entire Commission. Plaintiffs still had the right to petition for reconsideration after the report of the entire Commission. And this, of course, they did. The argument that the briefs may have been written differently if the plaintiffs had known that the persons deciding the case were other than those expected needs little comment. The Commission is, of course, an institutional agency and the appeal must be to the institution, not to the personal predilection of the individual members. The make-up of the divisions, as the make-up of the Commission, may change. In any event, new arguments or appeals could be made in amended or supplemental briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-16\"><em>B. \u201cConstructive\" </em>Sessions\u2014 <em>Notation Voting</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">Plaintiffs argue that the final report and orders of October 14, 1958, note 7, supra, were invalid because adopted by the Commission through voting by notation<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> rather than at a conference at which the Commission members were physically present and assembled together. Plaintiffs attack this procedure as calling for action of individual members of the Commission rather than the official action of the Commission as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>a body. Moreover, such a procedure is invalid because not published in the Federal Register.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Although there is little federal authority,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the state courts universally require that official action of state commissioners,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> town counsels,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> county boards,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> school boards,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> church trustees,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and corporation boards of directors <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> must be conducted in formal meetings attended by the necessary quorum. Here each side professes to see in \u00a7 17 (3) of the ICC Act language which sustains its position. Plaintiffs cite the statement that \u201ca majority of the Commission [or] of a division * * * shall constitute a <em>quorum </em>for the transaction of business\u201d as clearly indicating that a meeting at which the members are physically present is indispensable. Moreover, the references throughout the Act to \u201ccommission\u201d or \u201cboard\u201d contemplate joint action by members physically present with an opportunity to deliberate, exchange views, persuade or be persuaded by the force of argument and ultimately decide and pursue a jointly reached course of action. But on the other hand, \u00a7 17(3) provides that \u201cthe Commission shall conduct its proceedings under any provision of law in such manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business to the ends of justice * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b833-15\">We think that notation voting may be selected by the Commission as a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>manner of dispatching its business. <em>When </em>a meeting of the Commissioners assembled together is held, of course, as the Act specified, a majority shall constitute a quorum. But in view of the broad grant to the Commission of authority to control its proceedings, it may select this type of voting procedure as an aid in dealing with its tremendous workload.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">The statute does not specifically provide that administrative action be taken concurrently by the deciding members in a formal meeting and we decline to impose such requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Nor is the procedure of notation voting rendered a nullity because not published in the Federal Register. The minute authorizing it is recorded in the official record of the Commission, although never published in the Federal Register. We think that the procedure falls within one of the specific exemptions from the requirement of publication. The statute exempts \u201cany matter relating solely to the internal management of an agency.\u201d \u00a7 3(a), Adm.Proc. Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1002. The last sentence of \u00a7 3(a) gives meaning to the. exemption. \u201cNo person shall in any manner be required to resort to organization or procedure not so published.\u201d 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1002(a). Obviously the procedure is solely a matter of internal procedure within the Commission. It does not purport to inform parties of the procedure which is to be taken for the presentation of matters to the Commission. It is not designed for the guidance of the public because it in no way affects any steps which interested parties must take or not take in order to obtain, or review, action by the Commission. As the court in Foreman &amp; Clark, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, 9 Cir., 1954, 215 F.2d 396, at page 410, certiorari denied 348 U.S. 887, 75 S.Ct. 207, 99 L.Ed. 697, stated: \u201cthe clear purpose of Section 3 (a) * * * is to provide a <em>shield </em>for a petitioner before * * * [an] agency, to protect him from being penalized for failing to resort to unpublished methods of procedure. It is not a <em>sword </em>by which a petitioner can strike down the agency\u2019s order on the ground that the agency <em>has not authorized itself </em>to issue that type of order, by publishing a statement in the Federal Register!\u201d Thus, the procedure of notation voting, otherwise valid, is not rendered invalid because it was not published in the Federal Register.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">\n<em>C. Lack of Findings in Order Denying Petition for Reconsideration.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\"><em>The </em>Commission denied the petition for reconsideration in April 1959 \u201c * * * .for the reason that the findings of the Commission are in accordance with the evidence <em>and the </em>applicable law.\u201d Plaintiffs contend that with this conclusion and nothing more there is a lack of the basic or essential findings required to support the Commission\u2019s order. Amarillo-Borger Express v. United States, D.C.N.D.Tex.1956, 138 F.Supp. 411 (3-judge), appeal dismissed as moot 352 U.S. 1028, 77 S.Ct. 594, 1 L.Ed.2d 598; Dixie Carriers, Inc., v. United States, D.C.S.D.Tex.1956, 143 F.Supp. 844 (3-judge), appeal dismissed as moot 355 U.S. 179, 78 S.Ct. 258, 259, 2 L.Ed.2d 186. The Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1007(b) requires a statement of findings and conclusions \u201cas well as the reasons or basis therefor.\u201d The Amarillo-Borger and Dixie Carriers cases involve orders entered for \u201cgood cause appearing\u201d which vacated and overruled existing Commission orders suspending proposed rates [138 F.Supp. 414.] There were no basic findings and conclusions or reasons therefor to support the order overruling the prior controlling orders except the cryptic phrase \u201cgood cause appearing.\u201d The court held: \u201cThe Commission may, as any other body, have the right to change its mind, but its action must demonstrate the \u2018rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>sons or basis therefor.\u2019 \u201d Amarillo-Borger Express v. United States, supra, 138 F.Supp. 411, at page 420. The Administrative Procedure Act does not require that detailed findings with supporting reasons previously made and adhered to by the Commission be reiterated after each attack. The statement by the Commission that the \u201cfindings of the Commission [are] in accordance with the evidence and the applicable law\u201d is obviously a statement that the Commission is standing behind the original detailed and articulate findings and conclusions. The law requires no more.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">\n<em>D. Use of Attorney-Advisers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AjP\">Plaintiffs contend that the Commissioners used attorney advisers, who were not qualified as APA hearing examiners, to review the record of the proceedings conducted by the Hearing Examiner (together with the exceptions and replies to the Examiner\u2019s report) and make recommendations \u2014 which were never served upon the parties \u2014 to aid the Commissioners in reaching their decision's. This was, they urge, especially harmful in this c\u00e1se since' the final report rejected the recommendations of the Hearing Examiner. The Commission, although contending that the issues were not raised before the Commission and should not properly be considered by this court, United States v. L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, 1952, 344 U.S. 33, 36, 73 S.Ct. 67, 97 L.Ed. 54; Monumental Motor Tours v. United States, D.C.D.Md.1953, 110 F.Supp. 929, 932, does not deny that its practice is to have staff attorney subordinates review the record and make recommendations. These attorney reviewers do not, however, participate in either the investigating or prosecuting functions of the Commission, nor do they take part in the proceedings before the Hearing Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">There are three stages of review by the attorney reviewer. First, taking the Hearing Examiner\u2019s report, exceptions and replies, the reviewer prepares a draft of a final report. This report is a recommendation by the adviser who is expected to arrive at his recommendation through his independent study of the record. This report is then turned over to another reviewer who, unfamiliar with the case, goes over the draft of the initial staff reviewer. This re-reviewer may make changes, but if he disagrees with the draft of the initial reviewer then the draft of the initial reviewer must go to the Commission along with the comments of the re-reviewer. The final step, is by the Review Committee composed of three men of the greatest experience on the staff who take a \u201cquick look\u201d at the report before it goes to the division or Commission. The draft and recommendation is then sent to the Commission.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">The crux of the plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the Administrative Procedure Act applies to the \u201cintermediate review\u201d stage to the same extent that it applies to proceedings before the Hearing Examiner. Wong Yang Sung v. McGrath, 1950, 339 U.S. 33, 70 S.Ct. 445, 94 L.Ed. 616; Riss &amp; Co. v. United States, D. C.W.D..Mo.l950, 96 F.Supp. 452, reversed 1951, 341 U.S. 907, 71 S.Ct. 620, 95 L.Ed. 1345. Specifically, plaintiffs argue, review of evidence in making of recommendations can only be done by Hearing Examiners qualified under \u00a7 11 of the Administrative Procedure Act, and these recommendations must be served upon the parties who must be given an opportunity to file exceptions to them. The Commission vigorously defends the use of the attorney-reviewers as necessary and essential for effective staff assistance in the internal decisional process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>of the Commission. Relying mainly on cases <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> decided before the enactment of the Administrative Procedure Act, the Commission contends that the Administrative Procedure Act was not intended to cut off such effective staff assistance,</p>\n<p id=\"Am_\">Plaintiff\u2019s argument that the staff review violates the Administrative Procedure Act is based on \u00a7 7 <footnotemark>29</footnotemark> relating to the qualifications of the individual who acts and \u00a7 8(b) <footnotemark>30</footnotemark> relating to the decisions rendered. But \u00a7 7 provides that an examiner qualified under the Act \u201cshall <em>preside at the taking of evidence.\u201d </em>Obviously, the purpose was to govern the qualifications of the individual conducting the hearing, ruling on the admissibility of evidence, and charged with the responsibility of making the record and, wbe*e 'Sitial decision. It \u2122u]d be ^cuRto read the language of \u00a7 7 to mcIude staff assistants who review and mabe recommendations to aid the Commissions in their study of the record of proceedings conducted by the Examiner.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>The applicable part of \u00a7 8 provides that before a \u201cdecision upon agency review of the <em>decision </em>of subordinate officers the parties shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to submit * * (1) proposed findings and conclusions, or (2) exceptions to the decisions or recommended decisions of subordinate officers * * *Further, \u201c[a] 11 decisions (including initial, recommended, or tentative decisions) shall become part of the record * * * .\u201d The contention of the plaintiffs apparently is that any staff recommendation after review of the record of the Hearing Examiner, exceptions and replies, is either a recommended or a tentative decision within the meaning of the section. Reference to other sections, however, indicates that what was contemplated by a \u201crecommended decision\u201d was one made by a Hearing Examiner when the agency it- . self makes the initial decision without having presided at the taking of evidence. This would also include an initial' decision made by a Division under the delegation procedure and in which no hearings are held before an Examiner. This would also include those in which the Examiner\u2019s proposed order may become final under \u00a7 8(a). Section 8(a) provides that decisions or recommended decisions of the Examiner shall become final in the absence of appeal to the agency by the parties or reconsideration on motion of the agency itself.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Similarly, \u00a7 17(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act provides that findings or orders of an individual commissioner or board shall, in the absence of appeal, become the order of the full Commission.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> In adjudicatory cases a \u201ctentative decision\u201d is substantially equivalent to a \u201crecommended decision.\u201d More often it is regarded as one issued by an agency in rule-making or initial licensing procedure in which no recommended or initial decision by the Hearing Examiner is involved. Or, as the term implies, it may be one in which the agency or the hearing officer couches the order in terms which will be followed unless the parties show good reason to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The distinction between the function of a Hearing Examiner and the Commission (or a division of it) must be kept carefully in mind. Much is committed to the Examiner and the aim of the APA was to give him a position of judicial independence and disinterestedness. His findings and conclusions, or recommended action, will have great significance. But the final decision is that of the Commission. The Commission is not, as would be the case of a court reviewing a trial judge\u2019s non-jury decision or the action of an administrative agency under clearly erroneous or substantial evidence concepts, bound by the Examiner\u2019s decision. It is, of course, a relevant and important part of the ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>ministrative record. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 492-497, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456, 489-472. But the final decision must be that of the Commission. Consequently it is not a mere matter of the Commission\u2019s reviewing the Examiner\u2019s proposed report to see whether it is supported by sufficient evidence. That means that in the performance of this duty of ultimate responsibility the Commission and its members may properly call on staff assistance in satisfying the almost insuperable demands on this personal institutional accountability.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Congress is aware of the tremendous volume of business which is the ultimate responsibility of the Commission, and hence the Commissioners. The APA was intended to reach the vice of infection of the. adjudicatory body by the partisan views of those having investigatory and prosecuting duties. Congress did not mean to leave this small group of Commissioners bereft of staff assistance in the assimilation of the great flood of formal cases requiring decision. The decision is still that of the Commissioners. Each bears full legal and personal accountability for that which bears his name or concurrence. The system requires a full public report of reasons and conclusions. With these safeguards Congress deemed the question of the identity and actions of staff assistants to be matters beyond question by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Substantiality of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Plaintiffs vigorously attack the granting of both applications on the grounds that they are not bottomed and supported by substantial evidence viewing the record as a whole. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. Giving color to this argument is the fact that the Commission, while adopting the many factual statements of the Hearing Examiner, rejected the recommendations, of the Examiner and reached a directly contrary result. In assaying the substantiality of the evidence supporting the-Commission\u2019s action, ours is the limited task of determining whether the conclusion of the Commission \u201cfinds support in the record as a whole, * * * \u2018even though the court would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before it de novo.\u2019 \u201d N. L. R. B. v. Fant Milling Co., 1959, 360 U.S. 301, 309, 79 S.Ct. 1179, 1184, 3 L.Ed.2d 1243; United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, 1946, 327 U.S. 515, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821; \u00a7 10(e), Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1009(e). If the Commission has made adequate findings which are in turn supported by substantial evidence, viewed in the light that the record in its entirety furnishes, a reviewing court may not set the order aside even though the court may disagree with the ultimate findings of the Commission. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. Co., 1912, 222 U.S. 541, 547, 32 S.Ct. 108, 56 L.Ed. 308; Rochester Telephone Corp. v. United States, 1939, 307 U.S. 125, 139-140, 59 S.Ct. 754, 83 L.Ed. 1147; Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-12\">It is the duty of the Commission to determine the question of public convenience and necessity \u2014 a judgment as to the public interest \u2014 in an application for additional transportation facilities under \u00a7 207(a).<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Interstate Commerce Commission v. Parker, 1945, 326 U.S. 60, 65 S.Ct. 1490, 89 L.Ed. 2051.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-13\">Here the Commission made its findings of public convenience and neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>sity requiring the granting of the two applications based largely on its judgment that the existing service was unsatisfactory and that the proposed service was feasible and appropriate. The Commission\u2019s basic conclusion \u2014 which the plaintiffs here vigorously contest\u2014 is that \u201cthe existing service of Herrin and TSC between Houston and New Orleans is not reasonably adequate to meet the present and future requirements of the public for expeditious motor service * * ICC Report, supra, 77 MCC at 677. \u201c[Herrin and TSC] have demonstrated * * * that they cannot be depended upon to provide the type of service of which they are capable, except when faced with an imminent threat of .additional competition.\u201d ICC Report, supra, 77 MCC at 666. These conclusions were based largely on complaints of shippers which complaints the Commission stated \u201ccharacterize the over-all service as undependable.\u201d Such complaints fall into two general categories, (1) delay in picking up shipments and delay in making local deliveries and (2) excessive and irregular transit times.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">It is inappropriate and unnecessary for us to recite the evidence of the individual witnesses. Over 100 persons support Strickland\u2019s application and 40 shippers or receivers support the application of Southern-Plaza. It is sufficient to give a general brief description of the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Witnesses recited their experience in the years 1954, 1955 and 1956 with respect to unsatisfactory pickup service by the existing carriers. Some of the shippers testified that because of delayed pickup service and their need for prompt shipment, they were forced to deliver shipments to the carrier\u2019s docks. Others testifying to the unsatisfactory service they had received commented upon the noticeable improvement after the filing of the applications by Strickland and Southern-Plaza. The complaints which the Commission was entitled to credit were largely that the particular carrier failed to pick up shipments on the same day it was requested to do so. In the same vein, some witnesses testified that they found it necessary to pick up their incoming shipments at the carrier\u2019s dock if they wanted them the same day the shipment arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">The objection which the Commission characterized as the \u201cmost serious complaint against existing service\u201d was that relating to excessive and irregular transit time. Although the Commission considered some of the delay excusable because of week-end shutdowns, the Commission stated that from the past experience of many of the shippers it was clear that they had been subjected to a substantial amount of mediocre and poor service.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Herrin and TSC countered that they hold out and advertised 2-day service as well as overnight service between Houston and New Orleans. Further, as shown in the Examiner\u2019s report, in excess of 90% of the shipments handled by Herrin during August 1955 (immediately prior to the hearings) were accorded 2-day or better service. But the carriers hold themselves out to furnish expedited service also and too many shipments, the Commission found, were given inadequate or slow service.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">Another facet of the \u201ctransit time\u201d problem is a complaint by some of the supporting shippers, from San Antonio, of delay incidental to the interchange of freight at Houston. Specific instances of such delay are recited in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Aua\">The evidence adequately supports the Commission\u2019s ultimate finding. It is the conventional type of evidence usually submitted to the Commission in proceedings of this kind calling for the evaluation of many variable factors and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>exercise of sound judgment to reach an equitable and fair decision. The evidence adduced supports the statements of underlying reasons made by the Commission. And the evidence showing a noticeable increase in satisfactory service shortly prior to the hearings on these applications further supports the basic conclusion of the Commission on the need for additional service. If the prospect of additional competition brings about such beneficent results, surely the Commission in the exercise of its informed judgment could find that the additional carriers would give a healthy climate of controllable competition without being destructive to the position of the existing carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The applicants\u2019 proposed service contemplates service between all points which they now serve, on the one hand, and on the other, New Orleans and points between Houston and New Orleans. The applicants both propose regularly scheduled overnight service between Houston and New Orleans. Strickland also proposes a number of schedules between Houston and the principal intermediate points, and plans to have terminals at those intermediate points. It plans to have service between those small intermediate points provided generally by so-called peddle runs. The Commission concluded \u201cthe schedule set up by applicant governing their proposed operations between Houston and New Orleans are * * * entirely reasonable; and we have no basis to doubt that either applicant can, or would, maintain the service proposed if the instant applications are granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">The Commission concluded that the amount of additional' service resulting from the granting of the applications would not endanger the existing services of Herrin and TSC. This was based upon its informed judgment that the amount of traffic available, based in part on figures submitted by Herrin and TSC,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> is or will be sufficient to support the additional operation of both applicants between Houston and New Orleans.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">The Commission granted Strickland the \u201cnorthern\u201d route and Southern-Plaza, the \u201csouthern\u201d route. Thus Baton Rouge will be served by Strickland alone and Lafayette will be served by Southern-Plaza alone. There will be no added competition in the local service between New Orleans and Baton Rouge and between New Orleans and Lafayette and points intermediate thereto since the Commission imposed restrictions to protect such existing local services.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b840-15\">Complaint of Intervenors Central and East Texas</p>\n<p id=\"b840-16\">These two intervenors operate between Beaumont-Orange and Houston although East Texas has a somewhat restricted authority. They complain that the final order authorizes two new services, \u201c(1) between Orange, Beaumont and Houston and (2) between Orange, Beaumont and other points on U. S. Highway 90 inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>mediate to Orange and Houston, on the one hand, and, on the other, San Antonio, Fort Worth, Dallas, St. Louis, Chicago, and other points now authorized to be served direct by Strickland and Southern-Plaza.\u201d They further assert that there is no evidence that public convenience and necessity requires such services, nor are there requisite findings in the report to support those conclusions. They point to the \u201cmanifest inconsistency within the report as between involved local services in Louisiana and local services in Texas, and as between proposed off-route services and proposed through services from Beaumont and Orange to the west and north, and vice versa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">There does not seem to be any serious dispute between the intervenors and the applicants concerning what the testimony was before the Hearing Examiner with respect to truck service to and from Orange and Beaumont.. The testimony of the witnesses to which we have been referred deals in every case, except one, R. W. Smith and Company,<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> with shipments between Orange and Beaumont on the one hand, and points in Louisiana on the other. It may be fairly said that there was no showing of inadequate service from Orange and Beaumont, on the one hand, and Houston on the other. Therefore, the question is resolved into a question of law. That is, must there be adequate evidence of public convenience and necessity for additional service between Beaumont-Orange and Houston to support the specific service award here challenged?</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Strickland already has authority to carry from Houston to Beaumont, but not in the reverse direction. Southern-Plaza had no authority to carry between Houston and Beaumont or Orange or reverse. Strickland and Southern-Plaza urged that the question is merely whether \u201ctacking\u201d should be allowed. The \u201ctacking\u201d argument would apply to Strickland\u2019s Houston to Beaumont service. And so far as points west or north of Houston, such as San Antonio, Ft. Worth, Dallas, St. Louis, Chicago, which Strickland and Southern-Plaza were previously authorized to serve, the new authority is properly regarded as \u201ctacking.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s order is adequate as to evidence and findings to sustain the order with respect to such transportation. But it is incorrect to attempt to justify new service between Beaumont-Orange and Houston on the principle of \u201ctacking.\u201d Whether a grant of authority between Houston and New Orleans should include authority for local service between Beaumont-Orange and Houston or shipments destined for or originating from such points is obviously a question on which evidence on the need for that particular service must be.adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">This means that service between Beaumont-Orange and Houston (and intermediate points) was required to be supported by evidence of public convenience and necessity. This extends to shipments originating in Houston or beyond destined to move through Houston to Beaumont-Orange or any points intermediary to Houston and Beaumont-Orange as well as any return shipments going in the reverse direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Intervenors, Central and East Texas, rely on Hudson Transit Lines v. United States, D.C.S.D.N.Y.1948, 82 F.Supp. 153, affirmed 338 U.S. 802, 70 S.Ct. 59, 94 L.Ed. 485, and L. A. Tucker Truck Lines v. United States, D.C.E.D.Mo.1953, 115 F.Supp. 647. Both of these eases involved the setting aside of a certificate of public convenience and necessity which authorized service between intermediate points within the scope of broad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>er rights because of the failure to show the necessity for that particular localized service. So much of the certificate authorizing the service between a particular intermediate point that was not supported by substantial evidence of necessity for the service was set aside.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In view of the persuasiveness of these two cases, and the obvious inapplicability of the \u201ctacking\u201d cases cited by applicants, so much of the certificate granting authority for new service between Beaumont-Orange and Houston must be set aside. This will not affect the existing authority of Strickland to operate from Houston to Beaumont, but not in the reverse direction.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Miscellaneous Objections</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">There is no merit to the contention that the Commission failed to consider the adequacy of rail service or the im-. pact of these grants upon such carriers. \u201cMany of the supporting shippers are now utilizing rail service to some extent, but all prefer motor service for expeditious handling of their smaller shipments. They complain generally of the service received from existing carriers, both motor and rail.\u201d ICC report, supra, 77 MCC 655, 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Commission failed to make findings in terms of the national transportation policy<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-12\">The report of the Commission is a detailed, careful, and articulate exposition of its judgment as to the adequacy of the existing services, the present and probable future need for additional services, the desirability of such additional services as a result of a controlled competition, and its judgment as to the effect the additional service will have on existing carriers. Unless, as in cases like' Pacific Inland Tariff Bureau v. United States, D.C.D.Or.1955, 129 F.Supp. 472 (3 judge), and Schaffer Transportation Co. v. United States, 1957, 355 U.S. 83, 78 S.Ct. 173, 2 L.Ed.2d 117, where special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>problems exist, it would be mere tautology for the Commission to repeat formal declarations in terms of the national transportation policy. Obviously the entire report with its many basic findings \u25a0clearly demonstrates that the Commission applied \u201cits familiarity with transportation problems to these conflicting considerations.\u201d American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc. v. United States, 1953, 344 U.S. 298, 314, 73 S.Ct. 307, 316, 97 L.Ed. 337.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Finally, the Commission did not abuse its discretion in denying the petition for rehearing. United States v. Pierce Auto Freight Lines, 1946, 327 U.S. 515, 534-536, 66 S.Ct. 687, 90 L.Ed. 821; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Jersey City, 1944, 322 U.S. 503, 514-518, 64 S.Ct. 1129, 88 L.Ed. 1420.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">Accordingly, the order is affirmed in part and set aside in part. Insofar as the order is set aside, the matter is remanded to the Commission for further consistent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Affirmed in part, remanded in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-10\">.

Legal Services and Procedure, March 1955, by the Commission on Organization of the Executive Branch of the Government, at page 202: \u201cIn some agencies like the Interstate Commerce Commission, moreover, the record made by the hearing examiner is often subject to further review by other officers who have not heard the evidence, before the record is submitted to the agency for final decision.

The use of staff assistants in making recommendations on the record was sanctioned before the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act. See note 28, supra. When Congress undertook to regulate internal agency staff collaboration it did so specifically. In \u00a7 5(c) of the Act, Congress specifically prohibit-ited consultation between staff members engaged in investigative and prosecuting \u2022 functions of an agency with those participating in the adjudicatory function of an agency:</p>\n<p id=\"b836-12\">\u201cNo officer, employee, or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for any agency in any case shall, in that or a factually related case, participate or advise in the decision, recommended decision, or agency review * * * except as witness or counsel in public proceedings.\u201d 5 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 1004(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-14\">The Attorney General's Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act, 1947, a document of importance in the development of the Administrative Procedure Act, pointed out the need for staff assistance, but also the essential need to separate functions to insure fair and impartial hearings: \u201cThe expertise of an administrative agency is not limited to the heads of the agency; it includes also the staff of specialists through whom and with whose assistance most of the agency\u2019s functions are carried on. The issues in adjudicatory cases, while frequently less complex and with narrower policy implications than are often involved in rule making, present in many cases difficult questions of law and policy. * * * In determining such issues, agency heads have consulted with their principal advisers and specialists. Indeed, it is clearly in the public interest that they continue to do so. Section 5 (c) does not purport to isolate the agency heads from their staffs. Rather, in the interest of fair procedure, it mere-</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>ly excludes from any such participation in the decision of a case those employees of the agency who have had such previous participation in an adversary capacity in that or a factually related case that they may be \u2018disabled from bringing to its decision that dispassionate judgment which Anglo-American tradition demands of officials who decide questions.\u2019 \u201d Attorney General\u2019s Manual at 56-57 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">It is significant that Congress in two statutes subsequent to the Administrative Procedure Act has specifically provided for a separate opinion and review section for the Federal Communications Commission (see 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 155(c), 409) and for individual review by a legal assistant for each member of the National Labor Relations Board (see 29 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 154(a)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b837-9\">. 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1007(a): \u201c* * * Whenever such officers make the initial decision and in the absence of either an appeal to the agency or review upon motion of the agency within time provided by rule, such decision shall without further proceedings then become the decision of the agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b837-11\">. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 17 (5). Staff recommendations on the other hand have no such finality until they have actually been adopted by the Commission or by division. To read \u00a7 8(b) as requiring that all staff memoranda be subjected to exceptions and replies and be placed in the record would effectively destroy their usefulness in aiding the individual commissioners in the decisional process.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">. \u00a7 207(a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 307(a), provides: \u201c * * * a certificate [of public convenience and necessity] shall be issued to any qualified applicant therefor, authorizing the whole or any part of the operations covered by the application, if it is found that the applicant is fit, willing, and able properly- to perform the service proposed * *' * and that the proposed service * * *\u25a0 is or <em>will he </em>required by the present or <em>future </em>public convenience and necessity; otherwise such application shall be denied * (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">. \u201cRecapitulating certain figures tabulated by the examiner * * * it is noted that of 692 shipments handled by Herrin and TSG for the supporting shippers from Houston to Baton Rouge, only 379, or about 55 percent, were afforded 1-day service, 207 were afforded 2-day service, and 106 or about 15 percent required 3 days or more for delivery. Of 616 shipments handled by Herrin and TSG for the supporting shippers from Houston to New Orleans, 166 or about 27 percent were afforded 1-day service, 391 were afforded 2-day service, and 59 required 3 or more days.\u201d ICO Report, 77 MOO 655, 664.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b840-6\">. Figures submitted by Herrin and TSC indicated a daily average tonnage of 830.000 pounds handled between Houston and New Orleans; 110,000 pounds between Beaumont and New Orleans, 117.000 pounds between Houston and Lake Charles, 97,000 pounds between Houston and Baton Rouge, and 141,000 pounds between Houston and Lafayette.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b840-9\">. This is the point on which one commissioner dissented. 77 MCC 655, 670-71: \u201cConsidering * * * the fact that no need has been shown for greater quantum, as distinguished from quality, of service, I am not convinced that the record justifies the granting of the two applications. To double the number of direct single-line carriers between the termini here involved would dilute the available traffic possibly to such a considerable extent that it might eventually result in deteriorated service as well as produce unsound economic conditions, contrary to the objectives of the national transportation policy. X believe, therefore, that if any authority is to be granted, it should be to one applicant only * * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b840-18\">. Service at Baton Rouge was restricted to traffic moving to or from points west of the Louisiana-Texas state line. Service at Lafayette and intermediate points between Lafayette and New Orleans was restricted to traffic moving to or from points west of the Louisiana-Texas state line.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\">. Mr. Posey of R. W. Smith and Company testified that he had shipments from Houston to Beaumont, New Orleans, and points further east. On cross-examination Mr. Posey said that he had never had any great difficulty with Herrin to Beaumont, and that he had never used TSC to Beaumont.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"40\">\n<p id=\"b841-12\">.

Thrun, 8 Cir., 1949, 173 F.2d 454, 456.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. In Hudson Transit Lines v. United States, supra, Adirondack Transit Lines had been given a certificate with respect to long hauls between Paramus, New Jersey, and Monroe, New York, as well as short haul or communter service between New York City and intermediate points between Paramus, New .Jersey, and Monroe. The court set aside so much of the certificate as dealt with the short haul service, on the grounds that substantial evidence had not been presented and necessity for this phase of the service.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">In L. A. Tucker Truck Lines v. United States, supra, Pemiscot truck lines was granted authority to run truck service between St. Louis and Memphis and between Memphis and Sikeston, Missouri, and Sikeston, Missouri and St. Louis. Sikeston was only one of the intermediate points between Memphis and St. Louis. The only portion of the certificate attacked was that part which dealt with the authorization of new service between Sikeston and St. Louis. The court held: \u201cThere was no evidence before the Commission to sustain the need for granting additional service between St. Louis, Missouri, and Sikeston, Missouri, nor was there showing that the present service was inadequate. While the routes over which Pemiscot Motor Freight operated required it to pass through Sikeston in order to render service to other points farther south granted in the certificate, this in the court\u2019s opinion is no justification for granting it authority to serve Sikeston.\u201d 115 F.Supp. at page 649.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"42\">\n<p id=\"b842-15\">. As the case has to he remanded to the Commission with respect to this phase, we do not undertake to set this forth in terms having the precision of a certificate. But under our hoiding, except for Strickland\u2019s existing authority, the applicants will not be permitted to engage in the following transportation:</p>\n<p id=\"b842-16\">(1) Service from or through Houston destined to Beaumont or any point between Houston and Beaumont, or in the reverse direction,</p>\n<p id=\"b842-17\">(2) service from or through Houston destined to Orange or any point between Houston and Orange, or in the reverse direction,</p>\n<p id=\"b842-18\">(3) service from points east of Orange-Beaumont destined to any <em>intermediate point detween </em>Orange-Beaumont and Houston, or in the reverse direction.
