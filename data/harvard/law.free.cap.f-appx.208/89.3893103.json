We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s failure to expressly refute Molina\u2019s argument that the existence of fast-track programs in other judicial districts creates an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). <em>See United States v. Pereira, </em>465 F.3d 515, 523 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that while \u201ca district court must \u2018consider\u2019 the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) ... [w]e have ... steadfastly refused to require judges to explain or enumerate how such consideration was conducted\u201d); <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that we presume a district judge has considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and do not require him to \u201cdiscuss each one individually or ... expressly parse or address every argument relating to those factors that the defendant advanced\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Further, Molina\u2019s contention is merit-less. We recently held that the existence of fast-track programs in other judicial districts does not create an unwarranted disparity within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(6), and therefore that a district court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to account for such programs does not render the sentence unreasonable. <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Pereira, </em>465 F.3d at 522-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-11\">For those reasons, we AFFIRM the November 7, 2005 judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
