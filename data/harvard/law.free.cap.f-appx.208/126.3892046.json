The District Court sentenced O\u2019Keefe to five months in prison, five months of home detention, and 3 years of supervised release. The District Court also ordered him to pay $90,000 in restitution, a $3,000 fine and a $100 assessment. O\u2019Keefe appealed his sentence. Following <em>Booker, </em>this Court vacated and remanded O\u2019Keefe\u2019s cause. The District Court held a second sentencing hearing and imposed the same sentence. O\u2019Keefe timely appealed. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-21\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-22\">First, O\u2019Keefe argues that, during his second sentencing hearing, the Government breached his plea agreement by arguing he should be held accountable for the full harm done by the telemarketing scheme, despite the parties\u2019 stipulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>that he only knowingly took part in defrauding an individual named Doris Gilbert of $90,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">We review the question of whether the Government breached a plea agreement <em>de novo. United States v. Rivera, </em>357 F.3d 290, 293-94 (3d Cir.2004). We analyze plea agreements according to contract principles and attempt to discern whether the Government\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding when entering his plea. <em>Rivera, </em>357 F.3d at 294-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">O\u2019Keefe\u2019s plea agreement states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">[O\u2019Keefe] will acknowledge his responsibility for the full scheme to defraud by wire during the period November 2001 through January 2002, as described in the information, and stipulate (subject to the limitations of paragraph C 4, below) that such conduct may be considered by the Probation Office and by the District Court in imposing sentence (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Paragraph C-4 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">In this regard, the parties agree that the maximum amount of loss from the scheme to defraud for which Mr. O\u2019Keefe has responsibility pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 1.B1.1.3, Relevant Conduct, is a sum not more than $90,000, based on Mr. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s lack of knowledge of the nature of the scheme prior to December 5, 2001. However, the parties\u2019 stipulation is not intended to limit any inquiry by the District Court, and has no bearing on any fact not expressly set forth in the stipulation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Supplemental Appendix at 180,184.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">At the plea colloquy, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s counsel sought to clarify the meaning of paragraph A-4, and explained to the District Court that it was nothing more than a venue waiver. The U.S. Attorney agreed, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">That is basically correct, your Honor. It is unquestionably the intent of this agreement that the Defendant\u2019s relevant conduct for purposes of the Guidelines is based on the 90 thousand dollar figure, and that is provided both in Paragraph C-4, and then the factual basis for that is explained in the stipulation. And it is correct that the issue of venue is underneath the terms of Paragraph A-4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-13\">Supplemental Appendix at 117-118.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-14\">O\u2019Keefe contends paragraph C-4 prohibited the Government from advocating a sentence based upon harm caused to senior citizens before he knew the scheme was fraudulent. We disagree. Paragraph C-4 plainly refers to the maximum loss for which O\u2019Keefe\u2019s offense level would be calculated pursuant to Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 2Bl.l(b). Under that provision, the $90,000 loss for which O\u2019Keefe would be responsible results in an eight-level increase in his offense level. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(E) (2006). This reading of paragraph C-4 is consistent with the rest of the plea agreement and the parties\u2019 statements before the District Court. For instance, under paragraph B-3, the Government expressly reserved the right to allocution on \u201cthe full extent and nature of\u2019 O\u2019Keefe\u2019s involvement in the fraud. Although the Government conceded O\u2019Keefe did not knowingly defraud senior citizens, no provision of the plea agreement prevented the Government from explaining the overall impact of his actions and his failure to alert authorities when he did become aware of the nature of the scheme. We cannot reasonably infer such a specific prohibition from paragraph C-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">District judges must follow a three-step analysis in sentencing criminal defendants. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). The district court must 1) continue to calculate a defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentence precisely as it would have before <em>United States v. Booker; </em>2) formally rule on the parties\u2019 motions, stating on the record whether it is granting a departure and how that departure affects the Guidelines calculation; and 3) exercise its discretion by considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247. At step three, the sentencing record should demonstrate the court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">First, O\u2019Keefe contends he was entitled to a four-level decrease in his offense level as a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in the fraud. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3B1.2 provides for a four-level decrease in the offense level of a \u201cminimal participant\u201d in any criminal activity and a two-level decrease in the offense level of a \u201cminor participant.\u201d A \u201cminimal participant\u201d is one who plays a minimal role in concerted activity and is \u201cplainly among the least culpable of those involved.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 4 (2006). This adjustment is to be applied infrequently. <em>Id. </em>A \u201cminor participant\u201d is one who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role cannot be described as minimal. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 5 (2006). The District Court concluded he was a \u201cminor participant\u201d entitled only to a two-level decrease.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">In applying \u00a7 3B1.2, the district court must weigh the totality of the particular circumstances in a defendant\u2019s case, and is not required to grant an adjustment based solely upon the defendant\u2019s assertions. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(C) (2006). The district court\u2019s inquiry involves weighing factors such the defendant\u2019s relationship to other participants, his knowledge of others\u2019 activities, the importance of his actions to the success of the venture, his economic interest in the scheme and his physical participation. District courts exercise broad discretion in applying \u00a7 3B1.2 and their rulings are left largely undisturbed on appeal. <em>United States v. Haut, </em>107 F.3d 213, 217 (3d Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Isaza-Zapata, </em>148 F.3d 236, 238-39 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">Following the first sentencing hearing, the District Court noted O\u2019Keefe discovered the scheme was fraudulent and nonetheless failed to notify authorities and collected $90,000 from Doris Gilbert. In addition, O\u2019Keefe enjoyed an economic interest in the scheme by retaining between five and ten percent of his collections for himself. The District Court did not err by concluding O\u2019Keefe was a minor, not minimal, participant in the fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Next, O\u2019Keefe argues the District Court violated the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>clause when it applied the 2003 Sentencing Guidelines Manual to reduce his offense level for his role in the offense before it reduced his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. Because O\u2019Keefe did not present this argument to the District Court, we review it for plain error. <em>United States v. Dyer, </em>325 F.3d 464, 467 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">When O\u2019Keefe committed his offense in 2001, the Sentencing Guidelines Manual Application Instructions simply listed the steps to be taken in calculating a sentence sequentially, (a) through (i). U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.1 (2001). In 2003, the Sentencing Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>sion added text specifically directing district courts to make adjustments sequentially, such that a district court adjusts an offense level for role in the offense before it adjusts for the defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.1 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">The District Court properly calculated the adjustments applicable to O\u2019Keefe\u2019s offense. Generally, a district court should apply the Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing, unless doing so would expose the defendant to greater punishment than if he were punished under the Guidelines in effect at the time he committed his crime. The 2003 amendment merely clarified the formulaic application of the Guidelines we directed district courts to employ in previous cases. It did not alter \u201cthe definition of criminal conduct or increase the penalty by which a crime is punishable.\u201d <em>California Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 506 n. 3, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">O\u2019Keefe also challenges the District Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(B), which requires a two-level enhancement where \u201ca substantial part of a fraudulent scheme was committed from outside the United States.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(B) (2006). O\u2019Keefe argues the enhancement is inapplicable to his offense because he was a resident of Canada at the time of his offense and did not know he was involved in extracting money from persons in the United States. O\u2019Keefe\u2019s position lacks merit. First, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s Canadian residence does not except him from the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(B) enhancement\u2019s coverage. Second, O\u2019Keefe stipulated he \u201cunderstood that Gerlach and others acting with him expected to receive money sent by wire transfer from Americans\u201d and stated at his sentencing hearing that he \u201cknew the money was coming from the United States.\u201d The District Court did not err when it applied the \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(B) enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">Next, O\u2019Keefe argues the District Court failed to make findings regarding his sentence objections as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(i)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">The District Court made the requisite Rule 32 findings during the first sentencing proceedings, and reaffirmed those findings at the second sentencing hearing. At the second hearing, the District Court stated, \u201c[Njothing in my view has fundamentally changed.\u201d The District Court was under no obligation to reconsider and re-issue its initial findings following our <em>Booker </em>remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">Finally, O\u2019Keefe contends the District Court misapplied <em>Booker </em>when it accorded the Sentencing Guidelines \u201cgreat weight\u201d and imposed an unreasonable sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">The Guidelines continue to carry considerable weight in the sentencing process. <em>See United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2006). Here, the District Court properly recognized the \u201chighly advisory\u201d quality of the Guidelines, and gave meaningful consideration to the relevant statutory factors and O\u2019Keefe\u2019s particular circumstances. <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 332 (3d Cir.2006). The Guidelines range applicable to O\u2019Keefe was 10-16 months. . O\u2019Keefe\u2019s sentence \u2014 five months in prison and five months of home detention \u2014 was entirely reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">We conclude the Government did not breach O\u2019Keefe\u2019s plea agreement and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>the District Court imposed a proper and reasonable sentence. We will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
