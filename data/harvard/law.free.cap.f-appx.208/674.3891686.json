ARLEN BEAM, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Rodgerick Lackey appeals from the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denial of his motion to vacate, set aside, or correct sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Lackey was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). His sentence was enhanced pursuant to United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) for having two prior felony offenses \u2014 a crime of violence (assault) and a controlled substance offense (selling crack cocaine), both from North Carolina state court. Due to the enhancement, Lackey\u2019s guidelines range was 110-137 months, but the statutory maximum was 120 months. He was ultimately sentenced to 110 months in prison, and his conviction was affirmed on direct appeal in <em>United States v. Lackey, </em>334 F.3d 1224 (10th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">In his section 2255 motion, Lackey argued that his sentence was improperly enhanced under Apprendi<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and/or <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to anticipate and make the <em>Booker </em>argument. Before the district court ruled, Lackey realized that one of his prior North Carolina convictions might not qualify as a prior felony \u2014 which would have invalidated the section 2K2.1 enhancement. Lackey therefore asked the district court for leave to amend his 2255 pleading, seeking to add the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to realize that the underlying conviction did not qualify as a felony under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-14\">The district court denied the 2255 motion, finding that because Lackey was sentenced below the statutory maximum, he was not entitled to <em>Apprendi </em>relief at the time of sentencing. The district court further held that counsel was not ineffective for failing to anticipate <em>Blakely</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or <em>Booker </em>rulings. The district court denied Lackey\u2019s motion to amend as \u201cmoot,\u201d and accordingly did not address the ineffective assistance claim regarding whether his pri- or offense qualified as a felony. The district court declined to issue a certificate of appealability.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-15\">A panel of this circuit issued a certificate on the issue raised in Lackey\u2019s motion to amend: whether Lackey\u2019s counsel was ineffective for failing to anticipate, and argue, that a prior state court drug conviction could not be used to enhance the underlying federal sentence, because it was not a felony under section 2K2.1. The court specifically directed counsel to its decision in <em>United States v. Plakio, </em>433 F.3d 692 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Lackey must show that his counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d and that the deficient performance resulted in prejudice. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 691-92, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">Lackey\u2019s trial counsel did not contest that Lackey\u2019s prior North Carolina drug offense was a prior felony. The guidelines define a prior felony, for sentencing purposes, as an offense \u201cpunishable\u201d by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year, regardless of whether the state calls the offense a felony, and regardless of the actual term of imprisonment imposed. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1 cmt. n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Lackey argues that his prior offense was not a felony for guidelines purposes, because he was convicted of a crime for which he was not punishable<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by more than twelve-months\u2019 imprisonment. Thus, Lackey contends counsel was ineffective for so stipulating.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">Even though everyone agrees that the maximum sentence <em>Lackey </em>could have received was less than one year, prior to 2005 our precedent indicated that Lackey\u2019s particular maximum sentence was not relevant in determining whether the offense constituted a prior felony for purposes of section 2K2.1. In <em>United States v. Arnold, </em>113 F.3d 1146 (10th Cir.1997), we considered the question of when a prior offense was a felony for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). In <em>Arnold, </em>as a result of having a minimal number of criminal history points, the defendant was given an eleven-month sentence in Kansas state court for a conviction involving unlawful possession of a firearm. Under Kansas law, the maximum possible sentence for this offense was twenty-three months \u2014 for a hypothetical offender with a more extensive criminal history. Additionally, under the Kansas sentencing scheme used at that time, the trial court could enhance a sentence, solely at its discretion, based on an expressly non-exclusive list of aggravating factors. <em>Id. </em>at 1148 n. 1. We held that because section 922 penalized anyone convicted of a crime <em>punishable </em>by more than one year, Arnold\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a pri- or felony. <em>Id. </em>at 1148. We noted that, \u201c[w]hat matters is not the actual sentence which the appellant received, but the maximum possible sentence.\u201d <em>Id. See also United States v. Norris, </em>319 F.3d 1278, 1281-82 (10th Cir.2003) (holding that the mere possibility of an upward departure beyond one year qualifies a Kansas offense as one punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">The state of the law on this issue changed somewhat after our 2005 decision in <em>Plakio, </em>however. 433 F.3d 692. In <em>Plakio, </em>the defendant argued on direct appeal that his prior offense was not a felony for section 2K2.1 purposes. Plakio\u2019s prior convictions occurred in Kansas state court, and according to his offense and criminal history, his \u201cpresumptive\u201d maximum sentence was 9-11 months. But, because a Kansas trial judge could enhance a sentence beyond the presumptive sentence, based upon its discretionary finding of certain aggravating factors, <em>Arnold, </em>113 F.3d at 1148, the sentencing court found that Plakio\u2019s prior sentence was one that was punishable by more than one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>We reversed. <em>Plakio, </em>433 F.3d at 695. Plakio was sentenced in Kansas state court in 2001 during a particularly uncertain time in Kansas sentencing law. After <em>Apprendi </em>was decided in June 2000, the Kansas Supreme Court limited the discretionary flexibility of Kansas trial judges to enhance sentences. <em>See State v. Gould, </em>271 Kan. 394, 23 P.3d 801, 814 (2001) (invalidating all upward departures in cases that were pending on direct appeal or were not yet final as of June 26, 2000). Thus, between June 2000 and June 2002,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> a Kansas defendant\u2019s presumptive sentence was also his maximum possible sentence. Because Plakio was sentenced in 2001, his maximum possible sentence was less than one year. <em>Plakio, </em>433 F.3d at 695. In essence, our <em>Plakio </em>decision held that in Kansas, during the period of June 2000 through June 2002, the \u201chypothetical\u201d defendant no longer existed. The only relevant question was the maximum sentence that the actual defendant before the court could have received for his prior offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Lackey argues that based on the <em>Ap</em>prendi-founded reasoning of <em>Plakio, </em>his trial counsel should have known that his earlier North Carolina drug offense did not qualify as a prior felony for federal sentencing purposes. Although Lackey does not clearly explain his argument in this regard, he apparently contends that the Kansas sentencing scheme as articulated in <em>Gould </em>and applied in <em>Plakio, </em>was binding in North Carolina, and therefore his sentence, which was imposed during the 2000-2002 time frame, should receive Plakio-type treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">This argument, if we correctly understand it, is without merit. Whether or not Plakio\u2019s reasoning applied at the North Carolina proceeding we consider in this appeal, Lackey\u2019s counsel did not have the benefit of the <em>Plakio </em>decision at the time of Lackey\u2019s sentencing. We simply cannot find that counsel was ineffective for failing to anticipate and make the <em>Plakio </em>argument because <em>Plakio </em>was decided in 2005, long after Lackey was sentenced in 2002, and his conviction was affirmed on appeal in 2003. Lackey\u2019s argument that <em>Plakio </em>represented only an extension of the law as announced in <em>Arnold </em>and <em>Norris </em>is unavailing. The dissent in <em>Plakio </em>argued that the court should look only at the maximum possible sentence allowed for any defendant convicted of the particular crime \u2014 not simply the defendant before the court. 433 F.3d at 698 (O\u2019Brien, J., dissenting). Judge O\u2019Brien noted that this approach, not the court\u2019s approach, would be \u201ca logical extension\u201d of the precedents in <em>Norris </em>and <em>Arnold. Id. </em>Though Lackey argues that <em>Plakio </em>did not change our circuit\u2019s law on the contested point, Judge O\u2019Brien was certainly convinced otherwise. In light of this, we cannot fault trial counsel for failing to predict the course that <em>Plakio </em>would chart. <em>Bullock v. Carver, </em>297 F.3d 1036, 1052 (10th Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cclairvoyance is not a required attribute of effective representation\u201d) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">We grant Lackey\u2019s motion to amend his section 2255 motion. However, because Lackey cannot establish ineffective assistance of counsel, we deny relief on that motion. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b699-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.
