His counsel has moved to withdraw, filing a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">On appeal, Fernandez\u2019s counsel argues the district court erred in sentencing Fernandez to 120 months in prison. We disagree, because in the circumstances here, the district court had no authority to sentence Fernandez below the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Chacon, </em>330 F.3d 1065, 1066 (8th Cir.2003) (only authority for district court to depart from statutory minimum sentence is found in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and (f), which apply only when government makes motion for substantial assistance or defendant qualifies for safety-valve relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Having carefully reviewed the record in accordance with <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment, and we grant counsel leave to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\">.
