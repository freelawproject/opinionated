We will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">In 1995, Williams pleaded guilty to drug and firearms offenses in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Williams was sentenced to 270 months in prison. This Court affirmed the judgment on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-12\">In 1999, Williams filed in District Court a motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The District Court denied the motion, and this Court denied a certificate of appealability. The District Court also denied Williams\u2019 subsequent motion for a modification of his sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). This Court affirmed. This Court also denied requests by Williams for authorization under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-17\">In 2004, Williams filed in District Court another motion to vacate sentence under \u00a7 2255. The District Court transferred the motion to this Court to treat as a request under \u00a7 2244 for authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion. This Court denied authorization, and Williams then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to \u00a7 2241 in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania raising the same claims he sought to raise in his \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-18\">The District Court did not err in dismissing Williams\u2019 \u00a7 2241 petition. Motions pursuant to \u00a7 2255 are the presumptive means by which federal prisoners can challenge their convictions or sentences on constitutional grounds. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Although a petitioner may challenge a conviction pursuant to \u00a7 2241 where a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d a \u00a7 2255 motion is not inadequate or ineffective because the sentencing court denied relief, or because the petitioner is unable to meet the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255. <em>Cradle v. United States, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538-39 (3d Cir.2002). Rather, a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim. <em>Id. </em>at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Williams has not made such a showing. Williams was unable to meet the gatekeeping requirements of \u00a7 2255, and he may not evade those requirements by seeking relief under \u00a7 2241.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we will dismiss this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-13\">. Williams sought to raise claims that his conviction could not be sustained under <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), that his sentence was invalid under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-14\">. Williams\u2019 case is distinguishable from <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), in which the Court allowed the petitioner to raise a <em>Bailey </em>claim under \u00a7 2241. The petitioner in that case had no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction for a crime that <em>Bailey </em>may have negated. <em>Id. </em>at 251. As recognized by the District Court, Williams raised a <em>Bailey </em>claim in District Court in a motion to withdraw his plea. <em>See United States v. Williams, 1996 </em>WL 119972 (E.D.Pa. 1996) (denying motion to withdraw plea).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b141-25\">. Appellee\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is unnecessary and, therefore, denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
