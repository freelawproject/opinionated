Dearco argues that, as a mere crew member on the vessel in question, he was entitled to a minor-role reduction. He further claims that the district court misapprehended its authority to depart downward from the Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of allegedly inhumane conditions of confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-15\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s denial of a minor role reduction. <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>139 F.3d 820, 821-22 (11th Cir.1998). A minor participant, defined as \u201cone who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal,\u201d may receive a two-level reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(a), (b), comment.(n.5). A sentencing court has substantial discretion in its assessment of the two \u201cfact-intensive\u201d considerations that inform its decision to grant or deny a minor role reduction. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>291 F.3d 1274, 1278 (11th Cir.2002). The first of these considerations is the magnitude of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense of conviction; \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>establish that he played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which he has already been held accountable \u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy\u2014 should the district court grant\u201d a minor role reduction. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 944 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en </em>banc). Second, \u201cwhere the record evidence is sufficient,\u201d a district court may \u201cmeasure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 934. When making the minor-role determination in a drug case, the sentencing court may consider \u201cthe amount of drugs, fair market value of drugs, amount of money to be paid to the courier, equity interest in the drugs, role in planning the criminal scheme, and role in the distribution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">\u201cSo long as the basis of the trial court\u2019s decision is supported by the record and does not involve a misapplication of a rule of law, ... it will be rare for [this Court] to conclude that the sentencing court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. This is not one of those rare instances. It was Dearco\u2019s burden to demonstrate entitlement to a minor role reduction, <em>id. </em>at 939, and the district court did not clearly err in finding that Dearco failed to meet his burden. In reaching this conclusion, the court emphasized the sheer quantity of drugs for which Dearco was found responsible. It further explained that, although the ship\u2019s captain received a role increase, Dearco was no less culpable than the other crew members, none of whom received a role reduction. In light of these circumstances and the district court\u2019s \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in assessing their significance, we affirm the denial of a minor role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Nor are we persuaded by Dearco\u2019s second claim. Dearco argues that, because the district court\u2019s remarks did not explicitly track the three-part analysis set forth in <em>United States v. Pressley, </em>345 F.3d 1205 (11th Cir.2003), it is impossible to determine whether the court understood its authority to grant a downward departure. He asserts that the district court never acknowledged its discretion to depart on the basis of inhumane conditions of confinement and never specifically analyzed whether the conditions of confinement were so unusual as to compel a sentence outside the range recommended by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">We \u201cmay not review at all the district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart from the guidelines\u2019 sentencing range, but [may] review <em>de novo </em>the question of whether the district court erroneously believed it lacked authority to depart.\u201d <em>Pressley, </em>345 F.3d at 1209 (citation omitted). Even after <em>Booker, </em>our \u201creview of decisions regarding downward departures remains limited.\u201d <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0t\">Before <em>Booker, </em>we stated repeatedly that section 3742(a) of Title 18 of the United States Code left us without jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal of a discretionary decision of the district court to not apply a downward departure, so long as the district court did not incorrectly believe that it lacked the authority to apply a departure. Although the Supreme Court in <em>Booker </em>excised section 3742(e), it left section 3742(a) intact ... [O]ur precedent similarly remains intact, and, therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the decision of the district court not to apply a downward departure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b760-8\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). Absent specific cause to suspect otherwise, \u201cwe assume\u201d that \u201cthe sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>United States v. Chase, </em>174 F.3d 1193, 1195 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Here, the record contains nothing to indicate or suggest that the district court misapprehended its authority to depart downward. On the contrary, the district court expressly found that, notwithstanding its concern over the conditions described by Dearco, the alleged treatment was not so grave as to be \u201cinhumane\u201d and therefore, in its judgment, did not warrant a departure. Dearco expressly cited <em>Pressley, </em>the district court evinced no doubt as to the applicability of that precedent, and the government itself acknowledged the court\u2019s authority to impose a lesser sentence by arguing that the alleged conditions of confinement did not, as a factual matter, entitle Dearco to a <em>Pressley </em>departure. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s denial of Dearco\u2019s request for a departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
