McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">Defendant Derek Tyrone Harrison argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of a term of supervised release following his violation of an initial term of supervised release was neither reasoned nor reasonable. We reject this argument and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-10\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b689-11\">In 1998, Mr. Harrison pleaded guilty in the District of Kansas to seven counts of robbery, for which the court sentenced him to concurrent terms of 109 months imprisonment followed by three years supervised release. Mr. Harrison\u2019s term of supervised release began September 14, 2005. On November 18, 2005, his probation officer informed the district court that Mr. Harrison had violated the terms of his release. Following Mr. Harrison\u2019s stipulation to two violations, the district court ordered him to reside at a halfway house for up to 180 days and to complete a residential substance abuse program.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-12\">On February 10, 2006, Mr. Harrison\u2019s probation officer informed the court that Mr. Harrison had violated the halfway house residency condition. At a hearing before the district court, Mr. Harrison again stipulated to violating the terms of his release. Noting that he found supervised release unpalatable, he requested a sentence of twelve months and one day imprisonment with no supervised release. The court revoked Mr. Harrison\u2019s current supervised release, rejected his request, and sentenced him to eight months incarceration to be followed by twenty-four months supervised release. The court explained that it had \u201cconsidered the nature and circumstances of the violations, as well as the characteristics of the defendant, as well as the sentencing objectives required by statute.\u201d R. Vol. II, at 5. The court \u201calso considered the advisory, nonbinding Chapter 7 policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d as to what the proper sentence should be for a violation of the terms of supervised release. <em>Id.; see also </em>United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) Ch. 7 (2005). The court found that the sentence imposed would \u201caddress reintegration objectives and provide deterrence from subsequent criminal behavior.\u201d R. Vol. II at 6. The court also noted that it was \u201cspecifically ... disregarding [Defendant\u2019s sentencing request] because his history of drug abuse warrants further treatment,\u201d and because continued monitoring under supervised release could help address Mr. Harrison\u2019s mental health issues. <em>Id. </em>at 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">On appeal, Mr. Harrison contends that the district court\u2019s imposition of supervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>release was neither \u201creasoned nor reasonable\u201d under <em>United States v. Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d 1236, 1241 (10th Cir. 2005), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). He argues that the district court\u2019s assertions regarding its consideration of the sentencing factors listed under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) were merely \u201cperfunctory recitations of what the sentencing court knew she was to consider, without any indication that she had actually considered the factors as applied to Mr. Harrison.\u201d Brief for Defendant-Appellant at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">We review a sentence imposed after a violation of supervised release under a \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Kelley, </em>359 F.3d 1302, 1304 (10th Cir.2004). Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), if a defendant\u2019s original offense was, as in this case, a class C felony, then a district court may punish the defendant\u2019s violation of the terms of supervised release by revoking that release and imposing up to two years imprisonment. Furthermore, if the court imposes a term of imprisonment \u201cless than the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under subsection (e)(3), the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment,\u201d the length of which is not to \u201cexceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h). In announcing a new sentence, the court must consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>957 F.2d 770, 774 (10th Cir.1992). The sentencing court, however, need not \u201cconsider individually each factor listed in \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d or \u201crecite any magic words to show us that it fulfilled its responsibility to be mindful of the factors that Congress has instructed it to consider.\u201d <em>Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d at 1242 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). In addition, the district court must consider, but need not follow, the sentencing recommendations for violations of supervised release set forth by the U.S. Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Ch. 7; <em>Lee, </em>957 F.2d at 774r-75. Last, as we have previously made clear, a revocation sentence must be both \u201creasoned and reasonable.\u201d <em>Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">The sentence imposed by the district court in this case easily satisfies these requirements. First, the record recounted above makes plain that the court\u2019s decision was reasoned. The district court explained that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors before imposing sentence. Moreover, the court credited particular factors as militating for the sentence in this case. Mr. Harrison contends that these explanations were \u201cperfunctory,\u201d but what additional verbiage would satisfy him remains unclear. In any event, we disagree with his characterization. As we noted above, a sentencing court need not utter \u201cmagic words\u201d to satisfy its duty of reasoned decision making, <em>see Contreras-Martinez, </em>409 F.3d at 1242, and the explanations offered here were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">Second, the terms of Mr. Harrison\u2019s sentence are eminently reasonable. The Sentencing Guidelines suggest a five- to eleven-month sentence for a defendant in Mr. Harrison\u2019s position. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4(a). Mr. Harrison\u2019s eight month prison sentence falls in the middle of this range. Based on this prison term, the court was authorized to impose up to twenty-eight months of supervised release under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (thirty-six months of supervised release authorized for a Class C felony, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(2), less eight months of imprisonment actually im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>posed, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h)). Mr. Harrison\u2019s twenty-four-month term falls within this limit. Thus, in sentencing Mr. Harrison, the district court complied with statutory requirements, adopted the Guidelines\u2019 recommendations, and explained its reasons for doing so. Such a process is not only reasonable but exemplary. As such, we uphold the sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-13\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 (eff. Dec. 1, 2006) and 10th Cir. R. 32.1 (eff. Jan. 1, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
