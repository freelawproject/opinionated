Cox (\u201cCox\u201d) petitions for review of a final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (\u201cOPM\u201d) decision that Cox was not eligible to apply for and receive survivor annuity benefits. <em>Estate of Cox v. Office Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DA-0831-05-0558-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 23, 2005) <em>(\u201cOrder </em>\u201d). Because the Board\u2019s decision is in accordance with law and does not otherwise contain reversible error, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b868-28\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b868-29\">Earl Cox retired from the Department of Justice on February 1, 1978. At the time of his retirement, Earl Cox elected a survivor annuity for his wife, Betty H. Cox, pursuant to the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). Earl Cox died on October 30, 2003. His death was not reported to OPM, which continued to deposit his annuity into a bank account. Betty H. Cox died on September 7, 2004. After her death, Kenneth E. Cox, the executor of her estate, notified OPM that both his mother and father had died and sought survivor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>benefits on behalf of his mother for the period of time between their deaths. OPM determined that benefits were not payable because the application for survivor benefits was not filed during the lifetime of Betty H. Cox. <em>Order, </em>slip op. at 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">Cox filed a petition for review of OPM\u2019s decision with the Board. In an initial decision, the administrative judge affirmed OPM\u2019s decision, citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8345(e), 8331(H),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.643, and our decision in <em>Davis v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>918 F.2d 944 (Fed.Cir.1990). <em>Order, </em>slip op. at 3-5. The administrative judge\u2019s initial decision became the final decision of the Board on December 28, 2005 when Cox chose not to petition the Board for review. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113. This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">This court must affirm a Board decision unless it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>see also Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). The burden of establishing reversible error in a Board decision rests upon the petitioner. <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-11\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b869-12\">On appeal, Cox argues that our decision in <em>Simpson v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>347 F.3d 1361 (Fed.Cir.2003), overturned our previous decision in Davis. Alternatively, Cox argues that <em>Davis </em>conflicts with earlier precedent, <em>Roebling v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>788 F.2d 1544 (Fed.Cir.1986), and was therefore wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-13\">As Cox acknowledges, the facts in Davis are very similar to those at issue in this case. In Davis, the annuitant elected a survivor annuity for his wife. 918 F.2d at 945. The annuitant died, and his wife died shortly thereafter without having filed a survivor\u2019s claim to an annuity. <em>Id. </em>We held that 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8345(e), 8331(11) and the relevant regulations provide that a right to a survivor annuity \u201cdoes not vest automatically; an application must first be filed before there is any entitlement to a survivor annuity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 946. We also held that the application must be filed before the survivor\u2019s death. <em>Id. </em>\u201cAccordingly, if a potential survivor annuitant does not make application during his or her lifetime, there can be no accrual of any unpaid annuity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b869-14\">Cox argues that <em>Simpson </em>renders <em>Davis </em>inapplicable by creating a general duty on OPM to advise individuals of their retirement rights. We disagree. In <em>Simpson, </em>we noted that OPM had a statutory duty to inform an <em>annuitant </em>of the requirements that must be met to reelect a spousal annuity after a divorce. 347 F.3d at 1364. Because \u201cOPM\u2019s notices of record fail[ed] to comply with the <em>statutory requirement of notice,\u201d </em>we reversed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Board\u2019s denial of the former spouse\u2019s application for a survivor annuity. <em>Id. </em>at 1364,1367 (emphasis added). However, as we acknowledged in <em>Davis, </em>\u201c[t]here is no statutory duty imposed on OPM to notify <em>potential survivor annuitants </em>of the requirement to file a claim for an annuity.\u201d 918 F.2d at 946. Because Cox was a potential survivor annuitant, and not an annuitant, <em>Simpson </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">Cox\u2019s remaining alternative arguments are unpersuasive. The administrative judge correctly applied 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8345(e), 8331(11), 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.643, and our decision in <em>Davis. </em>Because the Board\u2019s decision is in accordance with law and does not otherwise contain reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b869-9\">. Section 8345 of the statute provides, in relevant part, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b869-10\">after the death of an employee, Member, or annuitant, no benefit based on his service shall be paid from the Fund unless an application therefore is received in the Office of Personnel Management within 30 years after the death or other event which gives rise to title to the benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8345(i)(2).
