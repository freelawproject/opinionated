R.App. P. 3.4(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b547-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Darwin Gonzalo Dela Cruz petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) decision adopting and affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) finding that Dela Cruz was removable under \u00a7 237(a)(2)(B)\u00ae of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae. Dela Cruz argues that he cannot be removed for his drug conviction because he qualifies for Federal First Offender Act (\u201cFFOA\u201d) treatment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3607. Dela Cruz also argues that the BIA erred in failing to grant or address his motion to remand for consideration of new evidence unrelated to his drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Dela Cruz was placed in removal proceedings after he was convicted of three crimes: Promoting a Dangerous Drug in the Third Degree, Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 712-1243; Prohibited Acts Related to Drug Paraphernalia, Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 329-43.5; and Abuse of a Family or Household Member, Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 709-906. Dela Cruz was sentenced for his drug convictions in 2003 under Hawaii\u2019s rehabilitative statute, Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 706-622.5. That statute provides that the court shall, upon written application, expunge a first-time offender\u2019s formal conviction after the person has \u201csuccessfully completed\u201d probation. Dela Cruz was sentenced to five years of probation on each of the two drug counts, with the sentences to ran concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-12\">The IJ found that Dela Cruz was removable based on his dangerous drug conviction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(B)\u00ae for \u201cviolati[ng] ... a state law relating to a controlled substance as defined in Section 102 of the [Controlled [S]ubstances [A]ct, 21 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]802.\u201d The IJ denied Dela Cruz\u2019s application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">While Dela Cruz\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s decision was pending before the BIA, Dela Cruz filed a motion to remand based on new evidence, claiming that his conviction for domestic abuse had been set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and further held that the drag paraphernalia conviction was an independent ground for removal. The BIA did not address Dela Cruz\u2019s motion to remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">We deny the petition with respect to Dela Cruz\u2019s FFOA claim. We have held that \u201cno alien may be deported based on an offense that could have been tried under the [Federal First Offender] Act, but is instead prosecuted under state law, where the findings are expunged pursuant to a state rehabilitative statute.\u201d <em>Lujan-Armendariz v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 728, 749 (9th Cir.2000). However, the conviction must be expunged at the time of removal proceedings; it is insufficient that the conviction may be expunged in the future when and if the person completes probation. <em>Chavez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1284, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>1291-92 (9th Cir.2004). D\u00e9la Cruz is not entitled to FFOA treatment because his convictions have not been expunged.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">We grant the petition with respect to Dela Cruz\u2019s motion to the BIA to remand for new evidence, which the BIA failed to address. The BIA must address and rule upon remand motions, \u201cgiving specific, cogent reasons for a grant or denial.\u201d <em>Narayan v. Ashcroft, </em>384 F.3d 1065, 1068 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The petition for review is DENIED in part, GRANTED in part, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
