We conclude that Francis is not entitled to mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-24\">Mandamus relief is available only when the petitioner has a clear right to the relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>sought. <em>In re First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>860 F.2d 135, 138 (4th Cir.1988). Further, mandamus is a drastic remedy and should only be used in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Kerr v. United States Dist. Court, </em>426 U.S. 394, 402, 96 S.Ct. 2119, 48 L.Ed.2d 725 (1976); <em>In re Beard, </em>811 F.2d 818, 826 (4th Cir.1987). The relief sought by Francis is not available by way of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Accordingly, although we grant Francis\u2019 motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, we deny the petition for writ of mandamus. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
