The sentences followed his guilty plea to charges of conspiracy to possess and possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while aboard a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii) and 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j). He argues that the district court erred in failing to grant a minor-role reduction and in imposing unreasonable sentences. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-7\">Campaz first challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to grant him a minor-role adjustment to his base offense level. He contends that the court did not properly consider his limited role in the transportation of the cocaine and did not properly balance his culpability relative to that of the other participants. Campaz argues that he was \u201csimply a mariner\u201d with no leadership role. He received a flat fee for the delivery and was only expected to perform mundane duties on the ship. The district court found that a minor-role reduction was not appropriate because the ship was transporting such a large amount of cocaine (2, 647 kilograms), and Campaz, a general crew member, was hired to do whatever was necessary to make the delivery. We review a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense under the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937-38 (11th Cir.1999) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-8\">A district court may award a two-level reduction in a defendant\u2019s offense level if it determines that he was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the criminal activity. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a \u201cminor participant\u201d if he is \u201cless culpable than most other participants,\u201d but has a role that \u201ccould not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. (n. 5). The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to the reduction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">In determining whether a minor-role reduction is warranted, a district court must: \u201cFirst, and most importantly ... measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which [he] was held accountable at sentencing....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 945. In some circumstances, the amount of drugs will be dispositive. <em>Id. </em>at 943. Second, a district court may measure the defendant\u2019s role against that of the other participants. <em>Id. </em>at 944. However, \u201c[t]he fact that a defendant\u2019s role may be less than that of other participants engaged in the relevant conduct may not be dispositive of role in the offense, since it is possible that none are minor ... participants.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-11\">We find no clear error in the district court\u2019s decision to deny Campaz\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction. As to the first prong of the <em>De Var\u00f3n </em>test, Campaz pleaded guilty to knowingly and willfully conspiring to transport drugs and knowingly and intentionally possessing drugs with an intent to distribute. In measuring Campaz\u2019s individual contribution against the crimes charged, the district court did not clearly err. Campaz knew of the nature of the voyage and was on board to do whatever was necessary to carry out the delivery. Based on the sheer volume of narcotics and Campaz\u2019s knowledge of the shipment\u2019s illegality, the district court properly denied the level reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 943 (\u201c[B]ecause the amount of drugs in a courier\u2019s possession ... may be the best indication of the magnitude of the courier\u2019s participation in the criminal enterprise, we do not foreclose the possibility that [the] amount of drugs may be dispositive \u2014 in and of it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>self \u2014 in the extreme case. As we held in <em>United States v. Asseff, </em>917 F.2d 502, 507 (11th Cir.1990), a defendant is generally not entitled to a minor-role reduction where a \u201cgreat amount of cocaine [is] involved,\u201d and the defendant has \u201capparent knowledge of [the] criminal activity.\u201d Notably, only 278.60 kilograms of cocaine was recovered in <em>Asseff, </em>as compared to the 2.647 kilograms here. <em>Id. </em>at 504. Regardless of whether Campaz knew the ultimate destination of the shipment, he knew that the boat\u2019s cargo was a large quantity of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">The district court did not have to reach the second prong of the <em>De Varon </em>analysis. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 945 (recognizing \u201cthat in many cases [the first method] of analysis will be dispositive\u201d). Even so, Campaz cannot show that he was less culpable than most of the other participants. \u201c[A] defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor role adjustment merely because [he] was somewhat less culpable than the other discernable participants. Rather, the district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em>in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. Of the eight men onboard, Campaz only distinguishes the conduct of two (the captain and engineer), but he cannot distinguish himself from the other five sailors.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">Campaz\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Dorvil, </em>784 F.Supp. 849 (S.D.Fla.1991), is misplaced. Aside from not being binding precedent on this court, the facts of <em>Dorvil </em>are distinguishable from those of this case. In <em>Dorvil, </em>only 227 kilograms of cocaine were being transported, as opposed to the 2.647 kilograms at issue here. <em>Id. </em>at 850. The defendants in <em>Dorvil </em>were not aware of the illegality of their conduct, whereas Campaz was fully aware of what he was doing. <em>Id. </em>The grant of a sentence reduction in <em>Dorvil </em>has no bearing on the facts here. The district court\u2019s denial of the minor-role reduction was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-10\">Campaz also contends that his sentences are unreasonable because the district court failed to properly consider the mitigating evidence he offered. He claims that the court improperly disregarded evidence of his age, economic situation, troubled childhood, limited education, and health problems. Further, Campaz asserts that the court should have taken into consideration the small amount of money he was paid, and the fact that an equally culpable codefendant received a lesser sentence and a more culpable codefendant received the same sentence as Campaz.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">\u201cPursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s instructions in <em>Booker, </em>we review a defendant\u2019s ultimate sentence, imposed after the district court has consulted the Guidelines and considered the factors set forth at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), for reasonableness. Our reasonableness review is \u2018deferential\u2019 and focuses on whether the sentence imposed fails to achieve the purposes of sentencing as stated in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Pope, </em>461 F.3d 1331, 1333 (11th Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-12\">A party challenging a sentence bears the burden of establishing that a sentence is unreasonable in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the record established below. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Some factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a) are: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, deter criminal activity, and protect the public from future crimes by the defendant; and (3) the need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(2), (6). Although a sentence within the guideline range is not per se reasonable, it usually will be. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. A district court need not mention each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors specifically. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">We find that, in fashioning Campaz\u2019s sentence, the district court properly considered the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court noted Campaz\u2019s difficult economic circumstances and need to provide for his family, but it determined that these facts failed to justify his criminal participation in transporting 2,647 kilograms of cocaine. The court recognized the need for deterrence and the substantial danger that such a large shipment of cocaine would present to the United States. We find that the court fully considered the mitigating evidence presented. Some of the facts Campaz urges on appeal were not argued during the sentencing hearing, although the district court had access to those facts in the presentence investigation report. There is nothing to indicate that it did not consider them. The court sentenced Campaz at the lowest end of the Guideline range, and the statutory maximum was life.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Campaz further argues that his sentences were unreasonable when compared to the sentences imposed on two of his codefendants. First, he asserts that one of his fellow crewman was equally responsible and yet received a sentence of only 87 months, instead of the 137 months Campaz received. Second, he argues that one co-defendant, who served as the engineer, was more culpable than he and yet received the same sentence. While 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) speaks of \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct,\u201d that principle generally applies more broadly outside the codefendant context, and the \u201c[disparity between the sentences imposed on codefendants is generally not an appropriate basis for relief on appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Regueiro, </em>240 F.3d 1321, 1325-26 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cAs the majority of circuit courts has recognized, to adjust the sentence of a co-defendant in order to cure an apparently unjustified disparity between defendants in an individual case will simply create another, wholly unwarranted disparity between the defendant receiving the adjustment and all similar offenders in other cases.\u201d <em>United States v. Chotas, </em>968 F.2d 1193, 1197-98 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">We refuse to create a never-ending cycle of sentence adjustment. But even if we do compare the sentences imposed on codefendants, Campaz\u2019s sentences were still reasonable. The district court found equal fault between Campaz and the codefendant he claims was more culpable. We have no reason to question that determination. Thus the two men were properly given the same sentence. Further, we note that the codefendant that Campaz claims was equally culpable but sentenced to a shorter term received a \u00a7 5K1.1 departure for providing substantial assistance to the authorities. There was no \u201cunwarranted sentence disparity]\u201d between the two. We conclude that the sentences imposed on Campaz were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
