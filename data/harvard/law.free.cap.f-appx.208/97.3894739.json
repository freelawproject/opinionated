Because we agree with the District Court that it had jurisdiction over this matter and that Solis had committed a crime of violence as defined by the laws of the Virgin Islands, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-14\">In October 1993, the United States Attorney filed an information against Solis alleging violations of two Virgin Islands laws. In April 1994, Solis pleaded guilty to robbery in the third degree and unlawful possession of a firearm. The District Court ultimately sentenced him to a five-year suspended sentence and five years probation on the robbery count, and five years imprisonment on the firearm count to be served consecutively with the probationary sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-15\">In June 2003, a Bronx grand jury returned a seven-count indictment against Solis. The following month, a petition was filed in the District Court to rev\u00f3cate Solis\u2019 probation. That same month, Solis pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court to two counts of robbery in the third degree, in violation of New York law. On December 12, 2005, the District Court heard argument on the petition to revoke probation. The Court concluded that it had jurisdiction to entertain the petition, and, having found that Solis committed a crime of violence as defined by the law of the Virgin Islands, revoked Solis\u2019 probation, rescinded the order suspending his sentence, and imposed a five-year sentence of incarceration. Solis timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Our review of the District Court\u2019s jurisdictional and legal rulings is plenary. <em>Brow v. Farrelly, </em>994 F.2d 1027, 1032 (3d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-17\">The first issue before us is that of the District Court\u2019s jurisdiction over this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>matter. In brief, in 1984 Congress amended the Revised Organic Act to confer \u201cthe entire jurisdiction of a District Court of the United States\u201d upon the District Court of the Virgin Islands, <em>Walker v. Gov\u2019t of the V.I., </em>230 F.3d 82, 86 (3d Cir.2000), while simultaneously limiting the local jurisdiction of that court to causes of action \u201cthe jurisdiction over which is not then vested by local law in the local court of the Virgin Islands.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1612(b). At the same time, Congress provided, in a savings clause, that when the Government of the Virgin Islands decided to vest exclusive jurisdiction over local causes of action in the local courts, all cases then pending before the District Court would properly remain in that court and \u201cmay be pursued to the final determination in the District Court of the Virgin Islands, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and the Supreme Court.\u201d 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1612 note. Effective January 1, 1994, the Virgin Islands legislature vested exclusive jurisdiction over local criminal actions in the Territorial Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Callwood v. Enos, </em>230 F.3d 627, 631 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Because this action was commenced in 1993, there is no doubt that, pursuant to the savings clause, the District Court properly exercised jurisdiction in 1994 when it accepted Solis\u2019 guilty plea and sentenced him. The question we must answer is whether that jurisdiction continued through 2005, when the District Court revoked Solis\u2019 probation and imposed the previously suspended sentence of five years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Solis argues that because the District Court no longer has jurisdiction to hear cases arising from the crimes underlying this action, it did not have jurisdiction over this matter. He relies heavily on our decisions in <em>Callwood v. Enos, </em>230 F.3d 627 (3d Cir.2000), <em>Parrott v. Gov\u2019t of the V.I., </em>230 F.3d 615 (3d Cir.2000), and <em>Walker v. Gov\u2019t of the V.I., </em>230 F.3d 82 (3d Cir.2000). As those cases are inapposite, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">In <em>Callwood, Parrott, </em>and <em>Walker, </em>we explained the interplay between the Territorial Court and the District Court when petitioners sentenced by the District Court for purely local offenses file habeas petitions pursuant to either Virgin Islands or United States law. Those cases stand for the proposition that \u201cthe relations[hip] between the District Court of the Virgin Islands and courts established by local law should be the same as those between district courts of the United States and state courts,\u201d <em>Walker, </em>230 F.3d at 87, such that habeas petitions under Virgin Islands law should be brought before the Territorial Court and habeas petitions under United States law should first be exhausted in Territorial Court before advancing to the District Court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b123-13\">Although the <em>Callwood </em>line of cases raised interesting questions about the relationship between the two courts, the reasoning of those decisions is simply inapplicable here, where what is at issue is an order of the District Court revoking its sentence of probation and rescinding the suspension of its sentence of incarceration because of violations committed by a defendant it had properly sentenced in the past. Unlike a habeas petition, which is a civil action that seeks to collaterally attack a sentence, <em>Parrott, </em>230 F.3d at 620, proceedings to revoke probation are neither civil, collateral, nor in any way distinct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>from the underlying action. In fact, the Virgin Islands law permitting the imposition of probation specifically allows the District Court to \u201crevoke or modify any condition of probation\u201d and, as discussed below, explicitly directs the District Court to \u201cforthwith revoke ... probation, rescind the order suspending execution of the underlying sentence and direct the incarceration\u201d of a defendant who commits a crime of violence while serving probation. V.I.Code Ann. tit. 5, \u00a7 3711.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">Although the parties have directed us to no factually similar cases, we note that courts have long held that sentencing courts have the power to revoke or modify probation or supervised release, even after the term has expired, as a way of policing the judgments that they have entered and punishing defendants for violating their terms. <em>See, e.g., Black v. Romano, </em>471 U.S. 606, 610-16, 105 S.Ct. 2254, 85 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985); <em>United States v. Sczubelek, </em>402 F.3d 175, 178-81 (3d Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Monteiro, </em>270 F.3d 465, 472 (7th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. Barton, </em>26 F.3d 490, 492 (4th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Bazzano, </em>712 F.2d 826, 835 (3d Cir.1983); <em>Sweet v. Sanford, </em>115 F.2d 213, 214 (5th Cir.1940). That the District Court of the Virgin Islands would not have jurisdiction to hear a newly-filed criminal case alleging violations of laws such as that underlying this case is wholly irrelevant. In sum, we find that the District Court had jurisdiction to enforce its judgment of sentence and ensure that Solis was punished for violating the terms of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Having found that the District Court correctly exercised jurisdiction, the only remaining question before us is whether the District Court properly found that Solis had committed a crime of violence as defined by Virgin Islands law, so as to trigger mandatory revocation of his term of probation pursuant to section 11 of title 5 of the Virgin Islands Code. We find that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Virgin Islands law provides that when a defendant on probation \u201cis convicted of a crime of violence, as defined in Title 23, section 451(e) of the Code, the court shall forthwith revoke such probation, rescind the order suspending execution of the underlying sentence and direct the incarceration of such defendant for the full term of such sentence.\u201d V.I.Code Ann. tit. 5, \u00a7 3711(b). A \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined to include \u201crobbery.\u201d V.I.Code Ann. tit. 23, \u00a7 451(e). Because neither sections 3711(b) nor 451(e) require that the conviction be one for a violation of Virgin Islands law, we must determine whether the definition of robbery in the third degree under New York law satisfies the definition of \u201crobbery\u201d or any other crime enumerated in section 451(e). <em>See Gov\u2019t of the V.I. v. James, </em>929 F.Supp. 201, 205 (D.Vi.1996); <em>cf. Nugent v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 162, 170-79 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Virgin Islands law defines robbery as \u201cthe unlawful taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence and against his will, by means of force or fear,\u201d V.I.Code Ann. tit. 14, \u00a7 1861, where the perpetrator acted with \u201ca specific intent to deprive permanently a rightful owner of his property,\u201d <em>Gov\u2019t of the V.I. v. Carmona, </em>422 F.2d 95, 98 (3d Cir.1970). Under New York law, one is guilty of robbery in the third degree \u201cwhen he forcibly steals property,\u201d N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 160.05, which requires the perpetrator to use or threaten the use of force \u201cin the course of committing a larceny,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 160.00. Because larceny requires the intent to deprive another of his property, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 155.05, it is clear that robbery in the third degree under New York law satisfies the definition of robbery under Virgin Islands law and that the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>trict Court correctly concluded that it is a crime of violence pursuant to section 451(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-7\">. Starting in October 2004, the Territorial Court became known as the Superior Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b123-9\">. In <em>George v. Sively, </em>254 F.3d 438, 441 (3d Cir.2001), we explained that the language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 allowed for motions challenging a District Court sentence for purely local crimes to be brought directly in the District Court of the Virgin Islands.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
