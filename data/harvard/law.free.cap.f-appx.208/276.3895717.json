R.Crim.P. 36 motion as a petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 (2000), and dismissing it for lack of jurisdiction. Farmer also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>United States v. Farmer, </em>No. 3:00-cr-00385-CMC-AL (D.S.C. July 7, 2006; Aug. 15, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
