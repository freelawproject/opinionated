R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-19\">Defendant Miguel Ascencio-Vences appeals the thirty-seven month sentence imposed by the district court after Ascencio-Vences pled guilty to one count of illegal reentry into the United States following deportation after conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-21\">On June 9, 2005, Ascencio-Vences was arrested by Border Patrol agents near Columbus, New Mexico. Ascencio-Vences admitted to the agents that he had illegally entered the United States. A review of Ascencio-Vences\u2019 criminal records indicated he had previously been convicted in California state court of possessing mari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>juana for sale and sentenced to sixteen months\u2019 imprisonment. A review of Ascencio-Vences\u2019 immigration records also indicated he had been twice deported.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">The day after his arrest, June 10, 2005, Ascencio-Vences was charged by complaint with one count of illegal reentry into the United States following deportation after conviction for an aggravated felony, i.e., possessing marijuana for sale, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1326(a)(1), (a)(2), and (b)(2). A federal grand jury subsequently indicted Ascencio-Vences on the same general charge. On October 26, 2005, Ascencio-Vences pled guilty, pursuant to a written plea agreement, to the charge set forth in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">On or about December 8, 2005, the probation office submitted to the district court its presentence investigation report (PSR). The PSR assigned a base offense level of eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a), imposed a sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because of Ascencio-Vences\u2019 prior conviction for possessing marijuana for sale, and reduced the offense level by three levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. Based upon the resulting final offense level of twenty-one and Ascencio-Vences\u2019 criminal history category of IV, the PSR recommended a guideline range of 57 to 71 months. Ascencio-Vences responded to the PSR by filing a sentencing memorandum arguing that the district court should, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), impose a sentence below the recommended guideline range because: (1) the sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) overrepresented the seriousness of his prior conviction; and (2) he was suffering from severe pain as a result of a prostate condition, but was not receiving adequate treatment for the condition while incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">At the sentencing hearing on March 21, 2006, the district court reviewed Ascencio-Vences\u2019 arguments and asked his counsel what sentence he would consider reasonable. Ascencio-Vences\u2019 counsel responded that \u201csomething in th[e] neighborhood\u201d of \u201c33 to 41 months\u201d would be \u201cappropriate given the arguments that [he] ha[d] made.\u201d ROA, Vol. Ill at 9. Although the government disputed that the sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) overrepresented the seriousness of Ascencio-Vences\u2019 prior conviction, it agreed that a below-guideline sentence in the range requested by Ascencio-Vences\u2019 counsel was warranted \u201cbecause of [Ascencio-Vences\u2019] health situation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 10. The district court ultimately agreed with the government\u2019s assessment, reduced Ascencio-Vences\u2019 offense level by five levels as a result of his medical situation, and imposed a sentence of 37 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Ascencio-Vences argues on appeal that the district court erred in imposing the sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). As noted, Ascencio-Vences did not object below to the imposition of the sixteen-level enhancement. Rather, he argued that the district court should impose a sentence below the guideline range because the sixteen-level enhancement overrepresented the seriousness of his prior conviction. Thus, we review his appellate argument only for plain error. To establish plain error, Ascencio-Vences \u201cmust demonstrate (1) that the district court committed error, (2) that the error was plain, and (3) that the plain error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Trujillo-Terrazas, </em>405 F.3d 814, 818 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">After reviewing the record on appeal, it is apparent that Ascencio-Vences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>cannot carry the burden of showing plain error. Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) requires the imposition of a sixteen-level enhancement \u201c[i]f the defendant previously was deported ... after ... a conviction for a felony that is ... a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months....\u201d Ascencio-Vences\u2019 1987 California conviction readily falls within the scope of this language because it was a felony drug-trafficking crime for which Ascencio-Vences received a sentence of sixteen months. Thus, the district court did not err in imposing the sixteen-level enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">To the extent that Ascencio-Vences also contends that the sentence imposed by the district court was unreasonable, we note that Ascencio-Vences\u2019 counsel specifically suggested to the district court that a sentence of between 33 and 41 months was reasonable. And, as noted, the district court adopted that suggestion and imposed a sentence of 37 months. Thus, the doctrine of invited error precludes Ascencio-Vences from seeking to undo precisely what his counsel suggested should be done. <em>See United States v. Edward J., </em>224 F.3d 1216, 1222 (10th Cir.2000) (discussing and applying doctrine of invited error in context of criminal proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b639-12\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 (eff. Dec. 1, 2006) and 10th Cir. R. 32.1 (eff. Jan. 1, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
