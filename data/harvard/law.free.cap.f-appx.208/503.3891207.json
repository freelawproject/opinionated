Rocha contends the court erred in finding he was ineligible for safety-valve relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-26\">To receive the safety-valve reduction, Rocha had \u201cto show, through affirmative conduct, that he gave the Government truthful information and evidence about the relevant crimes before sentencing.\u201d <em>See United States v. Romo, </em>81 F.3d 84, 85-86 (8th Cir.1996). We review for clear error the district court\u2019s finding that Rocha did not satisfy his burden. <em>See United States v. Weekly, </em>118 F.3d 576, 581 (8th Cir.), <em>modified on other grounds, </em>128 F.3d 1198 (8th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-27\">Upon careful review of the record before us on appeal, we cannot say that the district court clearly erred in finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Rocha gave inconsistent answers about his drug sources and avoided some of the government\u2019s proffer-interview questions. Rocha complains that the court considered only the letters from the prosecutor and the arguments at the sentencing hearing, but the district court also had before it a letter from defense counsel after the first proffer about Rocha\u2019s refreshed recollection, as well as Rocha\u2019s sentencing testimony during which he was unable to remember details about one of his proffer interviews, was evasive, and disclaimed knowledge about the cost of the methamphetamine he had bought and about the contact information for his drug source or sources. <em>See Romo, </em>81 F.3d at 85 (defendant was required to disclose all information he possessed about his involvement in crime and his chain of distribution, including identities and participation of others).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-17\">.
