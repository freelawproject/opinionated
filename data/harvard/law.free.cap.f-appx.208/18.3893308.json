Rakoff, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b43-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Defendant Dominick J. Savino appeals the district court\u2019s judgment that he violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, as well as Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act by knowingly aiding and abetting Anthony Shen\u2019s violations of Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. Savino also appeals the district court\u2019s order that he disgorge $366,358.04 and the court\u2019s injunction against any future violations by Savino of the federal securities laws. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment that Savino violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws, as well as the court\u2019s injunction against his future violations. We have carefully considered Savino\u2019s arguments on these grounds and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">The district court ordered Savino to disgorge $366,358.04, which was Savino\u2019s net compensation commission in fiscal year 1999 from trades between New York Life and Greenwich Capital. The court mischaracterized this commission compensation, however, as \u201cattributable to [Savino\u2019s] New York Life trades with Shen.\u201d Accordingly, although some of the district court\u2019s factual findings and portions of the evidentiary record would tend to support the conclusion that the scheme to defraud extended to those of Savino\u2019s transactions with New York Life in which the counter-party representative was not Shen, we cannot determine whether the district court intended its disgorgement order to extend that far. We remand the case to the district court so that it may either amend, or clarify its basis for the scope of, the order of disgorgement.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed as to Savino\u2019s primary and aiding-and-abetting liability, as is the injunction the court issued against Savino\u2019s future violations of the securities laws. But the order of disgorgement is remanded to the district court for amendment or clarification. The district court may, at its discretion, allow supplementation of the record as it deems appropriate. After the district court\u2019s decision, jurisdiction may be restored to this court by letter from any party, and the Clerk\u2019s Office shall set a briefing schedule and send such proceeding to this panel for disposition without oral argument unless otherwise ordered. <em>See U.S. v. Jacobson, </em>15 F.3d 19, 21-22 (2d Cir.1994). The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
