R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b627-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">We have reviewed the record and petitioners\u2019 filings in this court. We conclude that petitioners have failed to raise a colorable constitutional or legal claim to invoke our jurisdiction over this petition for review under the REAL ID Act. <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001). Accordingly, respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss this petition for review is granted as to petitioner, Florencia Analco Noyola, A79-519-097, because we lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that petitioner did not demonstrate her removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to a qualifying relative. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i); <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005); <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 892 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Respondent\u2019s motion to summarily affirm this petition is granted as to petitioner Diego Visoso Blanco, A79-519-098, because petitioner\u2019s removal cannot result in \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident\u201d as required for cancellation of removal because petitioner has no qualifying relatives. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-12\">All other pending motions are denied as moot. The temporary stay of removal confirmed by Ninth Circuit General Order 6.4(c) shall continue in effect until issuance of the mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-13\">DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b627-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
