Gaston was convicted in the Court of Common Pleas, Belmont County, Ohio of the attempted rape of a nine-year old girl and the rape of a seven-year old girl. In his direct appeal to the Ohio Court of Appeals for the Seventh Judicial District, he contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that the admission of an audio-tape of the seven-year old\u2019s out-of-court statement over his objection -violated his right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The Ohio Court of Appeals did not consider Mr. Gaston\u2019s federal constitutional claims. Instead, it ruled that the audio-taped statement was admissible under Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A). The Ohio Supreme Court dismissed the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">Mr. Gaston filed a state prisoner petition for habeas corpus against Anthony Brigano, the Warden of the Lebanon Correctional Institute in Lebanon, Ohio (\u201cthe State\u201d) pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. The District Court granted the petition, holding that the admission of the audio-tape violated Mr. Gaston\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The State has appealed from that judgment. We affirm because we conclude that Mr. Gaston\u2019s right to confrontation was impermissibly denied under the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Confrontation Clause in <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">The evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, reveals that Maxine Williams, Mr. Gaston\u2019s live-in companion, was the sister of K.B., the mother of L.B., the seven-year old child who was named as the rape victim in Count Two of the indictment. Ms. Williams was also a friend of Ms. E.W., the mother of D.M., the nine-year old alleged victim in Count One of the indictment. Ms. K.B. and Ms. E.W. were also friends. Ms. KB.\u2019s children and Ms. E.W.\u2019s children met socially frequently before the alleged rapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">Prior to June 15,1998, Ms. Williams had an affair with Ms. E.W.\u2019s husband. As a result, Ms. E.W. had not spoken to Ms. Williams for two years. Ms. E.W. called Ms. Williams on June 12, 1998, to request that Mr. Gaston testify on her behalf at her trial in which she was accused of child endangerment resulting in the death of her twenty-month old son.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">Mr. Gaston and Ms. Williams went to Ms. E.W.\u2019s home on June 15, 1998, in response to her request. Ms. E.W. asked Ms. Williams to take her three children, including D.M., to the Gaston residence for the evening and deliver them to Barkcamp the following morning. Ms. Williams refused because she had to work that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">Ms. Williams left E.W.\u2019s residence later that evening in a separate vehicle to go work. Mr. Gaston called Ms. Williams at her workplace and told her Ms. E.W.\u2019s children wanted to spend the night at their residence. Ms. Williams told him not to let them come over. She was concerned that Ms. E.W. was \u201cup to something\u201d because of Ms. Williams\u2019s affair with Ms. E.W.\u2019s husband. Nevertheless, Mr. Ga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>ston took D.M. and her brothers, C. and J.J., to his and Ms. Williams\u2019 residence to spend the night because they wanted to play Nintendo and eat pizza. After playing Nintendo, J.J. became tired and went to bed upstairs. D.M. fell asleep on the couch. Mr. Gaston told C. to go to bed upstairs. C. tried to get D.M. to go to bed upstairs, but Mr. Gaston told him that she could spend the night asleep on the couch. C. went upstairs but did not go to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Later, he came downstairs, because he heard his sister screaming. He observed that Mr. Gaston was lying naked on the couch with D.M. When C. yelled Mr. Gaston\u2019s name, he jumped up, put his clothes on, and threw D.M.\u2019s clothes at her. The children began crying and told Mr. Gaston they wanted to go home. At this time, Ms. Williams telephoned Mr. Gaston from her workplace. She heard D.M. complaining and \u201cyelling she wanted to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Mr. Gaston took the children home at 12:30 a.m. on June 16, 1998. Ms. J.M., D. M.\u2019s grandmother, testified that the children were crying and hysterical when they got out of Mr. Gaston\u2019s car. When Ms. J.M. asked D.M. what was wrong, she replied: \u201cNothing, Grandma. I can\u2019t tell you____[bjecause if I tell you, he\u2019ll make sure my mommy goes to prison for the rest of her life.\u201d C. then stated: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what went on, Grandma.\u201d C. told his grandmother: \u201cI caught him on top of my sissy. I hollered his name once and he didn\u2019t hear me. And I hollered his name again and he jumped off of her, ran across the room and put his clothes on, and threw hers at her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">Ms. J.M. testified that when she continued to ask her granddaughter what happened, she replied: \u201cHe touched me ... [djown below where he\u2019s not supposed to, Grandma.\u201d Ms. J.M. then called the Wheeling Police Department. Mr. Gaston left the area while the call was made to the police. Mr. Gaston was arrested some time after midnight on June 16, 1998. C. testified at trial that after the police left, his mother called K.B., L.B.\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-14\">D.M. was taken to the Martin\u2019s Ferry Police Department at the request of the Wheeling Island Police Department because that agency had jurisdiction over the incident. After making a report to the police, D.M. was taken to an emergency room for examination. Thereafter, D.M. was interrogated by Karen Holmes, a sexual assault specialist at Belmont County Children Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-15\">D.M. testified at the state trial that she went to Mr. Gaston\u2019s house with her two brothers because they were supposed to go swimming the next day. After her brothers went to bed, Mr. Gaston took off her shorts and underwear, licked his fingers, and stuck them inside of her vagina. Mr. Gaston told her that if she told anyone about his conduct, he would have her mother put in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">L.B. was taken to the police station on June 16, 1998. She was examined at a hospital to determine whether she had been raped or sexually abused. The examination revealed that her vagina had been injured as the result of a penetrating injury. An expert witness testified that these injuries \u201ccould have been five days old or it could have been five months old.....[ojr five years even.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">On the same day that L.B. was examined, Ms. Holmes told her, \u201cthat\u2019s a safety rule, you tell if somebody touches you [on your privates] ... and then the policemen ... make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again and that you\u2019re all right.\u201d Ms. Holmes then told L.B. that she was taken to the hospital to \u201cmake sure that you\u2019re all right.\u201d L.B. replied: \u201cYeah. Um [D.M.] went to the doctors and Jimmy [Gaston] went to jail.\u201d During this interrogation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>L.B. stated for the first time that, on one occasion, sometime during the summer after school was out, Mr. Gaston hurt her when he put his private parts between her legs. L.B. also told Ms. Holmes that Mr. Gaston told her that he would kill her family if she told anyone what he had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">L.B.\u2019s taped statement was introduced into evidence over objection. It was the only evidence that identified Mr. Gaston as the person who raped her. At trial, Mr. Gaston\u2019s counsel objected to the admissibility of L.B.\u2019s taped statement on the ground that it violated Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A). The District Court overruled the objection. The jury convicted Mr. Gaston of the lesser included offense of the attempted rape of D.M., and the rape of L.B. He was sentenced to serve eight years in prison for the attempted rape of D.M., and life in prison for the rape of L.B. The trial court ordered the sentences to be served consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Mr. Gaston filed an appeal from the judgment of conviction on November 23, 1998 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mr. Gaston presented the following assignments of error for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">FIRST ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-8\">The trial court\u2019s admission into evidence of a child declarant\u2019s audio-taped statement denied appellant due process of law and the right to confront his accusers, in violation of Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio Constitution<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">SECOND ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-11\">The trial court\u2019s exclusion of relevant evidence violated Evid. R. 404(B) and denied appellant his right to present a defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">THIRD ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6J\">The trial court erred in instructing the jury on the lesser included offense of attempted rape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-13\">Merit Brief of Defendant-Appellant James R. Gaston at vi, <em>State v. Gaston, </em>No. 98-BA-52, 2001 WL 1647295 (Ohio Ct.App. Dec. 17, 2001) (brief before the Court of Appeals, Belmont County, Ohio Seventh Appellate District (\u201cOhio Court of Appeals\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-14\">Mr. Gaston argued in support of his federal constitutional claim as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-e\">[L.B.j\u2019s taped statement did not meet the criteria articulated in <em>[Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) ]. The statement did not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. Nor did the statement bear adequate indicia of reliability. Indeed, [L.B.]\u2019s statement is virtually identical to the statements that the United States Supreme Court found to be unconstitutionally admitted in <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b404-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 9 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-16\">Mr. Gaston also stated in his brief before the Ohio Court of Appeals that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s errors violated state evidentiary rules as well as Mr. Gaston\u2019s constitutional rights to due process and to confront his accusers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Mr. Gaston did not set forth Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A) in his Table of Authorities, nor did he discuss it in his argument regarding his first assignment of error. In the appendix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>to the brief he filed in the Ohio Court of Appeals, Mr. Gaston set forth and quoted Ohio Rule of Evidence 404 (\u201cCharacter Evidence Not Admissible To Prove Conduct; Exceptions; Other Crimes\u201d), 405 (\u201cMethods of Proving Character\u201d), 601 (\u201cGeneral Rule of Competency\u201d), and 608 (\u201cEvidence of Character and Conduct of Witness\u201d). Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A) was not set forth or quoted in Mr. Gaston\u2019s appendix. <em>Id. </em>at 14-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The Ohio Court of Appeals affirmed Mr. Gaston\u2019s conviction. The Court summarized Mr. Gaston\u2019s claim that the audiotape of L.B.\u2019s taped statement was inadmissible as follows: \u201cAppellant also asserts that by admitting [L.B.]\u2019s interview into evidence, the court denied him of his Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses against him.\u201d <em>State v. Gaston, </em>No. 98-BA-52, 2001 WL 1647295, at *6 (Ohio Ct. App. Dec. 17, 2001). The Court further stated, \u201cHe claims that [L.B.j\u2019s statement was hearsay not within any recognized exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">The Ohio Court of Appeals did not consider whether, as a matter of law, the admission of L.B.\u2019s taped statement without permitting Mr. Gaston to face her at his trial violated his rights under the Ohio or United States Constitutions. Instead, it held that, \u201c[a]s to whether the [trial] court properly admitted [L.B.]\u2019s taped interview into evidence, <em>we must look to the rules of evidence.\u201d Gaston, </em>2001 WL 1647295, at *7 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">The Court then noted that \u201c[Ohio Rule of Evidence] 807(A) provides that an out of-court statement made by a child under twelve years of age describing a sexual act performed with the child is not excluded as hearsay as long as certain prerequisites are met.\u201d <em>Gaston, </em>2001 WL 1647295, at *7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Ohio Court of Appeals applied the abuse of discretion standard of review in determining whether the taped statement was admissible. The Court stated: \u201cThe admission or exclusion of evidence rests in the sound discretion of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>court. This court will not reverse a trial court\u2019s decision on the admission or exclusion of evidence absent an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *8 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The Ohio Court of Appeals held that \u201c[i]n this case [L.B.]\u2019s taped interview met the mandates of Evid.R. 807.\u201d <em>Gaston, </em>2001 WL 1647295, at *8. In reaching its conclusion, the Ohio Court of Appeals did not cite nor discuss any decision of the Ohio Supreme Court or the United States Supreme Court that considered whether the admission of a hearsay statement of a person under twelve years of age who was not subjected to cross-examination violated a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. The only case cited by the Ohio Court of Appeals in its analysis of the admissibility of L.B.\u2019s taped statement was <em>State v. Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 510 N.E.2d 343 (1987). The issue before the Supreme Court in <em>Sage </em>was whether a witness\u2019s testimony was admissible because it was relevant, as that term is defined in Ohio Rule of Evidence 401. <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 180, 510 N.E.2d 343. The Appellant in <em>Sage </em>did not challenge the admissibility of the testimony on state or federal constitutional grounds. The Ohio Supreme Court concluded in <em>Sage </em>that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony. <em>Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d at 182, 510 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In this matter, the Ohio Court of Appeals, relying on the <em>Sage </em>decision, limited its review to the question whether the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the taped statement was admissible pursuant to Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A). The Ohio Court of Appeals clearly acknowledged that Mr. Gaston had contended in his appeal that the trial court denied him his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by admitting L.B.\u2019s taped statement. It failed to explain why it applied the abuse of discretion standard of review, however, instead of considering this issue as a pure question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review pursuant to Ohio jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Mr. Gaston filed a memorandum in support of jurisdiction before the Supreme Court of Ohio in which he requested that it review the trial court\u2019s judgment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s admission of the taped statement violated Ohio\u2019s evidentiary rules and Gaston\u2019s state and federal constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him.\u201d Memorandum In Support of Jurisdiction of Defendant-Appellant James R. Gaston at 6, <em>State v. Gaston, </em>No.2002-0171, 95 Ohio St.3d 1422, 766 N.E.2d 162 (Ohio April 17, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">The Supreme Court of Ohio dismissed the appeal on April 17, 2002. Its entire dispositive order reads as follows: \u201cUpon consideration of the jurisdictional memoranda filed in this case, the Court denies leave to appeal and dismisses the appeal as not involving any substantial constitutional question.\u201d Entry, <em>State v. Gaston, </em>No.2002-0171, 95 Ohio St.3d 1422, 766 N.E.2d 162 (Ohio April 17, 2002). The Ohio Supreme Court did not cite any state or federal authority to support its terse conclusion that Mr. Gaston failed to present a substantial constitutional question in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>his memorandum in support of jurisdiction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Mr. Gaston filed a petition for certiorari in the United States Supreme Court. It was denied on November 12, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">On November 12, 2003, Mr. Gaston filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(a) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, Eastern Division. He alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[a]dmission of a child\u2019s taped statement as well [as] the child\u2019s other hearsay statements at Petitioner\u2019s trial violated Petitioner\u2019s right to confront his accuser in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\u201d Petitioner James R. Gaston\u2019s Traverse To Respondent\u2019s Return of Writ at 3, <em>Gaston v. Brigano, </em>No. 03-1043 (S.D.Ohio Jan. 28, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">After reviewing the trial record, the audio-tape of L.B.\u2019s statement to Ms. Holmes, and the transcription of the tape, Magistrate Judge Terrence P. Kemp concluded in his Report and Recommendation that the admission of this evidence violated Mr. Gaston\u2019s right to confrontation. Report and Recommendation, <em>Gaston v. Brigano, </em>No. C-2-03-1043, 30-34 (S.D.Ohio Oct. 7, 2004). Accordingly, Magistrate Judge Kemp recommended that the application for a writ of habeas corpus be conditionally granted as to Mr. Gaston\u2019s federal constitutional claim, and that the conviction of the crime charged in Count Two of the indictment be vacated. <em>Id. </em>at 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">After reviewing Magistrate Judge Kemp\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and the entire record in this case, the District Court adopted the recommendation on November 19, 2004, and stated that the \u201cadmission of [L.B.]\u2019s audio-taped statements to Karen Holmes of Belmont County Children [sic] Services violated petitioner\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d Opinion and Order, <em>Gaston v. Brigano, </em>No. C-2-03-1043 at 6 (S.D.Ohio Nov. 19, 2004). The District Court rejected the State\u2019s argument that it was required to apply a deferential standard of review to the state trial court\u2019s basis for admitting L.B.\u2019s taped statement. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6. The District Court held that the Ohio Court of Appeals had failed to address Mr. Gaston\u2019s federal constitutional claims in affirming the judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 5. The District Court concluded that, under Sixth Circuit law, \u201cwhere the state court fails to address a petitioner\u2019s.federal constitutional claim, a federal habeas court may review the claim <em>de novo.\u201d Id. </em>at 2. The District Court conditionally granted Mr. Gaston\u2019s constitutional claim and vacated the conviction on the rape charge alleged in Count Two of the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">The State filed a notice of appeal on December 17, 2004 from the final order of the District Court conditionally granting Mr. Gaston\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus and vacating his conviction for raping L.B. In support of its appeal, the State argued that the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 rejection of Mr. Gaston\u2019s confrontation clause claim was neither contrary to clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent nor based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in the light of the evidence presented. The State also contends that the District Court erred in applying a <em>de novo </em>standard of review to the question whether the Ohio Court of Appeals erred in holding that L.B.\u2019s taped statements were admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Before addressing these contentions, we must determine whether the District Court was barred from considering Mr. Gaston\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus because the Ohio Court of Appeals concluded that L.B.\u2019s taped statement was admissible pursuant to Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A), a state law ground, without ruling on the federal constitutional claim presented in Mr. Gaston\u2019s brief to the Ohio Court of Appeals. A state prisoner\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus may be granted only if \u201cit appears that ... the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the courts of the State____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1). \u201cAlthough the parties did not raise [the exhaustion] issue on appeal, it may not be waived or conceded, and may be raised by this Court <em>sua sponte. \u201d Harris v. Rees, </em>794 F.2d 1168, 1170 (6th Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">The exhaustion requirement is satisfied when \u201cstate prisoners give state courts a <em>fair </em>opportunity to act on their claims.\u201d <em>O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, </em>526 U.S. 838, 844, 119 S.Ct. 1728, 144 L.Ed.2d 1 (1999) (emphasis in original). Although Mr. Gaston presented his Confrontation Clause claim to the Ohio Court of Appeals, the Court of Appeals ignored it. Instead, the Ohio Court of Appeals concluded that it was required to look to Ohio\u2019s rules of evidence to determine whether the trial court properly admitted L.B.\u2019s taped interview. <em>Gaston, </em>2001 WL 1647295, at *6-8. The United States Supreme Court instructed in <em>Smith v. Digmon, </em>434 U.S. 332, 98 S.Ct. 597, 54 L.Ed.2d 582 (1978) that \u201c[i]t is too obvious to merit extended discussion that whether the exhaustion requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b) has been satisfied cannot turn upon whether a state appellate court chooses to ignore in its opinion a federal constitutional claim squarely raised in petitioner\u2019s brief in the state court....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 333, 98 S.Ct. 597. Because Mr. Gaston gave the Ohio Court of Appeals a fair opportunity to resolve his federal constitutional claim, we hold that the District Court did not err in considering Mr. Gaston\u2019s application for habeas corpus relief on his properly exhausted federal constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b408-10\">The State contends that the District Court erred in refusing to evaluate Mr. Gaston\u2019s state prisoner habeas corpus claims in accordance with the deferential standards of review of State court decisions set forth in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). We disagree. Section 2254(d) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-11\">An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-12\">As discussed above, the record shows that the Ohio Court of Appeals failed to address Mr. Gaston\u2019s federal constitutional claim <em>de novo </em>as required by Ohio law. <em>Gaston, </em>2001 WL 1647295, at *6-8. Instead, the Ohio Court of Appeals applied the abuse of discretion standard that is applicable in determining whether the trial court erred in admitting evidence under State law. <em>Id. </em>at *8.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">The Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling on the admissibility of L.B.\u2019s taped statement un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>der Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A) cannot be construed as an implied, simultaneous ruling on Mr. Gaston\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, because the Court of Appeals failed to apply the <em>de novo </em>standard of review applicable to that constitutional claim. In <em>Maples v. Stegall, </em>340 F.3d 433 (6th Cir. 2003), this Court held that \u201c[w]here, as here, the state court did not assess the merits of a claim properly raised in a habeas petition, the deference due under [\u00a7 2254(d) of] AEDPA does not apply\u201d because the statute \u201cis applicable only to habeas claims that were \u2018adjudicated on the merits in State court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436-37 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)). <em>See McAdoo v. Elo, </em>365 F.3d 487, 498 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cWhen a state court fails to address the merits of a properly raised ineffective assistance of counsel issue, this court conducts its review <em>de novo. \u201d). See also Danner v. Motley, </em>448 F.3d 372, 376 (6th Cir. 2006) (holding that <em>de novo </em>review of a federal confrontation clause claim applies where the state court \u201cexamined only [state] law in determining whether the procedure was proper.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Citing <em>Early v. Packer, </em>537 U.S. 3, 123 S.Ct. 362, 154 L.Ed.2d 263 (2002), <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1,124 S.Ct. 1,157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003), <em>Mitchell v. Esparza, </em>540 U.S. 12, 124 S.Ct. 7, 157 L.Ed.2d 263 (2003), and <em>Price v. Vincent, </em>538 U.S. 634, 123 S.Ct. 1848, 155 L.Ed.2d 877 (2003), the State notes that \u201cit is entirely unnecessary for the state courts to cite, <em>or even be aware, </em>of the relevant federal case law, so long as the state court reasoning and result is in accord with [Supreme] Court precedent.\u201d (Reply Brief of Respondent-Appellant 1.) The State\u2019s reliance on these decisions is misplaced. In each of these cases, unlike the Ohio Court of Appeals\u2019 procedure in this case, the state courts expressly considered and rejected the federal constitutional claim presented by the state prisoner.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The Ohio Court of Appeals simply did not address Mr. Gaston\u2019s Confrontation Clause claim. Instead, it limited its review to the question whether L.B.\u2019s taped statements were admissible under Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A). It did not decide whether the application of Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A) violated the federal Constitution. In <em>McKenzie v. Smith, </em>326 F.3d 721 (6th Cir.2003), this Court held that when an issue was not considered by a state court, \u201cthere are simply no results, let alone reasoning, to which this court can defer. Without such results or reasoning, any attempt to determine whether the state court decision \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of clearly established Federal law,\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), would be futile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 727.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The fact that the Ohio Court of Appeals held that L.B.\u2019s taped statements were admissible under an exception to that State\u2019s hearsay rules does not demonstrate that the trial court did not violate the Sixth Amendment in allowing the jury to consider this evidence. The United States Supreme Court held in <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990) that the Confrontation Clause \u201cbars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139. Because the Ohio Court of Appeals did not determine independently whether admission of L.B.\u2019s taped statements violated the Confrontation Clause, notwithstanding their admissibility under Ohio\u2019s rules of evidence, the District Court did not err in reviewing the constitutionality of the admission of L.B.\u2019s taped statements <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\n<em>V</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. CONST, amend. VI. It ensures the reliability of testimonial evidence against the accused by subjecting prosecution witnesses \u201cto the rigorous adversarial testing that is the norm of Anglo-American criminal proceedings.\u201d <em>Maryland v.

Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) the Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">The Confrontation Clause operates in two separate ways to restrict the range of admissible hearsay. First, in conformance with the Framers\u2019 preference for face-to-face accusation, the Sixth Amendment establishes a rule of necessity. In the usual case (including cases where prior cross-examination has occurred), the prosecution must either produce, or demonstrate the unavailability of, the declarant whose statement it wishes to use against the defendant. The second aspect operates once a witness is shown to be unavailable. Reflecting its underlying purpose to augment accuracy in the fact finding process by ensuring the defendant an effective means to test adverse evidence, the Clause countenances only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that there is no material departure from the reason of the general rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 65, 100 S.Ct. 2531 (quotations and internal citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The Supreme Court held in <em>Roberts </em>that hearsay statements are sufficiently rehable to allow their admission without cross-examination of the declarant when they contain \u201cadequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. \u201cReliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">A statement that does not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception is presumptively unreliable and inadmissible under the Confrontation Clause. <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531. \u201c[I]t may nonetheless meet Confrontation Clause reliability standards if it is supported by a \u2018showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 543, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986) (quoting <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531). In <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), the Court explained that \u201c[t]he Confrontation Clause ... bars the admission of some evidence that would otherwise be admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-11\">The Supreme Court stated in <em>Wright </em>that \u201c[t]he state and federal courts have identified a number of factors that we think properly relate to whether hearsay statements made by a child witness in child sexual abuse cases are reliable.\u201d 497 U.S. at 821, 110 S.Ct. 3139. They include spontaneity, consistent repetition, the mental state of the declarant, the use of terminology unexpected of a child of similar age, and lack of motive to fabricate. <em>Id. </em>at 821-22, 110 S.Ct. 3139. The Court held that these factors \u201capply to whether such statements bear \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 under the Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>frontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 822, 110 S.Ct. 3139.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Supreme Court did not define \u201cspontaneity\u201d in <em>Wright. </em>However, it cited <em>State v. Robinson, </em>153 Ariz. 191, 735 P.2d 801 (1987) as an example of the application of the spontaneity factor that \u201cproperly relatefs] to whether hearsay statements made by a child witness in child sexual abuse cases are rehable.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 821, 110 S.Ct. 3139. In <em>Robinson, </em>the Supreme Court of Arizona held that a child\u2019s complaint to her mother that her vagina hurt because an adult male babysitter had poked her with a pencil was spontaneous. The child\u2019s panties had blood on them and she had a bruise on her labia. <em>Robinson, </em>735 P.2d at 804. The Supreme Court of Arizona concluded the child\u2019s statements were admissible and that there was no evidence of \u201cprior interrogation, prompting, or manipulation by adults.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 811.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The Ohio Court of Appeals rendered its decision in this matter on December 17, 2001. Mr. Gaston\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus was filed in the District Court on November 12, 2003. The District Court conditionally granted the application on November 10, 2004. Meanwhile, on March 8, 2004, the United States Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court overruled <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>and its progeny. It held that prior testimonial evidence is not admissible in a criminal trial unless the defendant has had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. 541 U.S. at 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354. The Court reasoned that \u201c[w]here testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68-69, 124 S.Ct. 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">In <em>Dorchy v. Jones, </em>398 F.3d 783 (6th Cir.2005), this Court held that <em>Crawford </em>is not retroactive. <em>Id. </em>at 788. Accordingly, we must apply the <em>Roberts </em>test to determine whether the record demonstrates particularized guarantees of trustworthiness, in light of the totality of the circumstances, that render the evidence admissible and worthy of belief in the absence of cross-examination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">The record shows that L.B. did not spontaneously or excitedly report to her mother, or anyone else, that Mr. Gaston had \u201churt\u201d her by placing part of his body between her legs. The State does not maintain that Ohio Rule of Evidence 807(A) is a firmly rooted hearsay exception. As noted, hearsay statements that do not fall within \u201ca firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d are \u201cpresumptively unreliable and inadmissible for Confrontation Clause purposes.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 543, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986). We are persuaded that the State has failed to overcome that presumption. L.B. did not accuse Mr. Gaston of hurting her until after her mother was informed by D.M.\u2019s mother that her daughter had been sexually assaulted by Mr. Gaston. L.B. was interrogated <em>after </em>she and D.M. had been examined to determine whether they had been molested. L.B. was also aware prior to being questioned that Mr. Gaston had been arrested and D.M. \u201cwent to the doctors.\u201d She also stated to a sexual assault specialist that her mother told her why she was going to be questioned. <em>See Webb v. Lewis, </em>44 F.3d 1387, 1392 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that the child\u2019s hearsay statement, made a week after an alleged serial assault, \u201cwas not the state of mind of one excitedly reporting a recent assault.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>The audio-tape of Ms. Holmes\u2019s interrogation of L.B. was admitted into evidence.

Now what would be the safety rule if someone would touch your private parts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-22\">[L.B.] Get mad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-23\">Holmes: Yeah. Now did anything like that every happen to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-24\">[L.B.] [Inaudible] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-25\">Holmes: Is it a private part?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJA\">[L.B.] Um.

But sometimes it\u2019s hard for kids to tell right away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-33\">[L.B.] I can\u2019t fit it on my teddy bear</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-34\">Holmes: Right. Right. But that\u2019s a safety rule, you tell if somebody touches you here or here and then what it is you tell and then the policemen, like the policeman here, then (sic) make sure that it doesn\u2019t happen again and that you\u2019re all right. That\u2019s why we wanted you to go to the hospital, make sure you\u2019re all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-35\">[L.B.] Yeah.

We can go out and see your Mom now, you\u2019re done.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-37\">The record also reflects that L.B.\u2019s taped statements were not consistent. Prior to selecting the jury in this matter, the trial judge questioned L.B. to determine whether she was competent to testify as a witness against Mr. Gaston. Contrary to L.B.\u2019s statement to Ms. Holmes that Mr. Gaston had \u201churt\u201d her once in his bedroom during the summer, L.B. told the trial judge that she had not gone to his house. She also stated that she had been hurt by her mother and her brothers had hurt her, but she had never been hurt by anyone else. L.B. also denied telling any lies in response to the trial court\u2019s questions. These statements expressly contradicted her report to Ms. Holmes that Mr. Gaston had \u201churt\u201d her at his house.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-38\">The trial court found that L.B. was competent to testify. The trial court also held that L.B. was unavailable as a witness because she indicated she would not testify against Mr. Gaston. The trial court overruled Mr. Gaston\u2019s objection to the admission of L.B.\u2019s taped statements. It reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-39\">In accord with [Ohio Rule of Evidence] 807(A)(1), the court finds that the totality of circumstances surrounding the making of the statement to Karen Holmes [] provides particular rise to guarantees of trustworthiness. Court finds that the interview came about as a result of a separate allegation of sexual abuse of another child, [D.M.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-40\">The interview appears to have been conducted in accord with recognized pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>tocol. The child\u2019s answers to the questions appears [sic] spontaneous.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">The child stated that she knew the defendant, visited his home, knows the rooms of the house, and the particular room where the alleged incident occurred. She knows Maxine as his girlfriend, and that Maxine was not home, and she knows safety rules. She also provides an adequate description of after effects. The first of which is her knowledge that the act hurt her. And also noteworthy, is her knowledge that she went to the bathroom after it happened.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The evidence does not support the trial court\u2019s finding that L.B.\u2019s response to interrogation was \u201cspontaneous.\u201d The term \u201cspontaneous\u201d is defined as \u201c1: proceeding from natural feeling or native tendency without external constraint 2: arising from a momentary impulse.\u201d <em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary </em>1206 (11th ed.2003). L.B. did not complain to anyone that she had been \u201churt\u201d by Mr. Gaston until she had been examined after D.M. .reported that she had been sexually assaulted by Mr. Gaston and was interrogated by Ms. Holmes to determine who had caused the injury to her vagina. We cannot characterize L.B.\u2019s answers to the questions posed by a skilled investigator as \u201carising from a momentary impulse\u201d or without \u201cexternal constraint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Mr. Gaston\u2019s counsel pointed out that L.B. had stated to the trial court during the competency proceeding that Mr. Gaston did not hurt her. The trial court responded that \u201cshe did provide inconsistent answers at that time. One of which is the answer that you stated. And the court certainly understands that is a concern of the defendant\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">The trial court apparently overlooked the fact that L.B. informed the court that L.B. not only denied that Mr. Gaston hurt her, she also stated she had never been in his house. The trial court violated Mr. Gaston\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation in ruling that L.B.\u2019s taped statements were admissible. Because of L.B.\u2019s unmistakably inconsistent statements and her lack of spontaneity in complaining about Mr. Gaston\u2019s conduct, we are persuaded that L.B.\u2019s taped statements were inadmissible because they were not trustworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">Having concluded that the trial court erred in admitting L.B.\u2019s taped testimony, we must consider if the error was harmless. <em>See United States v. Baker, </em>458 F.3d 513, 520 (6th Cir.2006) (\u2018We apply the harmless-error test to evidentiary errors ... including evidence admitted in violation of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d). An error by the trial court is not harmless if it \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 638, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). <em>See also Gilliam v. Mitchell, </em>179 F.3d 990, 995 (6th Cir.1999) (adopting the <em>Brecht </em>standard for harmless error). In the instant case, L.B.\u2019s taped statements contained the only evidence that she had been raped by Mr. Gaston. While there was physical evidence that L.B. had been the victim of sexual abuse, the physical evidence did not support an inference that Mr. Gaston was the perpetrator. The denial of the right to cross-examine L.B. had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s errors were not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">We AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-10\">.
