Bowman told Nieves that Michael, carrying a gun and wearing a jeff cap and all-white clothing, had just walked southbound toward the intersection of 11th Street and Girard Avenue. As Nieves left Bowman\u2019s apartment, other police officers arrived and told him they\u2019d just spotted a man fitting Bowman\u2019s description on the corner of 11th and Girard.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">The man the officers saw was appellant Kasan Sanders. When Nieves arrived at 11th and Girard, he stopped Sanders and conducted a <em>Terry </em>frisk. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). Nieves discovered a loaded .38 caliber revolver tucked inside Sanders\u2019 waistband and arrested him. A federal grand jury indicted Sanders and charged him with one count of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) as a felon in possession of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-16\">Sanders filed a motion to suppress the revolver and ammunition, contending Nieves lacked reasonable suspicion to frisk him. Subsequently, Sanders and the government reached an agreement pursuant to which Sanders admitted the factual elements of the indictment and agreed to a stipulated trial should his motion to suppress be denied. The government in turn agreed Sanders would be entitled to at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>least a two point adjustment for acceptance of responsibility upon sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">At the suppression hearing, the government presented Officer Nieves to testify. Sanders presented five witnesses and documentary evidence to impeach Nieves\u2019 testimony. The district court denied Sanders\u2019 motion and admitted the revolver and ammunition into evidence. Sanders waived his right to trial by jury and the court conducted a short, stipulated bench trial that afternoon. Sanders was found guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">At sentencing, the parties clashed over whether Sanders deserved a three-point adjustment for his acceptance of responsibility for the crime under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 3El.l(b). The government agreed to a two point reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a), but refused to move for a third point under \u00a7 3El.l(b). Sanders contended he deserved the third point because he had admitted his guilt from the start of the proceedings. The court reduced Sanders\u2019 offense level by two points, but declined to reduce it by a third point because, the court explained, \u201cthe Government has not filed a motion permitting me to depart downward the additional point____\u201d The court sentenced Sanders to 63 months in prison, to be reduced to 56 months should the Bureau of Prisons choose not to credit him for time served.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">On appeal, Sanders contends the government vindictively refused to move for a \u00a7 3El.l(b) departure and that the district court erred when it concluded it could not order the departure absent a government motion. \u00a7 3E1.1 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">a) If the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense, decrease the offense level by 2 levels.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">b) If the defendant qualifies for a decrease under subsection (a), the offense level determined prior to the operation of subsection (a) is level 16 or greater, and upon motion of the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the government and the court to allocate their resources efficiently, decrease the offense level by 1 additional level. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3El.l(a-b)(2006). In relevant part, the Commentary to \u00a7 3El.l(b) states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-15\">Because the Government is in the best position to determine whether the defendant has assisted authorities in a manner that avoids preparing for trial, an adjustment under subsection (b) may only be granted upon a formal motion by the Government at the time of sentencing. U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3El.l(b) &amp; cmt. n. 6 (2006)(citing the PROTECT Act of 2003 \u00a7 401(g), Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 STAT. 671-72).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AT\">Despite the government\u2019s broad discretion under this provision, district courts have the power to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to move for a downward departure and to grant a remedy if they find the refusal a) was based on an unconstitutional motive, such as race or religion, or b) lacked a rational relationship to any legitimate government objective. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>United States v. Abuhouran, </em>161 F.3d 206, 212 (3d Cir.1998). However, in recognition of the government\u2019s prerogative, the scope of a district court\u2019s review here is \u201cextremely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>limited\u201d absent a plea agreement. <em>United States v. Isaac, </em>141 F.3d 477, 481 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The government may violate due process if it refuses to move for a departure vindictively. <em>United States v. Paramo, </em>998 F.2d 1212, 1219 (3d Cir.1993), <em>cert. denied, </em>510 U.S. 1121, 114 S.Ct. 1076, 127 L.Ed.2d 393 (1994). Sanders carries the burden of proving prosecutorial vindictiveness, by adducing evidence of actual vindictiveness or evidence which generates a presumption of vindictiveness. <em>Paramo, </em>998 F.2d at 1220 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Sanders\u2019 <em>Paramo </em>claim lacks merit entirely. Well before the suppression hearing, the Government maintained it would not move for a \u00a7 3El.l(b) departure if Sanders sought suppression. In <em>Paramo, </em>we recognized a prosecutor does not violate due process when he threatens serious charges to induce a guilty plea and then carries out that threat after the defendant refuses to cooperate. <em>Paramo, </em>998 F.2d at 1221 (citing <em>Bordenkircher v. Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 363-65, 98 S.Ct. 663, 54 L.Ed.2d 604 (1978)). Similarly, the Government\u2019s threat to refuse a \u00a7 3El.l(b) departure, and its adherence to that threat, are \u201cinevitable and permissible\u201d attributes of a judicial system \u201cwhich tolerates and encourages the negotiation of pleas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bordenkircher, </em>434 U.S. at 364, 98 S.Ct. 663).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Sanders allowed the government to avoid voir dire, jury instructions and jury selection, but he forced the government to litigate the essential element of a \u00a7 922(g)(1) offense \u2014 Sanders\u2019 possession of a firearm \u2014 and his only arguable defense. In doing so, Sanders compelled the government to prepare and examine Officer Nieves and to cross-examine five defense witnesses. As a result, the government essentially tried Sanders at the suppression hearing. <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>129 F.3d 76 (2d Cir.1997)(per curiam). The government reasonably concluded Sanders did not permit it or the court \u201cto allocate their resources efficients ly.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3El.l(b) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">Sanders argues his sentence is unreasonable because the district court refused to grant a variance comparable to \u00a7 3El.l(b) and failed to adequately explain the rationale behind his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">District judges now must follow a three-step analysis in sentencing criminal defendants. <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237, 247 (3d Cir.2006). The district judge must 1) continue to calculate a defendant\u2019s Guidelines sentence precisely as he would have before <em>United States v. Booker; </em>2) formally rule on the parties\u2019 motions, stating on the record whether he is granting a departure and how that departure affects the Guidelines calculation; and 3) exercise his discretion by considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Gunter, </em>462 F.3d at 247. At step three, the sentencing record should demonstrate the judge considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and any sentencing grounds properly raised by the parties which have recognized legal merit and factual support in the record. <em>U.S. v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 332 (3d Cir.2006). However, the judge need not discuss every argument made by a litigant if an argument is clearly without merit. <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-12\">We conclude the district court followed the proper analysis and that Sanders\u2019 sentence is reasonable. The court carefully calculated Sanders\u2019 Guidelines sentence and formally ruled on the parties\u2019 motions with respect to Guidelines departures. At <em>Gunter </em>step three, it acknowledged the Guidelines are advisory, stated the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and considered the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>totality of the circumstances. Importantly, the court considered Sanders\u2019 personal circumstances when it chose not to impose a fine and reduced Sanders\u2019 sentence to credit him for time served because the Bureau of Prisons did not intend to do so. Appendix at 226; <em>see United States v. Charles, </em>467 F.3d 828 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">Although the district court did not expressly rule on Sanders\u2019 request for a variance, we can infer it concluded Sanders\u2019 claim lacked merit. Indeed, Sanders provided no evidence to suggest he was entitled to a variance comparable to the \u00a7 3El.l(b) departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The district court properly calculated Sanders\u2019 Guidelines sentence, expressly ruled on the parties\u2019 respective departure motions and exercised its discretion prudently. We will affirm Sanders\u2019 sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
