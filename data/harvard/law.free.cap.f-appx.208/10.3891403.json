Because appellant fails to allege that he has suffered an injury due to the existence of the Secret Service, the district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s suit for lack of standing. <em>See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-18\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.

R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
