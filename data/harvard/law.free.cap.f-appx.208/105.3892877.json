The District Court noted that Speight had previously filed a \u00a7 2241 petition raising the same claims, which it had dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and that this Court affirmed on appeal. <em>See Speight v. Nash, </em>D. N.J. Civ. No. 05-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>319(FLW); <em>Speight v. Nash, </em>132 Fed. Appx. 423 (3d Cir.2005). As this Court has previously affirmed the District Court\u2019s holding that it lacked jurisdiction to consider Speight\u2019s arguments, it follows that the District Court similarly lacked jurisdiction to consider the identical arguments brought in the instant petition. We will therefore summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
