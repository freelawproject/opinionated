Lanares-Mendez appeals his sentence, contending that the district court\u2019s imposition of a sixteen-level enhancement under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (2004), based on his prior conviction for harboring an illegal alien, violated the Sixth Amendment. He also argues that counting the same conviction in his criminal history score resulted in an unreasonable sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">Lanares-Mendez was deported in 2000 after he was convicted of harboring an illegal alien. A sixteen-level increase in offense level applies under USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) when the defendant has previously been deported after a conviction for an alien smuggling offense. LanaresMendez asserted at sentencing that the prior conviction was not an alien smug<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>gling offense because he had only given water to persons entering the country as a charitable act.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, the district court agreed with the government that the conviction met the definition of an \u201calien smuggling offense,\u201d as defined in the guideline commentary, which states that it \u201chas the meaning given that term in section 101(a)(43)(N) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) [2000]).\u201d An \u201calien smuggling offense\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(N) as\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-4\">[A] n offense described in paragraph (1)(A) or (2) of section 1324(a) of this title (relating to alien smuggling), except in the case of a first offense for which the alien has affirmatively shown that the alien committed the offense for the purpose of assisting, abetting, or aiding only the alien\u2019s spouse, child, or parent (and no other individual) to violate a provision of this chapter[;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Lanares-Mendez argues that it was a violation of the Sixth Amendment to increase his offense level based on a prior conviction for alien smuggling when that fact was not charged in the indictment and determined beyond a reasonable doubt. Lanares-Mendez acknowledges that the fact of a prior conviction need not be charged in the indictment or proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Cheek, </em>415 F.3d 349, 352-53 (4th Cir.) (holding that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), reaffirmed exception set out in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), for sentence enhancements based on recidivism), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 640, 163 L.Ed.2d 518 (2005). Because the district court correctly applied the existing law, we conclude that no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">Next, Lanares-Mendez argues that, because the sentencing guidelines permit his prior conviction and sentence for alien smuggling to be used to increase his offense level and counted in his criminal history as well, his sentence is unreasonable. He suggests that this court should remand his case so that the district court may consider whether a downward departure is warranted to \u201ccure the double counting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">This court has held that a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 433 (4th Cir. 2006). A sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if, for instance, the court fails to make necessary fact findings or adequately explain its reasons for imposing the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 434. A sentence may be substantively unreasonable if the court misapplies the guidelines or \u201crejects policies articulated by Congress or the Sentencing Commission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In effect, Lanares-Mendez is arguing that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because the district court <em>failed to reject </em>the policy adopted by the Sentencing Commission on double counting. We conclude that he has not shown that his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b298-8\"> According to the presentence report, LanaresMendez was convicted, under an alias, of harboring a illegal alien at an address in Texas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
