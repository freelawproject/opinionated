The district court sen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>fenced Bennette to forty-two months in prison. Bennette timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">Bennette asserts on appeal that the district court erred in denying his motions for judgment of acquittal pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure because the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for judgment of acquittal de novo. <em>United States v. Smith, </em>451 F.3d 209, 216 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 197, 166 L.Ed.2d 161 (2006). Where, as here, the motion was based on a claim of insufficient evidence, \u201c[t] he verdict of a jury must be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the Government, to support it.\u201d <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). This court \u201cha[s] defined \u2018substantial evidence,\u2019 in the context of a criminal action, as that evidence which \u2018a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Newsome, </em>322 F.3d 328, 333 (4th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862-63 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc)). In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, the court considers circumstantial and direct evidence, and allows the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences from the facts proven to those sought to be established. <em>United States v. Tresvant </em>677 F.2d 1018, 1021 (4th Cir. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Section 922(g)(2) prohibits \u201cany person ... who is a fugitive from justice ... [from] posess[ing] in or affecting commerce ... any firearm or ammunition.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(2). A \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d is defined under the statute as \u201cany person who has fled from any State to avoid prosecution for a crime.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(15) (2000). In <em>United States v. Spillane, </em>913 F.2d 1079 (4th Cir. 1990), in the context of a \u00a7 922(g)(2) conviction, this court defined a \u201cfugitive from justice\u201d as \u201c[a]ny person who, knowing that charges are pending, purposely (1) leaves the jurisdiction of prosecution and (2) refuses to answer those charges by way of appearance before the prosecuting tribunal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1081-82. Bennette argues that the government failed to show that he deliberately left Maine knowing there were charges pending against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-11\">Although this court has not directly addressed the issue, other circuits have distinguished between a defendant\u2019s classification as a \u201cfugitive,\u201d which is necessary for a \u00a7 922(g)(2) conviction, and a defendant\u2019s actual <em>knowledge </em>that he was classified as a fugitive when he left the state where charges were pending, which is not required for a \u00a7 922(g)(2) conviction. <em>See United States v. Ballentine, 4 </em>F.3d 504, 506 (7th Cir.1993) (collecting cases). The Seventh Circuit explained in <em>Ballentine,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AId\">\u201c[F]ugitive\u201d status ... involves a defendant\u2019s knowledge that charges are pending against him. It is not necessary for him to understand that he carries the name or status of \u201cfugitive.\u201d Instead, a defendant need only know that charges are pending against him, that he has refused to answer to those charges and that he has left the jurisdiction where the charges are pending.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b244-13\">Here, the evidence presented at trial showed that at the time he possessed the firearm in 2004, Bennette knew that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest in Maine for obtaining goods by false pretenses. The government also presented the testimony of Bennette\u2019s friend who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>stated that Bennette had told him that when Bennette was young, he left a company and created his own \u201cseverance package\u201d by charging \u201csome stuff\u2019 from the supply house and then leaving. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, we find that this evidence was sufficient to show that Bennette knew he had committed a crime when he \u201ccreated\u201d his \u201cseverance package\u201d in Maine and thus it supported the jury\u2019s finding that Bennette left Maine with the knowledge that there were charges pending against him in that state.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Bennette\u2019s conviction. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b244-8\">. The parties stipulated that the firearm at issue in this case traveled in interstate commerce. (J.A. 238).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b245-17\">. Bennette does not assert on appeal that the government failed to meet the second prong of <em>Spillane; </em>namely, that he refused to answer the charges by appearing before the tribunal in Maine. Further, he does not dispute that he possessed a firearm.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
