Beauchman of conspiring to manufacture 500 or more grams of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846, and of possessing two firearms \u201cin furtherance\u201d of his drug trafficking crimes, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924. On appeal, Beauchman challenges the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict him on these two counts. Because the government presented ample evidence during Beauchman\u2019s trial to support the jury\u2019s findings, we affirm both convictions. We also hold that Beauchman\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated when the government presented evidence of an inculpatory statement Beauchman made, post-indictment and without counsel, to a federal agent. Finally, we do not address Beauchman\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>sentencing-related claim because he has waived the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Beauchman first argues that the government failed to present sufficient evidence that he conspired to manufacture 500 or more grams of methamphetamine because it produced only 9.8 grams of pure methamphetamine from a flask police seized from Beauchman\u2019s garage. That flask, however, contained 1500 grams of a substance which, according to trial testimony from the state\u2019s forensic scientist, contained detectable amounts of methamphetamine. When deciding the statutory minimum sentence mandated by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 in cases involving methamphetamine, we consider the full weight of a \u201cmixture or substance\u201d and not simply that portion of the mixture that is \u201creadily marketable\u201d or \u201cdistributable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Beltran-Felix, </em>934 F.2d 1075, 1076 (9th Cir.1991). As a result, presenting evidence that a 1500-gram mixture contained detectable amounts of methamphetamine is sufficient to convict Beauchman of conspiring to manufacture 500 or more grams.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Beauchman argues that <em>Beltran-Felix </em>is no longer good law following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chapman v. United States, </em>500 U.S. 453, 111 S.Ct. 1919, 114 L.Ed.2d 524 (1991). The two cases, however, do not irreconcilably conflict. Like <em>Beltran-Felix, Chapman </em>held that because \u00a7 841(b) \u201crefers to a \u2018mixture or substance\u2019 containing a detectable amount,\u201d as long as some portion of the seized mixture or substance \u201ccontains a detectable amount, the entire mixture or substance is to be weighed when calculating the sentence.\u201d 500 U.S. at 459, 111 S.Ct. 1919. That <em>Chapman </em>did not undermine <em>Beltran-Felix </em>is further supported by subsequent Ninth Circuit cases that have recognized <em>Beltran-Felix\u2019s </em>continuing viability. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Innie, </em>7 F.3d 840, 845-47 (9th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Robins, </em>967 F.2d 1387, 1389-90 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">Beauchman also argues that <em>BeltranFelix </em>is no longer good law following a 1993 amendment to \u00a7 2D1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. A change in the manner that sentences are calculated under the Guidelines, however, does not require a change in the manner that mandatory minimum sentences are calculated under \u00a7 841. <em>See Neal v. United States, </em>516 U.S. 284, 290, 116 S.Ct. 763, 133 L.Ed.2d 709 (1996); <em>United States v. Sprague, </em>135 F.3d 1301, 1306 n. 4 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In short, because <em>Beltran-Felix </em>remains good law, Beauchman\u2019s conviction for conspiring to manufacture 500 or more grams of methamphetamine must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-12\">We also affirm Beauchman\u2019s conviction under 18 U.S.C. <em>\u00a7 </em>924(c) for possession of two firearms \u201cin furtherance\u201d of his drug trafficking crimes. The government presented sufficient evidence to establish the requisite \u201cnexus between the guns discovered and the underlying offense,\u201d such that the jury was able to conclude that \u201cthe defendant <em>intended </em>to use the firearm[s] to promote or facilitate the drug crime.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rios, </em>449 F.3d 1009, 1012 (9th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Krouse, </em>370 F.3d 965, 967-68 (9th Cir.2004)). Specifically, Beauchman\u2019s firearms were found loaded and stashed in a bedroom closet that housed numerous unopened boxes of cold and sinus tablets containing pseudoephedrine, as well as other drug manufacturing paraphernalia. In the adjoining bedroom, police found 66.3 grams of pure methamphetamine, more cold and sinus tablets, another loaded firearm, and other drug <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>paraphernalia items. Because this evidence speaks to the \u201cproximity, accessibility, and strategic location of the firearms in relation to the locus of drug activities,\u201d <em>Rios, </em>449 F.3d at 1012, it sufficiently supports the jury\u2019s finding that Beauchman possessed his firearms \u201cin furtherance\u201d of his drug-trafficking activities. Beauehman\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c) is, therefore, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Next, Beauchman argues that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated when the government used during trial an inculpatory statement Beauchman made, post-indictment and outside the presence of counsel, to a federal agent. Because Beauchman presented no evidence that the agent \u201cdeliberately elicited\u201d the statement, his Sixth Amendment claim fails. <em>See Fellers v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 519, 524, 124 S.Ct. 1019, 157 L.Ed.2d 1016 (2004); <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 206, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Finally, Beauchman argues that his case should be remanded for resentencing because the sentencing judge failed to consider sufficiently the factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Beauchman, however, did not raise this issue in his opening brief. The claim has therefore been waived. <em>See Eberle v. City of Anaheim, </em>901 F.2d 814, 818 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b612-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
