He filed a motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Prior to ruling on the merits of Ramirez\u2019s motion, the district court denied Ramirez\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel, struck a pleading exceeding the page limitation, and ordered Ramirez to cure certain deficiencies in his pleadings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>Ramirez now moves this court for a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s determination on these interlocutory issues. Ramirez also moves this court for authority to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u201cThis Court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction, on its own motion, if necessary.\u201d <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The district court\u2019s orders denying the appointment of counsel, striking a pleading, and ordering Ramirez to cure deficiencies are non-appealable interlocutory orders. <em>See Thomas v. Scott, </em>47 F.3d 713, 714-16 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Brinar v. Williamson, </em>245 F.3d 515, 516-18 (5th Cir. 2001). This court is without jurisdiction to consider Ramirez\u2019s appeal. Accordingly, Ramirez\u2019s motion for a COA is denied, and the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Ramirez\u2019s motion for authorization to proceed IFP on appeal is also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">MOTIONS DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b367-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
