Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Tesfaye fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that she seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-20\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Tesfaye\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum \u2014 even though the facts that must be proved are the same \u2014 an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Tesfaye fails to show that she is eligible for asylum, she cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-21\">We also find that Tesfaye fails to meet the standard for relief under the Convention Against Torture. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c)(2) (2004). We find that Tesfaye fails to make the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-22\">Finally, we have reviewed the record and the Board\u2019s order and find that the Board did not abuse its discretion in denying Tesfaye\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2006); <em>Jean v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 475, 481 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-23\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review for the reasons stated by the Board. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
