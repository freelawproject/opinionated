Straiton petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) that affirmed the decision of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). OPM based Mr. Straiton\u2019s share of his retirement annuity on Mr. Straiton\u2019s actual monthly annuity payment at the time of retirement rather than on a hypothetical monthly annuity payment based on his salary at the time of his divorce. <em>Straiton v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. AT-0831-05-0798-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov.18, 2005)(Final Decision). Discerning no error, this court <em>affirms.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b954-11\">John and Esther Straiton divorced on April 10, 1987 after approximately sixteen and one-half years of marriage. On September 3, 2000, Mr. Straiton retired from the federal government after thirty-three years of federal service. Upon his retirement, OPM calculated the division of his retirement annuity based on a hypothetical annuity using an \u201caverage pay\u201d of $50,-354 \u2014 the pay Mr. Straiton expected to receive at the time of the divorce under the couple\u2019s marriage settlement agreement (MSA).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-15\">More than three years after Mr. Straiton retired, OPM reconsidered its interpretation of the divorce judgment. OPM concluded that the divorce judgment did not contain express language limiting Mrs. Straiton\u2019s portion of Mr. Straiton\u2019s annuity to the annuitant\u2019s pay level at the time of the divorce. OPM further concluded the express language of the divorce judgment did not limit the \u201ctotal years of service\u201d in the annuity formula to the length of service at the time of the divorce. Additionally, OPM granted Mrs. Straiton annual cost-of-living adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-16\">Based on its revised interpretation of the divorce judgment, OPM determined it had underpaid Mrs. Straiton and overpaid Mr. Straiton a total of $24,123.31. On July 1, 2004, OPM notified Mr. Straiton of OPM\u2019s intent to recover these funds. Mr. Straiton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-17\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b954-18\">This court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-19\">A former spouse receives that portion of an employee\u2019s retirement benefits expressly provided in a divorce order. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.1004(a) (2006). Further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-20\">[ujnless the court order directly and unequivocally orders otherwise, a court order that awards a former spouse a por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"931\">*931</page-number>tion of an employee annuity either on a percentage basis or by use of a fraction or formula provides that the former spouse\u2019s share of the employee annuity will be adjusted to maintain the same percentage or fraction whenever the employee annuity changes as a result of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-5\">(i) Salary adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and before the employee retires; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-6\">(ii) Cost-of-living adjustments occurring after the date of the decree and after the date of the employee\u2019s retirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">5 C.F.R. \u00a7 838.622(b)(1) (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The After Acquired Property and Retirement Rights sections of the MSA are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-9\">10. <em>AFTER ACQUIRED PROPERTY: </em>All income, earnings, or other property received or acquired by either party to this agreement on or after the date of separation shall be the sole and separate property of the receiving or acquiring party. Each party as of the effective date of this agreement, does hereby and forever waive, release and relinquish all right, title, and interest in and to such income, earnings, or other properties so received or so acquired by the other party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-10\">22. <em>RETIREMENT RIGHTS:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-11\">For 16)6 years during the marriage of the parties, Husband was employed as a civil servant in the United STates [sic] government (NASA), and is to be rated GS 14, Step 5, at a salary rate of $50,354 to commence upon his entering into work at Kennedy Space Center, Florida. (The parties acknowledge that in California they enjoyed a higher income from husband\u2019s employment, due to special pay reflecting California\u2019s higher cost of living).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-12\">The parties agree that based <em>on the 16% years as set forth above, </em>the community property equation as to wife\u2019s rights in said retirement, is)6 x 16)6 over total years of service, x monthly income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-14\">The parties further agree that, upon Husband\u2019s retirement from the employment giving rise to retirement rights recited herein, <em>the income then received </em>shall be divided between the parties according to the formula above-cited; and that husband will do nothing to prevent such income from being divided at the source, to the extent that such division is available from the paying source at that time. (Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-15\">In addition to the MSA, the divorce judgment includes an \u201cAttachment to Judgment of Dissolution of Marriage,\u201d reciting, <em>inter alia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b955-16\">IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that petitioner is entitled to a <em>community property share </em>of Respondent\u2019s NASA retirement income as follows:J\u00e9 x 16)6 over total years of service x monthly income. Upon Respondent\u2019s retirement from NASA employment, the income then received shall be divided according to the above formula and Respondent shall do nothing to prevent such income from being divided at the source. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-17\">Mr. Straiton argues the phrase \u201cas set forth above\u201d in section 22 of the MSA refers to the $50,354 salary recited in the preceding paragraph. OPM, however, suggests a more natural reading of section 22 in which \u201cas set forth above\u201d refers to, and emphasizes the \u201c16)6 years\u201d recited in the preceding paragraph and repeated just before to \u201cas set forth above.\u201d Further, although MSA refers to Mr. Straiton\u2019s expected salary at the time of the divorce, it does not expressly require use of this salary in the calculation of the division of the annuity.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>Regarding Mr. Stratton\u2019s argument that OPM\u2019s revised interpretation creates an inconsistency between sections 10 and 22 of the MSA, this argument necessarily requires equating retirement income as an after acquired income, earnings, or other property. The Board, however, explicitly found retirement benefits are not income, earnings, or property and that section 10 does not apply. Indeed, Mr. Stratton\u2019s reading of a conflict between sections 10 and 22 would completely render section 22 ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Additionally, Mr. Stratton\u2019s relies on <em>In re Marriage of Brown, </em>15 Cal.3d 838, 126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561, (1976) for the proposition that division of his retirement annuity must be based on his salary at the time of his divorce. His reliance on <em>Brown </em>is misplaced. In overruling <em>French v. French </em>17 Cal.2d 775, 112 P.2d 235 (1941), the California Supreme Court merely held that non-vested pension rights are community property. 15 Cal.3d at 842, 126 Cal.Rptr. 633, 544 P.2d 561. <em>Brown </em>enunciates only the unremarkable proposition that community property, including rights to community assets not yet vested, must be divided equally at the time of divorce. <em>Id. </em>at 847-48. <em>Brown </em>says nothing regarding the actual determination of the community property or its division.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">For the foregoing reasons, this court affirms the final decision of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
