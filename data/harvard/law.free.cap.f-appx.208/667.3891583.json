McCONNELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">James Sherrill, a prisoner in military custody, appeals from the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 60(b) motion to reopen his habeas corpus action. Finding no merit to his argument that <em>Brown v. Sanders, </em>546 U.S. 212, 126 S.Ct. 884, 163 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), calls his sentence into question, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">A general court martial convicted Mr. Sherrill of absence without leave, indecent acts upon a minor, two specifications of indecent liberties upon a minor, desertion, and disorderly conduct. For these crimes, Mr. Sherrill received a sentence of dishonorable discharge and twelve years incarceration. On appeal, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals (\u201cACCA\u201d) dismissed a finding of indecent liberties on a minor but affirmed the remaining findings and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Mr. Sherrill filed a petition for habeas corpus in 2002. The district court denied the petition and this Court affirmed. <em>Sherrill v. Commandant, USDB, </em>118 Fed. Appx. 384 (10th Cir.2004). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s denial of Mr. Sherrill\u2019s petition for certiorari, 544 U.S. 936, 125 S.Ct. 1690, 161 L.Ed.2d 505 (2005), Mr. Sherrill filed a motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) in the district court, seeking to reopen his habeas action and claiming that under <em>Brown v. Sanders, </em>546 U.S. 212,126 S.Ct. 884, 163 L.Ed.2d 723 (2006), his sentence was unconstitutional because it was based on an invalidated sentencing factor. The court denied the motion, noting that <em>Brown </em>provides \u201clittle support\u201d for Mr. Sherrill\u2019s argument and also that the same issue was considered and denied in the original habeas proceeding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> R. Vol. I, Doc. 45, at 2-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Mr. Sherrill timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">\u201cA district court has discretion to grant relief as justice requires under Rule 60(b), yet such relief is extraordinary and may only be granted in exceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Servants of Paraclete v. Does, </em>204 F.3d 1005, 1009 (10th Cir.2000) (internal quotations marks omitted). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">In <em>Brown, </em>the Supreme Court announced a new rule for evaluating the effect of the invalidation of sentencing factors in capital cases. The Court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAs\">[a]n invalidated sentencing factor (whether an eligibility factor or not) will render the sentence unconstitutional by reason of its adding an improper element to the aggravation scale in the weighing process <em>unless </em>one of the other sentencing factors enables the sentencer to give aggravating weight to the same facts and circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-15\"><em>Brown, </em>126 S.Ct. at 892. Mr. Sherrill, reasoning from <em>Brown, </em>argues that be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>cause the ACCA dismissed a finding of indecent liberties upon a minor, his sentence \u2014 which issued before that dismissal \u2014 was based upon an invalidated sentencing factor. He also argues that <em>Brown </em>ushered in a new standard of review for claims such as his, and that the ACCA\u2019s review of his sentence was therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We agree with the district court that <em>Brown </em>lends little support to Mr. Sherrill\u2019s argument. <em>Brown </em>concerned the specific jurisprudence surrounding capital sentencing, and absent guidance from the Supreme Court, we will not expand its holding beyond that realm. Accordingly, Mr. Sherrill\u2019s claim is unchanged from the general objection to the ACCA\u2019s reassessment of his sentence that both the district court and this Court considered and rejected when reviewing his habeas petition. We held that \u201c[i]f the military courts have fully and fairly reviewed Sherrill\u2019s claims, we cannot review them.\u201d <em>Sherrill, </em>118 Fed. Appx. at 385 (citing <em>Roberts v. Callahan, </em>321 F.3d 994, 995 (10th Cir.2003)). We found that the military courts had, in fact, \u201cfully and fairly considered Sherrill\u2019s claims that he was denied due process in reassessing his sentence,\u201d and thus held we could not review the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 386. We stand by that ruling and thus must affirm the denial of Mr. Sherrill\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This case is therefore submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 (eff. Dec. 1, 2006) and 10th Cir. R. 32.1 (eff. Jan. 1, 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b692-17\">. The district court also found moot Mr. Sherrill\u2019s request for a stay and abeyance pending his transfer between correctional facilities. Mr. Sherrill does not argue that this ruling was in error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
