After review, we vacate the district court\u2019s order, and remand to the district court for a determination in the first instance of whether Scott\u2019s claim satisfies the test for ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-21\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b798-22\">Scott is currently serving a life-plus-25year sentence after being convicted by a jury of malice murder, kidnaping, aggravated assault, and possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony. Scott was tried with two codefendants, Jamie McKenzie and Herman Morris. At the joint trial, Johnersan Adams testified that two weeks after the murder, he had a conversation with Morris. During that conversation, Morris admitted that he and four other individuals murdered the victim because he \u201csold them bad drugs.\u201d According to Adams, Morris further stated there were two \u201ctriggermen\u201d who actually shot the victim, but Morris claimed that he was not one of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-23\">After Scott was convicted, he filed a motion for a new trial, arguing, in part, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Adams\u2019 testimony. At the hearing on Scott\u2019s motion for a new trial, Scott\u2019s trial counsel testified that he did not object to Adams\u2019 testimony because \u201cduring the course of trial, some things slip past you. And if I did not object then that was one of those things that did.\u201d The trial court denied Scott\u2019s motion for a new trial, finding that Morris\u2019s statement to Adams related only to his involvement in the crime, which was not hearsay, and did not violate Scott\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. On direct appeal, the Georgia Supreme Court found that Morris\u2019s incriminating statements did not implicate Scott, and, therefore, Scott\u2019s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the testimony. <em>See McKenzie v. </em>State, 274 Ga. 151, 549 S.E.2d 387, 338 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Scott filed a habeas petition in state court, and an evidentiary hearing was held. At the hearing, Scott\u2019s trial counsel testified that he recognized that Adams\u2019 testimony contained hearsay, but he did not object because Adams\u2019 testimony did not implicate Scott. The state court denied Scott\u2019s habeas petition, finding he failed to show his counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally ineffective under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Scott then filed an application for certificate of probable cause to appeal the denial of his habeas petition, which the Georgia Supreme Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Scott then filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition in federal district court. The magistrate judge recommended denying the petition because Scott did not meet his burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness of the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s determination of the factual issues raised in his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Scott objected to the recommendation, but the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and denied Scott\u2019s habeas petition. This Court granted a Certificate of Appealability on the issue of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuA\">Whether the Georgia Supreme Court\u2019s finding that a witness\u2019 testimony as to a codefendant\u2019s incriminating statements did not implicate the appellant, and, therefore, his trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to it or request a jury instruction limiting consideration of the testimony to the culpability of the codefendant, was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law, or relied on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the state court proceedings, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b799-9\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition <em>de novo. McNair v. Campbell, </em>416 F.3d 1291, 1297 (11th Cir.2005). Factual findings are reviewed for clear error. Mixed questions of law and fact, including claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b799-11\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d), a federal court may not grant habeas relief on claims that were previously adjudicated in state court, unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the [U.S.] Supreme Court, ... or resulted in a decision based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u2014 (2). A state court decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d established law if (1) the state arrives at a conclusion opposite to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law, or (2) a state court confronts facts \u201cmaterially indistinguishable from relevant Supreme Court precedent, but reaches an opposite result.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 1519, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The Court added that a state court decision is an \u201cunreasonable application\u201d of clearly established law if the state court unreasonably applies controlling law, or unreasonably extends, or fails to extend, a legal principle to a new context. <em>Id. </em>at 1520.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Scott asserts his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Adams\u2019 testimony. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must show that: (1) his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient; and, (2) the deficient performance prejudiced his defense. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Regarding the first prong, there is a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s actions were reasonable, and the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action \u201cmight be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2065. The Georgia Supreme Court and the district court both found Scott\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">In <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 1621-22, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), the Supreme Court held that, in a joint trial, the admission of a codefendant\u2019s confession, which implicated the petitioner, violated the petitioner\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. Because the codefendant did not take the stand, the Court held, \u201cthe introduction of [the] confession added substantial, perhaps even critical, weight to the Government\u2019s case in a form not subject to cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1623. Thus, the petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated despite the fact that the court issued a limiting instruction directing the jury only to consider the confession as evidence of the codefendant\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 1628 (holding \u201cin the context of a joint trial we cannot accept limiting instructions as an adequate substitute for petitioner\u2019s constitutional right of cross-examination.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In <em>Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1709, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987), the Court limited the scope of <em>Bruton </em>and held \u201cthe Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession with a proper limiting instruction when, ... the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendant\u2019s name, but any reference to his or her existence.\u201d The Court distinguished <em>Bruton </em>by noting that, in <em>Bruton, </em>\u201cthe codefendant\u2019s confession expressly implicated the defendant as his accomplice,\u201d whereas in <em>Richardson, </em>\u201cthe confession was not incriminating on its face, and became so only when linked with evidence introduced later at trial.\u201d <em>Richardson, </em>107 S.Ct. at 1707 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The Court further noted the issue was not whether the confession implicated Richardson, but rather whether the trial court could have properly assumed that the jury did not use it against Richardson. <em>Id. </em>at 1707 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">On the other hand, in <em>Gray v. Maryland, </em>523 U.S. 185, 118 S.Ct. 1151, 1153, 1155, 140 L.Ed.2d 294, (1998), the Supreme Court extended <em>Bruton\u2019s </em>protective rule and held the Sixth Amendment also bars the admission of a codefendant\u2019s confession that has been redacted by \u201creplae[ing] a defendant\u2019s name with an obvious indication of deletion, such as a blank space, the word \u2018deleted,\u2019 or a similar symbol.\u201d In <em>Gray, </em>Gray\u2019s codefendant gave a confession to the police, in which he stated that he, Gray, and another codefendant participated in the beating death of the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 1153. At trial, the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>introduced the codefendant\u2019s confession with Gray\u2019s and the other codefendant\u2019s names redacted. <em>Id. </em>When the detective read the confession, he said the word \u201cdeleted\u201d or \u201cdeletion\u201d whenever Gray\u2019s or the other codefendants\u2019 names appeared. <em>Id. </em>After reading the confession, the prosecutor asked the detective whether he was subsequently able to arrest Gray, and the detective said, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The state also produced other witnesses who said that six persons participated in the beating. <em>Id. </em>The Court reasoned, the \u201cobvious deletion\u201d calls the jury\u2019s attention to the omitted name and encourages the jurors \u201cto speculate about the reference,\u201d and, ultimately, to link it to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1155-56. The Court further stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-5\">Consider a simplified but typical example, a confession that reads \u201cI, Bob Smith, along with Sam Jones, robbed the bank.\u201d To replace the words \u201cSam Jones\u201d with an obvious blank will not likely fool anyone. A juror somewhat familiar with criminal law would know immediately that the blank, in the phrase \u201cI, Bob Smith, along with, robbed the bank,\u201d refers to defendant Jones. A juror who does not know the law and who therefore wonders to whom the blank might refer need only lift his eyes to Jones, sitting at counsel table, to find what will seem the obvious answer ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Id. at 1155. The Court acknowledged the jury had to use an inference to connect the statement in the redacted confession with Gray, but the focus must be on the kind of inference, not the simple fact of inference. Id. at 1156-57. The Court explained \u201c[t]he inferences at issue here involve statements that, despite redaction, obviously refer directly to someone, often obviously the defendant, and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced at trial.\u201d Id. at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">In <em>Bruton, Richardson, </em>and <em>Gray, </em>the Court emphasized the jurors were instructed to consider the confession only as evidence of the culpability of the confessing codefendant. <em>See, e.g., Richardson, </em>107 S.Ct. at 1707 (noting \u201c[ojrdinarily, a witness whose testimony is introduced at a joint trial is not considered to be a witness \u2018against\u2019 a defendant if the jury is instructed to consider that testimony only against a codefendant.\u201d). Generally, where such a limiting instruction is provided, courts are free to assume the jury obeyed that instruction. <em>See id. </em>at 1709 (noting \u201c[t]he rule that juries are presumed to follow their instructions is a pragmatic one, rooted less in the absolute certitude that the presumption is true than in the belief that it represents a reasonable practical accommodation of the interests of the state and the defendant in the criminal justice process.\u201d). In <em>Bruton, </em>however, the Court recognized \u201cthere are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\u201d <em>Bruton, </em>88 S.Ct. at 1627.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">In this case, unlike in <em>Bruton, Richardson, </em>and <em>Gray, </em>the trial court did not issue a limiting instruction, and, therefore, the jury was free to consider the witness\u2019 testimony regarding Morris\u2019s admissions as evidence of Scott\u2019s guilt. The instant case is comparable to <em>Gray </em>because even though Morris did not specifically identify Scott in his statements to the witness, the clear implication was that he was referring to Scott when he said that there were two triggermen. The implication was the three named defendants who were tried together were responsible for the victim\u2019s death. Given the prejudicial nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>testimony and the fact Scott\u2019s trial counsel admitted at one point the decision not to object was not a strategic one, the state court\u2019s conclusion that Scott\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to it was an unreasonable application of <em>Strickland. </em>Therefore, the state court and district court denied relief based on an unreasonable application of the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test and never reached the second prong. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand for a determination in the first instance of whether Scott\u2019s claim satisfies the second prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
