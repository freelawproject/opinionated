FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANp\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">I write separately to note that the record we reviewed supports a finding that there is substantial evidence of past persecution and of a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of imputed political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">First, Kabateraine presented unrebutted evidence of past persecution. \u201cPhysical harm has consistently been treated as persecution.\u201d <em>Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2000). The IJ acknowledged that Kabateraine\u2019s testimony was credible. Kabateraine testified that the first time he was arrested, he was detained for four days and beaten with a belt and stick by secret service agents who were part of the governing National Resistance Movement (\u201cNRM\u201d). He testified that during his second arrest, the secret service \u201ctortured ... and ... beat me seriously.\u201d The secret service agents burned Kabateraine\u2019s stomach and left rib cage with a sharp instrument \u201cto get me to talk\u201d and \u201cslammed on my legs so hard\u201d that they broke his kneecap. They continued to beat him with a boot and a stick. As a result, Kabateraine had to use a cane for about three months and has permanent scars. The harm Kabateraine suffered clearly rises to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-13\">Second, Kabateraine demonstrated that \u201chis persecutors actually imputed a political opinion to him,\u201d <em>Sangha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482,1489 (9th Cir.1997), because the secret service agents thought the Well-wishers charity organization he created and headed \u201cw[as] political in nature.\u201d It is well-established that persecution due to imputed political opinion is a valid basis for asylum. <em>See, e.g., Sangha, </em>103 F.3d at 1489 (\u201cIf the persecutor attributed a political opinion to the victim, and acted upon the attribution, this imputed view becomes the applicant\u2019s political opinion as required under the Act.\u201d); <em>Canas-Segovia v. INS, </em>970 F.2d 599, 601-02 (9th Cir.1992); <em>Navas v. INS, </em>217 F.3d 646, 658 (9th Cir. 2000) (imputed political opinion can be established where \u201cpolitical opinion [is] attributed to him by his persecutors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-14\">Kabateraine testified that the secret service agents who detained and beat him \u201cthought ... [the Well-wishers] were not agreeing with the government and ... what the government was doing at the time.\u201d Kabateraine held Well-wishers meetings in his restaurant. He testified that during his first detention, the secret service agents \u201cmainly ... were interrogating ... to get me [to] say something about the meetings, and I would tell them that mainly they were just ... charity meetings.\u201d The agents asked, \u201care your meetings ... political in nature,\u201d \u201c[a]re your meetings discussing anything about the government,\u201d and \u201c[a]re your meetings contributing money for other causes other than, ... the cause you\u2019re telling us?\u201d During his second detention, the agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>again demanded to know whether the Well-wishers meetings were \u201cpolitical in nature.\u201d Kabateraine testified, \u201cI wasn\u2019t saying anything that they wanted to hear as far as the ... meetings were concerned,\u201d so they tortured him.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Kabateraine\u2019s uncontradicted testimony demonstrated that NRM secret service agents tortured him because they thought that he was engaged in anti-government political activity through the Well-wishers. <em>See Navas, </em>217 F.3d at 657 (only <em>\u201csome </em>evidence of [the persecutors\u2019 motive], direct or circumstantial\u201d is required) (quoting <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)). That Kabateraine\u2019s father was a member of the former regime and Kabateraine was related through his first wife to Paul Muwanga, the former Vice President, provided additional evidence that the NRM believed Kabateraine to be politically active. Whether or not Kabateraine was <em>in fact </em>politically active is irrelevant. The record evidence would seem to compel a reasonable factfinder to conclude that the NRM persecuted him on account of imputed political opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Having presented substantial evidence of past persecution, Kabateraine is presumed to have a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Navas, </em>217 F.3d at 657; <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1194, 1204 (9th Cir.2004). The burden shifts to the government \u201cto show by a preponderance of the evidence that country conditions have changed to such an extent (as applied to the individual\u2019s case) that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear that he would be persecuted if he were to return.\u201d <em>Navas, </em>217 F.3d at 657. The evidence shows that the NRM government headed by Museveni is still in power, \u201c[t]he local police chief has never changed,\u201d Kabateraine could not move elsewhere in Uganda because \u201cthe government ... would find [him],\u201d and, most importantly, the government still arrests, beats, and kills their perceived and actual political opponents. There is no evidence in the record of relevant changes in the Ugandan government that would undermine Kabateraine\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution should he return.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">The issue of whether Kabateraine has established entitlement to withholding of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>removal under the Convention Against Torture turns on whether the persecution he suffered rose to the level of torture. This would seem to be the case. The evidence in the record shows that governmental security forces and local police specifically target, arrest, and torture perceived political opponents such as Kabateraine. Of course, \u201crelief under the Convention does not require that the prospective risk of torture be on account of certain protected grounds,\u201d <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1280 (9th Cir.2001), but that Kabateraine would more likely than not be tortured if he returned to Uganda. Given his credible testimony about past torture, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(i), and the evidence showing continued \u201cgross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights\u201d in Uganda, <em>id. </em>at \u00a7 208.16(c)(3)(iii), it would seem that Kabateraine has established eligibility for relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">For these reasons, I believe that on reconsideration, the BIA will be compelled to grant Kabateraine\u2019s asylum application, withholding of deportation because of fear of future persecution, and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture because of substantial grounds for believing he would be in danger of being subjected to torture in Uganda.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b602-5\">. Even though Kabateraine acknowledged that the Ugandan government did not permit public meetings, there is \u201cno evidence in the record ... that an actual, legitimate, criminal prosecution was initiated against\u201d him. <em>Singh v. Ilchert, </em>63 F.3d 1501, 1509 (9th Cir. 1995) (quoting <em>Blanco-Lopez v. INS, </em>858 F.2d 531, 534 (9th Cir.1988)) (quotation marks omitted). First, there is no evidence in the record showing that the kind of meetings Kabateraine held violated Ugandan law. Second, Kabateraine explained that while Well-wishers meetings were open to anyone interested in attending, they were not public meetings in the sense he believed were prohibited by the Ugandan government. He testified, \"[t]he meetings that [the government] never allowed was like going in public and calling the people and talking about anything like that was ... contrary ... to the government.\u201d The Well-wishers meetings were \"not those particular meetings.\u201d Third, Kabateraine\u2019s detentions, one of which lasted four days and the other of which involved being burned with a sharp object and having a kneecap broken, \"can hardly [be] characterize^] ... as an example of legitimate criminal prosecution.\u201d <em>Blanco-Lopez, </em>858 F.2d at 534. In any case, Kabateraine\u2019s country conditions evidence shows that the Ugandan government suppressed public demonstrations <em>as a means of political repression. </em>Thus, on remand, the BIA will be compelled to conclude that \"the incidents] described by [Kabateraine] w[ere] not in furtherance of a criminal prosecution, but rather w[ere] one[s] of governmental <em>persecution </em>based on [his] perceived political beliefs.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Singh, </em>63 F.3d at 1510 (\"The task of the alien is simply to demonstrate the reasonableness of a motivation which is related to one of the enumerated grounds.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
