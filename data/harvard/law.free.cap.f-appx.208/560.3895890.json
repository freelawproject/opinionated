The IJ\u2019s determination that Petitioners were not subject to past persecution is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Nahrvani v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2005) (noting that anonymous and vague threats do not rise to the level of persecution); <em>see also Ramos-Vasquez v. INS, </em>57 F.3d 857, 861 (9th Cir.1995) (explaining that isolated incidents of violence against family members do not establish past persecution where there is no \u201cpattern of persecution closely tied to the petitioner\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">2. The IJ\u2019s conclusion that Petitioners faded to demonstrate a reasonable fear of future persecution is also supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Belayneh v.
