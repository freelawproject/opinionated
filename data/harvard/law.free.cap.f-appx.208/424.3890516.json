The district court granted the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because Olynyk failed to file a valid charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">After a careful review of the record, the parties\u2019 briefs and the applicable law, we are convinced that the district court correctly determined that Olynyk\u2019s intake questionnaire could not be construed as a valid charge within the meaning of Title VII because Olynyk did not manifest her intent to activate the machinery of Title VII. Thus, we find that the district court properly concluded that the Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Olynyk\u2019s claims and decline to reach the remaining issues raised by the parties on appeal and cross-appeal. Because the district court\u2019s opinion accurately sets out the law governing this issue and clearly states the reasons for its conclusion, issuance of a more lengthy opinion in this case would not serve a useful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
