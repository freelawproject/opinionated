Echols alleged in his complaint that Home Depot discriminated against him by failing to hire him for an administrative position with the company. On appeal, he claims that the district court erred by finding that the reasons given for. his non-selection were legitimate and not pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-14\">Upon review of the briefs and the record, we find that the district court correctly concluded that Echols failed to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether Home Depot\u2019s proffered reasons for failing to hire him were pretextual. The record reflects that Marvin Ellison, an African-American and a Home Depot supervisor, initially offered the job to another African-American who declined it. He then selected Bret Graddy, a white male, because of his superior experience and qualifications. Ellison says that Echols was not selected because of his lack of a college degree, lack of strategic planning experience, and a history of job hopping. We find nothing in the record, other than Echols\u2019s own unsupported claims, to support a conclusion that these reasons were a pretext for discrimination or that a racial motivation otherwise affected Ellison\u2019s decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-15\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
