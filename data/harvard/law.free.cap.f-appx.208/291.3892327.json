He argues that the district court erred in assessing a 16-level \u201ccrime of violence\u201d enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) based on a prior Florida conviction for burglary of a dwelling. He argues that the Florida statute is over broad because it includes \u201ccurtilage\u201d in the definition of \u201cdwelling.\u201d <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 810.02, 810.011(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-16\">Stewart\u2019s argument is without merit. The charging document for one of the burglaries on which the enhancement was based indicates that he burglarized an apartment. An apartment is designed for human habitation and is therefore within the meaning of a \u201cdwelling\u201d for purposes of \u201cburglary of a dwelling\u201d as used in the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Murillo-Lopez, </em>444 F.3d 337, 345 (5th Cir.2006); \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii), comment. (n.1(B)(iii)); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 810.011(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-17\">Stewart\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Stewart contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. See <em>United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b316-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
