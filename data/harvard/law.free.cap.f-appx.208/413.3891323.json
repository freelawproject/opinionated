GUY COLE, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">Plaintiffs-Appellants Willie Halsell, Aaron Johnson, Keithen Jones, Reuben Mundy, and Basil Lewis (the \u201cPlaintiffs\u201d) appeal the grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants-Appellees Officers Antonio Etter, Charles Zopfi, and Dean Chatman (the \u201cOfficers\u201d). The Plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 against the Officers, asserting a violation of the Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The district court granted summary judgment for the Officers, concluding that the Officers were entitled to qualified immunity. The court held that (1) there was no violation of the Plaintiffs\u2019 constitutional rights because the Officers\u2019 conduct was reasonable, and (2) the Plaintiffs did not establish that the Officers violated a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for the Officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b438-14\">On May 1, 2003, Officers Antonio Etter and Charles Zopfi of the Cincinnati Police Department were dispatched to investigate a shooting at or near 1111 Elm Street. Their affidavits state that when they arrived at the scene \u201ca number of citizens [were] pointing in a northeasterly direction stating that the suspect who committed the shooting ran toward West 12th Street.\u201d The officers headed towards West 12th Street and testified that upon arriving \u201cseveral citizens told [them] that the shooting suspect ran into a barbershop.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-15\">Before entering the barbershop, Officer Zopfi requested assistance from other officers. Both Etter and Zopfi testified that a request for backup was consistent with police procedure for the Cincinnati Police Department. In response to Officer Zopfi\u2019s request, Officer Dean Chatman arrived at the barbershop.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-16\">Basil Lewis (a barber) exited the barbershop after seeing police officers gathered outside and before any officer entered the barbershop. Lewis testified that he saw the police, went outside, and heard a voice on a police radio say \u201cthe suspect is wearing a white tee shirt.\u201d At the time, Lewis was wearing a white t-shirt. Lewis testified that an officer \u201cpointed a gun\u201d at him and \u201cbarked\u201d at him to put his hands against the car parked at the curb. Lewis replied that he \u201cwould do no such thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Only Officers Zopfi and Chatman entered the barbershop. The two officers testified that they entered with their \u201cweapons pointed at the low-ready position.\u201d Plaintiffs Mundy, Johnson, and Halsell (who were inside the barbershop) all testified that officers entered the barbershop \u201cguns drawn, with their arms extended and slanting down toward the floor.\u201d Officers Zopfi and Chatman explained that they were trained to enter a building with their weapon drawn in the \u201clow-ready position\u201d if they were facing a \u201cpotentially dangerous situation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The officers further testified that as they \u201capproached the rear of the barbershop, a man matching the general description of the person [they] were searching for exited from a bathroom.\u201d A brief investigation revealed that the individual arrested by Officer Chatman was not the suspect wanted for the shooting on Elm Street. None of the Plaintiffs were arrested or detained beyond the time it took the Officers to search the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Reuben Mundy (the owner of the barbershop), Willie Halsell (a customer of the barbershop), and Aaron Johnson (a barber) were inside the barbershop when Officers Chatman and Zopfi entered. Mundy testified that when the officers \u201cburst into the front door of the shop,\u201d they were yelling \u201cwhere is he, where is he?\u201d According to Mundy, the officers, once inside, \u201craised their guns to upper body level and began pointing the guns from person to person, so that everyone in the shop except [Mundy] had a gun pointed directly at his person at least once.\u201d Halsell and Johnson\u2019s testimony corroborated Mundy\u2019s description. Further, Mundy, Halsell, and Johnson all testified that as a result of having a gun pointed at them they were \u201cseverely frightened.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Betty Kelow, a resident of an apartment located above the barbershop, testified that she \u201cnoticed a man in a white tee shirt running past the building\u201d before the officers arrived at the barbershop. According to Kelow, she \u201cwent out the door aqnd [sic] saw the man turning into the alley at the east end of the barbershop building, running fast.\u201d Kelow testified that she went to see where the man went and saw him \u201crun to the end of the alley and jump over the fence in the back of the building.\u201d Kelow further said that she tried to inform the officers of the direction in which she saw the man run but that the officers \u201cdidn\u2019t want to hear from [her] and just told [her] to clear the area, get out of the way, etc.\u201d Kelow\u2019s additional testimony also supports (1) Lewis\u2019s statements that the police pointed a gun at him and asked him to lean against a car, and (2) the testimony of Mundy, Johnson, and Halsell that the officers entered the barbershop with their weapons drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">The Plaintiffs brought a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the Officers, in their individual capacities, alleging that the Officers violated the Plaintiffs\u2019 Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The Officers moved for summary judgment, arguing that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court entered summary judgment in favor of the Officers, concluding that (1) there were no genuine issues of material fact; (2) there was no constitutional violation because, although the plaintiffs were seized, the seizure was not unreasonable; and (3) the Officers were entitled to qualified immunity because raising their guns in the Plaintiffs\u2019 direction did not violate a clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. The Plaintiffs also brought a Fourteenth Amendment claim that the district court dismissed. The court explained that \u201crebanee upon the Due Process Clause is misplaced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>this context because it is the Fourth Amendment that establishes protections in the criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Halsell v. Etter, </em>No. 1:04cv63, 2005 WL 2850140, at *3, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26067, at *9-10 (S.D.Oh. Oct. 31, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">A grant of summary judgment by a district court is reviewed by this Court de novo. <em>Johnson v. Karnes, </em>398 F.3d 868, 873 (6th Cir.2005). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). The moving party bears the burden of proving that there are no genuine issues of material fact. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). This burden is satisfied \u201cby demonstrating that the nonmoving party lacks evidence to support an essential element of its case.\u201d <em>Pack v. Damon Corp., </em>434 F.3d 810, 813 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cThe mere existence of a scintilla of evidence\u201d that supports the non-moving party\u2019s claims is insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>Hopson v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., </em>306 F.3d 427, 432 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Further, this Court must review de novo the grant of summary judgment on grounds of qualified immunity because application of the qualified-immunity doctrine is a question of law. <em>McCloud v. Testa, </em>97 F.3d 1536, 1541 (6th Cir.1996). If there are disagreements about the facts, this Court \u201cmust review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, taking all inferences in their favor.\u201d <em>Champion v. Outlook Nashville, Inc., </em>380 F.3d 893, 900 (6th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Qualified immunity is an affirmative defense for government officials performing discretionary functions. <em>Harlow v. Fitzgerald, </em>457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). These \u201cgovernment officials ... are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court applies a two-step analysis to determine whether a police officer is entitled to qualified immunity: \u201c(1) whether, considering the allegations in a light most favorable to the party injured, a constitutional right has been violated, and (2) whether that right was clearly established.\u201d <em>Estate of Carter v. City of Detroit, </em>408 F.3d 305, 310-11 (6th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court in <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), explained that \u201c[i]f no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Once the Officers raise a qualified-immunity defense, the burden of demonstrating that they are not entitled to qualified immunity is on the Plaintiffs. <em>Silberstein v. City of Dayton, </em>440 F.3d 306, 311 (6th Cir.2006). The Plaintiffs can meet this burden by showing that the Officers\u2019 conduct violated a right \u201cso clearly established that a reasonable [officer] in [their] position would have clearly understood that he or she was under an affirmative duty to refrain from such conduct.\u201d <em>Sheets v. Mullins, </em>287 F.3d 581, 586 (6th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">There are two groups of plaintiffs to consider in this case. First, there is the group that was inside the barbershop when the Officers entered (Plaintiffs Hal-sell, Johnson, Jones, and Mundy) and second, there is Plaintiff Lewis who was out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>side the barbershop during the incident. We first address the seizure of the Plaintiffs inside the barbershop and then address the seizure of Plaintiff Lewis.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">1. <em>Plaintiffs Halsell, Johnson, Jones, and Mundy: Constitutional Violation</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-6\">\n<em>(a) Plaintiffs Halsell, Johnson, Jones, and Mundy were seized by the Officers</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The first step in determining whether an officer is entitled to qualified immunity focuses on whether a constitutional right has been violated, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the injured party. <em>Estate of Carter, </em>408 F.3d at 310-11. To establish a Fourth Amendment violation in a \u00a7 1983 action, the Plaintiffs must show that they were seized by the Officers and that the seizure was unreasonable. <em>Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 599, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989) (\u201cSeizure alone is not enough for \u00a7 1983 liability\u201d; the seizure must be \u201cunreasonable.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980), defined what constitutes a seizure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">[A] person has been \u2018seized\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment only if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave. Examples of circumstances that might indicate a seizure, even where the person did not attempt to leave, would be the threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, ... or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">(footnote omitted). This Court in <em>United States v. Rose, </em>889 F.2d 1490, 1493 (6th Cir.1989), explained that \u201c[w]hat constitutes a restraint on liberty prompting a person to conclude that he is not free to leave will vary with the police conduct at issue and the setting in which the conduct occurred.\u201d Further, behavior that is \u201ccoercive or intimidating\u201d supports an inference that compliance is demanded. <em>Cassady v. Tackett, </em>938 F.2d 693, 696 (6th Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">The district court correctly concluded that the Officers\u2019 conduct in this situation constituted a seizure of the Plaintiffs. According to the district court, \u201c[b]y entering the barbershop, yelling with guns draw [sic], the officers exhibited coercive or intimidating behavior.\u201d <em>Halsell, </em>2005 WL 2850140, at *4, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26067, at *11. Given the manner in which the Officers entered the barbershop, the Plaintiffs\u2019 belief that they were not free to leave was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">According to the Officers, the Plaintiffs were not seized because \u201c[a] necessary display of force by a police officer does not seize every individual inadvertently in the presence of that display of force.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. 9-10.) Under this view, an individual is seized only when the government official purposely directs his or her conduct at that individual. The Officers cite <em>McCoy v. City of Monticello, </em>342 F.3d 842 (8th Cir.2003), for the proposition that the McCoys were seized by police officers because the officers <em>directed </em>their conduct, \u201cthrough means intentionally applied,\u201d at the McCoys. (Appellee\u2019s Br. 9.) In this case, however, the Officers argue that the Plaintiffs were merely bystanders, who suffered the \u201caccidental effects\u201d of the Officers\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-13\">In <em>McCoy, </em>two police officers attempted to stop the McCoys after noticing that they were driving erratically. The police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>officers stopped in front of the McCoys\u2019 vehicle, causing the McCoys to swerve and land in a ditch. Mr. McCoy exited the truck with his hands in the air. The two officers approached the McCoys\u2019 car with their arms extended and holding their handguns. One of the officers started to run, but he slipped and his gun accidently discharged, injuring Mr. McCoy. 342 F.3d at 845-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">The Supreme Court has not placed such a restriction on what constitutes a seizure of an individual. Any conduct by an officer that would lead a reasonable person to believe that he or she was not free to ignore the officer\u2019s request and thus was not free to leave, whether that conduct was directed at the individual or not, is enough to constitute a seizure. <em>See Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870. Additionally, the Officers\u2019 reliance on <em>McCoy </em>is misplaced. <em>McCoy </em>merely distinguishes between an intentional seizure and an accidental seizure. The Eighth Circuit in <em>McCoy </em>stated that to violate the Fourth Amendment, the seizure must be intentional and not accidental because the Fourth Amendment addresses only intentional conduct and not acts of negligence. 342 F.3d at 847.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In the present case, the Officers intended to enter the barbershop and intended to detain the Plaintiffs inside while they looked for the shooting suspect. That the Plaintiffs were inside the barbershop at the time of the search does not make the Officers\u2019 conduct any less intentional. Further, the Officers entered with their weapons drawn and, while scanning the barbershop for the suspect, pointed their weapons at the Plaintiffs. Given the circumstances, the district court correctly determined that a reasonable individual would not feel free to leave. Accordingly, the district court correctly concluded that the Plaintiffs were seized by the Officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\n<em>(b) The Seizure of Plaintiffs Halsell, Johnson, Jones, and Mundy was Reasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">To constitute a Fourth Amendment violation the seizure must also be unreasonable. <em>Brower, </em>489 U.S. at 599, 109 S.Ct. 1378. To determine whether a seizure is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, a court must apply an objective test. This Court looks to \u201cwhether the officers\u2019 actions are \u2018objectively reasonable\u2019 in light of the facts and circumstances confronting them, without regard to their underlying intent or motivation.\u201d <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 397, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989); <em>see also Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 137, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978) (explaining that a court must \u201cmake an objective assessment of an officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances then known to [the officer]\u201d). Further, not only must this Court judge an officer\u2019s actions \u201cfrom the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight,\u201d this Court must also make \u201callowance for the fact that police officers are often forced to make split-second judgments \u2014 in circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396-97, 109 S.Ct. 1865. In determining whether the display of a weapon by an officer was reasonable, a court should look to whether \u201cthe surrounding circumstances give rise to a justifiable fear for personal safety.\u201d <em>United States v. Hardnett, </em>804 F.2d 353, 357 (6th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The district court concluded that the Officers\u2019 conduct did not constitute an unreasonable seizure. The court explained that after looking at the totality of the circumstances, the Officers\u2019 conduct was not unreasonable because \u201cit was reasonable for [the Officers] to believe that they were entering into a dangerous situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>and needed to protect themselves.\u201d <em>Halsell, </em>2005 WL 2850140, at *4, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26067, at *14.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">The Plaintiffs argue that the Officers\u2019 conduct was not reasonable because Kelow\u2019s affidavit states that she tried to tell the Officers that the suspect ran down an alley on the east end of the barbershop, rather than into the barbershop. The Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in not giving full credit to Kelow\u2019s affidavit. The Plaintiffs are correct that in determining whether the Officers\u2019 conduct amounted to a Fourth Amendment violation, the evidence must be construed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs. <em>See, e.g., Bennett v. City of Eastpointe, </em>410 F.3d 810, 823 (6th Cir.2005) (noting that a court must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff to determine whether the plaintiffs demonstrated a Fourth Amendment violation). With regards to the Kelow affidavit, the district court stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">While Plaintiffs would have the Court read the Kelow Affidavit as evidence that Defendants were not informed by citizens in the area that their suspect had run into the barbershop[,] Kelow merely states that she attempted to tell the officers that she saw a man run down the alley.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-7\"><em>Halsell, </em>2005 WL 2850140, at *4, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26067, at *14 n. 6. In analyzing the affidavits submitted by the parties, the Court must take what Kelow said as true. We must accept that she indeed \u201ctried to tell the officers that [she] saw the man run\u201d into the alley and not the barbershop. Contrary to the Plaintiffs\u2019 argument, however, we are not required to completely disregard the affidavits of the police officers in considering whether their conduct was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">Even taking into account Kelow\u2019s testimony in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs, the Officers\u2019 conduct was not unreasonable in light of the circumstances. The Officers were in pursuit of a fleeing suspect who was armed and, in all likelihood, dangerous. The Officers were told by bystanders, other than Kelow, that the suspect ran into the barbershop. It was not unreasonable for the Officers to act on the statements of some bystanders and not others. Alternatively, the Officers could have decided to enter the barbershop first and then investigate the alley. Lastly, the Officers could have seen Ms. Kelow and concluded that her statements were not trustworthy. Whatever their thought process, it was not unreasonable for the Officers to enter the barbershop to look for the fleeing suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Additionally, entering the barbershop with their weapons drawn was not objectively unreasonable. First, the Officers\u2019 conduct was in compliance with Cincinnati Police Department procedure. According to Officer Janke, \u201c[i]t was appropriate for tactical and safety reasons for the [OJfficers to have their firearms in hand, out of their holsters.\u201d Officer Janke also testified that a \u201cmomentary raising of the firearms as the [Officers scanned the immediate area searching for armed subjects would be reasonable.\u201d Second, as the Supreme Court explained in <em>Graham, </em>this Court must examine the Officers\u2019 actions in light of the circumstances, \u201crather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d 490 U.S. at 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865. Although the Officers ultimately found no suspect inside, they acted reasonably when, at the time, they believed that the suspect could be inside. Lastly, the Officers were not required to put their personal safety in harms\u2019 way by entering the barbershop without having their weapons ready. <em>See, e.g., Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 26-27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968) (explaining that police officers are not required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>take unnecessary risks while performing their duties). Momentarily pointing their weapons in the direction of the Plaintiffs, while scanning the interior of the barbershop, was not unreasonable given the possibility that an armed and dangerous suspect was inside. Therefore, the district court correctly concluded that, although the Officers seized the Plaintiffs, there was no constitutional violation because the Officers\u2019 conduct was reasonable in light of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The Officers are therefore entitled to qualified immunity and the district court properly granted summary judgment in their favor. Further, there is no need for this Court to determine whether the alleged violation involved a clearly established constitutional right, because the Officers\u2019 actions did not amount to a constitutional violation. <em>Saucier, </em>533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151 (\u201cIf no constitutional right would have been violated were the allegations established, there is no necessity for further inquiries concerning qualified immunity.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">2. <em>Plaintiff Lewis: Constitutional Violation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\n<em>(a) Plaintiff Lewis was seized by the Officers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The district court also concluded that Plaintiff Lewis was seized when the police officer outside the barbershop pointed a gun at him and asked him to stand with his hands on the car. The court reasoned that despite Lewis\u2019s statement that he told the officers \u201cthat he would not comply, ... a reasonable person in the circumstances would not believe that he was free to ignore the officer\u2019s requests.\u201d <em>Halsell, </em>2005 WL 2850140, at *4, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 26067, at *11-12. The district court\u2019s conclusion is correct. Although the Officers argue that the Plaintiffs were free to leave at any time because their \u201cauthority was directed at the possible presence of a suspect in the shooting\u201d and not at the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs were nevertheless seized once they felt they were not free to leave. Therefore, for the reasons previously discussed, the district court correctly determined that Plaintiff Lewis was seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">\n<em>(b) The Seizure of Plaintiff Lewis was Reasonable</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">The Plaintiffs did not argue in the district court that the seizure of Lewis was unreasonable. The Plaintiffs have the burden of setting forth specific facts indicating that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548. Because the Plaintiffs did not meet their burden, the district court properly granted summary judgment for the Officers on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">For the preceding reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Officers Etter, Zopfi, and Chatman.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
