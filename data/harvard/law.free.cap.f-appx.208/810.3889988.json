The district court sentenced him to a prison term of 92 months, followed by a five-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-22\">On February 2, 2006, Hankerson was arrested for violating the terms of his supervised release, and on February 14, the district court held a final revocation hearing. The court found that he had violated the terms of his release and sentenced him to a prison term of 60 months. He now appeals, contending that the district court abused its discretion in revoking his supervised release because there was not sufficient evidence to support a finding that he had willfully attempted to sell cocaine because: (1) the state dropped the drug charge; (2) he denied selling cocaine, though admitting that he attempted to sell marijuana; and (3) the confidential informant the police had used had a history of crimes of dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-23\">We review a district court\u2019s revocation of supervised release under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>26 F.3d 110, 112 (11th Cir.1994). Under \u00a7 3583(e), the court may \u201crevoke a term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>by statute ... if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of [his] supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3588(e)(3). The preponderance standard \u201cdoes not relieve the sentencing court of the duty of exercising the critical fact-finding function that has always been inherent in the sentencing process ... Preponderance of the evidence is not a high standard of proof. It is not, however, a toothless standard either.\u201d <em>United States v. Askew, </em>193 F.3d 1181, 1183 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in revoking Hankerson\u2019s supervised release because the testimony of the investigating detective was sufficient to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that Hankerson had committed a cocaine trafficking violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Hankerson contends that under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, his sentence was unreasonable \u2014 because the court based it on a Grade A violation, when he only committed a Grade C violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">When imposing a sentence after revocation, the district court must consider the \u00a7 3553 factors including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense; (2) the history and characteristics of the defendant; (3) the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense; and (4) the kinds of sentences and sentencing range established by the Guidelines, and in the case of a violation of supervised release, the applicable Guidelines or policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-9\"><em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). Section 3583(e)(3) prohibits a sentence of more than 5 years in prison, \u201cif the offense that resulted in the term of supervised release is a class A felony.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). As we cannot fault the court\u2019s determination that Hankerson committed a class A felony, and the court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentence the court imposed is due to be, and is,</p>\n<p id=\"b836-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
