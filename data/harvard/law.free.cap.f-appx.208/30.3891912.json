Petitioner challenges primarily the BIA\u2019s determination that he failed to establish derivative citizenship pursuant to former section 321(a) of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a). He also challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and reconsider based on his derivative citizenship claim and a nationality claim. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-22\">As the Respondent notes in its brief, the jurisdictional issue we directed the parties to address has been squarely decided by this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Gittens v. Menifee, </em>428 F.3d 382, 385-86 (2d Cir.2005) (section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. 109-13 (2005) (\u201cthe REAL ID Act\u201d) applies to habeas petitions pending in this Court on the date of the REAL ID Act\u2019s enactment). Accordingly, the petition is considered timely, and we have jurisdiction to review both the October 2003 and December 2003 orders of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-23\">We review the December 2003 order, which denied a motion to reopen and reconsider, for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Petitioner had failed to demonstrate that reopening and reconsideration were warranted. The BIA\u2019s decision on the nationality claim, which was addressed on the merits in the December 2003 order, is owed substantial deference. <em>See Diallo v. INS, </em>232 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>F.3d 279, 285 (2d Cir.2000). The BIA properly rejected that claim, as Petitioner cannot establish nationality by demonstrating permanent allegiance to the United States. <em>See Marquez-Almanzar v. INS, </em>418 F.3d 210, 216-20 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">We review the disposition of the derivative citizenship claim in the October 2003 order with substantial deference accorded to the BIA. <em>See Diallo, </em>232 F.3d at 285. The BIA was correct to deny the citizenship claim. Petitioner spends considerable energy in his <em>pro se </em>filings (and his filings before the BIA) attempting to demonstrate that his father had legal custody over him at the time his father naturalized. However, custody is only relevant when there has been \u201ca legal separation\u201d of the parents. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(3) (2000) (repealed). Here, Petitioner admits that he was born out of wedlock. Accordingly, there was no \u201cformal act which, under the laws of the state or nation having jurisdiction of the marriage, alter[ed] the marital relationship.\u201d <em>Brissett v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 130, 134 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Petitioner cannot qualify for citizenship under the second clause of \u00a7 1432(a)(3) because his mother was naturalized after he reached the age of majority. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432(a)(4) (2000) (repealed); Lang<em>horne v. Ashcroft, </em>377 F.3d 175, 180-81 (2d Cir.2004). Moreover, even if it could be established that his father legitimated him under that clause, he could still not derive citizenship from his father, as there was never a legal marriage or separation between his parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is hereby DENIED. In addition, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
