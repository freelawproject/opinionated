Weisel denying his application for withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) and the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Albert Abdel Salam Abdelmalek Girgis, </em>No. A 96 423 874 (B.I.A. Jan. 25, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 96 423 874 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 2, 2004). We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>Where, as here, the BIA adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision without opinion, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ, <em>see Xu Duan Dong v. Ashcroft, </em>406 F.3d 110, 111 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam), under the substantial evidence standard, <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004). There is substantial evidence to support the IJ\u2019s determination that Girgis is ineligible for withholding of removal under the INA and the CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Girgis first argues that the IJ erred by denying \u201cthe existence of explicit, highly probative record evidence that the Egyptian government punishes proselytizers.\u201d He contends that State Department country reports provide evidence that he would be subjected to persecution for having aided Housni in his conversion from Islam to Coptic Christianity. The report passages that Girgis cites appear to substantiate his claim \u201cthat it is a crime for anyone to assist in the conversion of a Muslim and that those accused of this crime have been harassed, prosecuted, and arrested.\u201d The reports indicate that \u201cthose accused of proselytizing have been harassed by police or arrested on charges of violating Article 98(F) of the Penal Code, which prohibits citizens from ridiculing or insulting heavenly religions or inciting sectarian strife.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The dictionary definition of proselytize\u2014 \u201cto cause to come over or turn from one opinion, belief, creed, or party to another; <em>esp. </em>to convert from one religious faith or sect to another,\u201d XII Oxford English Dictionary 664 (2d ed.1989) \u2014 clearly encompasses Girgis\u2019s alleged role in Housni\u2019s conversion, and thus the State Department\u2019s reports of harassment against those accused of proselytizing might support a finding in Girgis\u2019s favor. To the extent that the IJ determined that they did not provide evidence to support Girgis\u2019s claim of a well-founded fear of future persecution because they did not amount to \u201cevidence to suggest that the police also attack or persecute individuals who assist in the conversion [from Islam to Coptic Christianity],\u201d such a finding appears to be in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">While this error would normally require vacatur and remand, the IJ denied Girgis\u2019s petition on an \u201calternative and sufficient basis,\u201d <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005), to obviate the need for such a disposition. Here, the IJ permissibly denied the existence of an evidentiary nexus between Girgis\u2019s participation in Housni\u2019s conversion and the Egyptian government\u2019s pursuit of him. Contrary to Girgis\u2019s assertion that the IJ ignored pertinent testimony, it is clear from the IJ\u2019s decision that he fully considered both Girgis\u2019s testimony as well as the testimony of Girgis\u2019s mother, neither of whom was able to establish a nexus between Girgis\u2019s religious activity and the police\u2019s periodic efforts to find him. Considering this testimony along with the limited circumstantial evidence of the connection, the IJ permissibly determined that \u201c[t]here is not one scintilla of proof that the police were aware that the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>ever assisted in the conversion of Housni\u201d and thus permissibly denied the \u201cevidentiary link between that conversion and any awareness on the part of the police that the respondent assisted in it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Girgis alleges that the IJ erred in suggesting that the Egyptian government has not attempted to contact Girgis when he stated, \u201cIf, as the record indicates, the police had a file on the respondent and his assistance in his conversion of others, then it is reasonable that they would have made attempts to directly contact him to question him about those efforts.\u201d As the government concedes, this statement is \u201cambiguous.\u201d The IJ\u2019s opinion makes clear, however, that he considered and gave due regard to Girgis\u2019s and his mother\u2019s testimony regarding the repeated police searches of his home. The most logical implication of the IJ\u2019s statement in light of his other comments is that it was implausible that Girgis could remain undisturbed by the police in Egypt after his departure from the monastery if the government\u2019s interest in him, and the likelihood of his future persecution reflected in the State Department reports, were as substantial as Girgis now alleges. Because the IJ\u2019s statement, in context, does not indicate any failure to consider record evidence, or any misreading of that evidence, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Finally, Girgis claims \u2014 without explanation or argument \u2014 that the IJ erred in holding that the absence of past persecution undermined Girgis\u2019s claim of future persecution. The IJ\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he evidence offered by the respondent in terms of his own past undermines any assertion that it is more likely than not that he will be harmed if he returns to Egypt because of his Coptic faith\u201d is unclear at best. However, the paragraphs following this statement make clear that \u201c[t]he evidence offered by the respondent in terms of his own past\u201d consists of Girgis\u2019s and his mother\u2019s testimony regarding his experiences with Egyptian authorities in Egypt, which, as discussed above, the IJ reasonably discounted. Where, as here, a petitioner relies on a set of facts regarding past persecution to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution, the IJ appropriately considers those facts in making his determination as to whether the petitioner is eligible for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Because Girgis provided no evidence of past persecution on the basis of his religious activity, the IJ did not erroneously hold that Girgis\u2019s claim of future persecution was undermined by a lack of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. The pending motion for a stay of removal is therefore DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b108-5\">. This Court has repeatedly noted that persecution does not encompass \"mere harassment,\u201d <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. U.S. I.N.S., </em>359 F.3d 121, 128 (2d Cir.2004), but we have also recognized \"that the difference between harassment and persecution is necessarily one of degree that must be decided on a case-by-case basis.\u201d <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006). We have also indicated that even \"a 'minor beating\u2019 or, for that matter, any physical degradation designed to cause pain, humiliation, or other suffering, may rise to the level of persecution if it occurred in the context of an arrest or detention on the basis of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Beskovic v. Gonzales, </em>467 F.3d 223, 226 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Tian-Yong Chen, </em>359 F.3d at 128). We express no opinion as to whether the harassment Girgis alleges to have experienced, or the harassment or arrests the State Department reports indicate he might experience, rise to the level of persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
