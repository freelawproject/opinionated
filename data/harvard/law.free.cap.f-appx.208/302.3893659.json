Burns, </em>433 F.3d 442, 450-51 (5th Cir.2005), which held that an otherwise valid appeal waiver is not rendered invalid, or inapplicable to an appeal seeking to raise an error pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), merely because the waiver was made before <em>Booker. </em>Jennings also raises arguments that are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Austin, </em>432 F.3d 598, 599-600 (5th Cir.2005), which held that the application of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial opinion to a sentencing hearing where the underlying offense was committed <em>pre-Booker </em>does not violate constitutional due process or ex post facto requirements. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
