Arroyo contends that his role as a mere crew member was minor compared to that of the major transporters and owners of the drugs. He asserts that he was simply a \u201cmule\u201d who was limited to transporting the drugs, and had no decision-making power or input regarding the planning, supplying, or destination of the drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">We review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determination of a defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir. 1999) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">A defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal\u201d is entitled to a two-level reduction for his minor role. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), comment n. 5. The defendant bears the burden of proving a minor role in the offense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">To evaluate whether a defendant\u2019s role was minor, a court must engage in a two-step analysis. First, the court must measure \u201cdefendant\u2019s role in the relevant conduct for which [he] has been held accountable at sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. Where the relevant conduct is the same as a defendant\u2019s actual conduct, the defendant cannot establish that he is \u201centitled to a minor role adjustment simply by pointing to some broader criminal scheme in which [he] was a minor participant but for which [he] was not held accountable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 941. In a drug courier-context, \u201cthe amount of drugs imported is a material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. The quality of drugs in the courier's possession may be a good indication of the defendant\u2019s role in the offense. <em>Id. </em>Second, the court should consider the defendant\u2019s \u201crole as compared to that of other participants in [his] relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">In denying Arroyo a minor-role reduction, the district court found that Arroyo\u2019s role was comparable to that of the others named in the conspiracy. Arroyo was one of four crew members of a go-fast boat that was stopped outside of the territorial waters of Colombia and was found carrying approximately 4650 pounds of cocaine. Although the district court did not hold Arroyo accountable for the larger conspiracy, Arroyo provided no evidence that distinguished his culpability from that of his fellow crew members.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-14\">Upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, and thorough review of the record, we cannot find that the district court\u2019s determinations were clearly erroneous. The record supports the district court\u2019s findings that the conduct attributed to Arroyo was identical to his actual conduct and that he was not substantially less culpable than the other crew members on the go-fast boat. Arroyo was held accountable for the quantity of cocaine found on his boat. Furthermore, the amount of drugs involved in this case indicates that Arroyo\u2019s role as a crew member was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>minor. The district court did not clearly err in denying Arroyo a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
