Brinson was convicted of conspiracy to distribute in excess of five kilograms of powder cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(b)(1)(A), being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h), pursuant to guilty pleas, on July 19, 2004. Brinson was sentenced on November 17, 2005, to a term of imprisonment of one hundred thirty-one months as to Counts One and Twenty and a term of imprisonment of one hundred twenty months as to Count Five; these terms of imprisonment were imposed to run concurrently. For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Brinson was charged in Counts One through Six, Eight, Ten, Twelve, Fourteen, Sixteen, Eighteen, and Twenty of a multicount, multi-defendant Indictment returned by a grand jury in the Eastern District of Tennessee on March 16, 2004. (J.A. 55-69) On April 8, 2004, the government filed an Information regarding enhanced penalties in which Brinson was advised that he was subjected to an enhanced statutory penalty due to a prior felony drug conviction. (J.A. 147) He was convicted on Counts One, Five, and Twenty of the Indictment, by guilty pleas, on July 19, 2004. As a part of the plea agreement, Brinson entered into a stipulation of facts which served as the factual basis for his guilty pleas and agreed to cooperate with the government in order to secure a motion for a downward departure below the statutory mandatory minimum. (J.A. 96-99)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">On October 8, 2004, Brinson filed a set of objections to the presentence report in which he objected to a two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm and to the multiple-count grouping rule used to establish a total offense level. (J.A. 173) Brinson did not assert actual or factual innocence. Brinson\u2019s restricted guideline range for imprisonment was calculated as two hundred forty \u2014 two hundred sixty-two months. Sentencing was initially scheduled for November 9, 2004, continued six times, and ultimately set for November 17, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">On November 9, 2005, the government filed a sealed motion for downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e). (J.A. 176) The government recommended that the district court depart below the statutory minimum mandatory term of imprisonment of two hundred forty months to a term of imprisonment of one hundred forty-four months. (J.A. 182) On November 17, 2005, Brinson filed a motion for discovery pursuant to pursuant to Rule 16(a)(1)(E)\u00ae and (ii) and Rule 32(i)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (J.A. 100) Specifically, Brinson requested that the government be ordered to produce the presentence investigation reports for each of Brinson\u2019s co-conspirators, the sealed motion for departure/variance filed by the government as to each defendant whose case the government considered in making its sentencing recommendation for Brinson, and any written policies of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office used in the determination of sentencing recommendations based upon a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance. (J.A. 100) The district court denied Brinson\u2019s motion for discovery and proceeded with Brinson\u2019s sentencing as scheduled. Brinson was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one hundred thirty-one months as to Counts One and Twenty and a term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>imprisonment of one hundred twenty months as to Count Five, all such terms to be served concurrently. (J.A. 72)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Brinson filed a motion for extension of time to file a notice of appeal on November 29, 2005, which was granted on December 8, 2005. He timely filed a Notice of Appeal to this Court on December 30, 2005. (J.A. 78)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">This Court reviews a district court\u2019s order in response to a discovery motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Kincaide, </em>145 F.3d 771, 780 (6th Cir.1998). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs when the district court \u2018relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, ... improperly applies the law, ... or ... employs an erroneous legal standard.\u2019 \u201d <em>Apanovitch v. Houk, </em>466 F.3d 460, 476 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Earner v. Pilkington N. Am., Inc., </em>399 F.3d 745, 748 (6th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Brinson sought discovery from the United States pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 16(a)(l)(E)(i). That rule provides that the government \u201cmust permit the defendant to inspect and to copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places\u201d in the government\u2019s possession that are \u201cmaterial to preparing the defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Brinson, however, was not seeking to prepare a defense. He was not, in other words, attempting to demonstrate that the \u201cprosecutor had no valid case.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004) (defining \u201cdefense\u201d). By pleading guilty, he not only admitted that the prosecutor had a valid case but that he was guilty of the crime charged. And the co-conspirator information was listed in the prosecution\u2019s motion for downward departure to show the value of Brinson\u2019s assistance, not to prove some fact against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">This reading is supported by other instances where the rules use the term \u201cdefense.\u201d Rules 12.1 through 12.3, for example, establish procedures federal courts are to follow when certain defenses are alleged. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.1 (alibi defense); Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.2 (insanity defense); Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.3 (public-authority defense). Each of these defenses goes to show that the accused either did not commit or should not be held culpable for the crime charged. Brinson\u2019s situation is quite different; the government\u2019s downward departure motion, rather than accusing him of anything, recommended that he receive a Kghter-than-normal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">The purposes served by Rule 16 also support our interpretation of the rule. According to the advisory committee, \u201cbroad discovery contributes to the fair and efficient administration of criminal justice by providing the defendant with enough information to make an informed decision as to plea; by minimizing the undesirable effect of surprise at the trial; and by otherwise contributing to an accurate determination of the issue of guilt or innocence.\u201d This focus on accurately determining guilt or innocence demonstrates that the rule was not meant to extend to issues not impacting the defendant\u2019s culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The Supreme Court has interpreted this rule in a similar manner. In <em>United States v. Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. 456,116 S.Ct. 1480, 134 L.Ed.2d 687 (1996), the Court concluded that \u201c\u2018defense\u2019 means the defendant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s case in chief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 462, 116 S.Ct. 1480. Rule 16(a)(1)(c), the predecessor rule to Rule 16(a)(l)(E)(i), thus did not apply to discovery related to the defendant\u2019s selective prosecution claim. The provision, the Supreme Court reasoned, extends only to \u201cshield\u201d claims that \u201crefute the Government\u2019s arguments that the defendant committed the crime charged.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>While <em>Armstrong </em>arose in the context of a selective prosecution claim, we see no reason not to extend its reasoning to Brinson\u2019s claim. Beyond the obvious fact that Brinson has admitted committing the crime charged, the theory of his discovery request is similar to that denied in <em>Armstrong. </em>The best Brinson could hope for were his discovery request granted is evidence that the government\u2019s downward departure recommendation was inconsistent with the departure recommended for his co-conspirators \u2014 that the government in other words exercised its discretion to recommend a downward departure inconsistently. Armstrong similarly sought to prove that the government improperly exercised its discretion by deciding who to prosecute based on race. The Court not only held that Rule 16 did not apply to his request, but also held that a defendant alleging selective prosecution must make a \u201ccredible showing of different treatment of similarly situated persons\u201d before obtaining discovery related to the claim. <em>Armstrong, </em>517 U.S. at 469,116 S.Ct. 1480; <em>see also Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 186, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (requiring a heightened showing to obtain discovery on a claim that the government improperly exercised its discretion by failing to file a downward departure motion). Because Brinson requests far-ranging information implicating prosecutorial discretion, we similarly hold that Rule 16(a)(1)(E)\u00ae does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">In addition to Rule 16(a)(1)(E)\u00ae, Brinson cited Rule 32(i)(l)(B) to support his discovery request. That rule requires \u201cthe court\u201d to \u201cgive to the defendant ... a written summary of ... any information excluded from the presentence report ... on which the court will rely in sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, Brinson claims that pursuant to this rule the district court is required to provide him with the presentence reports of co-defendants sentenced in this case. Brinson\u2019s motion, however, was addressed to \u201cthe Government,\u201d not the court, and he did not redirect his motion toward the court at any time during the sentencing hearing. Thus, his request is reviewed for plain error, a standard he cannot meet.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
