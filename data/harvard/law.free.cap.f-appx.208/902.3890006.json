Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>No. AT-0353-06-0028-1-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov.28, 2005) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). </em>The Initial Decision became final when the Board declined to review it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><em>Miller v. Dep\u2019t of Agric., </em>No. AT-0353-06-0028-I-1, 101 M.S.P.R. 200 (M.S.P.B. Feb.24, 2006) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>We have considered Ms. Miller\u2019s claims and find them without merit. We therefore <em>affirm </em>the dismissal by the Board for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The petitioner, Donna Miller, was given a career-conditional appointment with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (\u201cAgency\u201d) as an office automation clerk. The appointment was subject to completion of a one year probationary period. Before the completion of the one year probationary period, the Agency decided to terminate Ms. Miller\u2019s appointment. The termination was based on Ms. Miller\u2019s absences from work and failure to accept her supervisor\u2019s directives.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Ms. Miller originally appealed the Agency decision to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). Ms. Miller alleged the Agency violated her human rights, improperly retaliated against her, and violated public policy. The EEOC decision was unfavorable and Ms. Miller appealed to the Board alleging several errors by the EEOC. She argued that the EEOC misinterpreted the Rehabilitation Act, misapplied Tennessee statutes concerning communication with state officials, and failed to take account of witness testimony. The administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) at the Board treated the filing as a challenge to the Agency\u2019s failure to select and/or reinstate her. The ALJ issued an acknowledgment order advising Ms. Miller that the Board lacked jurisdiction over a non-selection and that the Board also lacked jurisdiction over a denial of reinstatement absent a non-frivolous claim. The acknowledgement order further advised Ms. Miller to demonstrate that her petition was within the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. Ms. Miller failed to respond to the acknowledgment order. The ALJ then dismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Ms. Miller was terminated during her probationary period with the Agency. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 2. After the Board denied Ms. Miller\u2019s petition for review, she appealed to this court. <em>Final Order </em>at 2. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Whether the Board has jurisdiction to hear a claim is a question of law that this court reviews <em>de novo. Vesser v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>29 F.3d 600, 602 (Fed. Cir.1994). The petitioner must prove jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Garcia v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>437 F.3d 1322, 1338 (Fed.Cir.2006) (en banc). We have stated that: \u201cThe jurisdiction of the Board is limited to those matters specifically delineated by Congress or granted to it by way of regulatory authority exercised by the OPM.\u201d <em>Saunders v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>757 F.2d 1288, 1290 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">On appeal to this court, Ms. Miller contends the Board failed to properly apply the Rehabilitation Act, failed to consider her retaliation claim, did not apply Tennessee statutes correctly, and did not acknowledge witness testimony. None of these allegations establish jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">The Board has jurisdiction of only those actions made appealable by statute or regulation. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7512, 7513, 7701(a) (2006). Removal or termination of employment \u201cis an appealable action where the individual qualifies as an \u2018employee\u2019 at the time of her removal by the agency.\u201d <em>McCormick v. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, </em>307 F.3d 1339, 1341 (Fed.Cir.2002). The term \u201cemployee\u201d is defined by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>(1) \u201cemployee\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-5\">(A) an individual in the competitive service\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">(i) who is <em>not serving a probationary or trial period </em>under an initial appointment; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-7\">(\u00dc) who has <em>completed 1 year of current continuous service </em>under other than a temporary appointment limited to 1 year or less;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7511(a) (emphasis added). Ms. Miller\u2019s career-conditional appointment was subject to completion of a one year probationary period. She did not complete the one year probationary period. Therefore, she does not qualify as an \u201cemployee\u201d and is excluded from the statutory appeals process under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7511-14. <em>Stokes v. Fed. Aviation Admin., </em>761 F.2d 682, 684 (Fed.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">We have stated, however, that under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b), the Board will \u201cconsider appeals from agency actions adverse to probationary employees when those employees allege that those actions were the result of partisan political or marital status discrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 684-85. Since Ms. Miller has not alleged that the Agency\u2019s action was based on either partisan political or marital status reasons, the Board properly dismissed her case for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">Additionally, Ms. Miller\u2019s retaliation and Rehabilitation Act claims do not confer Board jurisdiction absent an allegation of marital status or partisan political discrimination. <em>See, e.g., Cruz v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>934 F.2d 1240, 1244 (Fed.Cir. 1991) (en banc) (holding discrimination allegations do not confer Board jurisdiction absent an action that is otherwise appeal-able to the Board); <em>Lizewski v. Dep\u2019t of the Army, </em>15 M.S.P.R. 417, 419 (1983) (holding the Board lacked jurisdiction to decide whether probationer\u2019s termination constituted physical handicap discrimination because there was no alleged marital status or partisan political discrimination). Also, Ms. Miller has not pointed to any statute or regulation that establishes Board jurisdiction to decide claims based on Tennessee state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">Finally, the Board must provide notice to the appellant of her burden to demonstrate jurisdiction. <em>Burgess v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>758 F.2d 641, 643-44 (Fed.Cir. 1985). The Board has held that failure to inform an appellant of her jurisdictional burden is \u201cmagnified\u201d if she is <em>pro se. Yost v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Sew., </em>85 M.S.P.R. 273, 277 (2000). Thus, to fulfill the notice requirement, a <em>pro se </em>probationary employee must be notified that 1) she must make a non-frivolous allegation of partisan political or martial status discrimination, and that 2) she has the burden of providing factual evidence to support her entitlement to a hearing. <em>See Burgess, </em>758 F.2d at 643-44 (holding that appellant must be notified of what is required to establish an appealable jurisdictional issue and that appellant must produce factual evidence to support her entitlement to a hearing); <em>Johns v. Dep\u2019t of Veteran\u2019s Affairs, </em>83 M.S.P.R. 345, 348-49 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">In this case, the Agency\u2019s motion to dismiss and attached removal notice gave sufficient notice to Ms. Miller of the first requirement \u2014 that she must allege partisan political or martial status discrimination. <em>See Johns, </em>83 M.S.P.R. at 348 (\u201cAn AJ\u2019s failure to properly inform an appellant of the Board\u2019s jurisdictional requirements may not be prejudicial where the appellant is put on notice by the Agency\u2019s motion to dismiss of what he has to allege to establish jurisdiction.\u201d). The motion to dismiss, however, failed to give notice of the second requirement \u2014 her burden to come forward with evidence. This failure was harmless because Ms. Miller could not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>have made a claim that invoked the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. As discussed above, Ms. Miller did not present a claim that invokes the Board jurisdiction. Moreover, there is no basis in the record that Ms. Miller could establish a partisan political or martial status discrimination claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the Board properly dismissed Ms. Miller\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. We affirm the judgment of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
