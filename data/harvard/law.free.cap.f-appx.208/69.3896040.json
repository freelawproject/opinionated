April 20, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">Where, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">In certain circumstances, it may be error for the agency to base an adverse credibility finding on omissions from an applicant\u2019s written asylum application. \u201c[A]sylum applicants are not required to list every incident of persecution on their 1-589 statements.\u201d <em>Pavlova v. INS, </em>441 F.3d 82, 90 (2d Cir.2006). In evaluating whether such an omission is sufficiently substantial to support an adverse credibility finding, the Court takes \u201cnote of the fact that the circumstances surrounding the application process do not often lend themselves to a perfectly complete and comprehensive recitation of an applicant\u2019s claim to asylum or withholding, and that holding applicants to such a standard is not only unrealistic but also unfair.\u201d <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">The agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so. <em>See, e.g., Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). The agency also need not \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each and every one of [an applicant\u2019s] purported explanations for testimonial inconsistencies or evidentiary gaps.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 159 n. 13 (2d Cir.2006). However, it must take into account significant factual assertions that the applicant offers, and its failure to provide a reasoned evaluation of an applicant\u2019s explanations for discrepancies may therefore require remand in certain circumstances. <em>See Latifi v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d </em>103, 105 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Department of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 403 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Here, the IJ found that Chen\u2019s testimony regarding his marriage, including the particulars of his \u201ctraditional ceremony,\u201d and a June 1999 visit from family planning officials were not included in his written application. Chen testified that he did not list his marriage in his application because his previous lawyer did not ask him that particular question. Chen was also questioned regarding why he failed to mention a June 1999 visit from family planning officials when he had mentioned a visit from the officials in September 1999. Chen again testified that the reason he did not list that visit was, again, because his attorney did not ask him that particular question.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">The IJ determined that Chen\u2019s explanations, particularly regarding his failure to mention the June 1999 visit in his application, were inadequate. The IJ reasoned that, if Chen thought the September 1999 visit was a significant event to include in his application, he would likewise mention the June 1999 visit, especially since the June 1999 visit was the first visit and warning he received from the family planning officials. The IJ\u2019s conclusion is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Next, with respect to Chen\u2019s failure to mention his marriage in his application, the IJ stated that he was unconvinced of the existence of the marriage itself. In addition to the fact that Chen did not think it a significant factor when discussing Qingyan\u2019s pregnancy with his attorney, the IJ pointed out that Chen continually referred to Qingyan as his girlfriend during the hearing. The IJ also found relevant the fact that Chen did not know the names of Qingyan\u2019s parents, instead testifying that he calls them mother and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Lastly, the IJ found particularly troubling the fact that Chen recanted his original claim \u2014 that his girlfriend became pregnant and was forced to have an abortion \u2014 asserting that his statements were \u201cnot correct.\u201d The IJ observed that Chen\u2019s explanation for his recantation and later withdrawal of the recantation \u2014 that he had falsely changed his story after talking to some \u201cpeople on the street\u201d \u2014 demonstrated that Chen was willing to take any position he believed would succeed regardless of the truth.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">Because the IJ provided Chen with an opportunity to explain his omissions, the IJ reasonably determined that it was unlikely that Chen would have simply faded to include such information in his application given the importance of each event to his asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The IJ next determined that there were numerous internal inconsistencies within Chen\u2019s testimony. Not only did Chen testify inconsistently regarding the events that surrounded his girlfriend\u2019s alleged pregnancy, ie., when she became pregnant, when he found out, and when her due-date was, he also provided inconsistent testimony concerning the events surrounding the persecution itself \u2014 visits from the family planning officials. The IJ concluded that contradictions concerning these matters related to the heart of Chen\u2019s claim for asylum and thus undermined his credibility. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09; <em>Latifi, </em>430 F.3d at 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The IJ\u2019s reliance on various inconsistencies, omissions, and discrepancies in Chen\u2019s testimony and documentary evidence was appropriate, and his adverse credibility determination is thus substantially supported by the record as a whole. Because these inconsistencies are so intricately tied to Chen\u2019s asylum claim, and the IJ\u2019s ruling is supported by substantial evidence. Because the only evidence of a threat to Chen\u2019s life or freedom depended upon the petitioner\u2019s credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Wu Biao Chen v. INS, </em>344 F.3d 272, 275 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Chen failed to raise any arguments regarding the denial of his CAT claim in his brief to this Court. Accordingly, these claims should be deemed waived. <em>See Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2) and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
