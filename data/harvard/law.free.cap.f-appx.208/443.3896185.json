(\u201cOXY\u201d), the successor-in-interest to Cities Service Company (\u201cCities\u201d), and Borden, Inc. (\u201cBorden\u201d) over the interpretation of a contract under which Borden acquired an ink manufacturing business from Cities. The dispute hinges on the interpretation of an assumption of obligations provision in the 1974 Agreement for Purchase and Sale (\u201cAPA\u201d) executed by the parties. The sole issue before this court is whether the trial court erred in determining that defendant Borden is not hable to indemnify OXY for costs incurred by OXY in a federally-mandated cleanup of the Skinner Landfill in West Chester, Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">OXY is a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Texas. Borden is a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business in Ohio. Cities, OXY\u2019s predecessor-in-interest, operated an ink manufacturing facility in Woodlawn, Ohio (\u201cthe Levey Division\u201d), and prior to January 31, 1974, the Levey Division disposed of waste containing hazardous substances at the Skinner Landfill in West Chester, Ohio. At no time did either Cities or OXY ever own or operate the Skinner Landfill. Borden never disposed of any waste from the Woodlawn facility at the Skinner Landfill.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">After considerable negotiations and drafts, Cities and Borden entered into the final APA on January 31, 1974, and the transaction closed the same day. Both before and after the closing, three surface impoundments were located on the Levey facility property, and Borden operated these impoundments after the closing. The negotiations for the sale of the facility took place from November 1973 through late January 1974. The parties\u2019 negotiations resulted in various draft sale contracts, which ultimately evolved into the final APA.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">Cities and Borden entered into the final draft of the APA on January 31, 1974. Two provisions of the APA are of particular importance to this case, Section 7 (\u201cTransfer of Assets\u201d) and Section 11 (\u201cthe Assumption\u201d). Section 7, in relevant part, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-13\">(a) <em>General Transfer: </em>On the Closing Date, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, Cities will sell, convey, assign, transfer and deliver to Borden, all the assets and properties of every kind, character and description, whether tangible or intangible, and whether real or personal, wherever located, of the Levey Division (except cash, accounts receivable, claims against third parties and insurance claims, and inventories of finished products, lithographic plates and lithographic chemicals, in existence and owned by Cities on the Closing Date, Letters Patent licensed under Paragraph 4(d) hereof, contracts not acceptable to Borden as identified in Exhibit 11, and except as otherwise specifically stated herein), free and clear of all liabilities and obligations, except only those liabilities and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>obligations which are to be assumed by Borden as provided herein----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">The final version of Section 11, the central provision of this dispute, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">11. <em>Assumption: </em>Except if and as otherwise provided in this Agreement, subject to and as of the consummation of the Closing, Borden hereby assumes all the obligations of Cities, arising out of events occurring after the Closing Date relating to the business or assets of the Levey Division transferred hereunder, except to the extent that any such obligation arises from a breach by Cities of a warranty or covenant. Cities will continue to be responsible for all obligations arising out of events occurring prior to and on the Closing Date relating to the business or assets of the Levey Division. Cities makes no representations as to the condition of the assets transferred being in compliance with any federal, state, or local laws provided, however, that Cities represents and warrants that Cities has received no notice of any violation or claim of violation of any such law and the management of Cities including the Levey Division management has no actual knowledge thereof. Cities shall have no obligations or liabilities arising out of failure of such assets to have been in compliance prior to the Closing, with any federal, state or local law except to the extent that any such obligation arises from a breach by Cities of the foregoing warranty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u201cEvent\u201d as used in Section 11 is not defined in the APA. No provision of the APA directly addresses whether Borden would assume the environmental obligations related to the Levey Division assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\u201cCERCLA\u201d) was enacted in 1980. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601-75. In 1983, pursuant to CERCLA, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) added the Skinner Landfill to the National Priorities List after it identified releases, actual and threatened, of hazardous substances from the Landfill. <em>See </em>48 Fed.Reg. 40658 (Sept. 8, 1983). It is undisputed that all costs related to the Skinner Landfill cleanup relate to incidents that transpired prior to CERCLA\u2019s enactment and before Cities (as OXY\u2019s predecessor-in-interest) conveyed the Woodlawn facility to Borden.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-12\">On March 28, 1997, Dow asserted a claim against OXY and more than 80 other parties seeking recovery of response costs under section 107 of CERCLA. Dow based its claims against OXY on allegations that, prior to the 1974 closing, the Levey facility arranged for the disposal of waste containing hazardous substances at the Skinner Landfill and OXY was therefore obligated under CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607(a), to share in the cost of clean-up at the Skinner Landfill. Amost all of the CERCLA claims were resolved through a consent decree entered into with the United States on April 3, 2001, pursuant to which OXY and others agreed to pay certain past and future costs at the site. <em>See United States v. Elsa Skinner-Morgan, </em>Civ. Action No. C-1-00-424.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-13\">On January 5, 2001, OXY and Borden filed a Joint Motion for a Case Management Order to permit OXY to file a cross-claim against Borden seeking damages OXY had incurred to date and any future damages OXY might incur related to the Skinner Landfill. The United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio granted the motion and on June 20, 2001, OXY filed a cross-claim against Borden citing the Levey CERCLA obligation. OXY sought damages incurred in cleaning the Skinner Landfill and in reimbursing the EPA and other Potential Responsible Parties (\u201cPRPs\u201d) for costs incurred at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Landfill. On May 3, 2002, Borden moved for summary judgment on OXY\u2019s cross-claim, and the district court subsequently denied the motion. In denying the motion, the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\">The Court finds as a matter of law that the contractual language is ambiguous concerning whether Borden assumed liability for costs incurred in connection with the Skinner Landfill cleanup for materials deposited there prior to the Closing Date. Both parties have posited plausible and varying interpretations of the Agreement, and they have cited several cases in support of their respective interpretations. It is not apparent from the face of the contract, however, which of the reasonable interpretations the parties intended when the Agreement was drafted. Nor do the cited cases resolve the ambiguity since those cases do not establish what these parties intended when they drafted the particular Agreement at issue here. Thus, it is necessary to look beyond the four corners of the written Agreement to ascertain the parties\u2019 intention as to the assumption of liability for the cleanup costs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">The case then proceeded to a nonjury trial. On December 29, 2005, the district court issued its opinion and found in favor of Borden on all claims. The district court concluded that OXY \u201cfailed to sustain its burden of demonstrating that the APA in question manifests a \u2018clear and unmistakable intent\u2019 to require Borden to assume liability for the environmental hazard at Skinner Landfill.\u201d The district court went on to state that \u201cthe most reasonable interpretation\u201d of the APA language, in light of all the evidence at trial, was that the parties contemplated that the closing date of the contract would serve as the \u201cdemarcation line\u201d for determining future liability \u201cwith Cities to retain responsibility for all liabilities arising from activity that took place on or before the transfer date, and Borden assuming responsibility for all liabilities arising from activity occurring thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The district court\u2019s construction of the contract is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review by this court. <em>Campbell v. Potash Corp., </em>238 F.3d 792, 797 (6th Cir. 2001). The existence of ambiguity in a contract is also a <em>de novo </em>question for this court. <em>Meridian Leasing, Inc. v. Associated Aviation Underwriters, Inc., </em>409 F.3d 342, 346 (6th Cir.2005). The district court\u2019s resolution of any ambiguity based on extrinsic evidence may be overturned only if clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a), findings of fact by the district court should not be reversed unless clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, \u201cthe reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, N. C, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (quoting <em>United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948)); <em>accord Gross v. Comm\u2019r, </em>272 F.3d 333, 343 (6th Cir.2001). When the findings rest on credibility determinations, Rule 52 demands even greater deference. <em>Anderson, </em>470 U.S. at 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504; <em>Hamilton v. Carell, </em>243 F.3d 992, 997-98 (6th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The parties agree that the APA provides that their rights and obligations thereunder are to be construed under New York law. New York law provides that it is the court\u2019s function to \u201cdiscern the intent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>the parties to the extent their intent is evidenced by their -written agreement.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Klafter Co. v. Cont\u2019l Cas. Co., </em>869 F.2d 96, 99 (2d Cir.1989) (citation omitted). If the parties\u2019 intent is unclear from the writing, however, the court may consider extrinsic evidence of intent. <em>Slatt v. Slatt, </em>64 N.Y.2d 966, 967, 488 N.Y.S.2d 645, 477 N.E.2d 1099 (1985). A court cannot find a duty to indemnify \u201cabsent manifestation of a \u2018clear and unmistakable intent\u2019 to indemnify.\u201d <em>Commander Oil Corp. v. Advance Food Sew. Equip., </em>991 F.2d 49, 51 (2d Cir.1993) (internal citation omitted). Moreover, as noted by the district court, courts applying New York law abide by the \u201cwidely accepted principle\u201d that \u201cindemnity agreements which purport to indemnify the indemnitee for its own fault are to be strictly construed.\u201d (JA at 104.); <em>see Olin Corp. v. Yeargin, Inc., </em>146 F.3d 398, 407-08 (6th Cir.1998) (citing <em>Purolator Prods. Corp. v. Allied-Signal, Inc., </em>772 F.Supp. 124, 131 (W.D.N.Y.1991)). A pre-CERCLA indemnity agreement inherently cannot expressly waive (or cover) CERCLA liability that did not exist at its drafting, but under New York law sufficiently broad contractual language can transfer unknown future CERCLA obligations. <em>Olin Corp. v. Consol. Aluminum Corp., 5 </em>F.3d 10, 15-16 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Section 11 of the APA states in clear language that \u201cBorden hereby assumes all of the obligations of Cities, arising out of events occurring after the Closing Date relating to the business or assets of the Levey Division transferred hereunder,\u201d while \u201cCities <em>will continue to be responsible </em>for all obligations <em>arising out of events occurring prior to and on the Closing Date </em>relating to the business or assets of the Levey Division.\u201d OXY\u2019s obligation under CERCLA to share in the cleanup of the Skinner Landfill directly arose from a pre-closing event: Cities\u2019 disposal of waste at the landfill. As such, OXY must retain liability under the plain language of the contract. An alternative reading of the APA requires a strained effort to arrive at an outcome not apparent from the face of the contract. <em>See W.W.W. Assocs., Inc. v. Giancontieri, </em>77 N.Y.2d 157, 163, 565 N.Y.S.2d 440, 566 N.E.2d 639 (1990) (\u201cBy ignoring the plain language of the contract, plaintiff effectively rewrites the bargain that was struck. An analysis that begins with consideration of extrinsic evidence of what the parties meant, instead of looking first to what they said and reaching extrinsic evidence only when required to do so because of some identified ambiguity, unnecessarily denigrates the contract and unsettles the law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">OXY\u2019s reliance on <em>Purolator, </em>772 F.Supp. at 131, is misplaced. Rather than bolstering OXY\u2019s case, <em>Purolator </em>highlights the distinction between the contract at issue in this case and the one at issue in <em>Purolator. Purolator </em>concerned only the breadth of the contract, i.e., whether the pre-CERCLA contract was sufficiently broad to cover CERCLA liability. <em>Id. </em>at 130-31 (finding that a \u201csettlement agreement which shows that the parties intended to resolve all their disputes involving any type of claim includes CERCLA liability, even if the agreement is framed in general terms and does not specifically refer to CERCLA or to environmental liability\u201d). The <em>Purolator </em>court concluded that contract language stating that one party \u201cassumes and agrees to satisfy all liabilities and obligations\u201d of the other party was sufficiently broad to encompass CERCLA liability. <em>Id. </em>at 131-32. Unlike the contract in this case, however, there was no temporal distinction in the <em>Purolator </em>contract: the contract said nothing of one party retaining liability arising out of events prior to the closing. Here the parties\u2019 use of the closing date as a \u201cdemarcation line\u201d to assign liability distinguishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the APA from the contract at issue in <em>Purolator.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">OXY also argues that \u201c[t]he disposal of waste in the ordinary course of business by the Woodlawn plant was not an \u2018event\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of the APA, and therefore did not trigger any legal obligation. OXY emphasizes the usage of \u201cevent\u201d from the 1989 edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>and its definition including the \u201cconsequence of anything\u201d and a \u201cnoteworthy happening or occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> OXY then splices the definition in order to arrive at its conclusion that \u201can event is: \u2018the consequence of anything,\u2019 the \u2018outcome of an action as finally determined,\u2019 that in which an action \u2018terminates\u2019 or a \u2018noteworthy happening.\u2019 \u201d (Final Br. of Appellant at 30 (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>498 (5th ed.1989)).) OXY goes on to note that \u201c[a]t least one New York court has embraced a similar definition of \u201cevent,\u201d and then cites a New York case from 1851. <em>See Fitch v. Bates, </em>11 Barb. 471, 473 (N.Y.1851). OXY then concludes that, in line with these definitions, the \u201cdisposal of waste by the Woodlawn plant, an action which was of no consequence, was clearly not an \u2018event\u2019 under the plain meaning of the word.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Cities\u2019 disposal of waste, however, does fit within the plain meaning of \u201cevent.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The 1968 edition of <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>the most recent edition at the time the APA was drafted but not cited by either party, defines \u201cevent\u201d as \u201c[t]he consequence of anything, the issue, the conclusion, end\u201d and \u201c[ajnything that happens or comes to pass as distinguished from a thing that exists.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>654 (4th ed.1968). The disposal of hazardous waste fits within this broad definition. Similarly, the current edition of <em>Webster\u2019s </em>dictionary at the time of the contract drafting (also not cited by either party) defined \u201cevent\u201d as \u201csomething that happens: occurrence.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>788 (3d ed.1967). Again, large-scale disposal of hazardous waste fits comfortably within this definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">OXY also contends that the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u201cevent\u201d contradicts the meaning the parties attached to \u201cevent\u201d in a separate provision of the APA. This argument is misleading. The APA provision cited by OXY, Section 2(n), is titled \u201cAbsence of Adverse Events\u201d and is a guarantee that nothing negative has happened to the property in the period between the drafting date and the closing. The illustrations of \u201cevents\u201d provided in this section, including \u201cfire, accident, or other casualty ... or any act of Good [sic] or the public enemy,\u201d apply only to <em>adverse </em>events as defined, not \u201cevents\u201d without this modifier. The same provision goes on to discuss \u201cgeneral economic events\u201d and \u201cevents which affect industry in general,\u201d but these other usages of \u201cevent\u201d are not addressed (or acknowledged) by OXY. Only a neutral usage or definition of \u201cevent,\u201d not a contextual usage like that found in Section 2(n), would be useful in determining the parties\u2019 intent with regard to the usage of \u201cevent\u201d in Section 11 of the APA. As such, any reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>anee on the meaning of \u201cevent\u201d as used in Section 2(n) is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">OXY asserts that \u201cthe district court erroneously equated the term \u2018event\u2019 with \u2018activity\u2019 in concluding that pre-Closing disposal of waste was an \u2018event.\u2019\u201d OXY raises this argument based on the district court\u2019s holding that \u201cthe parties contemplated that the Closing Date would serve as the demarcation line for determining future liability, with Cities to retain responsibility for all liabilities arising from <em>activity </em>that took place on or before the transfer date, and Borden assuming responsibility for all liabilities arising from <em>activity </em>occurring thereafter.\u201d (JA at 105 (emphasis added).) This statement does not, however, necessarily imply that the district court \u201cused \u2018event\u2019 and \u2018activity\u2019 interchangeably,\u201d as OXY alleges. Instead, this wording merely reflects the district court\u2019s conclusion as to the meaning of the provision and the court\u2019s finding that OXY remains liable for pre-closing dumping; the district court need not quote the language of the contract in every passage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">There is ample evidence in the record to support the district court\u2019s conclusion that OXY retained liability. Several Borden employees, including its then-vice president Jon Casey and in-house counsel Paul Josenhans, testified extensively as to Borden\u2019s non-assumption of liability at the Skinner Landfill. Moreover, the evidence presented by OXY is not convincing. OXY notes various statements by Cities\u2019 employees, but none provides any resolute evidence that would support a finding of clear error. Some evidence emphasized by OXY is not relevant, like the testimony of Dr. Hellwig (who led Cities\u2019 negotiating team) that Cities wanted to sell the Levey Division because it \u201cwanted to get out of the business.\u201d Other OXY evidence focuses on the drafting history of the APA, but this ultimately demonstrates little more than the OXY representatives\u2019 personal interpretations of the negotiations. OXY also relies on various contemporaneous notes and memoranda for the proposition that \u201cCities wanted no obligations \u2018hanging over.\u2019 \u201d These notes, however, do nothing to affect interpretation of the APA. OXY does little more than cite various personal notes of OXY officials and then liberally interpret these notes in its favor. Even if OXY\u2019s evidence permitted a finding contrary to that of the district court, this would not be the basis of a finding of clear error. <em>Anderson, N.C., </em>470 U.S. at 573-74, 105 S.Ct. 1504 (\u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the fact-finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d); <em>see also Fuji Kogyo Co., Ltd. v. Pac. Bay Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>461 F.3d 675, 687 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">OXY also argues that the \u201cunequivocal language of the APA demonstrates that Borden purchased the on-going business of the Levey Division.\u201d OXY asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>that the district court erred as a matter of law when it concluded that Cities did not transfer the Levey Division to Borden as an ongoing business. The district court found that \u201cBorden did <em>not </em>purchase \u2018the on-going business of the Levey Division,\u2019 but rather purchased only selected assets of that entity.\u201d The language in the APA is consistent with this interpretation. Section 1(b) of the APA states that Borden purchases only \u201cthose certain assets of the Levey Division more particularly set forth in Paragraph 7.\u201d That section then details various Levey assets <em>not </em>included in the sale: \u201cExpressly excluded from the assets to be conveyed hereunder are all Levey Division accounts receivable outstanding as of the Closing Date, all cash, claims against third parties and insurance claims, and inventories of finished products consisting of finished inks and related products, lithographic plates and lithographic chemicals in existence and allocable to the Levey Division as of the Closing Date.... \u201d Further, it is clear that the district court weighed the extrinsic evidence and arrived at the conclusion that Borden purchased only certain assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Even if Borden had purchased the Levey Division as an ongoing business, this would not inherently be determinative of environmental liability. As discussed above, Section 7 of the APA provides that Cities transferred assets of the Levey Division to Borden \u201cfree and clear of all liabilities and obligations, except those liabilities and obligations which are to be assumed by Borden as provided herein.\u201d Section 11 further states that \u201cCities will continue to be responsible for all obligations arising out of events occurring pri- or to and on the Closing Date relating to the business or assets of the Levey Division.\u201d Even if Borden had purchased the ongoing business of the Levey Division, this would not overcome the parties\u2019 negotiated agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-6\">. It is unclear why OXY relies on this particular dictionary definition, as it was not released until fifteen years after the parties drafted the APA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\">. Borden asserts that \"OXY conspicuously failed to devote so much as a sentence to the meaning of the phrase 'arising out of' \" as used in Section 11 of the APA. Borden goes on to note how New York courts interpret \"arising out of.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, the phrase \"arising out of\u201d as used in Section 11 is still dependent on whether Cities\u2019 disposal of hazardous waste was an \"event\u201d within the meaning of the contract, and as such \"arising out of\u201d has no independent relevance to determining liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\">. OXY also asserts that the district court\u2019s interpretation of \"event\u201d fatally conflicts with the warranty clause in Section 11. Cities\u2019 limited warranty that it had no knowledge that it was in violation of state or federal law does not, however, circumvent the plain language of other sections of the contract provision. <em>See Buffalo Color Corp. v. AlliedSignal, Inc., </em>139 F.Supp.2d 409, 424-25 (W.D.N.Y. 2001) (finding that one company\u2019s purchase of another company \"as is\u201d does not result in an assumption of CERCLA liability: \"If the parties intended such an indemnity, they could have drafted appropriate specific language to reflect this intent, or \u2014 quite simply\u2014 they could have drafted all-encompassing broad language ....\" (citation omitted)). Moreover, the warranty covers only the \"assets transferred.\u201d By its plain language, then, the warranty does not cover dumping or any subsequent release.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
