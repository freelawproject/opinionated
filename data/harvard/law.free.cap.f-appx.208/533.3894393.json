Three Partners (\u201cP.F. Three\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of administrative expense priority for three unsecured creditor claims. These unsecured claims derived from loans obtained by a Chapter 11 partnership, Upland Partners (\u201cUpland\u201d), without court approval. P.F. Three argues the bankruptcy court abused its discretion in holding (1) the loans obtained by the partnership constituted transactions outside the \u201cordinary course of business,\u201d and (2) \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d did not exist to warrant allowance and payment of claims <em>nunc pro tunc. </em>We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">P.F. Three\u2019s \u201cordinary course of business\u201d claim fails for two reasons. First, the loans do not satisfy the vertical dimension test because the transactions subjected Upland\u2019s creditors to economic risks of a nature different from those accepted when the creditors extended credit. See <em>In re Dant &amp; Russell, Inc., </em>853 F.2d 700, 705 (9th Cir.1988). Second, the loans do not satisfy the horizontal test because P.F. Three failed to provide any evidence to demonstrate that sole partners of real estate development partnerships ordinarily incur debt from entities directly or indirectly controlled by the sole partner. <em>See id. </em>at 704-05. Because P.F. Three\u2019s \u201cordinary course of business\u201d argument fails, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in denying P.F. Three administrative priority for the unsecured claims. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 364(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">Likewise, the bankruptcy court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the facts of this case do not warrant <em>nunc pro tunc </em>allowance and payments of the claims. P.F. Three provides no evidence to show \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d warranted allowance and payment of claims <em>nunc pro tunc. See In re THC Financial Corp., </em>837 F.2d 389, 392 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b558-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
