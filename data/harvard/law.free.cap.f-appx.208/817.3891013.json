APM opposes. APM moves, out of time, for an extension of time until September 25, 2006 to file its brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-24\">On June 7, 2006, this court docketed APM\u2019s appeal. The docketing package informed APM that its brief due date is governed by Fed. Cir. R. 31. Fed. Cir. R. 31(a)(1)(A) states that \u201cthe appellant must serve and file its initial brief within 60 days after docketing.\u201d Thus, APM\u2019s brief was due on August 7, 2006. No brief was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-25\">APM argues that its brief is not overdue because Fed. R.App. P. 31(a)(1) provides that an appellant\u2019s brief must be filed \u201cwithin 40 days after the record is filed.\u201d APM requests a brief due date 40 days after the record is \u201cavailable\u201d to APM. We note that the quoted provision of Fed. R.App. P. 31(a)(1) is stricken in this court\u2019s rules of practice and that Fed. Cir. R. 31 governs the brief due date. <em>See also </em>Fed. Cir. R. 11(a)(1)(A) (the district court must retain the record).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-26\">The docketing statement that was sent to APM clearly states that Fed. Cir. R. 31 governs the brief due date. APM has not demonstrated any reason to suggest that dismissal of the appeal for failure to prosecute is not appropriate. <em>See Julien v. Zeringue, </em>864 F.2d 1572, 1574 (Fed.Cir. 1989) (giving bar of the court notice that \u201cfailure to comply with this court\u2019s rules, including the requirements for preparing and filing briefs ... may result in dismissal of an appeal for failure to prosecute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-27\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b841-28\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-29\">(1) Shanklin\u2019s motion to dismiss 2006-1438 is granted. Shanklin\u2019s brief in 2006-1509 is due within 40 days of the date of filing of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-30\">(2) APM\u2019s motion is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>(3) The revised official captions are reflected above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
