Light (\u201cLight\u201d) petitions for review of the decision of the Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) that sustained his non-selection by the Small Business Association (\u201cAgency\u201d) for the position of Attorney/Advisor in the Disaster Assistance Program, Disaster Area Office 2 in Atlanta, Georgia. <em>Light v. Small Bus. Admin., </em>No. AT-0330-05-0198-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Jul.27, 2005) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>Light\u2019s appeal to the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d), Light argued that the Agency violated his rights under the Veterans Employment Opportunity Act of 1988 (\u2018VEOA\u201d). The Board rejected Light\u2019s argument and concluded that the Agency\u2019s decision not to hire Light did not violate Light\u2019s veterans\u2019 preference rights. <em>Light v. Small Bus. Admin., </em>No. AT-0330-05-0198-1-1, 101 M.S.P.R. 132 (M.S.P.B. Dec.28, 2005) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>The AJ\u2019s decision became the final decision of the Board after the Board denied Light\u2019s petition for review. Because the decision of the Board is supported by substantial evidence, is not an abuse of discretion, and does not otherwise contain reversible error, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c), this court must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it is: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>Chase-Baker v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>198 F.3d 843, 845 (Fed.Cir.1999). The petitioner bears the burden of establishing reversible error in reviewing a decision of an administrative agency such as the Board. <em>Harris v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998). Statutory construction is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>James v. Santella, </em>328 F.3d 1374, 1377 (Fed.Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">The VEOA provides redress for a preference eligible veteran \u201cwho alleges that an agency has violated ... [his or her] rights under any statute or regulation relating to veterans\u2019 preference.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a(a)(l)(A). Under the VEOA, veterans \u201cmay not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(f)(1). Section 3304(f) further provides, \u201cThis subsection shall not be construed to confer an entitlement to veterans\u2019 preference that is not otherwise required by law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3304(f)(3). 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.101 sets forth which positions are subject to the veterans\u2019 preference appointment of procedures and lists certain positions that are wholly exempt from veteran-preference appointment procedures. Attorney positions fall within this exemption. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.101(c)(9). For attorney positions, an agency need only \u201cfollow the principle of veteran preference as far as administratively feasible .... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 302.101(c). \u201c[T]his means an agency must consider veteran status as a \u2018positive factor\u2019 in reviewing applications.\u201d <em>Patterson v. Dep\u2019t of Int., </em>424 F.3d 1151, 1159 (Fed.Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">The AJ found, and Light does not dispute, that the Agency was aware of Light\u2019s veteran status, recalled the problems that Light caused in his prior employment, and informed Light that its decision not to hire Light was solely due to Light\u2019s negative employment history and his inability to work with others. <em>Initial Decision, </em>slip op. at 3. Although the Agency did not expressly state in its October 6, 2004 letter to Light that it considered his veteran status as a \u201cpositive factor\u201d that was outweighed by the Agency\u2019s prior experience with Light, we presume that, in noting Light\u2019s veteran status, the Agency properly discharged its administrative duty to consider Light\u2019s veteran status as a \u201cpositive factor,\u201d which in this case was outweighed by Light\u2019s history with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>Agency. <em>See Miley v. Principi, </em>366 F.3d 1343, 1347 (Fed.Cir.2004) (\u201cThe presumption of regularity provides that, in the absence of clear evidence to the contrary, the court will presume that public officers have properly discharged their official duties\u201d). Because Light has not presented clear evidence sufficient to overcome the presumption of regularity, we therefore agree with the Board that Light\u2019s rights under the VEOA were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">We also agree that the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain Light\u2019s discrimination claim. The Board lacks jurisdiction over a discrimination claim except where it is accompanied by an adverse action claim over which the Board does have jurisdiction. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702(a)(1); <em>Cruz v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>934 F.2d 1240, 1245 (Fed.Cir.1991) (en banc). Non-selection for employment is not an independently appealable action under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7702. <em>See Prewitt v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>133 F.3d 885, 886 (Fed.Cir. 1998). Because the Light\u2019s discrimination claims are not otherwise appealable, and because the provisions of VEOA give the Board no authority to adjudicate the merits of any personnel action; rather, they authorize the Board only to determine whether an agency has violated a statutory or regulatory provision relating to veteran preference, the Board may not employ VEOA to attain jurisdiction over Light\u2019s discrimination claim. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a(a)(l), (d); <em>See Metzenbaum v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>96 M.S.P.R. 104, \u00b6 5 n. 3 (M.S.P.B.2004), <em>aff'd, </em>122 Fed.Appx. 476 (Fed.Cir.2005) (unpublished). Accordingly, because the Board has no authority to review, in a VEOA appeal, his claim of discrimination, Light has failed to satisfy his burden of showing that the Board has jurisdiction over his non-selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the Board\u2019s decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
