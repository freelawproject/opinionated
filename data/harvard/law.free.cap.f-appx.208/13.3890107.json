Chan (\u201cChan\u201d) appeals from his above-guidelines sentence on the grounds that (1) the court erred in applying a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5); (2) the court imposed an unreasonably high sentence; (3) the court abused its discretion in requiring him to undergo mental health treatment as a special condition of supervised release; (4) the court erred in delegating to the probation officer the responsibility to determine the nature of the mental health treatment required; and (5) the court erred in imposing a fine in the written judgment. We will consider those arguments in that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>The short answer to Chan\u2019s objection to the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5), for possession of a firearm with intent to use it in another felony offense, is that he waived that objection by first raising it as an objection to the presentence report and then affirmatively withdrawing it at sentencing. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">As to the reasonableness of the ultimate sentence, the district court expressly considered, but reasonably rejected, each of the mitigating arguments advanced by Chan. First of all, the court rejected Chan\u2019s argument that he never intended to carry out the conspiracy to rob the gun store but that the plans were merely the story line for a book he intended to write. After reviewing the presentence report and hearing extended argument from both parties, the court concluded, based on the overt acts Chan had taken to implement the plan \u2014 casing the location, training the participants, and purchasing and sawing off a shotgun\u2014 that, at the time of his arrest, he intended to carry out the robbery. However, the court stopped short of finding that, when \u201cpush came to shove,\u201d he would actually do so. On that, the court gave Chan \u201cthe benefit of the doubt,\u201d stating that, otherwise, the sentence \u201cwould be a lot higher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">The court also expressly considered the other mitigating factors Chan advanced\u2014 that he had voluntarily enlisted in the Marines, that he has no prior criminal record, and that he comes from a \u201cvery good family\u201d \u2014 but found those considerations outweighed by the \u201chorrific\u201d nature of the offense that Chan had planned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given the \u201cvery, very violent\u201d nature of those plans, the court concluded that a sentence within the guidelines range of 30 to 37 months would be too \u201clenient,\u201d and that a slightly higher sentence of 42 months was necessary to address the statutory factors, particularly the nature of the offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). We find that explanation \u201cplausible,\u201d <em>United States v. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), and the resulting sentence \u201cwithin reasonable limits,\u201d <em>United States v. Scherrer, </em>444 F.3d 91, 93 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc). Accordingly, we defer to the district court\u2019s on-the-scene judgment. <em>Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-11\">As a condition of supervised release, the court required that Chan \u201cundergo a program of mental health counseling and treatment to be determined by the probation officer, either inpatient or outpatient.\u201d As the basis for imposing that condition, the court stated that \u201cthere may be some psychological problems here that may have contributed to the situation in which you now find yourself and, if so, I think you can use the help in dealing with that problem so that it doesn\u2019t continue to plague you for the rest of your life and you can turn your life around.\u201d After announcing that condition and others, the court gave the parties an opportunity to raise \u201c[ajnything further,\u201d but defense counsel raised no objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-12\">Even assuming that Chan did not thereby forfeit the objections to the mental health treatment condition raised here, <em>but see United States v. Sep\u00falveda-Contreras, </em>466 F.3d 166, 171-73 (1st Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mojica-Rivera, </em>435 F.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1599, 164 L.Ed.2d 322 (2006), those objections can be quickly dispatched. The guidelines themselves recommend such a condition \u201c[i]f the court has reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>to believe that the defendant is in need of psychological or psychiatric treatment.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(d)(5). And, given the gruesome and compulsively detailed nature of Chan\u2019s plans, reflecting, as the government argued, \u201ca fascination for violence,\u201d the district court did not clearly err or abuse its discretion in determining that Chan needed such treatment to rehabilitate himself and avoid future crimes of this nature. Nor did the district court err in delegating the determination of the precise form of treatment to the probation officer. <em>See United States v. Allen, </em>312 F.3d 512, 516 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">Chan\u2019s challenge to the requirement that he pay the cost of his three years of supervised release, i.e., $10,358.28, is twofold. He argues, first, that this requirement was imposed, for the first time, in the written judgment, and second, that it conflicts with the court\u2019s statement, at sentencing, that it was \u201cnot going to impose any fine because ... it doesn\u2019t appear [that Chan] ha[s] any assets with which to pay a fine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b40-5\">Taken in context, there is nothing inconsistent between the oral sentence and the written judgment and nothing unreasonable about the requirement that Chan pay the required amount. At sentencing, although the court characterized the requirement as a condition of supervised release rather than a fine, the court expressly stated that it would \u201crequire ... that [Chan] pay the cost of supervision.\u201d Chan was on notice as to the amount of that cost, since it was stated in the presentence report. In imposing this requirement, the court recognized that Chan could not afford to pay the amount up front but stated that as a \u201cyoung able-bodied intelligent young man,\u201d Chan would be able to get a job when he is released and so could bear the cost of the supervised release at that time. In further consideration of Chan\u2019s present inability to pay or to earn sufficient money to do so while in prison, the court stayed the running of interest until Chan is released from prison. Again, Chan\u2019s counsel voiced no objection to this requirement although given an opportunity to do so. The written judgment is to the same effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">Whether characterized as a fine or a condition of supervised release, we see no abuse of discretion in imposing this requirement, <em>see United States v. Uribe-Londo\u00f1o, </em>409 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005), much less anything so plainly erroneous as to warrant granting relief on this forfeited ground, <em>see United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, </em>430 F.3d 1, 19 (1st Cir.2005) The guidelines themselves recommend that the court \u201cimpose a fine in all cases, except where the defendant establishes that he is ... not likely to become able to pay any fine,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5E1.2(a), and directs the court to consider, in determining the amount of the fine, \u201cthe expected costs to the government of any ... term of supervised release imposed,\u201d <em>id., </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(d)(7). Given the guidelines\u2019 recommended range of $6,000 to $60,000 for the present offense level of 19, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5E1.2(c)(3), the amount imposed here was relatively low. The statute and guideline applicable to supervised release further require that if a f\u00edne is imposed and has not been paid upon release, the defendant be required to pay the fine, in installments, as a condition of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(e); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(5). Thus, whether we view the requirement that Chan be required to pay the cost of his supervised release as a fine or as a condition of supervised release, we see no reason to overturn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">Accordingly, the sentence is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">. According to the presentence report, which Chan ultimately did not dispute, the plan to steal guns from a licensed firearms dealer included using a sawed-off shotgun, wrapping the storeowner in duct tape, and setting fire to the store with the owner still inside.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
