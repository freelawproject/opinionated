We affirm. Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Mr. Nellum\u2019s entitlement to federal habeas corpus relief \u201cturns on showing that the state court\u2019s resolution of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>[466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)], \u2018resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rompilla v. Beard, </em>545 U.S. 874, 380, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005) (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254). \u201cAn \u2018unreasonable application\u2019 occurs when a state court \u2018 \u201cidentifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme Court\u2019s] decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts\u201d of petitioner\u2019s case.\u2019 That is, \u2018the state court\u2019s decision must have been [not only] incorrect or erroneous [but] objectively unreasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 520, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003) (quoting <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.))) (alterations in original). We held in <em>Duhaime v. Ducharme, </em>200 F.3d 597, 601 (9th Cir.1999), that \u201c\u00a7 2254(d)(1) does not suffer from any Article III constitutional infirmities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">To show ineffective assistance of counsel under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>Mr. Nellum must demonstrate that his counsel\u2019s representation \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\u201d 466 U.S. at 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. \u201c[Rjeview of an attorney\u2019s performance must be \u2018highly deferential\u2019 and must adopt the counsel\u2019s perspective at the time of the challenged conduct in order to avoid the \u2018distorting effects of hindsight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jennings v. Woodford, </em>290 F.3d 1006, 1012 (9th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052). There is a \u201cstrong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In general, \u201ccounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 691, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The Supreme Court has repeatedly cited the ABA Standards with approval as \u201cguides to determining what is reasonable.\u201d <em>See Rompilla, </em>545 U.S. at 387, 125 S.Ct. 2456 (quoting <em>Wiggins, </em>539 U.S. at 524, 123 S.Ct. 2527 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052)). Those standards describe the duty to investigate as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-9\">Defense counsel should conduct a prompt investigation of the circumstances of the case and explore all avenues leading to facts relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty in the event of conviction. The investigation should include efforts to secure information in the possession of the prosecution and law enforcement authorities. The duty to investigate exists regardless of the accused\u2019s admissions or statements to defense counsel of facts constituting guilt or the accused\u2019s stated desire to plead guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">ABA Standards for Criminal Justice Prosecution and Defense Function, Rule 4-4.1(a) at http://www.abanet.org/crimjusV standards/dfunc_blk.html# 4.1. Specifically with respect to a defendant\u2019s mental state, \u201c[t]rial counsel has a duty to investigate a defendant\u2019s mental state if there is evidence to suggest that the defendant is impaired.\u201d <em>Douglas v. Woodford, </em>316 F.3d 1079, 1085 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Here, Mr. Nellum\u2019s counsel had no reason to believe Mr. Nellum was mentally impaired. Accordingly, while inquiring further into Mr. Nellum\u2019s mental health would have been prudent, it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to determine that <em>Strickland </em>did not require him to do so. Dyslexia and marijuana use do not rise to the same level as the types of indicators we have previously held trigger an attorney\u2019s duty to investigate a defendant\u2019s mental health. <em>See Franklin v. Johnson, </em>290 F.3d 1223 (9th Cir.2002) (duty to investigate when counsel knew defendant was alcoholic and had attempted suicide); <em>Jennings v. Woodford, </em>290 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir.2002) (duty to investigate when counsel knew defendant used drugs, attempted suicide, had been reported as schizophrenic, had been involuntary committed, and engaged in self-mutilation); <em>Lambright v. Stewart, </em>241 F.3d 1201 (9th Cir.2001) (counsel knew defendant had been hospitalized in a mental facility, suffered from hallucinations, had attempted suicide); <em>Seidel v. Merkle, </em>146 F.3d 750 (9th Cir.1998) (counsel knew defendant had been treated at a V.A. hospital for a mental disorder); <em>Evans v. Lewis, </em>855 F.2d 631, 636 (9th Cir.1988) (defendant\u2019s record indicated he was in need of psychiatric treatment).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Nor was it objectively unreasonable for the state court to find that <em>Strickland </em>did not require Mr. Nellum\u2019s counsel to investigate further solely because he was raising a claim of imperfect self defense. <em>See Wilson v. Henry, </em>185 F.3d 986, 990 (9th Cir.1999) (holding counsel was not ineffective for failing to present psychiatric testimony although the defense was imperfect self-defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">Thus, under our deferential standard of review, we conclude that the state court\u2019s determination was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AqZ\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
