Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 724-25 (11th Cir.2004). The defendant then must rebut the plaintiffs <em>prima facie </em>case by producing a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for his action. <em>Id. </em>at 725. If the defendant articulates such a reason, the burden returns to the plaintiff to establish the reason offered by the defendant is pretext. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b750-21\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under the ECOA, a plaintiff must show: (1) the plaintiff participated in a protected activity; (2) the plaintiff suffered an adverse credit action; and (3) there is a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse credit action. <em>See Maniccia v. Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-22\">After oral argument and a thorough review of the record, we determine Appellant failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. Specifically, Appellant failed to establish a causal connection between his participation in the protected activity and the adverse credit action. While Appellee had knowledge of Appellant\u2019s participation in the protected activity, Appellant failed to provide evidence that his participation in the protected activity and the adverse credit action were related. <em>See Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>212 F.3d 571, 590 (11th Cir.2000) (explaining that to establish a causal connection, a plaintiff must show that the decision-makers were aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>of the protected conduct and that the protected activity and the adverse action were at least somewhat related). Additionally, even if Appellant established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, Appellant failed to show the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason offered by Appellee was pretext. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
