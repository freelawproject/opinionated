Although Jones\u2019s total sentence was 55 months below his advisory Guidelines range of 235-293 months, he contends that his sentence violates his constitutional right to due process because there is \u201c \u2018an extreme disparity between the crime charged and the sentence imposed.\u2019 \u201d (Br. at 6-7 (quoting <em>United States v. Red Elk, </em>368 F.3d 1047, 1051-52 (8th Cir.2004) (reversed on other grounds) (citing <em>United States v. Galloway, </em>976 F.2d 414, 426 (8th Cir.1992))).) He also maintains that the district court did not take into account each of the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that his sentence is unreasonable when compared with the 57-month sentence imposed for a sexual abuse crime in <em>United States v. Paz, </em>411 F.3d 906 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">We review the district court\u2019s sentencing decision for unreasonableness under section 3553(a), and we will reverse only for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261-62, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (sentences are reviewed for unreasonableness; section 3553(a) factors will guide appellate courts in determining whether sentence is unreasonable); <em>United States v. Maurstad, </em>454 F.3d 787, 789 (8th Cir.2006) (district court should calculate Guidelines range, determine if departure is warranted under Guidelines, then consider the sentencing factors in section 3553(a) in imposing reasonable sentence; this court reviews for abuse of discretion); <em>United States v. Haack, </em>403 F.3d 997, 1001 (8th Cir.) (method for <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing involves determining availability of Guidelines departures and consideration of factors under \u00a7 3553(a) for non-Guidelines, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>non-departure sentences), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 276, 163 L.Ed.2d 246 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Prior to pronouncing its sentence, the district court expressly stated that it was taking into account all the section 3553(a) factors. For example, the court acknowledged Jones\u2019s young age, difficult upbringing, and criminal record. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1) (factor includes history and characteristics of defendant); <em>see also United States v. Long Soldier, </em>431 F.3d 1120, 1123 (8th Cir.2005) (district court was not required to mention \u201c \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d in sentencing defendant; relevant inquiry is whether court actually considered \u00a7 3553(a) factors and whether appellate court\u2019s review of those factors leads it to conclude that they support a finding of reasonableness). Moreover, the disparity between Jones\u2019s overall sentence and the sentence imposed in <em>Paz </em>is not unwarranted. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) (need to avoid unwarranted disparities among defendants with similar records who are guilty of similar conduct). Even assuming the crime Jones committed was similar to the one committed by the defendant in <em>Paz, </em>Jones was convicted of an additional crime, and had a higher offense level and Guidelines range. <em>See Paz, </em>411 F.3d at 908 (defendant pleaded guilty to one count of sexual abuse of minor; his total offense level was 19, and his Guidelines range was 46-57 months). The district court\u2019s sentencing decision was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\">. The Honorable Charles B. Kornmann, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
