DeFonzo denying the petitioner\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal; and (2) a December 11, 2002 order of the BIA denying the petitioner\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>In re ShaoHua Jiang, </em>No. A 75 985 144 (B.I.A. June 7, 2002), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 75 985 144 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 10, 1998); No. A 75 985 144 (B.I.A. Dec. 11, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Comb reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 59 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yu Sheng Zhang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>362 F.3d 155,159 (2d Cir.2004). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). When the agency\u2019s findings \u201crely upon legal errors, the appropriate remedy is generally to vacate those findings and remand to the BIA for reconsideration of an applicant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Lin v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 106 (2d Cir.2006). If, however, \u201cthe reviewing panel is confident that the agency would reach the same result upon a reconsideration cleansed of errors,\u201d we consider remand futile and affirm the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-14\">In this case, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was supported by substantial evidence. First, although Jiang testified that his marriage certificate was issued in August 1993, two translations of his household register indicated that Jiang was married on March 16, 1995. Second, Jiang\u2019s wife and children were not listed in the household registration when it was issued in August of 1994 even though they were married, according to Jiang, and living together prior to that date. Third, the household registration booklet indicated that Jiang\u2019s children were born in Fuzhou City, even though Jiang testified that his children were born in Xiao Ming. Fourth, Jiang\u2019s statements concerning when he paid the 8,0000 fine and when his children were registered were inconsistent. Finally, Jiang provided inconsistent testimony regarding whether he had returned to his home village after moving to Fuzhou City. Given these inconsistencies with Jiang\u2019s testimony, written statements, and docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>mentary evidence, we are not compelled to conclude that the IJ erred in finding him not credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">We note that the IJ did err in rejecting the x-ray evidence of Jiang\u2019s wife\u2019s sterilization because it was not conducted \u201cunder the auspices of a United States government authorized physician.\u201d It is unclear how Jiang\u2019s wife, who resides in China, could be reasonably expected to have access to a \u201cUnited States authorized physician.\u201d <em>See Li v. INS, </em>453 F.3d 129, 141 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that the IJ erred by demanding documentation that was not reasonably accessible to the alien). Despite this error, remand is not required because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is supported by the inconsistent evidence detailed above and we are confident that the agency would reach the same result on remand. <em>See Lin, </em>453 F.3d at 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Jiang\u2019s motion to reopen. Jiang filed his motion to reopen 91 days after entry of the BIA\u2019s order. A motion to reopen must be filed no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened, but there is an exception to this deadline for asylum applications based on changed country conditions. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7) <em>&amp; </em>(c)(7)(C)(ii). Jiang\u2019s submission of the new translation of his household registration booklet did not establish a change in country conditions. The BIA, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Jiang\u2019s motion as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-12\">Accordingly, Jiang\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. The stay of removal that this Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
