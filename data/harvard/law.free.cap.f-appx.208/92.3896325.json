The District Court sentenced him to 210 months imprisonment, 5 years supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Cubbage appeals both his conviction and sentence. He argues that the District Court improperly admitted evidence and statements obtained through a police search of Cubbage\u2019s apartment, improperly instructed the jury-on the concept of joint possession, and erred in sentencing Cubbage based on a judicial finding that Cubbage possessed more than 700 grams of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. We have jurisdiction over Cubbage\u2019s appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 and we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Cubbage first challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained from a police search of his apartment on the ground that the police did not comply with the knock and announce requirements of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court found that the police were justified in dispensing with the knock and announce requirement in this case because there was a reasonable probability that the people inside Cubbage\u2019s apartment were armed and that the police officers could be in danger of physical peril. The Court reached this conclusion based on the awareness of the police officers, prior to the execution of the warrant, of the facts that: (1) Cubbage had been previously convicted of carrying a concealed deadly weapon, (2) high level drug dealers were in the apartment earlier on the day of the search, (3) when the officers exited their vehicle, people in the apartment complex in the area of Cubbage\u2019s apartment began to scream \u201c5-0 is here, 5-0 is here,\u201d (4) when the officers were exiting their vehicle, a woman on a cellular phone outside the apartment complex said, \u201cGirl, the police out here. They are getting ready to go into somebody\u2019s house,\u201d and (5) a half wall at the top of the stairs in Cubbage\u2019s apartment obscured the officers\u2019 view into the living room as they stood in the entryway at the bottom of the staircase. Cubbage does not challenge the District Court\u2019s determination that these circumstances were known to the officers at the time of the search, but rather argues that these circumstances did not justify dispensing with the knock and announce requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">We review the District Court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s application of law to the facts of this case. <em>United States v. Robertson, </em>305 F.3d 164, 168 (3d Cir.2002). \u201cIn order to justify a \u2018no-knock\u2019 entry, the police must have a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence, under the particular circumstances, would be dangerous or futile, or that it would inhibit the effective investigation of the crime by, for example, allowing the destruction of evidence.\u201d <em>Richards v. Wisconsin, </em>520 U.S. 385, 394, 117 S.Ct. 1416, 137 L.Ed.2d 615 (1997). We agree, under the totality of the circumstances known to the officers executing the warrant, that the officers had a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing their presence prior to executing the warrant at Cubbage\u2019s apartment would be dangerous. The warnings shouted by Cubbage\u2019s neighbors prior to the search, Cubbage\u2019s prior conviction for possession of a deadly weapon, the presence of known drug dealers in the apartment earlier in the day, and the unfavorable physical layout of the apartment together gave rise to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>a reasonable suspicion that knocking and announcing prior to execution of the warrant would be dangerous. <em>See United States v. Cline, 349 F.3d </em>1276, 1290 (10th Cir.2003) (affirming finding of exigent circumstances where (a) prior search of defendant\u2019s residence had revealed firearms, (b) there was likelihood that defendant used counter-surveillance equipment and could be aware of their approach, (c) the police approach had taken longer than anticipated, and (d) people in the vicinity had observed the police approach and might have warned defendant). Therefore, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s denial of Cubbage\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence obtained from the search of his apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Next, Cubbage argues that the District Court erred by instructing the jury on the concept of joint possession. Cubbage contends that there was insufficient evidence in the record to justify an instruction on joint possession because the evidence, if believed, established that Cubbage possessed the cocaine base <em>exclusively </em>and not jointly with anyone else. We note that it is counterintuitive for a defendant to seek reversal of his conviction based on the argument that the evidence presented at trial, if believed, established that he possessed the drugs recovered from his apartment solely, rather than jointly. Cubbage contends, however, that the giving of a joint possession instruction under these circumstances is reversible error. Cubbage objected to the instruction at the charge conference and after the District Court instructed the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In reviewing jury instructions, we review the trial court\u2019s charge for abuse of discretion, considering whether, in light of the evidence, the charge as a whole fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury. <em>United States v. Zehrbach, </em>47 F.3d 1252, 1264 (3d Cir.1995) (en banc). We will reverse if \u201cthe instruction was capable of confusing and thereby misleading the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bennis v. Gable, </em>823 F.2d 723, 727 (3d Cir.1987)). At Cubbage\u2019s trial, witnesses testified that the cocaine base seized from Cubbage\u2019s apartment was found in two locations: inside Cubbage\u2019s pant pocket and inside a helmet cover that Cubbage was seen removing from the trunk of his car prior to the search and that was later found under a cushion of the love seat in Cubbage\u2019s living room. Cubbage is correct that the evidence presented at trial could support a finding that he alone possessed the drugs, since the drugs were found in his clothing and concealed in the furniture of his living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">However, the jury could have also concluded from the evidence presented that some of the drugs were possessed jointly by Cubbage and other people in the apartment. Seven other men were in the apartment at the time that the drugs were seized, including one man sitting on the couch near to the love seat in which a package of drugs was concealed. There was also a blue coat found on the love seat, which was not identified as belonging to Cubbage. At the time that the search was conducted, the drugs found in the love seat were in closer proximity to the men in the living room than they were to Cubbage, who was showering in a locked bathroom in the apartment. The close physical proximity of these other people, and of personal property not identified as belonging to Cubbage, to the drugs in the love seat could have led the jury to conclude that Cubbage was not in exclusive possession of the drugs in the love seat at the time of the seizure. <em>See Johnson v. United States, </em>506 F.2d 640, 643-44 (8th Cir. 1974) (finding no error in joint possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>instruction because drugs were found in apartment that defendant shared with his sister and because another man was present in apartment and had access to drugs at the time they were seized). Considering the jury charge as a whole and the capacity of the joint possession instruction to confuse or mislead the jurors, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s instructing the jury on the theory of joint possession in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Finally, Cubbage argues that the District Court erred by sentencing him based on facts that were proved to the judge by a preponderance of the evidence, rather than proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. In the alternative, Cubbage argues that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the cocaine base Cubbage possessed was \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. After <em>Booker, </em>we review a district court\u2019s calculation of the sentencing range under the Guidelines for legal error, as part of our review of the reasonableness of the sentence imposed. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>467 F.3d 834, 838-39 (3rd Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Cubbage argues that the District Court was not permitted to make findings as to the weight and nature of the drugs by a preponderance of the evidence because these judicial findings resulted in a massive jump in Cubbage\u2019s sentencing range under the Guidelines. We disagree. Because the Sentencing Guidelines are now advisory, rather than mandatory, judicial fact finding that results in an increase in a defendant\u2019s maximum sentence under the Guidelines is not unconstitutional. \u201c[T]he clear intent of the remedial opinion in <em>Booker </em>was for the process of calculating the Guidelines to continue operating as before.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>467 F.3d at 838.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-9\">We also reject Cubbage\u2019s argument that the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the \u201ccocaine base\u201d he possessed was \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. Although the government has the burden to prove that the particular form of cocaine base possessed by Cubbage was \u201ccrack\u201d in order to trigger the enhanced Guidelines penalties for \u201ccrack\u201d possession, <em>United States v. James, </em>78 F.3d 851, 855 (3d Cir.1995), the testimony of an experienced law enforcement officer can be sufficient to prove that the substance is \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine, <em>United States v. Roman, </em>121 F.3d 136, 141 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">At Cubbage\u2019s trial, four law enforcement officers testified that the drugs found in Cubbage\u2019s apartment were, or appeared to be, \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d Detective Pires testified that he found \u201ca clear plastic bag that contained a yellowish-white rocklike substance that appeared to be crack cocaine\u201d in Cubbage\u2019s pants pocket. Detective Mailey described the package of drugs found in the love seat in Cubbage\u2019s living room as \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d Detective Boney also testified that the drugs found in Cubbage\u2019s love seat \u201cappeared to me to be crack cocaine.\u201d Finally, Detective Matthews described the drugs seized from the love seat and from Cubbage\u2019s pants pocket as \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d Detective Pope, who testified for the government as an expert on the distribution, price and packaging of \u201ccrack cocaine base,\u201d also identified the drugs found in the apartment as \u201ccrack cocaine.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition, the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>presented the testimony of a forensic chemist, who stated that the drugs found in Cubbage\u2019s apartment contained a mixture of \u201ccocaine in the base form also known as crack\u201d and cocaine hydrochloride. Cubbage challenged the chemist\u2019s testimony with the testimony of another forensic chemist, who concluded that it could not be determined from the tests performed by the government chemist whether the cocaine tested was cocaine salt or cocaine base.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">At sentencing, the District Court credited the trial testimony of the police detectives and, based on their testimony, found that the government had met its burden to prove that the cocaine base recovered from the apartment was \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. Cubbage objected to this finding prior to and at the time of sentencing. Given the detectives\u2019 years of experience with the appearance and packaging of crack cocaine and the lack of evidence presented to contradict their testimony that the substances recovered were, or appeared to be, \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine, we find no error in the District Court\u2019s finding that the government met its burden to prove that the cocaine base possessed by Cubbage was \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Accordingly, for the reasons set forth above, we will affirm Cubbage\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\">. Detective Pope was asked at trial to identify the substance \"in Government Exhibits 1 and 15.\u201d It appears that the transcript contains an error and that the question actually posed was as to the identify of the substances in Government Exhibits 6 and 15, which were the cocaine substances recovered from Cubbage's apartment. All of the prior questions in this line of inquiry related to Government Exhibits 6 and 15, and it would make little <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>sense to ask Detective Pope to identity the substance in Government Exhibit 1, which was a Tanita digital scale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
