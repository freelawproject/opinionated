Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>05-CV-0152, 2005 WL 3234629 (E.D.Pa. Nov. 30, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>2005) <em>(\u201cSummary Judgment Order\u201d). </em>We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Douglas owns U.S. Patent No. 5,664,272, which recites an \u201cauto control pillow for cars, vans, trucks and tractors.\u201d It consists of one independent claim, i.e., claim 1,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and two dependant claims. On January 17, 2005, using certified mail, Douglas served Wal-Mart with a complaint alleging patent infringement based on its G\u00fcee neck massage pillow. However, the certificate of service stated that it had been sent using first class mail, an improper method of service under Pennsylvania law. <em>See Douglas v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>05-CV-0152, slip op. at 2, 2 n. 1, 7, 2005 WL 589626 (E.D.Pa. March 11, 2005) <em>(\u201cDefault Judgment Order\u201d). </em>Wal-Mart contacted Douglas about this putative defect, but he did not respond, and instead filed a motion for entry of default judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 7. The trial court denied Douglas\u2019 motion, and granted Wal-Mart\u2019s motion to set aside entry of default. <em>Id. </em>at 8; <em>see also id. </em>at 8 &amp; n. 3 (analyzing the parties\u2019 motions as if default had been properly entered by the clerk of the court, and describing the procedures for entry of default judgment in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). Douglas then filed an amended complaint, setting forth additional claims for relief. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of WalMart on all of Douglas\u2019 asserted claims. <em>Summary Judgment Order </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-6\">As an initial matter, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Douglas\u2019 motion for entry of default judgment. <em>See EMCASCO Ins. Co. v. Sambrick, </em>834 F.2d 71, 73 (3d Cir.1987) (providing that a trial court\u2019s decision to lift a default is reviewed for abuse of discretion, and is guided by the factors enumerated in <em>Poulis v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>747 F.2d 863, 868 (3d Cir.1984)). In its answer to Douglas\u2019 motion for entry of default judgment, Wal-Mart set forth sufficient facts to establish a meritorious defense to the infringement claim. Because the Third Circuit has a strong policy in favor of deciding cases on the merits, <em>see, e.g., Spain v. Gallegos, </em>26 F.3d 439, 454 (3d Cir.1994), this factor weighs especially heavily in Wal-Mart\u2019s favor. Moreover, Douglas did not demonstrate how he would be prejudiced by the delay inherent in proceeding on the merits, and Wal-Mart\u2019s delay in filing its answer can reasonably be viewed as resulting from its belief that it had been improperly served. <em>Default Judgment Order </em>at 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-10\">With respect to the merits, we review the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>reapplying the same standard as the trial court. <em>Lacavera v. Dudas, </em>441 F.3d 1380,1382 (Fed.Cir.2006); <em>Martorana v. Bd. of Trs. of Steamfitters Local Union 120 Health, Welfare &amp; Pension Fund, </em>404 F.3d 797, 801 (3d Cir.2005). To prove literal infringement, Douglas must demonstrate that every limitation in an asserted claim is found in the accused device. <em>Amhil Enters, v. Wawa, Inc., </em>81 F.3d 1554, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1996). Wal-Mart demonstrated, <em>inter alia, </em>that its device does not have a \u201cU-shaped plastic retainer being adapted to fit on a thigh of a driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>of a motor vehicle,\u201d and Douglas did not enter any evidence to the contrary. Therefore, Wal-Mart does not literally infringe. Because Douglas does not point to anything in the accused device that performs the function of the \u201cU-shaped plastic retainer\u201d in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result, there cannot be infringement under the doctrine of equivalents. <em>See Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chem. Co., </em>520 U.S. 17, 40, 117 S.Ct. 1040, 137 L.Ed.2d 146 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">Douglas\u2019 remaining claims for relief fair no better. In order to maintain a claim for copyright infringement, he must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that Wal-Mart had access to his copyrighted work. <em>Dam Things from, Den. v. Russ Berrie &amp; Co., Inc., </em>290 F.3d 548, 561 (3d Cir.2002). Douglas, however, failed to come forward with any specific evidence to prove access to his work, either directly or circumstantially, <em>Summary Judgment Order </em>at 12, and does not point to any evidence in the record that would otherwise suggest such access.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-5\">With respect to trade dress infringement, Douglas must show, <em>inter alia, </em>that the allegedly infringing feature is nonfunctional. <em>Shire U.S., Inc. v. Barr Labs., Inc., </em>329 F.3d 348, 353 (3d Cir.2003). As a threshold matter, however, he has not established what features of his device or packaging constitute the purported trade dress. <em>Summary Judgment Order </em>at 14. With respect to false advertising, Douglas must prove, <em>inter alia, </em>that Wal-Mart made false or misleading statements about its neck massage pillow or Douglas\u2019 products. <em>Warner-Lambert Co. v. BreathAsure, Inc., </em>204 F.3d 87, 92 (3d Cir.2000). However, he has not set forth evidence of any such statements. Finally, with respect to unfair competition and trademark infringement, Douglas must establish, <em>inter alia, </em>that he owns a legally protectable mark. <em>Fisons Horticulture, Inc. v. Vigoro Indus., Inc., </em>30 F.3d 466, 472 (3d Cir. 1994); <em>see also Summary Judgment Order </em>at 15, 16 &amp; n. 7. His alleged mark, PLEASURABLE NECK PILLOW, is at a minimum descriptive, and therefore cannot possibly enjoy legal protection without secondary meaning. <em>A.J. Canfield Co. v. Honickman, </em>808 F.2d 291, 297 (3d Cir. 1986). Douglas, however, has not introduced any evidence suggesting that consumers associate his goods with his alleged mark.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-7\"> Claim 1 provides for, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b969-8\">A combined motor vehicle control pillow and tiltable steering wheel cover unit for straight highway driving comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APz\">a fabric covered foam piece; a hook and loop fastener strip mounted on one surface of said fabric covered foam piece; said hook and loop fastener strip being arranged to engage a steering wheel cover ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiVie\">a U-shaped plastic retainer secured to the opposite surface of said fabric covered foam piece, said U-shaped plastic retainer being adapted to fit on a thigh of a driver of a motor vehicle....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
