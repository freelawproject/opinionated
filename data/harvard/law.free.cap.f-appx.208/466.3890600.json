After voir dire but before opening statements at his trial, Hernandez-Eslora pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and one count of possession with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1). After calculating a guidelines imprisonment range of 168 to 210 months, the district court imposed concurrent terms of 192 months plus three years of supervised release, $200 in special assessments, and a $300 fine. Appointed counsel filed a notice of appeal but now moves to withdraw because he cannot discern a non-frivolous basis for appeal. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). We invited Hernandez-Eslora to respond to counsel\u2019s brief, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), but he has not done so. Counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate, so we limit our review to the potential issues identified by counsel. <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) <em>(per </em>curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-13\">Hernandez-Eslora has given no indication that he wants his guilty pleas set aside, so counsel appropriately has omitted any discussion of the adequacy of the plea colloquy or the voluntariness of his pleas. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-72 (7th Cir.2002). And since Hernandez-Eslora agreed with the probation officer\u2019s guidelines calculations, he has waived any appellate argument about the resulting imprisonment range. <em>See United States v. Murry, </em>395 F.3d 712, 717 (7th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Martinez-Jimenez, </em>294 F.3d 921, 923 (7th Cir.2002). Thus counsel considers only whether his 192-month prison terms are unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-14\">At sentencing Hernandez-Eslora argued for a below-guidelines sentence due to his poor health. The district court disagreed, finding that Hernandez-Eslora could receive adequate \u2014 if not better\u2014 medical treatment in prison. The district court also noted that Hernandez-Eslora\u2019s illness had not prevented him from committing crime, and thus could not be expected to deter him in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-15\">Counsel rightly concludes that it would be frivolous for Hernandez-Eslora to argue that his poor health compels a lower sentence. A sentence within the guidelines range is presumptively reasonable. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number><em>See United States v. Mykytiuk, </em>415 F.3d 606, 608 (7th Cir.2005). The Supreme Court has granted a writ of certiorari to determine whether that presumption is consistent with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>United States v. Rita, </em>177 Fed.Appx. 357 (4th Cir.2006), <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006). But even without the benefit of the presumption, HernandezEslora\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court meaningfully considered the statutory sentencing factors and determined that Hernandez-Eslora\u2019s illness did not compel a shorter sentence because he could be treated in prison. The court also found that his illness had not \u2014 and would not \u2014 prevent him from committing crime. <em>See United States v. Wurzinger, </em>467 F.3d 649, 653 (7th Cir.2006). Counsel is unable to identify any other factors that would have compelled a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
