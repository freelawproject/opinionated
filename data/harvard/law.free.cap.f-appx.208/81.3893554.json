Rohan denying his application for relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and denying his motion to reopen to assert claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>In re Munasar Uddin Ali, </em>No. A72 779 074 (B.I.A. April 23, 2003), <em>aff'g </em>No. A72 779 074 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jan. 29, 2002). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-15\">Where, as here, the BIA issues an opinion that fully affirms and adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision directly. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Here, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Ali had failed to show that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed to India, and that Ali was therefore not entitled to relief under CAT. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-16\">We review the IJ\u2019s denial of Ali\u2019s motion to reopen under the abuse of discretion standard, \u201cmindful that motions to reopen are disfavored.\u201d <em>Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006) (quotation marks omitted). We see no abuse of discretion here. As the IJ observed, Ali was \u201coffered every opportunity to proceed with those forms of relief ... and declined to do so.\u201d Moreover, the IJ considered Ali\u2019s claim under the well-founded fear of persecution standard applicable to asylum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>claims, and found that Ah would be unable to meet that lesser standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
