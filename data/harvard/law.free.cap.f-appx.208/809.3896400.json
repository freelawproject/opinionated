Thomas argues the district court erred by: (1) overruling his <em>Batson </em>challenge; (2) denying his motion to suppress; (3) denying his motions for judgment of acquittal; and (4) sentencing him as an Armed Career Criminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-10\">After oral argument and a thorough review of the record, we affirm issues one, three, and four without discussion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">As to the second issue, oral argument and a review of the record convinces us that the district court committed clear error in re-adopting the credibility findings in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation (the Report) and denying Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress. The Report reconciled the conflicting testimony of the officers, but was prepared without consideration of Ms. Mathis\u2019s testimony. At trial, the district court stated it was unable to reconcile all of the conflicting testimony. While the court need not reconcile all of the evidence, it needs to do more than readopt a report made without the benefit of testimony that substantially undermines the basis of Officer Wagaman\u2019s reasonable suspicion. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s denial of Thomas\u2019s motion to suppress, vacate his convictions, and remand for a new trial, directing the district court to grant the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-15\">REVERSED, VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b834-25\">. Counsel for Thomas conceded issues three and four were raised in order to preserve the issues for future review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
