Thompson\u2019s constitutional challenges<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to the state trial court\u2019s use of an anonymous jury fail, because he does not demonstrate that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was contrary to clearly established United States Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Ferrizz v. Giurbino, </em>432 F.3d 990, 993-94 (9th Cir.2005). Thompson\u2019s claim that his dignity interests were violated similarly fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Thompson\u2019s state law claims fail, because \u201cfederal habeas corpus relief does not lie for errors of state law.\u201d <em>Little v. Crawford, </em>449 F.3d 1075, 1082 (9th Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Thompson\u2019s claim that he was denied a liberty interest in a non-anonymous jury as created by state law is meritless, because California courts have upheld the <em>voir dire </em>procedure utilized during Thompson\u2019s trial. <em>See People v. Goodwin, </em>59 Cal.App.4th 1084, 1090-91, 69 Cal.Rptr.2d 576 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Thompson\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails, because he does not demonstrate the requisite prejudice. <em>See Cooper-Smith v. Palmateer, </em>397 F.3d 1236, 1243 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">The California Court of Appeal\u2019s opinion denying Thompson\u2019s access to the jurors\u2019 phone numbers and addresses was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law, because \u201cthe California rule requiring an indigent defendant to show a specific need to obtain a complete voir dire transcript does not run counter to clearly established federal law.\u201d <em>Boyd v. Newland, </em>467 F.3d 1139, 1151 (9th Cir.2006). Thompson also had access to the pertinent <em>voir dire </em>transcript, and the state trial court did not prohibit Thompson\u2019s counsel from showing the juror information to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-13\">We do not address Thompson\u2019s uncertified ineffective assistance of counsel claims, because he did not \u201cmake a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right to warrant a certificate of appealability.\u201d <em>Allen v. Ornoski, </em>435 F.3d 946, 951 (9th Cir.2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
