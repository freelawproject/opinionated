An immigration judge (IJ) ordered Abbas removed but granted his request for voluntary departure provided he waived an appeal. Notwithstanding the waiver, Abbas appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. While Abbas\u2019s appeal was pending and within the period allowed for voluntary departure, Abbas\u2019s 1-130 petition was approved. Rather than filing a motion to reopen the removal proceedings, as he had been instructed by the IJ, Abbas filed a motion to remand with the BIA; however, the motion to remand was mooted by the dismissal of Abbas\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-24\">Approximately one year later, Abbas and the respondent jointly moved to reopen the proceedings, but the IJ denied the motion as untimely. In the alternative, the IJ denied the motion as a matter of discretion because Abbas had failed to comply with the order of voluntary departure. Abbas appealed to the BIA, which concluded that the joint motion to reopen was timely, but nevertheless dismissed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>appeal because Abbas\u2019s failure to comply with the order of voluntary departure barred him from obtaining relief. Abbas has petitioned for review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">Abbas argues that the joint motion to reopen was timely and that the IJ\u2019s denial of the motion to reopen was an abuse of discretion because the order of voluntary departure would have been nullified if the IJ had reopened his case. We need not address the issue of timeliness because the BIA held that the joint motion to reopen was timely and addressed the merits of Abbas\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The decision whether to reopen immigration proceedings is discretionary, and our review of the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen is \u201chighly deferential.\u201d <em>Lam v. Trominski, </em>216 F.3d 487, 496 (5th Cir. 2000). If the BIA\u2019s interpretation of its regulations is reasonable, we defer to that determination. <em>Guevara v. Gonzales, </em>450 F.3d 173,176 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">An alien who is authorized to depart voluntarily and who fails to depart the United States within the specified time period is ineligible to receive cancellation of removal for a ten-year period. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229e(d). We have held that, in exchange for the \u201cnumerous benefits\u201d attendant to voluntary departure, \u00a7 1229c(d) requires that the alien accept the consequences of civil fines and ineligibility for certain forms of immigration relief, if he does not depart as agreed. <em>See Banda-Ortiz v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 387, 389-90 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert, filed </em>(Sept. 28, 2006) (No. 06^477). Thus, dismissal of Abbas\u2019s appeal pursuant to \u00a7 1229c(d) was within the discretion of the BIA. <em>Zhao v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 295, 303-04 (5th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b361-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
