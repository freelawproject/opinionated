We lack jurisdiction over this petition challenging the BIA\u2019s discretionary denial of the motion to reopen for further consideration of their application for suspension of deportation, because 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) \u201cbars jurisdiction ... to review the denial of a motion to reopen that pertains only to the merits basis for a previously-made discretionary determination under [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 603 (9th Cir.2006). As in <em>Fernandez, </em>Petitioners\u2019 proffered additional evidence was \u201ceither cumulative or pertained to the inevitable passage of time between [the] removal hearing and the BIA\u2019s adjudication of [the] appeal,\u201d and, therefore, \u201cdid not alter the core of [their] claim,\u201d precluding jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 603.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-13\">2. We also lack jurisdiction over petitioners\u2019 claim that the BIA abused its discretion by not issuing a decision that fully explains the reasons for denying the motion to reopen because \u201c[o]ur conclusion that we lack jurisdiction to review [petitioners\u2019] claim regarding the BIA\u2019s determination that [they] did not make out a prima facie case of hardship forecloses this argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-14\">3. Although we generally have jurisdiction to review constitutional due process claims, <em>Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005), our jurisdiction arises only if the asserted due process claim is colorable. <em>See id. </em>(requiring \u201cat least a colorable constitutional violation\u201d before reviewing due process challenges) (citation omitted). Because we have determined that Petitioner\u2019s claim that the BIA failed to articulate its reasoning is precluded by <em>Fernandez, </em>the claim is not colorable. <em>See Torres-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cTo be colorable ... [a] claim must have some possible validity.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). The claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>the BIA changed the evidentiary standard for reopening without providing notice or an opportunity for Petitioners to respond also fails, as there is no evidence in the record to support Petitioners\u2019 assertion. <em>See Fernandez, </em>489 F.3d at 603 (denying Petitioner\u2019s due process claim when the evidence in the record was inadequate to support her assertion.).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">4. Any stay of the voluntary departure period the INS granted petitioners will expire upon issuance of the mandate. <em>See Desta v. Ashcroft, </em>365 F.3d 741, 750 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">PETITION DISMISSED in part, DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b556-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-11\">. Petitioners claimed hardship under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254, the predecessor to \u00a7 1229b. Section 309(c)(4)(E) of IIRIRA precludes review of certain discretionary decisions of the BIA, including hardship decisions under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. See <em>Rodriguez-Lariz v. INS, </em>282 F. 3d 1218, 1223 (9th Cir.2002) \"The kinds of discretionary determinations covered by \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E) are ... the same as those covered by \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i).\u201d <em>Medina-Morales v. Ashcroft, </em>371 F.3d 520, 527 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
