Taylor (\u201cTaylor\u201d) appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition, challenging his Three Strikes sentence of 28-years-to-life imprisonment for drug possession.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taylor argues that: (1) the state court violated his due process rights by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the validity of his prior convictions; and (2) his sentence violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253 and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Assuming a <em>Teague </em>analysis is required, <em>Teague </em>clearly bars Taylor\u2019s due process claim. Taylor\u2019s due process claim fails because it \u201cask[s] us to make new law, which we cannot do\u201d on habeas review. <em>Allen v. Ornoski, 435 F.3d 946, 955 (9th </em>Cir.2006); <em>see Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989). <em>Teague </em>advises that \u201ca case announces a new rule when it breaks new ground or imposes a new obligation on the States or the Federal Government,\u201d or, stated differently, \u201cif the result was not <em>dictated </em>by precedent existing at the time the defendant\u2019s conviction became final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">Taylor cannot establish that \u2014 at the time his conviction and sentence became final \u2014 there was a federal due process right to an evidentiary hearing at sentencing to challenge the validity of prior convictions on grounds other than violation of the right to counsel. <em>See Lackawanna County Disk Attorney v. Coss, </em>532 U.S. 394, 404, 121 S.Ct. 1567, 149 L.Ed.2d 608 (2001). Nor can he establish that any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number><em>Teague </em>exception applies. As such, Taylor\u2019s due process claim is <em>Teague-barred.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Taylor\u2019s due process claim would also fail under the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) because, insofar as he cannot establish a federal due process right to the hearing he seeks, he cannot establish that the state court\u2019s denial of his request was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">Taylor\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim also fails because it is procedurally barred due to his failure to raise the issue in state trial court. The California Court of Appeal held that this failure waived the claim under state law and reached the merits of Taylor\u2019s claim only in an alternative holding. Because Taylor \u201cdefaulted his federal claims pursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule, federal habeas review ... is barred.\u201d <em>Coleman v. Thompson, </em>501 U.S. 722, 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546, 115 L.Ed.2d 640 (1991); <em>see High v. Ignacio, </em>408 F.3d 585, 590 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Taylor offers no argument that the contemporaneous-objection rule invoked by the court of appeal was not an adequate and independent basis for its decision. Nor does he assert there was cause for his default or that a miscarriage of justice would result if his claim is not heard. Accordingly, habeas review of Taylor\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim is procedurally barred. <em>See, e.g., Coleman, </em>501 U.S. at 750, 111 S.Ct. 2546; <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 86-87, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977) (failure to object at trial precludes federal habeas review); <em>Paulino v. Castro, </em>371 F.3d 1083, 1092-93 (9th Cir.2004) (California\u2019s contemporary-objection rule precludes federal habeas review).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b599-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.

Taylor\u2019s total sentence is a composite of a 25-years-to-life Three Strikes sentence and a 3-year prior prison term enhancement. Prior to sentencing, a jury found that Taylor had suffered two prior \"strike\u201d convictions within the meaning of California\u2019s Three Strikes law and qualified for three prison term enhancements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
