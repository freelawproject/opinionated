Robinson appeals his convictions and 224-month sentence, arguing that the evidence was insufficient to show that he was a knowing participant in the conspiracy and that the district court committed various sentencing errors. After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">By June 2002, Robinson had become involved in a conspiracy in which marijuana was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and then shipped from California to Florida and other parts of the country. Robinson, who owned a shipping company in California called MBS Transit, was responsible for shipping the marijuana to the various co-conspirators throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">Tony Ruiz, the main supplier of the drugs, would deliver the marijuana to Robinson at his shipping company. The marijuana would arrive already shrink-wrapped, covered in coffee grinds and mustard to mask the smell, and boxed up. Robinson would take the boxes containing marijuana from Ruiz, put the boxes in crates, and ship the crates to his co-conspirators for further distribution. The drug proceeds would be collected and sent back to Robinson, who in turn would give the money to Ruiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">An investigation into this marijuana distribution scheme resulted in the tracking and seizure of several shipments of marijuana sent through Robinson\u2019s MBS Transit, as well as statements from co-conspirators and shipping records implicating Robinson in numerous other marijuana shipments.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">In this case, Robinson was charged with (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 1,000 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(vii); (2) possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(vii); and (3) aiding and abetting the possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(B)(vii) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>a ten-day trial, a jury found Robinson guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) indicated that Robinson was responsible for approximately 7,000 kilograms of marijuana and recommended a base offense level of 34, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3). The PSI also recommended enhancements of (1) 4 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3131.1(a), because Robinson was an organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive; and (2) 2 levels, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, because Robinson obstructed justice during the course of his trial by submitting fraudulent invoices from his shipping company. With a total offense level of 40 and a criminal history category of I, the advisory guidelines range was 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Robinson objected to the PSI, arguing that (1) his base offense level should be 32 because the indictment charged him with possessing only between 1,000 to 3,000 kilograms of marijuana; (2) there was an insufficient basis to enhance his sentence for an aggravating role or for obstruction of justice; and (3) the PSI was deficient because it did not address all of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">At sentencing, the district court determined, \u201clooking at it in the most conservative sense [and only calculating] what came into Florida,\u201d that Robinson was responsible for 5,038 kilograms of marijuana. The district court arrived at this figure by adding up the gross weight of each shipment of marijuana as listed on the bills of lading and then subtracting an average of 50 pounds per crate to account for the extra weight of the crate and other packing material.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court also overruled Robinson\u2019s legal objection regarding his base offense level, noting that the court was allowed to make factual findings as to drug quantities at sentencing, even if that amount was higher than the amount listed in the indictment or found by the jury. Accordingly, the district court agreed with the PSI that Robinson\u2019s base offense level properly was set at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">As for the role enhancement, the district court imposed only a two-level enhancement, rather than the four-level enhancement recommended in the PSI. The district court initially noted that there was not enough evidence to support either a four-level or a three-level enhancement. The district court also noted that it had gone \u201cback and forth\u201d between a two-level enhancement and no role enhancement, but ultimately decided that a two-level enhancement was appropriate given the scope of the conspiracy and Robinson\u2019s central role and continuous involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">Nevertheless, the government emphasized the importance of Robinson\u2019s role in the offense and maintained that a four-level role enhancement was proper. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>response, Robinson argued that he was not an organizer or leader of the criminal activity and that he should not receive an aggravating-role enhancement. Robinson also stated that his \u201crole in this was a minor role,\u201d at which point the district court questioned whether Robinson was requesting a minor-role reduction. Robinson\u2019s counsel replied,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-4\">No, ma\u2019am. I am not arguing that at all.... I am saying that it shouldn\u2019t be the four levels. At the most, Your Hon- or, we would agree with the Court at the two level because of his actions in this case. We don\u2019t feel like it goes up to the level of someone who is recruiting people and/or basically controlling any part of the organization....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The district court again stated that a four-level role enhancement was not appropriate given the evidence, but it did find that a two-level enhancement was proper. Specifically, the district court found that the conspiracy \u201clast[ed] a number of years, it was a wide-ranging national operation, it moved a lot of marijuana,\u201d and that \u201cRobinson\u2019s operation was very significant in the success of the venture.\u201d The district court also found that, as to the marijuana, Robinson \u201cwas responsible for having it crated, having it picked up, [and] delivered to the shipping,\u201d and that he used more than one shipping company in order to \u201ccover the tracks and be less visible as to what was happening.\u201d The district court also noted that Robinson was responsible for receiving shipments containing drug proceeds from his co-conspirators. Ultimately, the district court found that Robinson was \u201ca manager of the criminal activity\u201d and imposed a two-level role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">As for Robinson\u2019s remaining objections, the district court found that (1) the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice was not appropriate; and (2) there was no legal basis for Robinson\u2019s argument concerning the sufficiency of the PSI. Accordingly, the district court determined that Robinson\u2019s total offense level was 86, resulting in an advisory guidelines range of 188 to 235 months\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the advisory guidelines range and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Robinson to 224 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently, a total of five years\u2019 supervised release, and imposed a fine of $30,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">Robinson now appeals his convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AlaF\">A. Sufficiency of the Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">Robinson argues that the evidence was insufficient to show his knowledge of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Robinson claims that he was an innocent shipper who had no knowledge that he was shipping thousands of kilograms of marijuana across the country over the course of several years.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-12\">However, there was more than ample evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that Robinson was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. First, a jury could reasonably infer from the large quantity of marijuana shipped from Robinson\u2019s company that Robinson had knowledge of the conspiracy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>and was actively participating in the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d 719, 722 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201cA reasonable jury could infer from the quantity of drugs seized that a \u2018prudent smuggler\u2019 is not likely to entrust such valuable cargo to an innocent person without that person\u2019s knowledge.\u201d). Ruiz repeatedly entrusted Robinson with crates of marijuana, and the jury could infer that Ruiz was unlikely to entrust such valuable cargo to Robinson without his knowledge of the cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Second, the amount Robinson charged to ship the crates of marijuana provides another indication that Robinson had knowledge of the conspiracy and the contents of the boxes. For example, Robinson charged $3,500 to ship a 350 pound crate and $4,000 to ship a 500 pound crate, despite the fact that his cost for shipping the crates was approximately $1.50 per pound. From this evidence, a reasonable jury could infer that Robinson was charging a premium rate for his shipping services because he knew that the boxes contained contraband. In addition, this evidence explains how Robinson was paid for his participation in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Finally, Robinson\u2019s knowledge of the conspiracy is evident from coconspirator Green\u2019s trial testimony. Green testified that he had spoken with Robinson in person about the arrests of some co-conspirators and related drug seizures. During this conversation, Robinson seemed to know what Green was talking about. In addition, Robinson explained to Green about a new shipping method that he had devised in order to help avoid future detection. The fact that Robinson and Green could openly discuss these various details of the conspiracy demonstrates Robinson\u2019s knowledge of, and participation in, the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Green also testified about one time when he brought marijuana from Ruiz to Robinson in order to be shipped. Green used the code word \u201cfood\u201d to indicate that it was marijuana, and Robinson never asked any questions about the contents of the boxes. Robinson advised Green that the shipment would cost $3,500. Green only had $2,000 but told Robinson that Ruiz would pay the rest, and Robinson agreed to this arrangement. This testimony also evinces Robinson\u2019s knowledge about Ruiz and the purpose of the conspiracy. Thus, we reject Robinson\u2019s claim that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">B. Drug Quantity at Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Robinson contends that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by enhancing his sentence based on facts \u2014 drug quantities \u2014 that were not charged in the indictment or found by the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Robinson also argues that the district court improperly calculated the weight of the marijuana because (1) it used an estimate of 50 pounds for the weight of the crates even though every crate was not weighed; and (2) it did not discount the weight of the packing materials in determining the actual weight of the marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All of Robinson\u2019s arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">First, after <em>Booker, </em>a district court is not precluded from making additional factual findings, under a preponderance-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>the-evidence standard, that go beyond the facts found by the jury, so long as it applies the Guidelines as advisory. <em>See United States v. Chau, </em>426 F.3d 1318, 1323-24 (11th Cir.2005). Accordingly, the district court did not commit <em>Booker </em>error.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Second, the district court\u2019s fact finding as to the amount of marijuana was adequately supported by the evidence and was not clearly erroneous. The district court calculated the gross weight of all shipments sent to Florida and then subtracted an average of 50 pounds per crate to estimate the net weight of the marijuana. Despite Robinson\u2019s argument, the 50 pounds per crate represented the difference between the gross weight of the shipment and the net weight of the marijuana, and therefore, accounted for both the weight of the crates and the weight of any packing material. Moreover, because the government did not seize every shipment of marijuana that Robinson was held accountable for, the district court properly used the average weight of the four crates that actually were weighed in order to estimate the net weight of marijuana included in all of the shipments. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, cmt. n. 12 (\u201cWhere there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance. In making this determination, the court may consider ... similar transactions in controlled substances by the defendant....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">C. Role Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Robinson also argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level aggravating-role enhancement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We disagree and conclude that the evidence adequately supports the role enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The Guidelines provide for a two-level increase to a defendant\u2019s offense level \u201c[i]f the defendant was an organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor in any criminal activity....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). \u201c[T]he assertion of control or influence over only one individual is enough to support a \u00a7 3Bl.l(e) enhancement.\u201d <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>224 F.3d 1243, 1251 (11th Cir. 2000); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 cmt. n. 2 (\u201cTo qualify for an adjustment under this section, the defendant must have been the organizer, leader, manager, or supervisor of one or more other participants.\u201d). Here, Robinson argues that the role enhancement was not proper because he did not manage any of the other participants in the criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-10\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s determination that Robinson had an aggravating role in the offense was not clearly erroneous. The evidence adduced at trial demonstrates that Robinson asserted control or influence over at least one other participant, namely co-conspirator Green. For example, at trial Green testified about one time in which Green brought some marijuana to Robinson in order to be crated and shipped. After Robinson looked at the boxes inside Green\u2019s vehicle, Robinson told Green that he did not do the crating at his business and \u201cdirected Green] to a location where someone would come and meet [him].\u201d Green followed Robinson\u2019s instructions and waited at the specified location. Green testified that he did not know who he was supposed to meet, and that he would \u201cjust do whatever [Robinson] say. I didn\u2019t want to hang around his business place. If he say bring it there, I just go ahead and do what I\u2019m doing.\u201d After waiting several minutes, Green <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>called Robinson to inform him that no one had come to meet him. At that point, Robinson told Green to bring the marijuana back to his business, and Green complied.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Furthermore, the evidence reflects that Robinson was in charge of the shipping methods for the conspiracy. After a co-conspirator had been arrested, Robinson decided to change the shipping method. By doing so, Robinson, in effect, directed Green and others as to the proper procedure for receiving future shipments. This new shipping method required the recipient of the marijuana shipments to go pick up the crates from the shipping company\u2019s warehouse, rather than waiting for the crates to be delivered. Green altered his receiving procedures in order to comply with Robinson\u2019s new shipping method.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Given the above evidence, which illustrates Robinson\u2019s control and influence over the actions of at least Green, we cannot say that it was clearly erroneous for the district court to find that Robinson had an aggravating role in the offense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">D. PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">Finally, we find no merit to Robinson\u2019s argument that the PSI was deficient for fading to address the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). The requirements for the contents of a PSI are set forth in Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Nothing in that rule or elsewhere requires that the PSI address every sentencing factor in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">To the extent that Robinson argues that his sentence is unreasonable, we also reject that argument. The district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range and expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors before imposing a sentence within the advisory guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that a sentence within the advisory guidelines range ordinarily is expected to be reasonable and that the party challenging the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable). Robinson has failed to show how his sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm Robinson\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">. At the sentencing hearing, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent testified that \"the difference between the gross weight that was on the bill of lading and the actual weight of the marijuana\u201d was approximately 50 pounds for each of the four crates that had been seized. Although the agent later agreed that \"the average weight of the crate was 50 pounds,\u201d it is clear from his previous testimony that this average difference of 50 pounds accounted for both the weight of the crate and any additional packing materials. Robinson objected to the district court's calculations, arguing that the government had only a couple of crates to weigh, and therefore, was just \"ballparking the amount of the weight of these crates.\u201d The district court overruled Robinson\u2019s objection, finding that \"the government has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that it is appropriate to discount the bill of lading weight ... by at least 50 pounds\u201d per crate, and that this calculation provided a fair estimate of the net weight of the marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">.
