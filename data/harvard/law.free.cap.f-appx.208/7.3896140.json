The Court has determined that the issues presented occasion no need for an opinion. <em>See </em>D.C.Cir. R. 36(b). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b31-21\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court is affirmed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>At oral argument, appellant\u2019s counsel withdrew the Rule 8(b) argument for improper joinder of defendants. Appellant\u2019s counsel also appeared to contest the conviction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) at oral argument, but as this challenge was not included in appellant\u2019s brief, we consider it waived. Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments \u2014 i.e., that the district court improperly failed to sever and that the gun charge was not supported by substantial evidence \u2014 are not borne out by the record. Appellant never moved for severance under Rule 14, and the district court did not commit plain error in allowing appellant to be tried with his co-defendant, Mr. Jordan. The gun charge under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c) was supported, in large part, by Mr. Tyree\u2019s testimony. Mr. Tyree\u2019s credibility was a jury question, and a rational trier of fact, having credited Mr. Tyree\u2019s account, could have convicted on the gun charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
