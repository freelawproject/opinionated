Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. SF0831040586-I-1, 98 M.S.P.R. 500 (M.S.P.B. Apr.25, 2005) <em>(\u201cFinal Decision </em>\u201d). After Mr. dela Cruz died, Mr. Catalasan was determined to be the proper party to pursue this appeal. We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">From April 16,1968, until his retirement on January 11, 1991, Mr. dela Cruz was employed by the Department of the Navy in the Philippines. The Standard Form 50 (\u201cSF-50\u201d) that was issued at the time of Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s retirement indicated that Mr. dela Cruz occupied a position in the excepted service and that he participated in a non-Civil Service Retirement Act (\u201cCSRA\u201d) plan. Following his retirement, Mr. dela Cruz applied for CSRS annuity benefits. Mr. dela Cruz indicated that he was seeking a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity for his nephew, Mr. Catalasan. In a reconsideration decision dated May 17, 2004, OPM affirmed its initial decision denying Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Mr. dela Cruz appealed to the Board. In an initial decision dated October 19, 2004, the administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) to whom the appeal was assigned determined that Mr. dela Cruz never qualified for CSRS annuity benefits. He therefore sustained OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision. <em>Dela Cruz v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., No. </em>SF0831040586-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Oct.19, 2004). The AJ\u2019s initial decision became the final decision of the Board on April 25, 2005, when the Board denied Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s petition for review for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d). <em>Final Decision. </em>This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-13\">Our scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>Kewley v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>153 F.3d 1357, 1361 (Fed. Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-14\">Eligibility for CSRS coverage requires that an employee complete at least five years of creditable service, and that at least one of the two years prior to separation \u201cbe subject to\u201d the CSRA, in other words, covered service. <em>Rosete v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>48 F.3d 514, 516 (Fed.Cir. 1995) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333(a)-(b)). Covered service includes only an appointment that is subject to the CSRS and for which an employee must deposit part of his pay into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Noveloso v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>45 M.S.P.R. 321, 323 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-15\">Substantial evidence supports the Board\u2019s finding that none of Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s service was covered under the CSRS. Mr. dela Cruz served under two separate appointments: the first effective April 15, 1968 and the second effective October 27, 1974. Both appointments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>were described as \u201cExc Appt\u201d without limitation. The first appointment did not have a SF-50 and was only documented by a \u201ctranscript of employment record as extracted from Official Personnel Folder (OPF) of Dionisio J. dela Cruz.\u201d The Board determined that this could be indicative of CSRS coverage but alone was not sufficient to carry petitioner\u2019s burden. For the second appointment, the Board pointed out that the SF-50 indicated a temporary appointment. Under 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201, such an appointment is excluded from CSRS coverage. Further, the SF-50 for the second appointment described Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s retirement coverage as \u201cnone.\u201d The Board also based its decision on the January 10, 1991 SF-50 that was issued in connection with Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s retirement. That SF-50 described Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s retirement coverage as \u201cother\u201d and stated that he was entitled to a retirement payment in accordance with Filipino Employment Personnel Instructions. Receipt of retirement pay under a plan other than the CSRS reflects that an employee\u2019s service is not covered under the CSRS. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8333(b); <em>DeGuzman v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>231 Ct.Cl. 1005 (1982) (per curiam); <em>Reyes v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>60 M.S.P.R. 172, 175 (1993), <em>aff'd, </em>29 F.3d 645 (Fed.Cir.1994) (Table). Finally, there is no documentation in the record indicating that any contributions to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund were withheld from Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s pay. The lack of such evidence is an indication that Mr. dela Cruz was not covered by the CSRS. <em>Rosete, </em>48 F.3d at 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">It is true, as the Board noted, that the summary of Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s employment history states that Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s 1968 and 1974 appointments both were excepted appointments without limitation. However, we see no error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that the summary of Mr. dela Cruz\u2019s employment was, in the face of the evidence outlined above, insufficient to establish that Mr. Dela\u2019s employment with the Navy was covered by the CSRS. We have considered all of Mr. Catalasan\u2019s other arguments and have found them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
