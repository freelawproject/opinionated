United States District Judge William Walls sentenced Burton after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release. This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We exercise appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327-28 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-11\">Burton contends that his sentence should be vacated and that this matter should be remanded for resentencing because the District Court failed to follow the proper procedures at resentencing. He asserts that the Court did not make a determination as to the appropriate guideline range. In addition, Burton contends that in imposing sentence the District Court failed to consider the various factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). In Burton\u2019s view, the Court \u201csimply\u201d sentenced him to the maximum period of sixty months.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-15\">In <em>United States v. Gunter, </em>462 F.3d 237 (3d Cir.2006), we instructed that post-<em>Booker </em>\u201cdistrict courts must follow a three step sentencing process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247. The first step requires calculating the applicable guideline range. Second, the district court must formally rule on any motions of the parties and requests for departure. In the final step, the district court must \u201cexercise [its] discretion by considering the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors in setting the sentence they impose regardless whether it varies from the sentence calculated under the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329) (internal quotation marks and ellipses omitted). Here, Burton takes issue with steps two and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-16\">We find no error by the District Court at step two in the sentencing process which would warrant vacating his sentence and remanding for resentencing. The District Court did not, as Burton points out, finish its computation of the guideline range as it failed to rule on the government\u2019s request for enhancements on the basis of Burton\u2019s role in the offense and an obstruction of justice. It explained, however, that Burton\u2019s guideline range, even without these enhancements, already exceeded the statutory maximum of sixty months. Because Burton could not be sentenced to more than sixty months, the District Court did not commit reversible error by abbreviating the process and correctly declaring that the guideline range was sixty months, consistent with the statutory maximum.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-17\">Nor do we find any merit to Burton\u2019s assertion that the District Court erred at step three in the sentencing pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>cess by sentencing Burton to the maximum of sixty months. The Court specifically noted Burton\u2019s age, his above average intelligence, and his ability to pull off the fraudulent scheme that resulted in a loss, as found by the jury, of $1.8 million. The Court further noted Burton\u2019s criminal history, as well as his ability to con people. Based on reasoned consideration of these factors, the District Court declared that this offense deserved jail time. In fact, the Court found that this offense was egregious and it expressed its hope that the punishment would make Burton realize, consistent with his remarks during his allocution, that he had erred and neglected his family. The District Court\u2019s comments clearly demonstrate consideration of the need to protect the public, to impose adequate deterrence, and to reflect the seriousness of the crime. Because the District Court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration to the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d as required by <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 329, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
