Citing our precedent under <em>United States v. Booker,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>McConnell asserts that the district court erred by increasing his sentence based upon facts that were neither proven to a jury nor admitted by him. Because he did not raise the objection below, we review this issue for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> McConnell must demonstrate (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If these conditions are satisfied, we may exercise our discretion to correct the error if it \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">The district court increased McConnell\u2019s sentence based upon a factual finding and under the belief that the Sentencing Guidelines were mandatory, so the error is plain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, McConnell has failed to show that \u201cthe sentencing judge\u2014 sentencing under an advisory scheme rather than a mandatory one \u2014 would have reached a significantly different result.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> McConnell\u2019s best evidence is from the sentencing hearing, where the district court remarked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-20\">If I sentence you for less than the guidelines, under the present system, [the AUSA] has to report me to the Attorney General. And the Attorney General has to report me to the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and Senate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Judiciary Committee and say that Judge Stagg departed downward without legal authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">However, the very same Judge, in denying McConnell\u2019s motion for release pending appeal, rejected his <em>Booker </em>arguments, reasoning that \u201cthere is no indication that McConnell\u2019s sentence would have been different under an advisory guidelines scheme as opposed to a mandatory one.\u201d We hold that this most recent statement by the district court is dispositive of the substantial-rights question. This holding follows <em>Smith, </em>where we held that such a statement, made in the context of a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, indicated \u201cthe indisputable message\u201d that \u201cthe court stands by its original sentence, even after <em>Booker.\u201d </em><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because McConnell has failed to show that the error affected his substantial rights, he cannot demonstrate that the district court committed plain error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b363-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
