O\u2019Connor petitions for review of the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) that sustained the reconsideration decision of the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d) denying his application for disability retirement under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). <em>O\u2019Connor v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. PH-0831-05-0173-I-1, 102 M.S.P.R. 236 (M.S.P.B. Mar.29, 2006). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b959-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b959-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">Mr. O\u2019Connor, a former employee of the United States Postal Service, applied to OPM for disability retirement on May 22, 2003, several years after he left his employment with the Postal Service. In his application, Mr. O\u2019Connor stated that he suffered from a number of disabling conditions, both mental and physical. In a reconsideration decision dated December 20, 2004, OPM denied the application. Mr. O\u2019Connor timely appealed to the Board, where the case was assigned to an administrative law judge (\u201cAJ\u201d). Following a telephonic hearing, the AJ rendered an initial decision sustaining OPM\u2019s reconsideration decision. <em>O\u2019Connor v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. PH-0831-05-0173-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Sept.7, 2005) <em>(Initial Decision). </em>The AJ\u2019s initial decision became the final decision of the Board on March 29, 2006, when the Board denied Mr. O\u2019Connor\u2019s petition for review for failure to meet the criteria for review set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113(d). This appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">Our review of decisions denying applications for disability retirement is narrowly circumscribed. Under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8347(c), OPM\u2019s factual determinations regarding an applicant\u2019s disability are \u201cfinal and conclusive and not subject to review.\u201d <em>See Brenneman v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>439 F.3d 1325, 1327 (Fed.Cir. 2006). In <em>Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985), the Supreme Court held that our review in disability cases is limited to determining whether \u201cthere has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620; see also <em>Pitsker v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>234 F.3d 1378, 1380-81 (Fed.Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">Other than generally challenging the findings of OPM and the Board with respect to his claimed disabilities \u2014 matters which we may not review \u2014 Mr. O\u2019Connor argues that the Board failed to take into account the Social Security Administration\u2019s (\u201cSSA\u2019s\u201d) determination that he was disabled, which it was required to do. <em>See Trevan v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>69 F.3d 520, 526 (Fed.Cir.1995). We understand Mr. O\u2019Connor to be making an argument of harmful procedural error, which we may review. We reject the argument, however. Although Mr. O\u2019Connor failed to present any documentation showing SSA\u2019s determination, <em>see Initial Decision, </em>slip op. at 15, the AJ assumed for purposes of the appeal that SSA had made such a determination. The AJ found, however, that any such determination was outweighed by the evidence before him. A determination by SSA that an individual is disabled does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>establish entitlement to CSRS disability benefits as a matter of law. <em>Trevan, </em>69 F.3d at 526. Because the Board considered the appeal based upon the assumption that the SSA had found Mr. O\u2019Connor to be disabled, there was no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the final decision of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
