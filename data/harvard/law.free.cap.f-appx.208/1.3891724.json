R.App. P. 34(a)(2); D.C.Cir. Rule 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b25-20\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the district court\u2019s order filed June 15, 2006, be affirmed. The district court correctly determined it could not grant habeas relief. <em>See </em>D.C.Code 23-110(g) (foreclosing federal court review of a Superior Court sentence \u201cunless it also appears that the remedy by motion [in Superior Court] is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention\u201d). In addition, the district court correctly concluded appellees, who are former and current attorneys from the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, are immune from appellant\u2019s damage claim for wrongful actions appellees allegedly had taken during their prosecution of appellant. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 431, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976) (\u2018We hold ... that in initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State\u2019s case, the prosecutor is immune from a civil suit for damages under \u00a7 1983.\u201d); <em>Wagshal v. Foster; </em>28 F.3d 1249, 1252 (D.C.Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b25-22\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
