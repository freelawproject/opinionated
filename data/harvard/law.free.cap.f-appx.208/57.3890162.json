We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural background and issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">Because the government concedes the appealability of the restitution order notwithstanding a waiver of certain appeal rights in Gjidija\u2019s plea agreement, we need not reach this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-13\">Gjidija contends that in ordering restitution, the district court was required to consider [i] the amount of loss sustained by each victim, [ii] Gjidija\u2019s financial resources, and [iii] other compensation received by the victims. Because Gjidija failed to raise his objections in the district court\u2019s sentencing proceedings, the restitution order is reviewed only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Boyd, </em>222 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.2000) <em>(per curiam).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-14\">As Gjidija\u2019s were indisputably crimes of violence, a restitution order was mandatory. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a)(1)(A) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16)). \u2018When restitution is mandatory, the amount of restitution can only be challenged on the ground that it does not reflect the losses to victims.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>302 F.3d 72, 75 (2d Cir. 2002) <em>(per curiam). </em>Moreover, [ii] and [iii] are statutorily barred from consideration. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
