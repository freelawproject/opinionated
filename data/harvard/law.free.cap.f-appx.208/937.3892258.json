The Merit Systems Protection Board (Board) affirmed. <em>Larry Thompson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>SF-844E-05-0638-I-1, 101 M.S.P.R. 582 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 3, 2006) <em>(Final Order) </em>affirming <em>Larry Thompson v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>SF-844E-05-0638-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Oct. 18, 2005) <em>(Initial Decision). </em>Because this court does not review factual determinations in disability retirement cases, <em>Lindahl v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>470 U.S. 768, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985), this court <em>dismisses </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-17\">The Veterans Administration (VA) employed Mr. Thompson for approximately fifteen years as a social services assistant. Earlier he held positions as a housekeeping aid, housekeeping aid leader, and health technician with the VA. Two days after Mr. Thompson voluntarily absented himself from his employment, he applied for disability benefits, claiming he suffered from post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to his military service in Viet Nam.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-18\">OPM denied his request for disability because he did not meet the applicable criteria. In particular, Mr. Thompson did not have any notable performance deficiencies at the time of his voluntary departure from the VA. Further, OPM did not find any definitive medical evidence indicating that Mr. Thompson was unable to perform his work duties as a result of his mental illness. Mr. Thompson requested reconsideration. OPM affirmed its earlier decision on April 25, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-19\">Mr. Thompson appealed OPM\u2019s decisions to the Board. The administrative judge found no evidence in the record from any treating physician specifically describing any duties that Mr. Thompson was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>incapable of performing. <em>Initial Decision, </em>slip. op. 5. Rather, at the time of his retirement, his job performance was satisfactory and his supervisor had voiced no complaints. <em>Id. </em>While the administrative judge noted Mr. Thompson\u2019s PTSD diagnosis, the record did not show that Mr. Thompson\u2019s mental condition rendered him incapable of performing his job duties. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Thus, the administrative judge found that the medical evidence did not support a finding of disability. <em>Id. </em>The Board affirmed. <em>Final Order, </em>slip. op. 2, 101 M.S.P.R. 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">Section 8461 of Title 5 governs disability retirement appeals such as Mr. Thompson\u2019s. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8461(d). This court has held that it is \u201cprecluded by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8461(d) from reviewing the factual underpinnings of physical disability determinations, but may address whether there has been \u201ca substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error \u2018going to the heart of the administrative determination.\u2019 \u201d \u201d <em>Anthony v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>58 F.3d 620, 626 (Fed.Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620.) This standard applies to reviews of disability determinations under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) as well as the FERS. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Anthony, </em>this court noted that the Supreme Court in <em>Lindahl </em>preserved \u201cjudicial review of factual findings regarding the mental condition of involuntarily retired employees.\u201d 58 F.3d at 625. However as noted above, Mr. Thompson\u2019s departure was voluntary. Thus, this court\u2019s review is limited. <em>Id. </em>at 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">On appeal, Mr. Thompson argues that the Board did not consider a letter from a specific physician because it was mailed to the wrong place. He further suggested that this evidence would have affected the outcome of the Board\u2019s determination. However, this court cannot consider new evidence that was not before the Board. <em>Cruz v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>934 F.2d 1240, 1245 n. 6 (Fed.Cir.1991). The remainder of Mr. Thompson\u2019s arguments appear to challenge the correctness of the Board\u2019s factual determinations of nondisability. This court cannot discern that the Board made any legal or procedural errors. This court lacks jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s factual determinations. <em>Baker v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>782 F.2d 993, 994 (Fed.Cir.1986) (\u201c[Petitioner] wants us to review the record to determine whether there was substantial evidence supporting the MSPB nondisability determination. That, of course, we have no jurisdiction to do.\u201d). As such, this court must dismiss the petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
