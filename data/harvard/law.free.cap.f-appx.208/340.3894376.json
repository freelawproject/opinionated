He argues for the first time on appeal that his November 1986 drug trafficking conviction was not a qualifying conviction for purposes of the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Our review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 358 (2005). The career offender enhancement is to be made only if the prior offense occurred within 15 years of the commission of the instant offense or if any part of the prior sentence was served during that same time period. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e). Because there was insufficient information contained in the record from which the district court could have concluded that Loston\u2019s November 1986 qualified him for the career offender enhancement, the district court plainly erred in applying the enhancement. This error affected Loston\u2019s substantial rights and affected the fairness and integrity of the judicial proceedings. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 275 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). The government agrees with Loston that his sentence should be vacated and remanded for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">Loston\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b365-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
