Petitioner Jing Ni appeals from an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) entered on November 12, 2002, adopting a November 14, 2000 decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Alan Vomacka. On appeal, the primary issue before this Court concerns the IJ\u2019s finding that Ni\u2019s application was frivolous, a finding that could have broad ranging implications for relief available to Ni under the immigration laws. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(6); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.20; <em>Liu v. U.S. Dep\u2019t. of Justice, </em>455 F.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir.2006). Ni\u2019s brief does not address the IJ\u2019s decision denying petitioner\u2019s request for asylum, withholding of removal, or Convention Against Torture relief. Thus, we address only the finding of a frivolous application.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">As a preliminary matter, Ni suggests that the IJ erred by not providing the requisite warnings regarding the filing of a frivolous application. Section 1158(d)(4) states in part that \u201c[a]t the time of filing an application for asylum, the Attorney General shall ... advise the alien of ... the consequences ... of knowingly filing a frivolous application for asylum.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(d)(4); see <em>also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.3(c)(5) (\u201c[k]nowingly filing a frivolous application ... so long as the applicant has received the notice required by section 208(d)(4) of the Act, shall render the applicant permanently ineligible for any benefits under the Act pursuant to \u00a7 208.20.\u201d). Before Ni signed her application for asylum, the IJ provided both written and oral warnings of the consequences of filing a frivolous application. As such, we find this contention without merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">Ni then challenges the IJ\u2019s finding that her application was frivolous. Although in <em>Liu </em>we noted emergent principles for reviewing findings of frivolousness, we remanded that case to the BIA with instructions to \u201cset down clear and explicit standards by which frivolousness decisions may be judged.\u201d <em>Liu, </em>455 F.3d at 116. Without these standards, it is difficult for us to evaluate the IJ\u2019s decision in this case. Therefore, we grant Ni\u2019s petition and remand the case to the BIA to reconsider the frivolousness finding, using standards developed in response to <em>Liu.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">As we remand the case to the BIA to evaluate whether Ni\u2019s application was frivolous, we need not address petitioner\u2019s further argument that her due process rights were violated by the IJ\u2019s purported failure to properly and fairly determine that her application was frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">Accordingly, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s decision is VACATED in part, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-10\">. Ni contends that as a minor she was entitled to \"extra caution and guidance\u201d from the IJ on the consequences of filing a frivolous application. We express no opinion on this contention. We simply note that, though Ni was seventeen years old when she entered the country, she was \u201cabout 18 and a half years old\u201d when the IJ heard her testimony; she was not a minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
