After review, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-23\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b783-24\">Esquivel-Arellano, a native and citizen of Mexico, came to the United States illegally in about 1992 and resided in Atlanta, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>Georgia. In 1995, he received a federal misdemeanor conviction for illegal entry into the United States and was deported to Mexico. In 1999, Esquivel-Arellano was convicted in Georgia state court of aggravated stalking, a felony offense, and was again deported to Mexico. In November 2005, a Florida deputy sheriff stopped Esquivel-Arellano for a traffic violation and discovered that he had an active immigration warrant for his arrest. After Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) agents took Esquivel-Arellano into custody, Esquivel-Arellano admitted that he was in the United States illegally and already had been deported twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">Esquivel-Arellano was charged with one count of unlawfully reentering the United States after having been convicted of an aggravated felony (his Georgia aggravated stalking conviction) and subsequently deported. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). The government filed a notice of penalties and factual basis for his \u00a7 1326(a) offense, notifying Esquivel-Arellano that he was subject to the maximum term of imprisonment of 20 years, pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b)(2), as a result of his Georgia felony conviction for aggravated stalking. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">Esquivel-Arellano waived his right to a jury trial. After a bench trial, the district court found Esquivel-Arellano guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Esquivel-Arellano a base offense level of 8 pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSI recommended: (1) a 16-level increase, pursuant to \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(1)(A), because Esquivel-Arellano previously had been deported after being convicted of aggravated stalking, which the PSI concluded was a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d and (2) a 2-level reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), for acceptance of responsibility.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With a total offense level of 22 and a criminal history category of II, Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s advisory guidelines range was 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Esquivel-Arellano objected to the 16-level enhancement that was based on the characterization of his Georgia aggravated stalking conviction as a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Esquivel-Arellano also argued that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326 was unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and that enhancing his sentence based on his prior aggravated stalking conviction violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">The district court overruled Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s objections and concluded that \u00a7 1326 was constitutional. The district court adopted the PSI\u2019s guidelines calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-12\">In mitigation, Esquivel-Arellano submitted various exhibits, including a letter from his ex-wife, Shannon Cohran, explaining her role in Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s aggravated stalking conviction. In an effort to take revenge on Esquivel-Arellano, Cohran had asked him to come over so they could \u201cwork things out,\u201d knowing that this would violate a protective order and increase the stalking charge to a felony. Cohran regretted the way she had treated her ex-husband. Esquivel-Arellano also included several letters from family and friends attesting to his good character. Noting that he was an outstanding and productive member of the community, Esquivel-Arellano asked the district court to consider Cohran\u2019s letter in mitigation of the 16-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>The district court acknowledged Cohran\u2019s story and considered her \u201crecantation\u201d under the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factor of history and characteristics of the defendant. The district court also stated that it had read and was impressed by the letters submitted and that Esquivel-Arellano did not fit the profile of someone with a criminal history category of II. The district court noted, however, that Esquivel-Arellano had entered the country illegally three times. The district court sentenced Esquivel-Arellano to 36 months\u2019 imprisonment, a sentence below his advisory guidelines range of 46 to 57 months. Esquivel-Arellano filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">A. Challenge to Constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), an alien who is convicted of illegal reentry into the United States following removal is subject to a statutory maximum sentence of two years. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). However, under \u00a7 1326(b)(2), if the alien was convicted of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d prior to his removal, the statutory maximum sentence is twenty years. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statutory definition of an \u201caggravated felony\u201d includes not only a laundry list of offenses, such as murder, rape, drug trafficking, money laundering, felony theft, child pornography, racketeering, alien smuggling and passport forgery, but also any \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(43).</p>\n<p id=\"b785-14\">Esquivel-Arellano argues that \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi </em>because it authorizes the district court to increase a defendant\u2019s statutory maximum sentence based on judge-found facts about a prior conviction, namely the characterization of the prior conviction as an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, there is no <em>Apprendi </em>error because the Supreme Court exempted prior convictions from its <em>Apprendi </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-15\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2363-64. In so holding, the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>preme Court declined to revisit its earlier decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which held that a prior conviction that increases a defendant\u2019s penalty need not be charged in the indictment or proven to a jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 489-90, 120 S.Ct. at 2362. In the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent opinions extending <em>Apprendi, </em>including <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) , it has continued to exempt prior convictions from indictment and jury-proof requirements of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. Recently, in a concurring opinion in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), Justice Thomas observed that \u201ca majority of the Court now recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was wrongly decided,\u201d and suggested that the Supreme Court reconsider the prior conviction exception \u201cin an appropriate case.\u201d 544 U.S. at 27-28, 125 S.Ct. at 1264 (Thomas, J., concurring). Nonetheless, as this Court repeatedly has explained since <em>Shepard, </em>we are bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>unless and until it is explicitly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir. 2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">In an attempt to circumvent the <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>rule, Esquivel-Arellano argues that it applies only to the fact of conviction, i.e. its existence, and not to whether his prior conviction is an \u201caggravated felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1326(b)(2). However, this Court has also repeatedly rejected that claim. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264-65 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1274-75; <em>Gibson, </em>434 F.3d at 1248; <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">B. Double Jeopardy Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b786-12\">We also reject Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s contention that the district court violated the Double Jeopardy Clause by enhancing his sentence based on his prior aggravated stalking conviction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall \u201cbe subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against \u201cthe imposition of multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowd, </em>451 F.3d 1244, 1251 (11th Cir.2006). Sentencing enhancements for prior criminal conduct, however, do not amount to a second punishment for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See Monge v. California, </em>524 U.S. 721, 727-34, 118 S.Ct. 2246, 2250-53, 141 L.Ed.2d 615 (1998) (concluding that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not apply in the non-capital sentencing context); <em>Witte v. United States, </em>515 U.S. 389, 398-401, 115 S.Ct. 2199, 2205-07, 132 L.Ed.2d 351 (1995) (concluding that \u201cconsideration of information about the defendant\u2019s character and conduct at sentencing does not result in \u2018punishment\u2019 for any offense other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>the one of which the defendant was convicted\u201d); <em>United States v. Carey, </em>943 F.2d 44, 46-47 &amp; n. 4 (11th Cir.1991) (explaining that, while \u201c[ejnhancement of a sentence based on criminal conduct other than that underlying the instant conviction has the practical effect of penalizing the defendant for that conduct ..., it is not considered \u2018punishment\u2019 for that conduct in the double jeopardy context because the court is sentencing the defendant only for the instant offense, which is considered more serious because of the defendant\u2019s other criminal conduct\u201d). Accordingly, the district court did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause by enhancing Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s sentence based on his prior conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">C. 16-level Increase Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 16-level offense level enhancement if the defendant was removed after having been convicted of a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). The Application Notes to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1) provide that a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is \u201cany offense under ... state ... law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, cmt. n. l(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-8\">At sentencing, the district court concluded that Georgia\u2019s crime of aggravated stalking has as an element the threatened use of physical force and is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L 1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). Consequently, the district court increased Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s offense level by 16 levels. On appeal, Esquivel-Arellano argues that this guidelines enhancement was error.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-14\">Courts generally apply a categorical approach when determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d), which means the court may \u201clook only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>See Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600-02, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2159-60, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (applying the categorical approach in the ACCA context). In <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936 (11th Cir.1995), this Court examined the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.2 and pointed out that, while the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Taylor </em>often will guide our decision about qualifying offenses under the guidelines, the guidelines commentary rejects its \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and expressly allows sentencing courts to look behind state convictions, albeit to a limited extent. <em>Spell, </em>44 F.3d at 939.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nonetheless, this Court recently indicated a categorical approach also \u201cgenerally\u201d applies to determining whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense for enhancement purposes under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A). <em>See United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-15\">In any event, where the judgment of conviction and the criminal statute are ambiguous and it is impossible to determine if the prior conviction qualifies, the district courts, in both ACCA and guidelines de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>terminations, may look to the facts underlying a prior conviction to determine whether it qualifies. <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d at 1273, 1275-76 (concluding that Florida statute is ambiguous and looking to facts of case to determine whether prior conviction qualified for 12-level enhancement in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) for drug trafficking offenses). In examining those facts, the district court is generally limited to examining the charging documents, jury instructions, a bench-trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, the terms of a plea agreement, a transcript of the plea colloquy or other comparable judicial records. <em>Shepard, </em>544 U.S. at 19-20, 26, 125 S.Ct. at 1259-60, 1263; <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">Here, we conclude that Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s conviction and Georgia\u2019s aggravated stalking statute in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-91 are ambiguous. Section 16-5-91 makes it a felony to follow, place under surveillance or contact another person in violation of a court order and without their consent for the purposes of \u201charassing or intimidating\u201d that person:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">A person commits the offense of aggravated stalking when such person, in violation of a bond to keep the peace posted pursuant to Code Section 17-6-110, temporary restraining order, temporary protective order, permanent restraining order, permanent protective order, preliminary injunction, good behavior bond, or permanent injunction or condition of pretrial release, condition of probation, or condition of parole in effect prohibiting the behavior described in this subsection, follows, places under surveillance, or contacts another person at or about a place or places without the consent of the other person for the purpose of harassing and intimidating the other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-91(a). \u201cHarassing and intimidating\u201d is defined in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-90 as willful conduct that places persons in reasonable fear for their or their family member\u2019s safety by a pattern of harassing and intimidating behavior that serves no legitimate purposes, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">For purposes of this article, the term \u201charassing and intimidating\u201d means a knowing and willful course of conduct directed at a specific person which causes emotional distress by placing such person in reasonable fear for such person\u2019s safety or the safety of a member of his or her immediate family, by establishing a pattern of harassing and intimidating behavior, and which serves no legitimate purpose.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">O.C.G.A. \u00a7 16-5-90. However, \u00a7 16-5-90 adds, \u201cThis Code section shall not be construed to require that an overt threat of death or bodily injury has been made.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">The definition of \u201charassing and intimidating\u201d is drafted broadly enough that a defendant can be convicted under \u00a7 16-5-91(a) with or without the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v. Smith, </em>260 Ga.App. 722, 580 S.E.2d 674 (2003) (affirming stalking conviction where defendant repeatedly placed victim \u201cunder surveillance, took pictures of her and shouted at her\u201d); <em>Johnson v. State, </em>264 Ga.App. 889, 592 S.E.2d 507 (2003) (affirming aggravated stalking conviction where defendant twice knocked on victim\u2019s door and shouted that he wanted to talk with her and broke a window); <em>Stevens v. State, </em>261 Ga.App. 73, 581 S.E.2d 685 (2003) (affirming aggravated stalking conviction where defendant continuously telephoned victim and appeared uninvited at victim\u2019s apartment and demanded entrance).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">Thus, Georgia\u2019s aggravated stalking statute prohibits a wide range of conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>and a \u00a7 16-5-91 conviction is not necessarily for a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(n). Rather, whether an aggravated stalking conviction under Georgia\u2019s statute qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii) depends on the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Here, the record is silent as to the underlying facts of Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s aggravated stalking conviction because the government did not submit any supporting court documents. The district court considered only the statute in applying the 16-level guidelines enhancement. Because Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s aggravated stalking conviction was not necessarily for a crime of violence, the district court erred in applying the 16-level enhancement based solely on the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Accordingly, we vacate and remand to the district court for the limited purpose of resentencing Esquivel-Arellano without the 16-level enhancement. On remand, the district court shall consider Esquivel-Arellano\u2019s correctly calculated advisory guidelines range of 8 to 14 months\u2019 imprisonment and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining a reasonable sentence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-7\">. The PSI explained that Esquivel-Arellano was eligible for a two-level acceptance of responsibility reduction because, although Esquivel-Arellano proceeded to trial, he stipulated to facts that satisfied the elements of the offense and asserted only issues that did not relate to his factual guilt in order to preserve them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b785-8\">.
