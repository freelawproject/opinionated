The district court sentenced him to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 one month less than the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. Peyla has filed a notice of appeal, but his appointed counsel informs us that he is unable to discern a nonfrivolous basis for the appeal and moves to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Because counsel\u2019s supporting brief is facially adequate and Peyla has not responded to his attorney\u2019s motion, <em>see </em>Cir. R. 51(b), we review only the potential issues that counsel has identified. <em>See United States v. Tabb, </em>125 F.3d 583, 584 (7th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-14\">As an initial matter, counsel informs us that Peyla does not want his guilty plea vacated, so counsel appropriately avoids any discussion about the voluntariness of the plea or the adequacy of the colloquy. <em>See United States v. Knox, </em>287 F.3d 667, 670-71 (7th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-15\">As far as potential arguments for the appeal, counsel first considers whether Peyla could challenge the two-level increase for obstruction of justice. In order to mount a successful challenge, Peyla would have to establish that his testimony at the sentencing hearing \u2014 which the district court discredited \u2014 was actually truthful. Peyla testified that he first became involved in the conspiracy on its very last day of operation and that he was responsible for only the amount of marijuana he handled that day \u2014 less than 50 pounds\u2014 and not for the several thousands of kilograms possessed by his co-defendants during the course of the conspiracy. He maintained that if his barn and his auto body repair shop were used to store marijuana prior to that date, it was without his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>knowledge, and he denied that he was paid for his role in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">It would be frivolous for Peyla to argue that this testimony was truthful. Three of Peyla\u2019s co-defendants \u2014 Jack Williams, Edward Trober, and Thomas Dukeman \u2014 testified at the sentencing hearing, and they contradicted Peyla\u2019s story. Their testimony indicated that the marijuana was stored in Peyla\u2019s shop and barn with his knowledge, that he helped load vehicles with large sums of money and unload vehicles containing drugs, and that he was paid for his involvement. Because Peyla lied repeatedly about matters that related directly to the offense of conviction, the district court\u2019s decision to impose the obstruction of justice enhancement was justified. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 cmt. nn. 2 &amp; 4(f); <em>United States v. Sharp, </em>436 F.3d 730, 736-38 (7th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Second, counsel considers whether Peyla could challenge the district court\u2019s refusal to allow a reduction for acceptance of responsibility and concludes that Peyla\u2019s obstruction of justice would render such a challenge futile. Although we have held that some defendants who obstruct justice may nevertheless qualify in \u201cextraordinary cases\u201d for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 cmt. n. 4; <em>United States v. Travis, </em>294 F.3d 837, 840 (7th Cir.2002) (\u201c[O]bstruction-of-jus-tice and acceptance-of-responsibility adjustments are not always mutually exclusive.\u201d), Peyla\u2019s situation does not present one of these \u201cextraordinary cases.\u201d The reduction may be appropriate where a <em>de minimis </em>obstruction early in an investigation is followed quickly by acceptance of responsibility. <em>See United States v. Buckley, </em>192 F.3d 708, 711 (7th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Lallemand, </em>989 F.2d 936, 938 (7th Cir.1993). But as we have already noted, the district court justifiably concluded that Peyla falsely minimized his role in the offense and falsely denied the extent of his relevant conduct right up until the moment he was sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">Third, counsel considers whether Peyla could challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was responsible for more than 1000 but less than 3000 kilograms of marijuana, a finding which we will uphold unless clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Marty, </em>450 F.3d 687, 689 (7th Cir.2006). The district court\u2019s estimate was conservative and amply supported by testimony from Williams, Trober, and Dukeman. The only evidence that suggests that Peyla was responsible for a lesser quantity is his own self-serving and discredited testimony, and thus challenging the quantity finding on appeal would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">Fourth, counsel asks whether Peyla could challenge the district court\u2019s denial of a minimal- or minor-role reduction, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, because Peyla was less culpable than some of his co-defendants. It is Peyla\u2019s burden to show that he was entitled to a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2, <em>see United States v. Corral, </em>324 F.3d 866, 874 (7th Cir.2003), and Peyla cannot meet this burden by pointing to his false testimony minimizing his role. The credible testimony of Peyla\u2019s co-defendants showed that Peyla allowed his business and barn to be used to store large shipments of marijuana; participated in loading and unloading drugs and money; helped to build false compartments in vehicles to conceal money and drugs; and was paid for it. Given this level of involvement, any argument that the district court incorrectly denied a reduction under \u00a7 3B1.2 would be frivolous. <em>See Corral, </em>324 F.3d at 874 (7th Cir.2003) (holding that \u00a7 3B1.2 reduction was not justified for defendant who allowed apartment to be used as a \u201cstash house\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Fifth, counsel considers whether Peyla could challenge the district court\u2019s finding that he was not eligible for the \u201csafety valve,\u201d which allows certain nonviolent, first-time drug offenders to avoid application of statutory mandatory minimum sentences, <em>if </em>they cooperate with the government before sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.2(a). Peyla bears the burden of proving his eligibility for the safety valve by a preponderance of evidence. <em>See United States v. Montes, </em>381 F.3d 631, 634 (7th Cir.2004). Apparently, Peyla attempted to proffer information to the government on one occasion, but the agent cut the meeting short on the belief that Peyla was lying about his role in the conspiracy. We agree with counsel that Peyla cannot demonstrate that he is eligible for the safety valve based on this single unfruitful meeting with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Finally, counsel considers whether it would be frivolous to challenge the reasonableness of Peyla\u2019s sentence in light of the sentencing factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Peyla presented several arguments for a below-guidelines sentence before the district court, but only one merits discussion. Peyla argued that a within-guidelines sentence would create an unjust \u201cdisparity\u2019 because Peyla would receive a greater sentence than Trober, the conspiracy\u2019s \u201ckingpin.\u201d But we agree with the district court that any disparity was \u201cself-inflicted.\u201d Had Peyla admitted his role in the conspiracy \u2014 thereby presumably avoiding the enhancement for obstruction of justice and qualifying for a reduction for acceptance of responsibility \u2014 his guidelines range would have been much lower. We find no error in the district court\u2019s refusal to adjust Peyla\u2019s sentence downward based on this \u201cdisparity.\u201d After considering Peyla\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced him to 150 months\u2019 imprisonment, one month below the guidelines range. We find nothing unreasonable in that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">Therefore, we GRANT the motion to withdraw and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
