Reeves, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b425-22\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b425-23\">Appellant, Attorney Steven W. Reifman, appeals the district court\u2019s order awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and imposing sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1927 and order denying the motion for reconsideration. After a careful review of the record, we are convinced that the district court did not err in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to the attorneys for the PlaintiffAppellee and imposing sanctions against Attorney Reifman. Likewise, we conclude that the district court did not err in denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-24\">Because the district court\u2019s opinions accurately set out the law governing the issues raised and clearly state the reasons for the conclusions, issuance of a more lengthy opinion by this Court would serve no useful purpose. Accordingly, for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s opinions, we AFFIRM the order of the district court awarding fees and costs and imposing sanctions and order denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
