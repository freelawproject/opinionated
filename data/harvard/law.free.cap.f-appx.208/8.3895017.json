R. 34(j). It is</p>\n<p id=\"b32-18\">ORDERED AND ADJUDGED that the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Appellant\u2019s arguments \u2014 i.e., involuntary waiver of the right to counsel, improper refusal to postpone proceedings, and improper refusal to grant a new trial \u2014 find no support in the record. The record makes clear that appellant\u2019s decision to represent himself was not the product of a dispute with counsel over trial strategy. Moreover, the record reveals that the district court repeatedly engaged in extensive <em>Faretta </em>inquiries that were sufficient to establish the knowing and voluntary nature of appellant\u2019s decision to forgo counsel. Appellant\u2019s remaining arguments are even more insubstantial. The district court\u2019s denial of a continuance to secure testimony from an expert firearm witness was not prejudicial because appellant neither proferred any admissible, favorable evidence that could have been introduced after the continuance, nor established any evidentiary predicate for his antique gun <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>defense that would allow the expert witness to answer questions about his use of such a weapon. Lastly, appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial under Rule 83 was largely predicated on his waiver argument, and the denial of that motion was well within the district court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
