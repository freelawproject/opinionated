Abbas, </em>208 Fed. Appx. 552 (9th Cir.2006), were companion cases for the purpose of oral argument. These cases will be decided separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b575-16\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-17\">Defendant John Campbell (\u201cCampbell\u201d), convicted by a jury of charges arising out of a scheme masterminded by his co-defendants in which the participants used fraudulently obtained credit to purchase computer merchandise from wholesale computer companies and resold the merchandise at a profit without repaying the credit extended to them, appeals his 48-month sentence on the grounds that the district court wrongly: (1) applied a two-point Guidelines enhancement for use of sophisticated means; (2) rejected a two-point Guidelines reduction for acceptance of responsibility; and (3) imposed a harsher sentence than that ultimately received by his more culpable co-defendants, who were sentenced to prison terms of 21 months and 41 months, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-18\">The district court did not err in applying a two-point enhancement for use of sophisticated means. This enhancement applies whenever \u201cthe <em>offense </em>... involved sophisticated means,\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C) (emphasis added), and the Sentencing Commission has clarified that \u201coffense\u201d in this context refers to \u201cthe overall offense conduct for which the defendant is accountable,\u201d not \u201cthe personal conduct of the defendant,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2T1.1 hist, notes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>(1998 Amends.). Accordingly, the \u201csophisticated means\u201d enhancement was properly applied to Campbell \u2014 who was convicted of a conspiracy involving the use of shell companies, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 2Bl.l(b)(9)(C), cmt. n. 8-even if he was not personally involved in that aspect of the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Nor did the district court err in rejecting a two-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Although Campbell confessed during his first encounter with law enforcement and cooperated with the government by wearing a recorder to obtain evidence against one of his co-defendants, he chose to proceed to trial contesting his factual guilt. <em>See United States v. Mohrbacher, </em>182 F.3d 1041, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (denying acceptance of responsibility adjustment where defendant immediately confessed and assisted the government in discovering others\u2019 criminal activities, but proceeded to trial and refused to admit to the intent element of the offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Nevertheless, the comparatively small sentences received by Campbell\u2019s far more culpable co-defendants \u2014 at least one of which was unanticipated by the district court when Campbell was originally sentenced \u2014 compel the court to remand this case for re-sentencing. Specifically, at Campbell\u2019s sentencing hearing, the government represented that co-defendant Abbas was facing a 97-120 month prison term under the Guidelines \u2014 a prediction the district court considered significant to its own sentencing decision. Ultimately, Abbas was sentenced to only 41 months in prison, and codefendant Jan (the undisputed ringleader of the scheme) was sentenced to only 21 months. In light of this new \u2014 and unanticipated \u2014 information, the district court may wish to re-examine the reasonableness of Campbell\u2019s 48-month sentence and \u201cimpose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3558.</p>\n<p id=\"AJu\">VACATED AND REMANDED,</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
