Alver (\u201cAlver\u201d) appeals from the final decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) denying Alver\u2019s request, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(f), for review of the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (\u201cOPM\u201d) regulation at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201(a)(14). <em>Alver v. Office of Pers. Mgmt, </em>CB-1205-05-0031-U-1 (M.S.P.B. Apr. 4, 2006). Because we lack jurisdiction to review the Board\u2019s determination, we <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b960-25\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b960-26\">From October 7, 1955 until his retirement on August 16, 1991, Alver worked for the Department of the Navy at Subic Bay, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>Philippines, under indefinite appointments and temporary intermittent appointments. Since 1994, Alver has been involved in numerous legal proceedings in an attempt to secure a retirement annuity under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d). At issue here, on July 27, 2005, Alver filed a request for review of 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.201(a)(14) by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">In its April 4, 2006 opinion responding to Alver\u2019s request and two other consolidated cases, the Board denied the request for review under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(f)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because it found Alver\u2019s arguments were or should have been raised in his prior proceedings seeking retirement benefits. Thus, the Board found Alver\u2019s request for review of the regulation is precluded by res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">On appeal, Alver\u2019s arguments focus on the merits of his claim and do not address either the Board\u2019s decision that res judicata applies or our jurisdiction to review that decision in light of the applicable statute. The government responds that this court has no jurisdiction to hear Alver\u2019s appeal because the Board has the \u201csole discretion\u201d to grant or deny a petition for review of a regulation under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(f)(1)(B), and this court has previously stated that it has jurisdiction to review such a denial only when the Board\u2019s decision reaches the merits of the issue under the OPM regulation. <em>See Debs Santos v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>289 F.3d 1382 (Fed.Cir.2002); <em>Clark v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>95 F.3d 1139 (Fed.Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-8\">We agree with the government. The Board did not reach the merits of any of its prior determinations, nor did it evaluate the validity of the regulation for which review was sought here. The Board merely determined that the subject matter raised by the challenge to the regulation was sufficiently related to prior proceedings that <em>res judicata </em>applies. As we noted in <em>Debs Santos, </em>\u2018When the court ruled in <em>Clark </em>that it had jurisdiction to review a Board denial of regulation review where the Board \u2018does consider the merits of the issue under the OPM rule or regulation,\u2019 the \u2018merits\u2019 to which this court referred were those of the underlying dispute, <em>not those of the decision whether to grant such review.\u201d </em>289 F.3d at 1384 (emphasis added). Because the Board did not review the merits of the underlying dispute, we lack jurisdiction. We therefore dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b961-9\">. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204(f)(1)(B) states, \"At any time after the effective date of any rule or regulation issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management in carrying out functions under section 1103, the Board shall review any provision of such rule or regulation ... (B) on the granting by the Board, in its sole discretion, of any petition for such review filed with the Board by any interested person, after consideration of the petition by the Board.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
