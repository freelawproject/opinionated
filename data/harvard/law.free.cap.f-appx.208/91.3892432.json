Because this appeal does not raise a substantial question, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-24\">In 1997, a jury found Miles guilty of conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance and distribution of a controlled substance in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(A)(iii). The District Court sentenced Miles to 324 months in prison. This Court affirmed on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-25\">The District Court denied Miles\u2019 subsequent motion to vacate his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. This Court granted a certificate of appealability on Miles\u2019 ineffective assistance of counsel claims, and then affirmed the denial of relief under \u00a7 2255. The United States Supreme Court denied Miles\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Miles then filed in District Court a motion for modification of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) claiming that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The District Court denied the motion, and this appeal followed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), the District Court may reduce a sentence \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission....\u201d As recognized by the District Court, <em>Booker </em>held that the provision of the federal sentencing statute that made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory was incompatible with the Sixth Amendment. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 244-45, 125 S.Ct. 738. While the effect of <em>Booker </em>was to make the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, <em>id. </em>at 245-47, 125 S.Ct. 738, <em>Booker </em>did not result in the amendment of any sentencing range. Thus, <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Cf. United States v. McBride, </em>283 F.3d 612, 616 (3d Cir.2002) (holding that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not provide a basis for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because it was unrelated to any change in the Sentencing Guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Accordingly, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-8\">. The District Court also noted that under <em>Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608, 616 (3d Cir.2005), <em>Booker </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review. To the extent Miles sought to collaterally challenge his sentence outside of \u00a7 3582(c)(2), he was required to obtain this Court's authorization to file a second or successive motion under \u00a7 2255. This Court, however, has held that <em>Booker </em>does not provide a basis for such authorization because the Supreme Court has not made <em>Booker </em>retroactive to cases on collateral review. <em>In re Olopade, </em>403 F.3d 159, 164 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
