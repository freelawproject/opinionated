On appeal, Manuel argues the following: (1) the district court erred by denying an offense-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1; and (2) the district court\u2019s sentence, which was an upward variance from the Guidelines range of 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment, was unreasonable. After careful review, we dismiss in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">The facts relevant to the instant sentencing claims are straightforward. On October 25, 2005, by second superceding indictment, Manuel was charged with sixteen counts of unarmed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(1); one count of armed bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(d); and one count of using and carrying a firearm in connection with a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). At Manuel\u2019s arraignment, the government moved to dismiss four of the unarmed bank robbery counts and Manuel subsequently proceeded to a jury trial on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">On the second day of the trial, after the government had presented the testimony of several witnesses, Manuel pled to seven counts of bank robbery, in exchange for which the government agreed to dismiss the remaining charges, which included the \u00a7 924(c) charge. The written plea agreement contained a waiver-of-appeal provision, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b738-8\">LIMITED WAIVER OF APPEAL: To the maximum extent permitted by federal law, the defendant voluntarily and expressly waives the right to appeal his sentence and the right to collaterally attack his sentence in any post-conviction proceeding on any ground, except that the defendant may file a direct appeal of an upward departure from the otherwise applicable sentencing guideline range. The defendant understands that this Plea Agreement does not limit the Government\u2019s right to appeal, but if the Government appeals the sentence imposed, the defendant may also file a direct appeal of his sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">At a subsequent plea colloquy, the government proffered the following factual basis for Manuel\u2019s plea. Between approximately May 29, 2003 and November 3, 2004, Manuel robbed numerous Bank of America and SunTrust branches located inside grocery stores. In total, about $70,000 in cash was stolen. During the robberies, which were recorded on surveillance tapes, Manuel wore a floppy hat and used a towel or newspaper to hide his face. Manuel was seen leaving one of the robberies in a vehicle that was traced back to him. During a subsequent search of his home, FBI agents found dye-stained money, and shirts that matched the clothing the robber was wearing in the surveillance photographs. Manuel admitted his role in the robberies and the amount of money involved, and he expressed remorse for his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">After advising Manuel of his rights, and the limitations on his right to appeal, the district court accepted the guilty plea. In the course of the plea colloquy, the court advised Manuel that under the plea agreement, (1) \u201cit\u2019s not possible to determine exactly how the guidelines are going to apply to your case until a presentence report is completed, and you and the government have had the opportunity to object and challenge any facts [in the PSI]\u201d; (2) the court \u201cretained the authority ... to impose a sentence that is more severe or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>less severe than a sentence called for by the guidelines\u201d; and (3) Manuel was waiving his right to appeal, \u201cwhich means you\u2019ll be bound by [my] decision, and you are also waiving your right to collaterally attack this sentence.\u201d Manuel indicated that he understood the provisions. The district court then accepted Manuel\u2019s guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">The probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), noting that the offenses would not be grouped together. The calculations for most of the counts were the same: a base offense level of 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1, with a 2-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(l) because the offense involved a financial institution. Thus, for these counts, the total adjusted offense level was 22. For the robbery charged in Count 2, the PSI included an enhancement for threat of death under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(F), in connection with a note Manuel handed to the teller. Thus, the adjusted offense level for that count was 24. Pursuant to the multiple-count adjustment of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.4, Manuel\u2019s combined offense level was increased by five points, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 29. The PSI did not recommend a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, noting that Manuel had forced the government to prepare for and proceed to trial before entering his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">The PSI calculated a criminal-history category III based on Manuel\u2019s prior convictions for theft-by-taking (1994), DUI (1994), battery/domestic violence (1997), and conspiracy to commit robbery (1998). With an offense level of 29 and a criminal history category III, the advisory Guidelines range was 108 to 135 months\u2019 imprisonment. The PSI noted that an upward departure might be appropriate under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21 in consideration of the dismissed and uncharged conduct. Manuel lodged objections to the enhancement for threat of death, the computation of his criminal history category, and the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility-</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">At the sentencing hearing, the court sustained the objections to the enhancement for threat of death and the criminal history category, but rejected Manuel\u2019s argument that he was entitled to an aceeptance-ofresponsibility reduction. The court found that Manuel let the case go too far before pleading guilty. With the sustained objections to the PSI, the district court determined that the adjusted offense level was 27 and the criminal history category was II, resulting in a Guidelines range of 78 to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. Based on the terms of the plea agreement, the government said it was not asking for an \u201cupward departure\u201d above the Guidelines range, but did request a sentence at the high end of the range. The court stated that it was considering imposing a 180-month \u201cupward departure\u201d sentence, even absent a motion by the government, noting the following factors: (1) Manuel\u2019s criminal history; (2) the number of robberies involved in the instant offenses; and (3) the court\u2019s belief that 97 months was not sufficient punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">Defense counsel then told the court that Manuel had pled guilty and expressed remorse, had a minimal criminal history, and had been employed. The court also heard the mitigating testimony of Manuel\u2019s mother and Manuel\u2019s sister, who described Manuel\u2019s childhood, military service, and character, as well as Manuel\u2019s statement of remorse and request for a shorter sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">After listening to the witnesses, the court noted the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a sentence of 168 months \u2014 a sentence the district court termed an \u201cupward departure\u201d \u2014 in light of the nature of the offense, Manuel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>history, the number of robberies involved, and the fact that Manuel had committed the offenses for both the money and the thrill. The court also noted the continuous and dangerous behavior that could have ended in violence, and stated that it had come <em>down </em>from the 180-month sentence it previously had mentioned at the hearing, prior to hearing Manuel\u2019s mitigating testimony and statement of remorse. Manuel again objected to a sentence above the advisory range to which the district court responded, \u201csince I made an upward departure it is my belief that you can proceed with your appeal concerning the sentence.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">First, Manuel argues he was entitled to a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The government urges that the waiver provision in Manuel\u2019s plea agreement bars this argument, and notes that Manuel does not suggest that the plea was not knowing and voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">A sentence appeal waiver contained in a plea agreement, made knowingly and voluntarily, is enforceable. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1345, 1350-51 (11th Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Copeland, </em>381 F.3d 1101, 1107 (11th Cir. 2004). The waiver can include the waiver of the right to appeal \u201cdifficult or debatable legal issues or even blatant error.\u201d <em>United States v. Frye, </em>402 F.3d 1123, 1129 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1141, 125 S.Ct. 2986, 162 L.Ed.2d 891 (2005). To enforce a sentence-appeal waiver, the government must demonstrate either that (1) the district court specifically questioned the defendant about the waiver during the change of plea colloquy, or (2) the record clearly shows that the defendant otherwise understood the full significance of the waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 1351.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">Here, although the appeal waiver excepts \u201cupward departures,\u201d we do not read that provision to mean that even if the district court imposed an \u201cupward departure,\u201d Manuel was free to appeal any and all aspects of his sentence unrelated to the imposition of a sentence above the advisory Guidelines range. There is <em>no </em>indication in the record that Manuel misunderstood the waiver on this point, and it is clear that he entered into the agreement, including the appeal-waiver provision, knowingly and voluntarily. The language of the plea agreement is plain. Moreover, at the plea colloquy hearing, the court confirmed that Manuel had discussed the waiver with counsel and that he understood it. Thus, the appeal waiver is enforceable and it at least covers the challenge to the denial of a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal as to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">Manuel next argues that his sentence was unreasonable because there was nothing about his case that falls outside the \u201cheartland\u201d of cases or warranted imposition of a sentence that was 73 percent higher than the top-end of the Guidelines range, and because the district court failed to make sufficient findings to support the sentence above the Guidelines range, which we have termed a <em>\u201cvariance,\u201d </em>not a \u201cdeparture.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Manuel also argues the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>trict court\u2019s consideration of his criminal history, in the context of its \u00a7 3553(a) analysis, constituted improper double counting because the same information was considered in calculating his criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 812, 163 L.Ed.2d 639 (2005). After a district court has calculated a defendant\u2019s advisory Guidelines range, it \u201cmay impose a more severe or more lenient sentence,\u201d which we review only for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). In conducting our reasonableness review, which is highly deferential, we do not apply the reasonableness standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process; instead, we review only the <em>final </em>sentence for reasonableness, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006). The district court need not state on the record that it has explicitly considered each factor and need not discuss each factor. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Rather, an acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Here, the district court considered Manuel\u2019s arguments for a lesser sentence and noted his mitigating evidence, but was persuaded to impose a harsher sentence because of the seriousness of the crime, including the number of robberies involved, the fact that Manuel used threats as part of the offenses, and the fact that Manuel continued to commit the robberies for the \u201cthrill\u201d of it. The district court also highlighted Manuel\u2019s criminal history. Thus, the district court\u2019s ruling plainly reflects consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including: the nature and circumstances of the offense; the history and characteristics of Manuel; the advisory Sentencing Guidelines range; and the need for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Moreover, the district court explicitly discussed the application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors as necessary to determine a reasonable sentence. On this record, Manuel cannot satisfy his burden to show that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">DISMISSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-6\">. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), we have explained that the term variance refers to a sentence outside the advisory Guidelines range based on the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2006); <em>cf. United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 788 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (explaining \"the record reveals that the district court, at resentencing, did not treat its decision to sentence Eldick above the guideline range as an upward departure, but rather as an exercise of its discretion because the court did not cite to a specific guidelines departure provision and, in the words of the district court, the guidelines did 'not ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>quately take into account the severity of the damage done by Mr. Eldick, and, therefore, I find that they should not be applied.\u2019 Therefore, we conclude that we are not reviewing the propriety of a \"guidelines\u201d departure.\u201d); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>441 F.3d 1322, 1330 (11th Cir.2006) (declining to address sentence outside the guidelines range based on \u00a7 3553(a) factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-13\">However, in light of the \"upward departure\u201d language used in the plea agreement, at the plea colloquy, and at the sentencing hearing, in this case, we cannot find that Manuel knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal the imposition of sentence above the Guidelines range.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
