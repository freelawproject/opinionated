Defonzo\u2019s order denying Gao\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief, and ordering her removed. We presume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yu Yin Yang v. Gonzales, </em>431 F.3d 84, 85 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121,129 (2d Cir.2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Upon review of the record, the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination and denial of asylum relief was supported by substantial evidence. The IJ properly found that Gao\u2019s testimony was inconsistent with the letter allegedly submitted by her mother in at least two critical respects\u2014 the extent of her involvement in her mother\u2019s religious activities and whether the Chinese authorities were pursuing her for her involvement in unregistered Christian activities. Gao\u2019s testimony also was inconsistent with the information that she, with the help of her attorney, included in her Request for Asylum, Form 1-589. These inconsistencies involved issues that were material to her asylum claim \u2014 specifically, whether Chinese officials were pursuing her and whether she had to hide from the authorities. Gao\u2019s explanations for the inconsistencies is her claim do not compel a reasonable adjudicator to conclude that she was credible and asylum relief was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Because the IJ\u2019s credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we affirm the BIA\u2019s decision affirming the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding. Furthermore, because Gao did not raise her claim for CAT relief in her brief before the BIA, she faded to exhaust her remedies with respect to that claim, and this Court lacks jurisdiction to review them. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 343 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
