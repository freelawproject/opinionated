Wagner appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming a denial of disability benefits under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401-434. Although we might have come to a different conclusion were we weighing the evidence in the first instance, substantial evidence supports the administrative law judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) decision. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">1. The ALJ did not err in discrediting Plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding the extent of his pain. The ALJ made \u201cspecific findings justifying [his] decision\u201d that Plaintiffs testimony was not fully credible. <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 604 (9th Cir.1989). The ALJ acknowledged pain but noted inconsistencies between Plaintiffs testimony and his physician\u2019s records and previously reported daily activities. <em>See Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1997) (noting that inconsistencies between testimony and other evidence is a justifiable reason to discredit testimony). Treating physicians found Plaintiff to have normal reflexes and motor abilities. Plaintiff had previously reported that he could walk up to three miles, perform yard work, and drive his children to and from school. Plaintiffs treatment records indicate that on one occasion he went scuba diving. The ALJ permissibly found this evidence contradictory to Plaintiffs testimony that he spends half the day lying down and has severe limitations in sitting, standing, and walking.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">2. The ALJ did not err in disregarding the opinion of treating physician Dr. Robert McAuley in favor of nontreating, nonexamining physician Dr. A. McCuistion. Although the opinion of a treating physician generally should be given greater weight than that of a nontreating, nonexamining physician, <em>see Andrews v. Shalala, </em>53 F.3d 1035, 1040-41 (9th Cir.1995), the ALJ gave \u201cspecific, legitimate reasons ... based on substantial evidence in the record\u201d for rejecting Dr. McAuley\u2019s opinion in favor of Dr. McCuistion\u2019s. <em>Id. </em>at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-12\">Dr. McAuley diagnosed Plaintiff with arthritis of the hands and found that Plaintiffs pain limited him to \u201csedentary work.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no evidence in the record that Plaintiff complained of pain in his wrists and hands either before or after that one examination by Dr. McAuley. Because the ALJ found that Dr. McAuley was apparently giving more weight to Plaintiffs discredited subjective complaints than to the objective findings, the ALJ properly rejected Dr. McAuley\u2019s conclusion based on those subjective complaints. <em>See Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 605 (rejecting treating physician\u2019s opinion where based on discredited subjective accounts of pain). Additionally, Dr. McAuley\u2019s opinion regarding \u201csedentary work\u201d was not supported by abnormal clinical findings. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>Matney v. Sullivan, </em>981 F.2d 1016, 1019 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that an ALJ may reject the conclusory opinion of an examining physician if the opinion is unsupported by clinical findings). Finally, Dr. McAuley\u2019s assessment is inconsistent with Plaintiffs medical records and daily activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">3. The ALJ properly used the Medical-Vocational Guidelines (\u201cthe grids\u201d), 20 C.F.R. pt. 404, subpt. P, app. 2, to determine whether Petitioner was disabled. The grids may be used in lieu of testimony by a vocational expert except in cases where a claimant\u2019s nonexertional limitations \u201c\u2018significantly limit the range of work\u2019 \u201d that he or she can perform. <em>Tackett v. Apfel, </em>180 F.3d 1094, 1104 (9th Cir. 1999) (quoting <em>Desrosiers v. Sec\u2019y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>846 F.2d 573, 577 (9th Cir.1988)). The nonexertional limitations claimed by Plaintiff \u2014 manipulative limitations in his hands and wrists and limitations resulting from severe pain\u2014 were properly rejected by the ALJ, obviating the need for vocational expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b562-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b562-13\">. Because the ALJ had an \"adequate\u201d amount of evidence from which to base his decision, we reject Plaintiff's contention that the AU was required to recontact Dr. McAuley. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1512(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b563-7\">W. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">It is uncontested that the appellant, John Wagner, has a degenerative back disorder, has had three major back surgeries, and takes six to eight Vicodin <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> every day as prescribed by his physician. None of the physicians who examined Wagner, or reviewed his case, concluded that he did not experience back pain. Today the majority, however, affirms the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\u201cALJ\u201d) disability determination that did not consider <em>any </em>of Wagner\u2019s limitations from his back pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">The ALJ dismissed Wagner\u2019s testimony about his back pain and resulting activity limitations as \u201cnot fully creditable.\u201d That credibility determination may be upheld only if it is supported by \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d and is not based on legal error. <em>Widmark v. Barnhart, </em>454 F.3d 1063, 1066 (9th Cir.2006). The paucity of the evidence that could even arguably support the ALJ\u2019s decision is apparent from the majority\u2019s memorandum disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">The majority first states that \u201c[tjreating physicians found Plaintiff to have normal reflexes and motor abilities.\u201d The majority does not mention that plaintiffs examining physician, Dr. McAuley, described his gait as \u201cslow.\u201d Nor does the majority explain how or why Wagner\u2019s reflexes and motor abilities demonstrate any inconsistency with his testimony. The record does not contain any medical evidence suggesting that any such findings would indicate that Wagner does not experience pain, almost certainly because patients can experience pain and still have normal reflexes and motor abilities. This evidence is therefore insufficient to uphold the ALJ\u2019s dismissal of Wagner\u2019s pain. <em>See Bunnell v. Sullivan, </em>947 F.2d 341, 346 (9th Cir. 1991) (en banc) (listing appropriate grounds for discrediting pain testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-13\">Next, the majority affirms the ALJ\u2019s decision because Wagner reported \u201cthat he could walk up to three miles, perform yard work, and drive his children to and from school.\u201d The majority concludes that Wagner\u2019s reports of walking, yard work, and driving somehow contradict his statements that he has \u201csevere limitations in sitting, standing, and walking,\u201d but his testimony demonstrates just the opposite. Wagner consistently reported that he could only drive short distances, such as driving his children to and from school, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>and that he could not complete his yard work. These consistent reports support his testimony that he frequently requires rest periods and changes in posture due to his severe back pain. <em>Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1997) (requiring that activity reports be inconsistent to dismiss a claimant\u2019s reports of pain); <em>see also Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir.1989) (explaining that many home activities often are not easily transferable to the workplace).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Wagner reported on his pain questionnaire that he could walk \u201cpretty far ? 3 mile.\u201d The majority contrasts the \u201cpretty far ?3 mile\u201d estimate with Wagner\u2019s testimony one year later, in which he reported that he could walk only half a mile. For two reasons, this is hardly \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that would support dismissing all of Wagner\u2019s reports of pain. First, \u201cpretty far? 3 mile\u201d is, on its face, a guess. Second, Wagner suffers from a <em>degenerative </em>back disease, which is consistent with a decrease in his ability to walk distances after one year. <em>Cf. Macri v. Chater, </em>93 F.3d 540, 544 (9th Cir.1996) (upholding ALJ dismissal of claimant\u2019s pain when claimant had unsuccessfully attempted to find work despite claiming disability, claimant\u2019s testimony regarding his pain was vague, physician reports indicated minimal to slight pain, patients strength was intact and patient had not been taking pain medication for a substantial portion of the relevant time period).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">The majority\u2019s next reason for upholding the dismissal of Wagner\u2019s pain-based restrictions is directly contradicted by Ninth Circuit precedent. The majority, and the ALJ, rely heavily on the fact that Wagner went scuba diving on one occasion with his son, who carried all of the equipment and helped Wagner get dressed. I suspect that the IJ and the majority may be unfamiliar with, and therefore overestimate, the physical strain associated with scuba diving. But, more important, scuba diving on one occasion does not constitute an \u201cactivity of <em>daily </em>living.\u201d <em>See Fair, </em>885 F.2d at 603 (describing that activities that constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d part of <em>daily </em>activities may be the basis for an adverse credibility finding). This circuit has held, \u201c[o]ne does not need to be utterly incapacitated in order to be disabled.\u201d <em>Vertigan v. Halter, </em>260 F.3d 1044, 1050 (9th Cir.2001). Rather a patient may engage in activities <em>\u201cdespite </em>pain for therapeutic reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">The majority contends that Wagner\u2019s statement that he spends \u201chalf the day\u201d lying down is contradicted by his testimony. In describing his average day, Wagner estimated that he spends almost three daylight hours lying in bed because of his back pain. Consistent with Wagner\u2019s testimony, in one report which the ALJ and majority did not reference, the examining physician reported that Wagner complained of fatigue after exertion which required him to lie down. The majority, however, seizes upon Wagner\u2019s general statement that he spends \u201chalf the day\u201d lying down. Then, based on Wagner\u2019s other detailed testimony about his day, it finds \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d that Wagner made inconsistent statements. I do not agree that there is even an \u201cinconsistency,\u201d let alone \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d that warrants the dismissal of Wagner\u2019s reports of pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">Neither of the majority\u2019s proffered grounds supports its rejection of Dr. McAuley\u2019s opinion as Wagner\u2019s treating physician. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(1) (2006) (prescribing that examining physician opinion is entitled to greater weight than a non-examining physician). First, while I agree that the ALJ had a permissible basis for rejecting Dr. McAuley\u2019s diagnosis of Wagner\u2019s wrist and hand limita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>tions, dismissing the diagnosis of Wagner\u2019s hand disorder does not warrant dismissing all of Dr. McAuley\u2019s other diagnoses and opinions. Second, after the majority errs in incorrectly discounting Wagner\u2019s reports of pain, it compounds the error by dismissing Dr. McAuley\u2019s other diagnoses because they are based on those reports. <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 831 (9th Cir.1995) (ALJ may only reject testimony of treating physician for \u201cspecific, legitimate reasons\u201d that are \u201csupported by substantial record evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Wagner established a medical basis for his pain by showing his history of back surgeries, his diagnosis, and his pain medication. The majority\u2019s requirement for additional \u201cabnormal clinical findings\u201d to support Dr. McAuley\u2019s opinion for Wagner\u2019s activity limitation is contrary to Ninth Circuit precedent. <em>Hammock v. Bowen, 879 </em>F.2d 498, 502-03 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that dismissal of treating physician\u2019s opinion which was based on claimant\u2019s pain was error because it \u201cis reversible as a matter of law to discredit excess pain testimony only because the medical evidence does not fully establish that level of pain\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Finally, the ALJ\u2019s use of the \u201cgrids\u201d was improper. After the ALJ found that Wagner could not perform his previous occupation as a Registered Nurse, the government had the burden to show that Wagner can perform \u201cother jobs that exist in substantial numbers in the national economy.\u201d <em>Bruton v. Massanari, </em>268 F.3d 824, 828 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001). Wagner\u2019s pain sufficiently interfered with his functional capacity that the ALJ was prohibited from relying on the grids. Instead, the ALJ was required to hear testimony from a vocational expert. <em>See Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 729 (9th Cir.1998) (\u201cIf the grids fail accurately to describe a claimant\u2019s limitations, the ALJ may not rely on the grids alone to show the availability of jobs for the claimant.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>Desrosiers v. Sec. of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>846 F.2d 573, 580 (9th Cir.1988) (reversing ALJ for failing to use vocational expert testimony when claimant had pain that significantly affected his ability to work and rendered him \u201cunable to perform the <em>full range </em>of light work\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">A deferential standard of review does not require upholding an ALJ\u2019s determination regardless of the facts. Where, as here, the ALJ\u2019s rejection of all of Wagner\u2019s pain-based limitations is not supported by substantial evidence in the record, reversal is not only warranted but required. <em>See Widmark, </em>454 F.3d at 1066. Here, the record, which includes diagnoses, treatment, surgery, and prescription medication, overwhelmingly demonstrates that Wagner suffers from back pain that disables him to some degree. Wagner is entitled to a disability determination that includes consideration of his back pain, and to testimony from a vocational expert under the government\u2019s burden to establish that Wagner can work. <em>See Reddick, </em>157 F.3d at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-9\">I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b563-9\">.
