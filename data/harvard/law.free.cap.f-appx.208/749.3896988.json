The petitioners argue that they filed their asylum application more than a year after they arrived in the United States because they did not know they could apply for asylum. The petitioners also argue that the BIA erred in denying withholding of removal because they fear they will be persecuted if returned to Jamaica.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">I. Jurisdiction Over Petition for Review of Asylum Denial</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We review our subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). An alien may apply for asylum if \u201cthe alien demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the application has been filed within 1 year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). An alien may apply for asylum after one year of arrival if the alien \u201cdemonstrates ... either the existence of changed circumstances which materially affect the applicant\u2019s eligibility for asylum or extraordinary circumstances relating to the delay in filing an application.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). \u201cNo court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination\u201d that an application was untimely or failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the delay. INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). Section 1158(a)(3) divests us of jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that an asylum applicant filed an untimely application and failed to establish changed or extraordinary circumstances to excuse the untimely filing. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283,1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">Here, the BIA determined that the petitioners filed their asylum application more than one year after their arrival in the United States. The BIA also found that the petitioners did not prove extraordinary circumstances justifying their late filing. Pursuant to INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision that the asylum application was untimely. However, we do not lack jurisdiction to review the petition for withholding of removal. Therefore, we dismiss the petition for review of the denial of asylum for lack of jurisdiction, but continue with review of the claim for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">II. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">When the BIA issues a decision, we review only that decision, except to the extent the BIA expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cInsofar as the [BIA] adopts the IJ\u2019s reasoning, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the BIA issued its own decision, without any adoption. Therefore, we will review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">\u201cTo the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, [our] review is <em>de novo.\u201d D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir. 2004). However, the BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the ... decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1283-84 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">An applicant for withholding of removal is not subject to the one-year time limitation placed on asylum applicants under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>INA \u00a7 208(a)(2)(b), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) or 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a). <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). Moreover, unlike asylum, withholding of removal under the INA is mandatory, not discretionary, once the applicant establishes eligibility. <em>Id.; 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">\u201cAn alien is entitled to withholding of removal under the INA if she can show that her \u2018life or freedom would be threatened in [that] country because of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1232 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (alteration omitted)). The burden of proof is upon the alien to show her eligibility for withholding of removal under the INA by showing that it is \u201cmore likely than not she will be persecuted or tortured upon being returned to her country.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The more-likely-than-not standard is more stringent than the well-founded fear standard in asylum cases. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1375 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">An applicant for withholding of removal may satisfy this burden of proof in one of two ways. <em>Id. </em>First, an alien may satisfy her burden if she establishes \u201cpast persecution in her country based on a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Once an alien establishes past persecution, \u201ca rebuttable presumption arises that she has a well-founded fear of future persecution, and the burden then shifts to the [DHS] to show that the conditions in the country have changed or the alien could avoid a future threat through relocation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">Second, if an alien has not shown past persecution, she still may be entitled to withholding of removal if she \u201cestablishes \u2018that it is more likely than not that she would be persecuted on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion upon removal to that country.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2) (alteration omitted)). \u201cAn alien cannot demonstrate that [she] more-likely-than-not would be persecuted on a protected ground if the [BIA] finds that the alien could avoid a future threat by relocating to another part of [her] country.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). An alien may also sustain her burden of proof by showing a pattern or practice of persecution of a group similarly situated to her in which she is included or with which she is identified. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(2). The alien need not show that she would be singled out individually for persecution; rather, she may sustain the burden of proof by showing a pattern or practice of persecution of a group similarly situated to the alien in which she is included or with which she may be identified. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b775-11\">Neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution.\u201d We have stated, however, that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and ... mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (quotations omitted). Furthermore, the petitioner\u2019s well-founded fear of persecution must be on account of, or because of, one of the statutorily listed factors, such as her political opinion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 816, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">We have held that \u201c[a]n imputed political opinion, whether correctly or incorrectly attributed, may constitute a ground for a well-founded fear of political persecution within the meaning of the INA.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289 (quotations omitted). An applicant \u201cmay prevail on a theory of imputed political opinion if he shows that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>the persecutor falsely attributed an opinion to him, and then persecuted him because of that mistaken belief about his views.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alterations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">To meet their burden of proof, the petitioners must have shown either that they suffered past persecution or that they more likely than not would suffer future persecution if removed to Jamaica. <em>See Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. We find no error in the IJ\u2019s determination that the petitioners did not suffer past persecution based on a protected ground. <em>See id. </em>The threats the petitioners received were unrelated to their political opinions and, although harassing, did not reach the level of persecution. Because the petitioners failed to show past persecution, they are only eligible for withholding of removal if they proved that they more likely than not would suffer persecution upon removal to Jamaica. <em>See Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1375. The petitioners have failed to meet this burden of proof as well. They do not belong to a persecuted group and presented no evidence that they would join one upon return to Jamaica. Therefore, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Upon review of the records and the parties\u2019 briefs, we hold that we lack jurisdiction to review the asylum claim and dismiss the petition as to that issue. We also discern no error in the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal and deny the petition as to that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-6\">. Because the petitioners did not argue that the BIA erred in denying CAT relief, the petitioners have abandoned this argument. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283 n. 12 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
