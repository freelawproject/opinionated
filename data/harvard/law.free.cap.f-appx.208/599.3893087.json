R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Jose Ramon Medina-Huerta appeals his conviction and forty-eight month sentence for being a deported alien found in the United States in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">The district court did not err in refusing to allow cross-examination regarding document shredding at the Laguna Niguel processing facility. The testimony sought by Medina-Huerta was marginally relevant at best, highly prejudicial, and not based on the witness\u2019s personal knowledge. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 403; Fed.R.Evid. 602. The district court did not err, therefore, because it did not limit relevant testimony, prejudice the defendant, or deny the jury sufficient information to appraise the biases and motivations of the witness. <em>United States v. Holler, </em>411 F.3d 1061, 1066 (9th Cir. 2005) .</p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">Medina-Huerta was not entitled to a different jury instruction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a). \u201cAs a functional matter, the Attorney General\u2019s consent to apply for admission [required under \u00a7 1326(a)] is tantamount to his consent to the admission itself.\u201d <em>United States v. Cervantes-Flores, </em>421 F.3d 825, 834 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation and citation omitted). For this reason, the instruction requiring the jury to find that Medina-Huerta \u201chad no official permission from the attorney general or anyone in charge to be here in the United States, he had not been granted permission to be back in the United States\u201d did not misstate the consent required under \u00a7 1326(a). Moreover, the evidence presented at trial overwhelmingly suggests that Medina-Huerta applied for the Attorney General\u2019s consent to apply for admission to the United States but was denied. Any error presented by the district court\u2019s jury instruction thus \u201cwas harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Feingold, </em>454 F.3d 1001, 1012-13 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">Finally, Medina-Huerta\u2019s challenge to the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326 is foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d 1090, 1097 (9th Cir. 2006) . His argument that the sentencing court improperly found the fact of his deportation, and its date, is likewise unavailing. At trial, the jury was presented with evidence of a single deportation in March 1996. In finding Medina-Huerta guilty of illegal reentry after deportation, the jury necessarily found beyond a reasonable doubt that Medina-Huerta was removed in 1996, a time subsequent to his December 1991 conviction. The sentencing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>thus did not err in finding either the fact of Medina-Huerta\u2019s prior removal or its date. <em>United States v. Martinez-Rodriguez, </em>468 F.3d 1182, 1186 (9th Cir.2006). Neither finding involved \u201cthe existence of a subsequent removal that was neither proven beyond a reasonable doubt at trial nor admitted.\u201d <em>Covian-Sandoval, </em>462 F.3d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b625-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
