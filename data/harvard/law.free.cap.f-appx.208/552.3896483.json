Campbell, 208 </em>Fed.Appx. 550 (9th Cir.2006), were companion cases for the purpose of oral argument. These cases will be decided separately.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b577-12\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-13\">Convicted by a jury of conspiracy, wire fraud, and making false statements to a government official, Appellant Asif Abbas (\u201cAbbas\u201d) appeals, arguing that his convictions were not supported by sufficient evidence and that the record on this direct appeal is sufficiently developed to demonstrate that his trial counsel \u2014 who stipulated to the admissibility of all of the government\u2019s exhibits and failed to object to a significant amount of hearsay testimony\u2014 was constitutionally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-16\">Sufficient evidence supported Abbas\u2019s wire fraud conviction. <em>See United States v. Mosley, </em>465 F.3d 412, 414-15 (9th Cir.2006). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, a rational trier of fact could have found that: (1) Abbas himself sent the false credit reference to DigiKey; Abbas, as well as Agent Nugent and co-defendant Jan, testified that \u201cJoseph\u201d \u2014 the name appearing on the credit reference \u2014 was a nickname used by Abbas; and (2) the false credit reference was sent via the interstate wires; the credit reference was presented at trial bearing a fax header showing that it was faxed from Abbas\u2019s company, ACT.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">Moreover, even if Abbas had not waived his argument regarding the government\u2019s failure to prove \u201cmateriality\u201d by failing to raise it in his opening brief, <em>see Paciulan v. George, </em>229 F.3d 1226, 1230 (9th Cir. 2000), <em>cert. denied, </em>531 U.S. 1077, 121 S.Ct. 775, 148 L.Ed.2d 673 (2001), sufficient evidence would exist to support this element as well. To prove materiality with regard to a fraudulent scheme, \u201c[i]t is only necessary to prove that it is a scheme reasonably calculated to deceive.\u201d <em>United States v. Woods, </em>335 F.3d 993, 998 (9th Cir.2003); <em>see also Neder v. United States, </em>527 U.S. 1, 25, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (materiality is an essential element of wire fraud crime); <em>United States v. Neder, </em>197 F.3d 1122, 1128-29 (11th Cir.1999) (on remand) (materiality in wire fraud context is the same as materiality in false statements context \u2014 fraudulent conduct need not <em>actually </em>influence the lenders\u2019 decisions; it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>need only \u201ctend[] to influence and [be] capable of influencing the lenders\u2019 decisions\u201d). Here, a reasonable juror could have concluded that Abbas\u2019s sending of a false credit reference to DigiKey was reasonably calculated to deceive DigiKey into extending credit to CDI.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Sufficient evidence also supported Abbas\u2019s false statements conviction. The government presented evidence regarding both the false statements made by Abbas and the decisions the IRS criminal investigators were trying to make. Whether or not Abbas\u2019s false statements actually affected the investigation, a reasonable jury could have inferred that Abbas\u2019s statements had \u201ca natural tendency to influence, or were capable of influencing, the decision making body to which [they were] addressed.\u201d <em>United States v. Gaudin, </em>515 U.S. 506, 509, 115 S.Ct. 2310, 132 L.Ed.2d 444 (1995).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Finally, we decline to review Abbas\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim at this stage, as the record is not \u201csufficiently developed\u201d to permit meaningful review of this claim on direct appeal, <em>see United States v. McKenna, </em>327 F.3d 830, 845 (9th Cir.2003), and the limited record before the court evidences no \u201cobvious[ ] den[ial] [of Abbas\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right to counsel\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b577-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-8\">. Accordingly, sufficient evidence also supports Abbas\u2019s conspiracy conviction. Putting aside the legal error with Abbas\u2019s argument that his conspiracy conviction would have to be overturned if insufficient evidence supported his wire fraud conviction, <em>see United States </em>v. <em>Prueitt, </em>540 F.2d 995, 1006 (9th Cir.1976) (conviction for conspiracy and acquittal on the underlying substantive offense is not inconsistent), the wire fraud conviction was supported by sufficient evidence, as explained above.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-24\">. Additionally, as the Supreme Court has expressly held, \"the plain language of [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1001 admits of no exception for an \u2018exculpatory no.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brogan v.
