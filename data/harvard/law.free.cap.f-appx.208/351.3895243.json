Daniel Olivarez, and others, in which he alleges that the defendants failed to protect him from being attacked by another inmate. The district court dismissed the action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>After <em>de novo </em>review of Garcia\u2019s complaint, and accepting his allegations as true, we conclude that the actions of Jones and Olivarez establish that they were not deliberately indifferent to Garcia\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 884-35, 844, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Garcia does not challenge the dismissal of the other defendants, so any such claims are abandoned. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir. 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Garcia also argues that the district court erred by denying his motions for a default judgment, discovery, and appointment of counsel. No relief is warranted on these grounds. <em>See Lewis v. Lynn, </em>236 F.3d 766, 767 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Ulmer v. Chancellor, </em>691 F.2d 209, 212 (5th Cir.1982). The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The dismissal of Garcia\u2019s action pursuant to \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) counts as his second strike for purposes of the three strikes provision, \u00a7 1915(g), because a previous action brought by him was dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). <em>See Garcia v. Espinosa, </em>No. 7:01-CV-285 (S.D.Tex. Sept. 21, 2004); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Garcia is WARNED that if he accumulates three strikes, he will be barred from proceeding <em>in forma pauperis </em>in any future civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility, unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b375-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
