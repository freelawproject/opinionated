Kurniawan petitions for review of a final order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), affirming the denial by the immigration judge (IJ) of Kurniawan\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will deny Kurniawan\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Kurniawan is a native and citizen of Indonesia. He alleged in his application for asylum that he had been persecuted on the basis of both his Chinese ethnicity and his Christian faith. Kurniawan related that he had been assaulted by Muslim Indonesians in 1996, April 1997, and October 1998. During the October 1998 incident, Kurniawan\u2019s girlfriend was fatally wounded in his presence and his garment business was destroyed. Two months later, on December 11, 1998, Kurniawan entered the United States. He did not, however, apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the CAT until more than two years later in June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-17\">At a hearing before the IJ, Kurniawan conceded that he had overstayed his visa and was removable. He requested a grant of asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. The IJ concluded that Kurniawan\u2019s asylum claim was time barred under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2). Because the IJ found that Kurniawan was not credible, he found that Kurniawan had not proved past persecution. The IJ also concluded that Kurniawan had not proved that he would suffer future persecution. As support, the IJ cited the new opportunities for ethnic Chinese Indonesians. As a result, the IJ denied Kumiawan\u2019s claim for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. Kurniawan filed a timely appeal with the BIA, asserting that the IJ erred because he should have concluded that a \u201cpattern or practice of persecution exists against the ethnic Chinese Christian population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-18\">On September 16, 2005, the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Kumiawan\u2019s asylum claim was untimely and that he had failed to demonstrate circumstances excusing his delinquency. Thus, the BIA considered only the merits of Kurniawan\u2019s claim for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT. It determined that it was unnecessary to address the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility findings inasmuch as it concluded that \u201cthe alleged events do not rise to the level of persecution on account of a protected ground\u201d and that Kurniawan failed to demonstrate a pattern or practice of persecution which merits withholding his removal. In addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>tion, the BIA denied Kurniawan\u2019s CAT claim, finding that he did not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if he was repatriated to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">This timely petition for review followed. Kurniawan asserts that the BIA\u2019s application of the one year time bar in \u00a7 1158(a)(2) violates both the treaty obligations of the United States and the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution. In addition, he submits that the record contains substantial evidence that there was a pattern or practice of persecution against ethnic Chinese individuals living in Indonesia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">We exercise plenary review over the propriety of the BIA\u2019s application of the one year time bar in \u00a7 1158(a)(2). <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d 627, 631 (3d Cir.2006). Because the BIA did not adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination, our review is limited to the final order issued by the BIA and whether it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 549 (3d Cir. 2001). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion .... \u201d <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228, 248 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc) (quoting <em>N.L.R.B. v. Columbian Enameling &amp; Stamping Co., </em>306 U.S. 292, 300, 59 S.Ct. 501, 83 L.Ed. 660 (1939)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Kurniawan appropriately acknowledges in his brief that his arguments with regard to \u00a7 1158(a)(2)\u2019s time bar are \u201calmost identical\u201d to those which were rejected in <em>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, </em>434 F.3d at 634.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We agree. Accordingly, we are bound by the holding in <em>Sukwanputra </em>that the one year statutory period neither violates the Supremacy Clause nor the right to due process. <em>Id. </em>at 632; 3d Cir. IOP 9.1. Because the time bar is not constitutionally infirm, we lack jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) to review not only the application of the time bar to Kurniawan\u2019s asylum claim, but also the determination that Kurniawan failed to demonstrate circumstances excusing his untimely application. Suk<em>wanputra, </em>434 F.3d at 632; <em>Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">We do have jurisdiction to review Kurniawan\u2019s claim for withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Kurniawan contends that the BIA erred in its determination that he failed to meet his burden of proof for withholding of removal. Kurniawan asserts that there is substantial evidence in the record demonstrating that there was a pattern or practice of persecution of ethnically Chinese Christian Indonesians. The issue is not whether this record supports Kurniawan\u2019s contention that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against this group of persons. Instead, as the Supreme Court pointed out in <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), the issue is whether the evidence of record \u201cnot only supports that conclusion, but compels it....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">In <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530 (3d Cir.2005), \u201cwe agree[d] with other courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>that have held that, to constitute a \u2018pattern or practice,\u2019 the persecution of the group must be \u2018systemic, pervasive, or organized.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537 (quoting <em>Ngure v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 975, 991 (8th Cir.2004)). In addition, we reiterated that conduct \u201cdoes not constitute persecution unless such acts are \u2018committed by the government or forces the government is either \u2018unable or unwilling\u2019 to control.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537 (quoting <em>Abdulrahman v. Ashcroft, </em>330 F.3d 587, 592 (3d Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">We are mindful of the citations by the IJ to the evidence of improved conditions for Chinese Indonesians and to Kurniawan\u2019s testimony that the government did not prevent him from practicing his faith. The 2003 United States Department of State Country Report for Indonesia supports the IJ\u2019s finding in this regard. Moreover, the Country Report confirms that Christianity is recognized by the government of Indonesia and that tolerance for non-Muslim religions has improved. Although there is some evidence, as Kurniawan points out in his brief, of some interreligious violence, we are not compelled by this record to find a pattern or practice of persecution against the ethnic Chinese Christian population of Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We will deny Kurniawan\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-19\">. The IJ had jurisdiction pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.2(b). The BIA exercised jurisdiction under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">. Kurniawan does not challenge in his brief the BIA\u2019s denial of his request for relief under the CAT. Nor does he take issue in his reply brief with the government's contention that he waived this issue. Accordingly, we deem the issue waived. <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 532 n. 1 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-12\">. Counsel pointed out that a petition for rehearing was pending in <em>Sukwanputra. </em>We note that the petition for rehearing has been denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
