Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (requiring, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201creasonableness\u201d review of <em>post-Booker </em>sentences, to be guided by the factors stated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). After offense-level adjustments for a prior drug-trafficking conviction and acceptance of responsibility, his offense level was 21, corresponding to an advisory Guidelines range of 41-51 months imprisonment. Villalobos requested a sentence below that range. The imposed 41-month sentence was within, and at the low end of, it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-16\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>sentences are reviewed for reasonableness. <em>E.g., United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 706 (5th Cir.2006). Because the sentence was within the properly-calculated Guideline range (Villalobos does <em>not </em>contend otherwise), it is presumed reasonable. <em>E.g., United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006). Such a sentence is given \u201cgreat deference\u201d, and we infer the sentencing court \u201chas considered all the [\u00a7 3553(a) ] factors for a fair sentence\u201d. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Further, when the court states it is imposing a sentence within the Guideline range, as was done here, \u201clittle explanation [for such sentence] is required\u201d. <em>Id. </em>Villalobos has failed to rebut his sentence\u2019s presumed reasonableness. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554 \u2014 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-19\">Villalobos also challenges, in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated-felony convictions as sentencing factors, rather than elements of the offense. As he concedes, this challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Nonetheless, he raises it in order to preserve its further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b373-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
