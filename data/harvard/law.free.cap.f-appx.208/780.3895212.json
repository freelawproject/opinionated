Marquez argues that the district court erroneously denied him a safety-valve reduction. U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 5C1.2, 2Dl.l(b)(9). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-24\">\u2018When reviewing the denial of safety-valve relief, we review for clear error a district court\u2019s factual determinations. We review <em>de novo </em>the court\u2019s legal interpretation of the statutes and sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ted). Section 2D1.1(b)(9) of the Sentencing Guidelines permits a two-level decrease of a defendant\u2019s offense level, if the defendant meets the five requirements of the safety-valve provision, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(1) \u2014 (5). The burden is on the defendant to establish that he has satisfied all the requirements. <em>Johnson, </em>375 F.3d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The issue presented is whether Marquez satisfied the fifth requirement that \u201cnot later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant has truthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence the defendant has concerning the offense or offenses that were part of the same course of conduct or of a common scheme or plan .... \u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5). Marquez argues that he satisfied this requirement because, before sentencing, he discussed with the government all of the details that he had regarding the offense, except drug quantity. He argues that he disclosed the drug quantity at sentencing when he stipulated that the amount of drugs was 10,000 or more pills.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The district court denied the reduction because it found that Marquez had never disclosed the quantity of pills involved in his offense, and the sentencing transcript confirms this finding. Marquez did not disclose the quantity of pills involved in his offense. When asked by the district court about the quantity, Marquez declined to state the number of pills and chose to rely on his stipulation. The district court did not clearly err when it denied the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Marquez\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
