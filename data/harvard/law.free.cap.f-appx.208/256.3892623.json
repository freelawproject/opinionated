He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the docket sheet reveals that the magistrate judge since has filed his report and recommendations, recommending that Veal\u2019s motion be denied. Accordingly, while we grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis, because the district court recently has acted in Veal\u2019s case, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-26\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
