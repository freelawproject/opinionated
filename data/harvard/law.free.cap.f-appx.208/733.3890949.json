Capone and Ella Sandra D. Capone, a minor by and through her father, James M. Capone (\u201cAppellants\u201d) appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of their Amended Complaint asserting personal injury claims against the Defendants Appellee Ruffin\u2019s Crystal Palace Hotel Corporation, Ltd., a Bahamian Limited Liability Company d/b/a The Wyndham Nassau Resort and Crystal Palace Casino (\u201cAppellee\u201d). Appellants\u2019 personal injury claims arise from injuries Appellant James M. Capone sustained when he dove from a seawall at the Appellee\u2019s Wyndham Nassau Resort and Crystal Palace Casino (the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u201cNassau Resort\u201d) and are based on Appellee\u2019s alleged negligence, <em>inter alia, </em>in failing to install railings and to post appropriate warnings for and to business invitees utilizing the swimming area of the resort. The district court granted Appellee\u2019s motion to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked personal jurisdiction over the Appellee under Florida\u2019s long arm statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Appellants and Appellee now concede that the outcome of this appeal as to the personal jurisdiction issue is controlled by this Court\u2019s recent opinion in <em>Stubbs v. Wyndham Nassau Resort &amp; Crystal Palace Casino, </em>447 F.3d 1357, 1360-64 (11th Cir.2006), and that based on that precedent this Court must reverse the dismissal of Appellants\u2019 Amended Complaint in this case. In <em>Stubbs, </em>this Court concluded that the Nassau Resort in that case, which is the same as in this case, was \u201cengaged in substantial and not isolated activity within\u201d Florida and that general personal jurisdiction existed over the Nassau Resort under Florida\u2019s long arm statute, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 48.193(2). <em>Stubbs, </em>447 F.3d at 1363. In <em>Stubbs, </em>this Court expressly noted that the defendants had also raised venue and forum non conveniens issues, that the district court had ruled based on the personal jurisdiction issue, and that the district court did not address any other issue. <em>Stubbs, </em>447 F.3d at 1360.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Appellees point out that the district court in this case, like the district court in <em>Stubbs, </em>ruled on only the personal jurisdiction issue and did not rule on the venue or forum non conveniens issues. Appellees request that we remand this case so that the district court may address these other issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order dismissing the Amended Complaint based on lack of personal jurisdiction is reversed, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b758-20\">.
