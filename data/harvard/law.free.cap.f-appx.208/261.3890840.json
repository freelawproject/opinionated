This court previously affirmed Melvin\u2019s conviction on direct appeal but vacated and remanded Melvin\u2019s sentence in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See United States v. Melvin, </em>147 Fed. Appx. 370 (4th Cir.2005). In the instant appeal, Melvin\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but raising the issue of whether Melvin\u2019s sentence was unduly harsh. Melvin\u2019s counsel concedes the issue is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449 (4th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">After the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>a sentencing court is no longer bound by the range prescribed by the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir. 2005). However, in determining a sentence <em>post-Booker, </em>sentencing courts are still required to calculate and consider the guideline range as well as the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). As stated in <em>Hughes, </em>this court will affirm a <em>post-Booker </em>sentence if it is both reasonable and within the statutorily prescribed range. <em>Id. </em>at 546-47. Further, this court has stated that \u201cwhile we believe that the appropriate circumstances for imposing a sentence outside the guideline range will depend on the facts of individual cases, we have no reason to doubt that most sentences will continue to fall within the applicable guideline range.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>405 F.3d 208, 219 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 668, 163 L.Ed.2d 539 (2005). Indeed, \u201ca sentence imposed \u2018within the properly calculated Guidelines range ... is presumptively reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456-57 (4th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 687 (7th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 1455, 164 L.Ed.2d 151 (2006)) (No. 05-8986), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 126 S.Ct. 2309, 164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-20\">We find that the district court properly calculated the guideline range and appropriately treated the guidelines as advisory. The court sentenced Melvin only after considering and examining the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). The court also clearly noted that it found the guidelines, \u201calthough advisory, provide an appropriate basis for determining a sentence in this case.\u201d Based on these factors, and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>cause the court sentenced Melvin within the applicable guideline range and the statutory m\u00e1ximum, we find that Melvin\u2019s sentence of 151 months of imprisonment is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have examined the entire record and find no meritorious sentencing issues for appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm Melvin\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. Accordingly, we also deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw as counsel. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may renew his motion for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b287-13\"> Because this case is back before the court after remand for resentencing, the scope of our review is limited to sentencing issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
