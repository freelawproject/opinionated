Melinsky appeal their convictions for conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000); bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2000); and false statements in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014 (2000). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The Melinskys first argue that the Government violated <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), because it faded to disclose that it lacked proof of Suzanne Melinsky\u2019s prior criminal conviction. We agree with the district court that the Melinskys\u2019 <em>Brady </em>claim lacks merit because the Government is not required to provide a defendant with information that the defendant has or with reasonable diligence could obtain himself. <em>Stockton v. Murray, </em>41 F.3d 920, 927 (4th Cir.1994). Additionally, the information was not exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">The Melinskys next argue the evidence was insufficient to support their convictions for counts One, Two, and Eight of the indictment, because they lacked the requisite mens rea for these offenses. A jury\u2019s verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, and inquire whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to support a conclusion of the defendants\u2019 guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). We do not review the credibility of the witnesses and assume that the jury resolved all contradictions in the testimony in favor of the government. <em>United States v. Romer, </em>148 F.3d 359, 364 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-14\">With respect to Count One, to prove a conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371, the government must establish an agreement to commit an offense, willing participation by the defendants, and an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>See United States v. Tucker, </em>376 F.3d 236, 238 (4th Cir.2004). Knowledge and participation in the conspiracy may be proven by circumstantial evidence. <em>Id., citing United States v. Meredith, </em>824 F.2d 1418, 1428 (4th Cir.1987). Count Two alleged bank fraud, for which the government must establish that the defendants knowingly executed a scheme to obtain the money, funds, or other property owned by or under the control of a financial institution by means of material false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, and that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>did so with the intent to defraud, and the financial institution was insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. <em>See United States v. Bales, </em>813 F.2d 1289, 1293 (4th Cir.1987). Count Eight required the government to prove that the Melinskys knowingly made a false statement or willfully overvalued a property or security for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of the Small Business Administration or First Savings Bank of Virginia. We conclude the evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to prove that the Melinskys possessed the mens rea alleged in the challenged counts of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The Melinskys challenge the district court\u2019s denial of Raymond\u2019s request to provide the jury with a \u201cpuffing\u201d instruction. This court reviews a district court\u2019s jury instructions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bolden, </em>325 F.3d 471, 486 (4th Cir.2003). Failure to give a requested instruction is not reversible error unless the instruction (1) was correct; (2) was not substantially covered by the court\u2019s charge to the jury; and (3) dealt with some point in the trial so important that failure to give the requested instruction seriously impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to conduct his defense. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>150 F.3d 382, 388 (4th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Here, the district court provided the jury with an extensive instruction regarding the good faith of the Melinskys as a complete defense to the charge of bank fraud (Count Two of the indictment). We find the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to give the proposed \u201cpuffing\u201d instruction. <em>See United States v. Thaw, </em>353 F.2d 581, 584-85 (4th Cir.1965) (holding that when substance of requested puffing charge covered in instructions given, failure to give puffing instruction not error).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">We therefore affirm the Melinskys\u2019 convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
