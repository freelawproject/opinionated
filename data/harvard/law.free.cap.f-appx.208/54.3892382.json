Schoppert denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Hasan Uzun, </em>No. A79 424 963 (B.I.A. Mar. 29, 2006), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 424 963 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 10, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.Bd 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 401 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">An applicant who has established past persecution is entitled to a presumptive well-founded fear of future persecution which may be rebutted if the government proves that there has been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the applicant\u2019s life or freedom would not be threatened or if it proves that the \u201capplicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the proposed country of removal.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). Although it is not clear whether the IJ found past persecution, we assume that he did in accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation to that effect. Accordingly, the IJ erred in finding that Uzun did not \u201cestablish that <em>at present </em>he has a well-founded fear.\u201d (emphasis added). It was not Uzun\u2019s burden of proof to establish that he possessed a well-founded fear, but the government\u2019s burden to rebut the regulatory presumption that arose from a finding of past persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b). Although the two-year period that Uzun lived in Turkey without incident after his second arrest may undermine his presumptive well-founded fear, we cannot confidently predict the same result if the IJ had applied the correct burden of proof. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 162 (2d Cir.2006) (ruling that remand is futile where we can confidently predict that the IJ would have reached the same decision absent errors).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">The IJ also erred through placing excessive reliance on the State Department Report as the only other evidence that conditions in Turkey had fundamentally changed since Uzun\u2019s departure. We have provided guidance on how State Department country reports should be utilized, emphasizing that \u201cthe immigration court should be careful not to place excessive reliance\u201d on them. <em>Tambadou v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 298, 302 (2d Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 130 (2d Cir.2004)). Although the IJ accurately noted that the State Department Report indicates that (1) 2002 parliamentary elections in Turkey brought to power an Islamist Party, (2) the Turkish government enacted a number of human rights related reforms and (3) the country generally respected the human rights of its citizens, these observations alone do not sustain a finding that there are fundamentally changed circumstances in the country where several other sections of the Report detail a pattern of human rights abuses in certain areas of Turkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Finally, we lack authority to review claims for relief that were not exhausted before the BIA. <em>Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 117 (2d Cir.2006). An applicant\u2019s inclusion of such claims in the prayer for relief to the BIA does not exhaust a claim where he or she fails to make an argument in support of the claim or to identify, at least by implication, any error in the IJ\u2019s ruling concerning the claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>See Id. </em>Here, although Uzun mentioned in his prayer for relief to the BIA that the IJ erroneously denied him withholding of removal and CAT relief, he makes no other reference to or arguments concerning those claims. Accordingly, we deny those claims for lack of administrative exhaustion.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is REMANDED in part and DENIED in part. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED. Any pending request for oral arguments in this case is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
