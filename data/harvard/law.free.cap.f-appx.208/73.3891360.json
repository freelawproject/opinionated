Ct. Buffalo Aug. 14, 2001). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-20\">When the BIA summarily affirms an IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>Ming Xia Chen v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006). Petitioner claims that (1) the IJ erred by applying a heightened legal standard to petitioner\u2019s application, requiring him to demonstrate outstanding and unusual equities before the IJ could exercise his discretion to grant the application; (2) the IJ erred as a matter of law in evaluating the equities of petitioner\u2019s application by considering petitioner\u2019s conduct relating to the underlying basis of removability, where no criminal charges resulted from that conduct; and (3) petitioner received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-21\">We need not determine whether petitioner\u2019s claims concerning the standard used and the conduct considered by the IJ are \u201csubsidiary\u201d to the issues raised before the BIA, <em>Gill v. INS, </em>420 F.3d 82, 87 (2d Cir.2005), or whether the claims present \u201ccolorable ... questions of law sufficient to invoke our jurisdiction under the REAL ID Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D),\u201d <em>Avendano-Espejo v. Department of Homeland Security, </em>448 F.3d 503, 505 (2d Cir.2006), because we would deny both these claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>even if they had been argued to the BIA and if jurisdiction were proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See Marquez-Almanzar v. INS, </em>418 F.3d 210, 216 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005) (assuming hypothetical jurisdiction where jurisdictional issues involved only statutory, and not constitutional, jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">First, although the IJ noted in his introductory description of the law regarding cancellation of removal that \u201cin some cases\u201d an alien may have to demonstrate \u201cunusual or outstanding equities\u201d in order to warrant a favorable exercise of discretion \u2014 a standard that the BIA subsequently held to be obsolete as the result of changes to federal immigration law in 1996, <em>see In re Sotelo-Sotelo, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 201, 203-04 (BIA 2001) \u2014 nothing in the IJ\u2019s analysis suggests that he considered such a standard applicable to petitioner\u2019s case or that the IJ did anything but \u201cweigh the favorable and adverse factors to determine whether, on balance, the totality of the evidence before [him] indicated] that the [petitioner] ... adequately demonstrated that he warranted] a favorable exercise of discretion, and a grant of cancellation of removal____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204 (internal quotation marks omitted). Second, petitioner cites to no statute, regulation, or case law that prohibits an IJ, when deciding whether to grant cancellation of removal, from taking into account the grounds for a petitioner\u2019s removal, and any conduct associated with those grounds, unless criminal charges have been filed. Petitioner merely points out the unremarkable facts that <em>In re Thomas, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 20 (BIA 1995), one of the cases cited to by the IJ in his summary of the law, involved an alien who had been convicted of crimes and that other cases have involved aliens who have been charged with crimes. Petitioner offers no authority that calls into question the IJ\u2019s right, when making a discretionary decision, to consider \u201cthe nature and underlying circumstances\u201d of the ground for petitioner\u2019s removal. <em>See In re Marin, </em>16 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 581, 584 (BIA 1978) (discussing adverse factors that an IJ might consider in deciding whether to grant discretionary relief under another section of the Immigration and Nationality Act); <em>Sotelo-Sotelo, </em>23 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. at 203 (general standards for exercising discretion as enunciated in <em>Marin </em>are applicable to cancellation of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">We deny petitioner\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel because petitioner has offered no proof that he has raised this claim before the BIA in the first instance or that he has substantially complied with the administrative requirements of <em>In re Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. 637 (BIA 1988). <em>See Zheng v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>409 F.3d 43, 46-47 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">. Because we assume hypothetical jurisdiction over these claims and review their merits, we have no cause to address petitioner\u2019s dubious contention that limitations on judicial review would somehow render the summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s decision by a single member of the BIA a violation of due process.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
