That if the j ury find from the evidence before them, that on the 29th day of April, 1879, Rachel Gfoldschmitt, the defendant, made and executed the deed that has been offered in evidence from Rachel Gfoldschmitt to Jacob Rose; that at the time said deed-\u2019was executed, the said defendant was indebted to various persons in the sum of twentyeig\u2019ht hundred dollars, and that among others, she was indebted to the plaintiffs in the sum stated in their affidavit; that the property covered by said deed, was worth between one thousand and thirteen hundred dollars, and that the said deed was made in bad faith, and with the intent, and for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding the creditors of the said Rachel Gfoldschmitt, then the deed is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b546-11\">2. That if the jury find from the evidence before them, that the deed offered in evidence, and referred to in the first prayer of the plaintiffs, was a part of a fraudulent scheme, and device on the part of Rachel Gfoldschmitt, the defendant, to cheat the plaintiffs, and all her other creditors, save those preferred in the deed, that the said deed was made in had faith, and for the purpose of hindering, delaying and defrauding her creditors of their just and lawful actions and debts, then the deed is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>8.

That if the jury shall find from the evidence before them, the facts set forth in the first three prayers, then the mere fact that the preferred debts, mentioned in the deed, were due and owing, and were <em>bona fide </em>debts, does not preclude the plaintiffs from impeaching the validity of said deed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b547-6\">5.

In other words, the deed being upon its face a. valid assignment, the appellants had offered no evidence from which a jury could reasonably find that it was fraudulent in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">A debtor, it is admitted, may make an assignment of his property, and provide for the payment of one class of creditors in preference to another. Abstractly considered, it may he more equitable to provide for the payment of all alike, hut as the debtor may, by actual payment of money, prefer one creditor to another, for the same reason he may assign his property, so long as it remains unaffected by liens, in trust, to sell the same and apply the proceeds to the payment of certain debts in preference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>to others. All the law requires is that the conveyance shall he made in good faith and upon a valid consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">As regards the conveyance now before us, it is upon its face unquestionably a valid assignment in law. It contains no provision exacting releases of creditors, nor is there a provision or reservation of any kind expressly or impliedly enuring to the benefit of the assignor. On the contrary, it is upon its face an unconditional conveyance of property in trust for the payment of creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">But though fair and valid on its face, it may, in fact it is said, to be a mere device or contrivance to defraud creditors. This is true. It may be made for the purpose of concealing or covering up the .debtor\u2019s property, or to force creditors to accept a compromise, or in pursuance of an agreement or understanding with the assignee or the preferred creditors, by which the assignor is to derive some advantage or benefit inconsistent with the legal rights and remedies of creditors. If so, it is as much within the condemnation of the statute as if the fraud had been written on its face. The burden of proof, however, in such cases is upon the creditor assailing the assignment, and he must offer evidence from which a jury may reasonably find that though valid on its face, it is fraudulent in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">This case then comes down to this, was there any. such evidence offered by the appellants ? We think not. There is no proof that the assignment in question was made for the purpose of concealing the property of the assignor, nor any proof of a secret trust or understanding with the trustee or any one else that she was to derive any benefit from its execution as against the rights of creditors. The trustee is not even a creditor, and the proof shows that he accepted the trust at the request of Mrs. G-oldschmitt, and after both Mr. Walter and Rohr had declined. He gave bond as required by law, took possession of the -property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>and at once had it appraised. Now a great deal was said about the removal of part of the goods from the store on the morning after the conveyance was made; hut whatever suspicion may arise from this fact, his reasons for the removal are fully explained in his testimony. The goods thus removed were sold by him, and whether he acted discreetly or indiscreetly in this respect, he acted on his own responsibility and without consulting the assignor or the preferred creditors. So we find nothing either surrounding the execution of the conveyance, or in the subsequent conduct of the trustee, from which fraud could be inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Besides this the proof shows the assignment was made upon a valid consideration, with the exception of Miss Laucheimer\u2019s claim of $350. No attempt is made to impeach the debts preferred by the deed; and we see no good reason to question the genuineness of her claim. She proves she loaned the money, and Mrs. G-oldschmitt admits she borrowed it, and her bank-book shows she had the money in bank. Whether it was a few dollars more or less than $350 is not material. If there be any question as to the precise amount, this can be determined in the audit and distribution of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The extent to which the evidence offered by the appellants goes is to prove the insolvency of Mrs. Qoldschjnitt, and that she continued business and continued to buy goods, after she knew or ought to have known, that she was unable to pay for the same. But even in this aspect it is but just to say that her purchases during the twelve months prior to the assignment were far less than the preceding twelve months; and further than this, the record shows that in the four months preceding the assignment, she bought of the appellants goods to the amount of $29L 60 and during the same time paid to them $260, leaving balance due of only $31.60. But this is a matter not material to this case. The fact that she was insolvent did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>prevent her from making an assignment of her property for the benefit of creditors. And even if she had fraudulently contracted debts within the meaning of the Act of 1864, this would not affect the assignment unless there was some connection between the debts thus contracted and the assignment itself. And of this there is not a particle of proof. On the contrary, she continued to buy and to pay as usual up to the very day, when the pressure of creditors forced her to make the conveyance. If she had fraudulently contracted debts with the appellants, they had a right to the writ of attachment under the Act of 1864, but they had no right under the writ, to take property which she, prior to the issuing of the writ, had conveyed in trust for the benefit of creditors. <em>Horwitz, garnishee, vs. Ellinger, </em>31 <em>Md., </em>492.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b553-9\">(Decided 8th March, 1883.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">The case of <em>Main &amp; McKillip, Garnishee vs. Lynch, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>658, so much relied on by the appellants, stands on a different ground from this case. In dealing with the plaintiff\u2019s prayers in that case, the Court say; there was evidence that the assignor, Wagoner, had been disposing of and concealing his property to defraud his creditors, and that Main, one of the assignees had aided and abetted him in furtherance of his fraudulent purpose. The question whether the assignment was fraudulent in fact, was submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">But in this case there is no evidence from which a jury could reasonably find a fraudulent purpose on the part of Mrs. Groldschmitt, and the assignment being valid on its face, the Court properly rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 prayers and granted the instruction offered by the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">Eor these reasons the judgment below will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
