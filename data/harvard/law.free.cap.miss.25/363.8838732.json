The bond is full of patent ambiguities, which cannot be \u201cholpen by averments\u201d in the declaration; and the reason is, because the law will not couple and mingle matter of speciality, which is of the higher account, with matter of averment, which is of inferior account in law; for that were to make all deeds hollow, and subject to averments, and so, in effect, that to pass without deed which the law appointeth shall not pass but by deed. 1 Greenl.

The bond, on its face, is a <em>nudum </em>pactum, and does not impose any liability, for want of a consideration, as the bond of third persons, wholly unconnected with the case, and for want \u25a0of authority in the sheriff to take it. Comyn on Con. 23.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-5\">The bond, on its face, is at war with the averments of the \u2022amended declaration, and contradicts the same, even as the bond of third persons unconnected with the case, in this, to wit: \u201c That after the making of said levy, that said plaintiff did apply to defendant, Thrasher, -who was then and there attorney and agent for Lawrence, Reese, &amp; Co., plaintiffs in said execution; and said Thrasher, as attorney and agent as aforesaid, executed and delivered said bond, with said Allen as his security therein.\u201d If either Allen or Thrasher can be considered as security, the one for the pther, then the legal presumption is, from the face of the bond itself, that it is the bond \u25a0of said Allen, with said Thrasher as his security; for the name \u25a0of Allen is first signed to the bond, and that of said Thrasher follows, as the security of said Allen. He cannot be the security to a bond who signs it first (in legal presumption); for, until the name of the principal is signed, that principal cannot .give security; there is no one to become security for until there is first a principal. The legal presumption, therefore, is, that Allen executed the bond first, as principal, and Thrasher secondly, as Allen\u2019s security.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b370-6\">By the statute, (H. &amp; PI. \u00a7 4, 589,) all sealed instruments are allowed to be impeached, by special plea, for want of a consideration. An obligation under seal, for the debt or undertaking of another person, may be impeached for want of a consideration; but where the want of consideration appears upon the face of the instrument itself, neither plea nor other proof is required, but the usual way of taking advantage of it is by demurrer. The instrument is said to be void on its face; and if the defendant has pleaded bad pleas, to which the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tiff demurs, the court will visit the demurrer back to the declaration upon the void instrument. 2 Porter, R. 473, 478; 4 Stewart &amp; Porter, R. 404-408 ; 2 lb. 268; 5 Monroe, 31.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-5\">3. The statute of this State (PI. &amp; PI. \u00a7. 11, 631,) authorizes the sheriff or other officer, on the, levy of an execution upon property, where a doubt shall arise whether the right of such property is in the debtor or not, \u201c to apply to the plaintiff, his attorney or agent, for his bond, with good security,\u201d \u2014 not his, her, or their bond, but \u201c his bond,\u201d meaning the plaintiff\u2019s bond-, but which bpnd the plaintiff might execute by his attorney or agent. The statute confines it to the bond of the plaintiff in the execution, and will admit of no other legitimate construction, without a perversion of language and of intellect. The language of the statute is, &lt;\u00a3,his bo\u2019nd,\u201d which can never be tortured into his, her, or their bond, by judicial legislation, as contended for by the plaintiff in error, in order to admit of the bond of a third person, who, at the same time, happened to be an attorney or agent of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-6\">The bond under consideration is not the bond of Lawrence, Reese, &amp; Co.; nor does it purport to be executed by an attorney or agent for them; nor by Allen and Thrasher, as attorney or agent for Lawrence, Reese &amp; Co., or for any other person. Whose bond is it? If it is the bond of Allen and Thrasher, then it is without consideration, which appears upon the face of the bond; and a bond, to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another, must show the consideration, under our statute of frauds. The bond of third persons, unauthorized by the statute, taken <em>colore </em>officii, is void. In a statutory bond, it is necessary to follow the form prescribed- by statute. 5 How.

The statute prescribes the bond of the plaintiff in execution, and the sheriff took the bond of third persons, wholly unconnected with the case. A bond taken <em>colore officii, </em>if it does not conform to the statute, is void. 5 Mass. R. 541.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\">That the bond in this case was taken <em>colore officii, </em>will not admit of a doubt; it is made payable to the sheriff, in his official character, and is sought to be enforced in his name, officially, for the use of the plaintiff in error, and grew out of a judicial proceeding; so that it has all the tests of a statutory bond, and is invalid as a statutory bond, in not being executed by the plaintiff in the execution. This point has been repeatedly decided in the courts of Alabama and this State. The case of <em>Sewall </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>2 Porter, R. 493, was an analogous case to the one under consideration, in which the sheriff took the replevy bond of third parties for goods attached by him, instead of the bond of the defendant in the attachment; and the court decided, that as a statute bond it was invalid, on the ground of its not having been executed by the defendant in the attachment, or by any one as agent, attorney, or factor for him. 2 lb. 498, 507.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-5\">The case of <em>Cummings </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>4 Stewart &amp; Porter, R. 404\u2014 408, is in point and decisive of the case under consideration, being the replevin bond of third persons, with security, and conclusive as to the amended declaration in this case, pleadings and demurrer, to the pleas which were adjudged by the court, in that case, to extend back to the declaration upon the replevy bond. \u201c The principal objection against the declaration,\u201d in that case, say the court, \u201c is, that it is founded on a replevy bond, given by persons who do not appear or purport to have had any authority to act for the defendant in the attachment. The statute of 1807 authorizes only the defendant, his attorney, agent, or factor, to-replevy the estate attached.\u201d This statute of Alabama is, almost word for word, that of our own statute, upon which the bond under consideration was taken. 4 lb. 404. Again say the court in that ease: \u201cNo authority is found by which a stranger, or any indifferent person, can claim the right to replevy property attached,\u201d &amp;c. Unless the replevy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>has been made by one who, by law, could claim the right to do so, the bond cannot fall within the provision of the statute regulating the condition thereof, and authorizing its assignment to the plaintiff by the sheriff. 4 S. &amp; P. R. 407.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b373-4\">A forthcoming bond, taken without security, is void, for want-of authority in the officer to take it. 6 How. R. 296.

Moore, for the use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Sylvester C. Keyes, founded upon a certain bond of indemnity executed by the defendants on the 18th day of March, 1846, to the said plaintiff, as sheriff of said county.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The defendants below demurred to the declaration, and the demurrer was sustained by the court. From which judgment the case is brought into this court by writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The facts averred in the declaration are as follows: On the 4th day of June, 1841, Lawrence, Neese, &amp; Co. recovered a judgment in Claiborne circuit court against the said Sylvester C. Keyes and one Josiah Kundell, for the sum of if1,532.24. On the 12th day of December, 1842, Keyes having filed his petition in the United States district court at Jackson, praying to be declared a bankrupt, received his certificate as a bankrupt. On the 3d of February, 1844, he purchased certain personal property which was seized by the sheriff of said county, by virtue of an execution issued upon said judgment in the early part of the year 1846.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Upon this state of facts, John B. Thrasher, one of the defendants herein, and the attorney of Lawrence, Reese, &amp; Co., executed the bond in question, with Allen as his security, to the plaintiff as sheriff of said county.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The bond, after reciting the levy of the execution, and stating that \u201c a doubt had arisen, whether the right of said property was in the defendants Keyes and Kundell, or not, sets forth the following condition : Now, if the said Allen and Thrasher shall indemnify the said Richard M. Moore, sheriff as aforesaid, against all damages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure or sale of said property; and moreover shall pay and satisfy to any person or persons, claiming title to said property, all damages which such person or persons may sustain in consequence of such seizure or sale, then this obligation to be void.\u201d The declaration, after setting out the levy of the execution upon the property of Keyes, acquired on the 3d of February, 1844, after his bankruptcy, contains the following-breach, to wit: <em>\u201c </em>And so the said plaintiff in fact says, that the said stock of jewelry and other articles, so levied on as aforesaid, are not subject to the said execution of the said Lawrence, Neese, &amp; Co.; nor liable to be seized and taken by virtue thereof; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>and the said Keyes, by reason of the seizure thereof, as aforesaid, hath suffered and been subjected to great loss and .damages.\u201d The breach then proceeds to state definitely the damages sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Under this statement of the case, the question arises, whether the action can be maintained upon this bond against the defendants. The object of the statute in allowing the plaintiff in execution, his attorney, or agent, to execute a bond of indemnity to the sheriff in any case, is to transfer the liability,. to which he subjected himself by the seizure and sale of the property under the execution,\"-to the persons executing the bond. The obligors in the bond only make themselves liable for such damages as the injured party without it could have, recovered from the sheriff. Suppose, then, that the sheriff had proceeded to sell the property under the execution, without taking this bond, and Keyes had brought his action against the sheriff, could he, under the state of facts averred in the declaration, have recovered damages ? This question appears almost too clear to require an answer. The sheriff, by his plea, j usti-fies his action under process, emanating upon a judgment which does not appear of record to have been satisfied or discharged. The execution contains no evidence of payment or satisfaction. The certificate in bankruptcy would have afforded no defence whatever to this plea, for the very plain reason, that it contained- matter going in discharge of the judgment since its recovery, and not appearing of record, or upon the execution, it was the duty of the defendant to have availed himself of this defence against the judgment by <em>audita querela </em>and <em>supersedeas </em>to the execution. The sheriff may have been wholly ignorant of proceedings in -bankruptcy; but even if he had been fully informed on the subject, it was not a question to be adjudicated by a mere ministerial officer, but by a judicial tribunal.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">It is to our minds clear, that no action could have been sustained against the sheriff. Whatever would be a good defence to him, if no bond had been taken, will also be a good defence to those who, by the bond, assume his liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The sheriff, under the facts ch\u00e1rged, was bound at his peril <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to proceed in executing the writ. He levied upon the property of the parties to the judgment; in this he committed no trespass, and was, therefore, liable to no damages. It may be true, that Keyes would have a remedy in a different form of action against the plaintiffs in the execution to recover back the money, or the value of the property; but this question is not involved, and we, therefore, give no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
