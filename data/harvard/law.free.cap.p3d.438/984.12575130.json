We grant the petitions as reflected now in Part II.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   MORTENSEN, Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b61 After accusing her wife (Wife) of infidelity, Defendant Teresa Marie Alires threatened to beat and kill Wife in the presence of their infant child and teenage niece. As their argument escalated, Alires threatened to strangle Wife-and then proceeded to do so. She slapped Wife, pushed her up against the wall, struck her in the head, lifted her by the throat, and threw her onto the couch. Placing both hands on Wife's neck, Alires pushed down until Wife could not breathe and could barely make any sounds. After thirty seconds, Alires let go of Wife, who then left the house and called the police. The State charged Alires with two counts of domestic violence in the presence of a child and one count of aggravated assault. At trial, Alires requested a self-defense instruction, but the court denied it. The jury convicted her on all charges. Alires now appeals on three grounds. First, she contends that the trial court erred in holding that the evidence presented was sufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she used force likely to cause death or serious bodily injury. Second, she argues that she was erroneously denied a self-defense instruction. Third, she claims constitutional error. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Domestic Incident\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 Alires and Wife married in 2010 and had a child together in 2014. Wife described their marriage as \"fearful,\" stating that they had committed acts of domestic violence upon each other throughout their marriage, though Wife claimed that she had only ever acted in self-defense against Alires's abuse. One morning, an argument between Alires and Wife erupted into physical violence. The disagreement-which their fifteen-year-old niece (Niece) recorded on a cell phone-escalated after Wife told Alires that she would not get custody of their fourteen-month-old child in the event of a divorce. Alires threw a plate of fruit at Wife, calling her a \"fucking slut,\" a \"dumb bitch,\" and a\n   \"true whore.\" She told Wife that she was \"very, very replaceable\" and said, \"[T]he only thing that works is fuckin' smackin' you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 When Wife said she would take their infant child away from Alires, she responded, \"Keep fucking talking about how you're gonna keep [him] from me ... and I will fucking choke you out right fucking now.\" As the argument continued, Alires threatened, \"Shut up ... or else I'll fucking kill you.\" When Wife told Alires to get a lawyer, Alires threw a hairbrush at Wife, who was holding their child. Niece took the child from Wife and left the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 After Niece departed, Alires told Wife, \"Come get your beat-down bitch,\" and then forced Wife against the wall and began slapping and punching her in the head. Wife tried to stop her, but Alires lifted Wife up by the neck, threw her on the couch, and pinned her there. Alires then placed both of her hands around Wife's neck and began strangling her, pressing with \"weight galore.\" Although Wife did not lose consciousness, she could not breathe, speak, or scream for help. Wife tried to free herself, but was unable. After approximately thirty seconds, Alires let go of Wife's neck. Wife immediately took their child and Niece outside and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The police arrived and examined Wife. Although Wife refused formal medical treatment, the officer who responded to the call (Officer) observed several injuries, including a bump and bruise on Wife's head, a scratch on her chest, and red markings around her neck. For a couple of days following the incident, Wife's throat hurt and she could not eat or swallow. Wife was \"emotional,\" \"hysterical,\" and \"in distress.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 Officer also interviewed Alires, but Officer did not notice any injuries or marks on Alires's body. In fact, Alires said that she \"couldn't be injured because she was stronger than [Wife].\" Officer testified that Alires admitted to choking Wife but claimed that she acted in self-defense. Alires alleged that she and Wife had gotten into an argument and Wife had slapped her, so \"she slapped [Wife] back, and then had to restrain her.\" Alires further asserted that, in an effort to subdue Wife, Alires had \"grabbed onto [Wife's] throat, sort of lifted her up, and then pushed her down onto the couch,\" holding her there by the neck until Wife had \"calmed down.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Summary of Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The State charged Alires with one count of aggravated assault and two counts of commission of domestic violence in the presence of a child. Alires was tried by a jury. At trial, the State presented evidence against Alires, including an audio recording of the fight\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as testimony from Wife, Officer, and a forensic nurse (Nurse).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Without ever examining, interviewing, or reviewing Wife's injuries, Nurse explained that, in general, strangulation is \"any sort of outside force applying pressure to the neck\" that prevents oxygenated blood from reaching the brain, either by restricting blood flow or air intake.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nurse further testified that symptoms of strangulation included loss of\n   consciousness, bowel release, urination, difficulty swallowing, hoarseness, shortness of breath, voice changes, scratches, claw marks, and bruises. She elaborated that it would take only three minutes of complete obstruction of the carotid arteries to cause death, but some cells in the brain can begin to die within six to ten seconds if deprived of oxygen-and once brain cells die, they do not regenerate. Additionally, she testified that lack of oxygen to the brain may have a \"traumatic brain effect\" that is \"similar to a concussion,\" especially if the event is recurring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 At the close of the State's presentation of evidence, Alires moved for a directed verdict, arguing that the evidence was insufficient on all counts. Responding to the charge of aggravated assault, Alires argued that there was no evidence that the alleged force used-thirty seconds of pressure on Wife's neck-was likely to produce death or serious bodily injury. Additionally, Alires argued that even if there was an aggravated assault, it did not occur in the presence of a child, and therefore she could not be convicted on the charges of domestic violence in the presence of a child. The court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Alires then testified on her own behalf, stating that Wife's account and Officer's account of what Alires told him after the accident were inaccurate. Alires said that she was angry but did not intend to literally carry out the threats against Wife. Notwithstanding her alleged admission to Officer that she had strangled Wife, Alires later claimed that after Wife instigated the fight, Alires's hand might have hit Wife's neck \"when [they] fell over the couch,\" but she did not choke or squeeze Wife's neck. Alires further testified that Officer asked her repeatedly if she restrained Wife by grabbing her neck, and she responded that she did not. She also testified that she was injured in the fight but withheld that information from Officer to protect Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 Finally, Alires claimed that other than this incident, she had never hit Wife-though she had \"restrained\" her several times throughout the course of their relationship-and until recently, it had been a \"very happy marriage.\" The State recalled Wife as a rebuttal witness, and she testified that prior to this incident Alires had punched her on sixty separate occasions throughout the course of their relationship. Wife added, \"[S]he made me believe that it was my fault that I was getting hit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b612 Alires requested a self-defense instruction, but the trial court determined that such an instruction was improper when \"someone denies the conduct that is the heart of the charge.\" And because Alires testified that she did not squeeze Wife's neck, the court determined that the situation did not \"call for a justification instruction.\" But the court did give a lesser-included-offense instruction for simple assault. A jury convicted Alires on all counts as charged, and Alires timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Alires first argues that there was insufficient evidence for the jury to conclude that her strangulation of Wife constituted means or force likely to cause death or serious bodily injury. We \"will reverse a jury conviction for insufficient evidence only when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict, is sufficiently inconclusive or inherently improbable that reasonable minds must have entertained a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the crime of which [she] was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, in the case at hand, the unrefuted testimony likewise established that the duration and force of strangulation was adequate to cause serious bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 We begin by reviewing the elements of the charged crimes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Utah Code section 76-5-103 states that aggravated assault is an actor's conduct that is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (i) an attempt, with unlawful force or violence, to do bodily injury to another;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (ii) a threat, accompanied by a show of immediate force or violence, to do bodily injury to another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (iii) an act, committed with unlawful force or violence, that causes bodily injury to another or creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   includes the use of a dangerous weapon or \"other means or force likely to produce death or serious bodily injury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-103\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-5-103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis Supp. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b618 Similarly, a person commits the crime of domestic violence in the presence of a child if, among other circumstances, the person uses \"means or force likely to produce death or serious bodily injury\" in the presence of a child.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-5-103\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-5-109.1(2)(b).

Alires challenges the sufficiency of the evidence presented to support the jury's finding that Wife's injury-thirty seconds of pressure to her neck-constituted serious bodily injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b620 But to find serious bodily injury \"[i]t is not necessary to prove that death or serious bodily injury occurred\"; it is only\n   necessary to prove that \"the actor used means or force likely to have that result.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

The jury heard that Alires strangled Wife for thirty seconds, in addition to threatening to \"choke [her] out\" and \"fucking kill her.\" Additionally, Nurse testified that after six to ten seconds, brain cells, which do not regenerate, begin to die if deprived of oxygen. From this evidence, a reasonable juror could find that Alires's actions were evidence of serious bodily injury or force likely to have that result. Therefore, the jury could properly convict her of both aggravated assault and domestic violence in the presence of a child. We therefore deny Alires's appeal on this point and affirm the denial of her directed verdict motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   II. Self-Defense Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b622 Alires next contends that the trial court erred in declining to give the jury a self-defense instruction regarding her conduct. Assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in refusing to give a self-defense instruction,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alires's claim fails due to the fact that even if error occurred, the error was harmless because the jury was not reasonably likely to acquit after hearing Wife's testimony and listening to a recording of the altercation between Alires and Wife.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b623 Harmless errors do not require reversal.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Alires has failed to persuade us that the alleged trial court error harmed her for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b624 First, based on the defense Alires presented at trial-in particular, her own testimony-there is \"no reasonable likelihood that the error affected the outcome of the proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33 (cleaned up). It must be acknowledged that Alires's main defense at trial was that she did not choke Wife. Alires insisted that she did not choke or squeeze Wife's neck, that she did not restrain Wife by grabbing her by the neck, and that her hand might have hit Wife's neck \"when [they] fell over the couch.\" However, to claim self-defense, Alires would have asked the jury to conclude that she did, in fact, choke or squeeze Wife's neck, or restrain Wife by grabbing her by the neck-albeit in self-defense. But this assertion would have contradicted her actual trial testimony and her primary defense entirely. Accordingly, had\n   the jury been permitted to consider Alires's proposed self-defense theory, the jury would have also had to acknowledge the discrepancy between her testimony at trial and other evidence, and conclude that Alires was not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 Second-and more importantly-any alleged error was harmless because \"there [wa]s overwhelming evidence in the record of the defendant's guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 33 (cleaned up).

The evidence Alires presented in support of her self-defense theory was comprised wholly of: (1) Alires's testimony that Wife was the aggressor and (2) Officer's testimony that Alires said that Wife had slapped her, so she had to \"slap[ ] [Wife] back, and then had to restrain her.\" This evidence is not likely to have raised a reasonable doubt in the jury's mind after considering the State's evidence, which included: (1) presentation to the jury of the recording in which Alires threatened Wife's life and shouted profanities at her; (2) Alires's admission that she slapped Wife while simultaneously claiming, \"I would never hurt her. I would never dream about hurting her. I've never hurt her before, nor after, nor would I ever\"; (3) Alires's assertion that she did not like fighting \"[but Wife] likes to scream really loud when we're fighting,\" while acknowledging that she was the one screaming on the recorded incident; (4) inconsistencies involving Alires's claim that her marriage was \"very happy\"; (5) Officer's testimony that Wife had several physical injuries, whereas Alires had none; and (6) Alires's prior conviction for giving a false report to a law enforcement officer, which further eroded Alires's credibility in the eyes of the jury. Again, as a result, any alleged error the trial court made is harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 Accordingly-even assuming without deciding that the trial court erred in failing to give the self-defense instruction-the trial court's error was harmless because, based on the overwhelming evidence presented against Alires at trial, there is no reasonable likelihood that the jury would have acquitted Alires. As a result, our confidence in the verdict is not undermined and thus, reversal is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   III. Constitutional Error\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b627 Lastly, Alires contends that if the denial of her self-defense instruction does not result in reversal as a matter of law, it should be reversed on the basis of \"constitutional\" error. \"As a general rule, claims not raised before the trial court may not be raised on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

First, Alires contends that denial of her self-defense instruction was a constitutional error preserved by the following statement made at trial by her attorney: \"Your Honor, based on the testimony, a self defense instruction might be warranted. I have some self defense instructions in here.\" Second, Alires points to her submission of proposed jury instructions to the court. Using these two passing instances, Alires attempts to elevate the issue to federal constitutional status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b629 But she has failed to show how these two instances would \"have alerted the trial court that denying [her request for jury instructions] would deprive [her] of [her] due process right.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
