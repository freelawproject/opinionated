In 2007, the District instituted significant increases to the rates it charged the Companies to attach their equipment to the utility poles. The Companies refused to pay the increased rates, and also refused to remove their equipment from the District's utility poles, leading the District to bring this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 In 2008, our legislature amended the statute governing utility pole attachment rates, RCW 54.04.045, effective June 12, 2008. The amendment included a specific rate calculation formula, the result of which would yield a \"just and reasonable\" rate. RCW 54.04.045(3)(a)-(c). Whether the District's revised rates complied with the amended statute became the central dispute of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 This is the second time that this matter has come before us on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub.

In deciding the first appeal, we held that none of the parties correctly interpreted the statutory formula set forth by the amended statute because, instead of interpreting and applying the words of the statute, the parties attempted to shoehorn the statutory language into various preexisting formulas.

Furthermore, the parties also dispute the validity of various data and inputs that the District utilized when calculating the maximum permissible rate allowed by the statute. We are presented with two principal issues: (1) whether the District abused its discretion when calculating the data and inputs it utilized to calculate the maximum permissible rate pursuant to RCW 54.04.045(3), and (2) whether the trial court erred by accepting the District's interpretation of the language set forth in RCW 54.04.045(3)(a). We affirm the trial court with respect to the District's choice of data and inputs, but reverse the trial court's interpretation of the language set forth in RCW 54.04.045(3)(a).

Ultimately, the trial court ruled that the District had correctly interpreted subsection (3)(a) and did not abuse its discretion when determining what data to rely on when calculating the maximum allowable pole attachment rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b631 At the remand trial, the District presented exhibits and testimony from the District's general manager regarding the District's process for determining whether its rate complied with RCW 54.04.045(3), as amended. The District's general manager\n   testified that, after reviewing our decision in\n   <em>\n    PUD I\n   </em>\n   , he looked through the amended version of RCW 54.04.045(3)(a) and attempted to convert the language of the statute to a numerical formula. Testifying specifically about his interpretation of the space allocator component of subsection (3)(a), the general manager explained that the space allocator component began with the language \"attributable to that portion of the pole, duct, or conduit\" and continued until the end of the paragraph. According to the general manager, this language corresponded to a two part mathematical formula in which the parts are added together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b632 For the first part, the general manager explained that he considered the language \"that portion of the pole, duct, or conduit used for the pole attachment\" to correspond to the following mathematical formula:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-60\">occupied ____________ usable space</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b633 For the second part, the general manager then considered the remaining language in subsection (3)(a), \"including a share of the required support and clearance space, in proportion to the space used for the pole attachment, as compared to all other uses made of the subject facilities and uses that remain available to the owner or owners of the subject facilities,\" concluding that it corresponded to the following mathematical formula:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-62\">occupied space (_______________) \u00d7 (support and clearance space) usable space (_____________________________________________________________) height of the pole</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b634 Thus, added together, the District's proposed interpretation of the formulaic expression of the space allocator component of subsection (3)(a) is:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-64\">occupied space (______________) \u00d7 (support and clearance space) occupied space usable space (_________________) + (__________________________________________________) usable space height of the pole</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b635 The general manager further testified to the District's process for determining whether its new rate was in compliance with RCW 54.04.045. He explained how the District's board of commissioners reviewed and adopted his interpretation of subsection (3)(a) and selected the data to rely on while calculating the rate. The commissioners met multiple times to discuss the District's pole attachment rate subsequent to our decision in\n   <em>\n    PUD I\n   </em>\n   . During these meetings, the general manager presented his analysis of RCW 54.04.045(3) and an analysis of the effect on the maximum allowable rate caused by relying on different data inputs when calculating the rate, such as using either gross or net expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The general manager made several recommendations to the commissioners\n   regarding the data that should be used to calculate the rate, including a recommendation that the District be permitted to use gross expenses and to classify the safety space as support and clearance (and therefore unusable) space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b636 At the conclusion of its meeting on November 3, 2015, the commissioners adopted Resolution No. 1364, which accepted the general manager's interpretation of RCW 54.04.045(3), including subsection (3)(a), accepted the general manager's selection of data to input into the formulas set forth in RCW 54.04.045(3), and concluded that the District's pole attachment rate was below the maximum rate permitted by the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b637 At trial, the Companies disputed the District's evaluation of subsection (3)(a) and asserted that the District abused its discretion when determining the data it input into the formulas in subsections (3)(a) and (3)(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the Companies, the proper interpretation of all of the language of subsection (3)(a) is:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-68\">occupied space (______________) \u00d7 (support and clearance space) occupied space usable space (_________________) + (_____________________________________________________) height of the pole height of the pole</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Companies further argued that this could be mathematically simplified to produce the following formula\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-70\">occupied space (________________) usable space</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b638 The Companies also claimed that the District included inappropriate charges in its rate calculation and misclassified the safety space as unusable space. The Companies' preferred data and rate methodology resulted in a maximum permissible rate that was significantly lower than the District's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b639 The trial court ruled in favor of the District, accepting its interpretation of subsection (3)(a) and adopting its selection of expenses and other data inputs when calculating the pole attachment rate. Following its ruling, the trial court entered supplemental findings of fact and conclusions of law on remand, findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding plaintiff Pacific PUD's motion for supplemental award of attorneys' fees and litigation expenses based on remand trial, an order awarding attorneys' fees and litigation expenses based on remand trial, and an amended and restated judgment. The trial court awarded the District its requested damages, including prejudgment interest and attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b640 The trial court rejected the Companies' interpretation of subsection (3)(a) because, in the judge's view, the Companies wanted the court \"to find that (3)(a) is the same as the FCC Cable Formula based on their interpretation of the 'space factor' and their formula simplification which results in (3)(a) being the FCC Cable formula.\" The trial court reasoned that \"[i]f the legislature had intended for (3)(a) to be the FCC Cable formula, the legislature would have no need to create a 'unique' formula. Therefore, an unstrained, plain reading of (3)(a) leads one to the logical conclusion that 3(a) is not, in its entirety, the FCC Cable formula.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b641 The trial court also rejected the Companies' arguments that the District had abused its discretion while determining the data to be used when calculating the pole attachment rate formula. The trial court\n   found that the testimony of the Companies' expert witness alleging that inappropriate data and methods were utilized to calculate the pole attachment rate was unhelpful when determining whether the District abused its discretion because she had little to no experience with a public utility such as the District.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b642 The Companies appealed to Division Two, which transferred the matter to us for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b643 The Companies contend that the District abused its discretion when selecting the inputs and data used to calculate the pole attachment rate pursuant to RCW 54.04.045(3). Specifically, the Companies object to the District's classification of the \"safety space\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   on a utility pole as unusable space and to the District's inclusion of a return on equity, rate of return for depreciated debt expenses, taxes, and attorney fees as actual expenses. In response, the District contends that it has not abused its discretion by defining the safety space as unusable and by utilizing the aforementioned expenses to calculate its pole attachment rate. The District has the better argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b644 If a municipal utility's actions \"come within the purpose and object of the enabling statute and no express limitations apply\" then \"the choice of means used in operating the utility [is left] to the discretion of municipal authorities.\"\n   <em>\n    City of Tacoma v.

Specifically, the Companies assert that the section that reads \"including a share of the required support and clearance space, in proportion to the space used for the pole attachment, as compared to all other uses made of the subject facilities and uses that remain available to the owner or owners of the subject facilities\" prohibits the District from classifying the safety space as unusable space. RCW 54.04.045(3)(a).

Specifically, the Companies object to the inclusion of a return on equity, rate of return on debt expenses, taxes, and attorney fees as actual expenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the District asserts that it has the discretion to include all of these expenses because they are actual expenses of the District and are within the bounds of the District's discretion to determine the expenses it includes when calculating the pole attachment rate. Again, the District has the better argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   \u00b651 The Companies first aver that the District is precluded from including a return on equity as an actual expense chargeable to the Companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is so, they assert, because RCW 54.04.045 does not explicitly permit the District to include just compensation as a component of its pole attachment rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the legislature's stated intent in passing the 2008 amendments to RCW 54.04.045 was to \"recognize the value of the infrastructure of locally regulated utilities\" and to \"ensure that locally regulated utility customers do not subsidize licensees.\" LAWS OF 2008, ch. 197, \u00a7 1.

We therefore conclude that the District did not abuse its discretion by incorporating a return on equity in its pole attachment rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b653 The Companies next aver that the District inappropriately included a rate of return component for the District's depreciated debt expenses in its pole attachment rate calculations. Citing to no authority, the Companies rely solely on the testimony of their expert witness-testimony which was explicitly rejected by the trial court-to assert that the District can charge a rate of return only for its undepreciated assets.

This is so, the Companies assert, because the taxes on the District's electrical business are not attributable to third party telecommunications pole attachers. In response, the District asserts that the tax expense is a component of the District's utility pole system, and that because the Companies would have nowhere to attach their equipment without the District's\n   utility pole system, they should be required to pay a share of the taxes. The District's position is consistent with our decision in\n   <em>\n    PUD I\n   </em>\n   that not every expense of operating the utility poles has to benefit attachers in order to warrant the attachers sharing in the expense.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364550\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/184/24/\">\n    184 Wash.

The District further contends that even the nonsimplified version must be an inaccurate interpretation because it is the mathematical equivalent of the FCC Cable formula, which, according to the District, would contradict our holding in\n   <em>\n    PUD I\n   </em>\n   that RCW 54.04.045(3) sets forth a unique formula.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude\n   that the Companies' nonsimplified formula accurately interprets the statutory language set forth in RCW 54.04.045(3)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b665 The District failed to provide any analysis of the disputed statutory language that supports the first component of its interpretation of the space allocator formula set forth in subsection (3)(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The closest the District comes to making any sort of argument that supports its interpretation is when it asserts that the divisor of the first part of its formula must be the usable space because it is \"the only space on the pole that third-party attachers are authorized by National Electrical Safety Code (NESC) Rules to use.\" However, such an argument fails to overcome the plain language of subsection (3)(a), which states that the District must calculate costs that are \"attributable to that portion of the pole ... used for the pole attachment\" instead of attributable to that portion of the usable space on the pole used for the pole attachment. RCW 54.04.045(3)(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   \u00b666 The Companies point out precisely the aforementioned problem with the District's interpretation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting that the first component of the space allocator formula set forth in subsection (3)(a) must divide the occupied space by the total height of the pole.

However, by refusing to do so, the legislature ensured that public utility districts utilized a mathematically equivalent rate to the FCC Cable formula, without becoming bound to follow any federal interpretations or rules relating to the FCC Cable formula. The legislative process can be a delicate balancing act between competing interests, and we can easily envision the legislature actively avoiding shortcut references in the language of the 2008 amendment to RCW 54.04.045 in order to avoid the prospect of foreign judicial opinions or agency interpretations interfering with the balance struck between public utility districts and those entities, such as the Companies, who were involved in the 2008 bill's development and implementation. Indeed, we noted a specific example of the results of such an approach in\n   <em>\n    PUD I\n   </em>\n   when we explained that, while the FCC Cable formula requires certain assumptions to be made regarding the inputs used when calculating the pole attachment rate, no assumptions regarding inputs are required by the formula set forth in RCW 54.04.045(3)(a)-(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364550\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/184/24/\">\n    184 Wash.

However, the Companies offer no argument grounded in Washington law to support their contention that the District has misallocated indirect costs. Instead, the Companies simply argue that the allocation of indirect costs must be arbitrary and capricious because the indirect cost allocation is not proportional to the allocation of capital costs and direct costs among the District's different operations. We disregard this argument because the Companies' position is unsupported by any legal authority or any citation to the record indicating that the District utilized inaccurate numbers. The Companies also claim that the trial court erred by finding that the Companies conceded that the District utilized the correct number of attachers per pole when calculating the rate. However, the record clearly shows that the Companies withdrew their position on this issue during the remand trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"29\">\n   <p id=\"p-186\">\n    The Companies also assert that the District's financial records did not include the necessary information for the District to calculate a return on equity component of the pole attachment rate. This assertion is rebutted by the record. The District's general manager testified as to how the District calculated the rate based on its financial records, specifically by relying on its records of retained earnings as set forth in the District's balance sheet. This balance sheet was included as a part of aggregate figures in the District's annual report to the state auditor. The trial court obviously credited this testimony when it ruled in the District's favor on this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"30\">\n   <p id=\"p-187\">\n    The Companies also contend that the inclusion of a return on equity as a component of the pole attachment rate violates RCW 54.16.330(4). This argument fails for three reasons. First, the statute addresses the District's ability to set rates for the sale of its telecommunications services, not pole attachment rates. Second, the Companies' referenced subsection only prohibits the District from giving itself a discount when it uses its own telecommunications services, it does not address the rates the District can charge other entities for other services. RCW 54.16.330(4) (\"A public utility district may not charge\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      its\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    nontelecommunications operations rates that are preferential or discriminatory compared to those it charges entities purchasing wholesale telecommunications services.\" (emphasis added) ). Third, even if RCW 54.16.330(4) did apply to the setting of pole attachment rates, RCW 54.16.330(2) defines discriminatory rates as \"when a public utility district offering rates, terms, and conditions to an entity for wholesale telecommunications services does not offer substantially similar rates, terms, and conditions to all other entities seeking substantially similar services.\" Because the Companies seek a different service than the District's wholesale telecommunications customers, namely to attach equipment to utility poles rather than purchasing broadband, the District need not charge a similar rate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"31\">\n   <p id=\"p-188\">\n    This also addresses the Companies' assertion that the District, as a nonprofit entity, has no reason to obtain a return on equity. As the District notes in its briefing, any return on equity received by the District can be reinvested into maintenance of the District's utility poles. This further helps to protect the investment in the system made by the District's customers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"32\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    The Companies' expert claimed that \"the rate of return is only applicable on unrecovered investment.\" She further explained that the \"rate of return is the payment for the fact that someone has expended money ahead of time and you are now paying back that principal over time.\" The basic idea is that the Companies should not be required to pay a rate of return based on the initial amount invested, the gross costs, because the District has recovered some of its investment through the use of those poles, thus reducing its net costs.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"33\">\n   <p id=\"p-190\">\n    As with many of the Companies' arguments regarding inputs, their complaint about the District's accounting choices would more appropriately be directed toward the District's board of commissioners. The arbitrary and capricious standard of judicial review is not a catch all standard intended to allow courts to interfere with agency decision-making in order to forestall any and all mistakes or perceived errors in judgment made by public officials. Rather, it permits courts to intervene to stop only \"willful and unreasoning action, taken without regard to or consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the action.\"\n    <em>\n     Abbenhaus\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108636\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/89/855/#p858\">\n     89 Wash.2d at 858\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=576%20P.2d%20888\">\n     576 P.2d 888\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

This is irrelevant. Whether the District receives a tax benefit for depreciation is not at issue. However, how much the District, and thus the District's customers, should be compensated for having made the costly initial investment into the District's utility pole system, is guided by the legislature's stated intent in RCW 54.04.045. The legislature wished to recognize the value of the infrastructure, and charging a rate of return on all assets, depreciated or not, recognizes that value.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"35\">\n   <p id=\"p-192\">\n    Contrary to the District's assertion, we never held that the space allocator component of the portion of the formula set forth in RCW 54.04.045(3)(a) could not be mathematically equivalent to the space allocator component of the FCC Cable formula.

By focusing on the mathematics, rather than on the words of the statute, the trial court erroneously concluded that subsection (3)(a) must set forth a space allocator component that is mathematically distinct from the FCC Cable formula's space allocator.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Rather than offer support for its position in the statutory text, the District merely restates, with conclusory language, that the general manager interpreted the statutory language and that the trial court accepted this interpretation. However, the record reveals that when questioned regarding his interpretation, the District manager was unable to articulate any reason derived from the language of the statute for his interpretation of the words \"of the pole\" to mean of the usable space on the pole. Furthermore, as we previously discussed herein, our review of the trial court's interpretation of the statute is de novo and we owe no deference to the District's, nor the District's general manager's, interpretation.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"37\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    The Companies assert two additional reasons for rejecting the District's interpretation. First, they assert that the District's interpretation is \"mathematically impossible\" because it double allocates a portion of the costs of the unusable space on the pole to the Companies. How this makes the formula mathematically impossible, as opposed to simply a formula which allocates a greater percentage of the costs of the pole to the Companies than they desire, is never explained. Second, the Companies assert that we should give great weight to the WUTC's interpretation of RCW 80.54.040, which the Companies assert has nearly identical language to RCW 54.04.045. The Companies contend that because the WUTC has interpreted the pertinent language in RCW 80.54.040 to be the FCC Cable rate, we should construe RCW 54.04.045(3)(a) in the same manner. This argument contrasts sharply with the Companies' position in\n    <em>\n     PUD I\n    </em>\n    , wherein they correctly asserted that we should construe the language of the statute de novo without deferring to an implementing agency's interpretation. If it is correct, and indeed it is, that we should not defer to an agency responsible for implementing RCW 54.04.045, it is undoubtedly correct that we decline to defer to a different agency's interpretation of a different statute when that agency is not even charged with the implementation of RCW 54.04.045. We therefore reject these arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"38\">\n   <p id=\"p-195\">\n    Or, as subsection (4) states, the District may use half of the rate calculated using the current FCC Cable formula instead of using the formula set forth by subsection (3)(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"39\">\n   <p id=\"p-196\">\n    The Companies assert that it is the mathematical equivalency to the FCC Cable formula that makes subsection (3)(a) the FCC Cable formula.

Whether the space allocator formula produced by the language of subsection (3)(a) is mathematically equivalent to any preexisting space allocator formulas is irrelevant, as it is the words of the statute that are significant.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     PUD I\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364550\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/184/24/\">\n     184 Wash.
