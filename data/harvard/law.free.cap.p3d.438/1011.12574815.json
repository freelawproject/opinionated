Miller appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress evidence of marijuana discovered during a traffic stop. Miller entered a plea to one count of possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. He argues that the traffic stop was impermissibly prolonged without reasonable suspicion when the officer conducting the traffic stop asked him to walk back to the patrol car, engaged him in unrelated questioning before and during the citation process, and waited to run a records check until later in the stop. Because none of these actions unconstitutionally extended the stop, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    The Traffic Stop\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 At 10:41 p.m., a Utah Highway Patrol Trooper (the officer) stopped Miller for driving seventy miles per hour on I-80, five miles per hour above the posted limit. After Miller gave the officer his driver license and the car rental agreement, the officer asked Miller to come back to his patrol vehicle. The officer testified that he asks drivers to come back to his patrol vehicle in 90% of traffic stops because he sometimes needs to gather additional information from drivers. In addition, by having Miller sitting in the passenger seat of the patrol vehicle and conversing with him, the officer \"could try and gain suspicion while actively filling out a citation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b63 Miller followed the officer back to the patrol vehicle. Although Miller had a crutch with him and \"was limping a little bit,\" the district court found that \"it didn't take him an excessive amount of time to get back to the patrol [vehicle].\" Once Miller was in the passenger seat, the officer stood at the passenger door and asked Miller, \"What'd ya do to your ankle?\" Miller told the officer how he came to be injured, and the officer asked no follow-up questions. Within one minute, the\n   officer \"was back on his side of the car and he began to fill out the citation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b64 Over the next seven minutes, the officer filled out the citation while conversing with Miller. The officer asked Miller \"some questions about his license and the car and where he rented it.\" But \"the majority of the conversation was the defendant making conversation with the [officer] about various topics[,] such as children and marriage and relationships.\" In reviewing the dashboard camera recording of the conversation, the district court found that Miller initiated much of the conversation and that the questions the officer asked \"did not take up much of that time.\" The court also credited the officer's testimony that \"during this time he was filling out the citation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 After finishing all but one section of the citation, the officer informed Miller that he needed to call Miller's information into dispatch. In his testimony, the officer explained that the final section of the citation requires him to identify the offenses or traffic code violations committed and whether he will issue a ticket or a warning. The officer \"leave[s] the violations part, the offenses part blank until [he hears] back from dispatch in case there's any other offenses that [he] might be adding to the citation.\" The district court accepted the officer's testimony that \"he needed to hear back from dispatch before he could complete the citation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 The officer testified that, approximately eleven minutes after he officer initiated the stop, he called into dispatch for a \"license records and criminal-history check.\" On the dashboard camera recording, an automated voice announces, \"License is valid.\" The officer's statements to dispatch are largely inaudible, but he testified that he asked the dispatch operator to run a criminal-history or \"Triple I\" check, which he typically requests only when the driver has roused his suspicions. The parties also agree that the officer's request included a check for outstanding warrants. While waiting for dispatch to respond with additional information, the officer deployed his police service dog around Miller's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 Approximately sixty seconds after the call to dispatch, the dog alerted the officer to the presence of a controlled substance. Several minutes after the dog signaled the alert, dispatch responded with the results of the criminal-history check. A subsequent search of Miller's car uncovered seventy-one pounds of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Miller's Motion to Suppress\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The State charged Miller with one count of possessing a controlled substance with intent to distribute and one count of speeding. After a preliminary hearing at which the officer testified, Miller was bound over for trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Miller moved to suppress all evidence discovered during the search of his vehicle, arguing that the \"search and seizure went well beyond the time necessary to conduct and conclude a routine traffic stop involving a speeding ticket for going 5 over.\" In support of the motion, Miller relied on the officer's testimony at the preliminary hearing and did not request an opportunity to present further evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 The district court denied the motion to suppress. In an oral ruling, the district court addressed \"whether the unrelated investigations[,] which were some of the questioning and the dog search, ... had the effect of extending [the] stop.\" First, the court concluded that the officer did not measurably extend the stop by conversing with Miller in the patrol vehicle. The court found that the officer \"said much less than [Miller]\" and the questions he did ask \"were going on simultaneously with him filling out a portion of the citation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b611 Second, the court concluded that the dog sniff did not measurably extend the stop. Because the officer could not finish the citation until he heard back from dispatch on the records check, the court found that he could not have completed the mission of the traffic stop within the sixty seconds it took for the dog to alert the officer to the presence of drugs. The court also rejected Miller's argument that it was impermissible for the officer to fill out a portion of the citation before calling dispatch:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Is it possible that [the officer] could have shaved off some time if he had called dispatch first? It's possible, but that [would be] speculation on my part .... [And] that would basically be the Court holding that\n   the [officer] has to call dispatch immediately upon getting back to his car. And that's micromanaging. That would be the Court telling the officer the order in which he has to perform the duties that are related to and permissible steps at a traffic stop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court concluded that the officer \"was reasonably diligent in pursuing the mission of the traffic stop\" and that \"his unrelated questioning and the dog sniff did not measurably extend the stop, but took place during the time that he was conducting a permissible investigation that was related to the reason for the stop.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 Following the denial of his motion to suppress, Miller pled guilty to possession of marijuana with the intent to distribute, reserving his right to appeal the district court's denial of his motion to suppress. He now appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b613 Miller contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence discovered during the officer's search of his car. \"We review a trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion to suppress for an alleged Fourth Amendment violation as a mixed question of law and fact.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

In\n   <em>\n    Duhaime\n   </em>\n   , this court suggested that questions about travel plans may \"exceed the scope of a traffic stop because the objective of such questions is not to gain some insight into the traffic infraction providing the legal basis for the stop, but to uncover inconsistent, evasive or false assertions that can contribute to reasonable suspicion or probable cause regarding drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11 (quotation simplified).

First, Miller was stopped for going five miles above the posted speed limit, which is simply not something for which Utah drivers are pulled over when traveling on an interstate highway, in their own lane, during decent weather. And in his testimony, the officer acknowledged that he typically does not pull drivers over for such an insignificant infraction and that he actually pulled Miller over because Miller had \"out-of-state plates\" and such plates \"are huge with drug transportation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that his actions throughout the stop were driven by an intent to \"gain suspicion\" on Miller, raising questions about how diligent the officer was in wrapping up the issuance of a citation for the traffic offense. And second, the officer admitted\n   that he \"spend[s] more time\" on certain stops, including running a criminal-history check on people he finds suspicious.

It was a full eleven minutes into this uneventful stop before the officer requested Miller's criminal history, during which time Miller had done or said nothing to suggest he posed a threat to the officer's safety. At that point, the officer had essentially completed his citation, and it would have been more efficient, as well as safer, ultimately, for the officer to finish the last section of the citation and send Miller on his way. There was also nothing in Miller's behavior throughout those eleven minutes that suggested the officer's safety was at risk. And in his own words, the officer admitted that his only reason for requesting Miller's criminal history was to \"gain suspicion,\" not to confirm or dispel a reasonable suspicion he had already formed or because, at the tail end of the stop, he suddenly became reasonably concerned about his safety. Because there was no officer safety or reasonable suspicion justification, the criminal-history check was \"aimed at detecting evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing\" and \"detour[ed]\" from the stop's mission.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1615-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b643 The State suggests that, because the criminal-history check occurred simultaneously\n   with the warrants check, it is merely a matter of speculation as to how much time this informational detour added to the stop.

While the length of license and warrant checks may also vary, these types of checks are typically brief, especially given that most officers have computers installed in their patrol cars that give them access to this type of data \"almost instantaneous[ly].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 512-13.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 508 n.155, 517.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

For example, the officer testified that there was an instance where 47 pages of criminal history took dispatch \"seven, eight minutes\" to go through. Here, it took dispatch over seven minutes to report back to the officer with Miller's criminal history. Suffice it to say, a criminal-history check adds measurable time to a more routine records check, and it is therefore unreasonable for an officer, without any safety justification or reasonable suspicion of criminal wrongdoing, to burden a stop for an exceedingly minor traffic infraction with a time-consuming investigation of a driver's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b645 Seemingly, the officer had a hunch that Miller was engaged in criminal wrongdoing and, as he testified, he was therefore going \"to spend more time on it.\" \"In assessing whether a detention is too long in duration ... we consider it appropriate to examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions\n   <em>\n    quickly\n   </em>\n   , during which time it was necessary to detain the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

But nothing in the officer's actions suggests that he acted diligently to conclude the traffic stop. Rather, he acknowledged that it is his practice to deliberately prolong stops to \"gain suspicion\" on certain drivers, which includes requesting criminal histories as a means to \"gain suspicion.\" He did so in this case to buy additional time to conduct the dog sniff because he had essentially finished the citation and had already conducted the license check and, in fairness, Miller should then have been sent on his way. Regardless of whether the warrants check was simultaneous to the criminal-history check, there was no purpose for requesting Miller's criminal-history check, given its timing so late in the stop, other than to extend the length of the stop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588788\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1609/#p1614\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"An officer, in other words, may conduct certain unrelated checks during an otherwise lawful traffic stop.
