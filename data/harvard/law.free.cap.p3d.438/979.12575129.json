One of the teenagers who worked as a lifeguard at the pool (Lifeguard) used a key to let them in, and the group went swimming. Afterward, unbeknownst to Lifeguard, Baer took the pool's small lockbox used to store the pool's cash. When Lifeguard later asked Baer about the missing lockbox, Baer told him, \"Tell the cops I wasn't there.\" With help from one of the other teenagers, K.D., authorities eventually recovered the pool's bank deposit bag from a nearby reservoir-the same place where Baer told a jailhouse informant that he had dumped the lockbox.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Baer now appeals his convictions for burglary, a third degree felony, and theft of services, a class B misdemeanor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel when his trial counsel failed to move for a directed verdict and failed to object to the jury instructions.

Baer's sufficiency argument focuses solely on the element of entering or remaining unlawfully. The Utah Code defines \"enter or remain unlawfully\" to mean that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a person enters or remains in or on any premises when: (a) at the time of the entry or remaining, the premises or any portion of the premises are not open to the public; and (b) the actor is not otherwise licensed or privileged to enter or remain on the premises or any portion of the premises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-202\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-6-201(3). The undisputed evidence established that the pool was closed at the time of Baer's entry and thus was \"not open to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-6-201(3)(a). Baer concedes that \"there is nothing to suggest that [his] entry was privileged\" to enter the premises, so the relevant question is whether sufficient evidence showed that Baer was not \"otherwise licensed ... to enter or remain on the [pool's] premises.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-202\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-6-201(3)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 The primary evidence against Baer about his entry to the pool was provided by Lifeguard and K.D. Lifeguard testified that, on the weekend night in question, he had possession of a key to the pool so that he could open the pool at 5 a.m. the next Monday morning. According to Lifeguard, even though he was not authorized to go into the pool at night, Lifeguard suggested to K.D. and another teenager, G.S., that they go \"night swimming.\" G.S. invited Baer to join them, and Baer met them there. K.D. testified\n   that Baer parked his car at the middle school \"right next door\" to the pool. Lifeguard then used his key to unlock the pool, and they all went swimming. Lifeguard testified that they entered the pool at \"about ten at night,\" but the State also introduced evidence that Lifeguard told the pool manager that they had been there at about \"2:00 in the morning.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Although Baer maintains that the evidence failed to show \"why [he] should know that he was not authorized\" to enter the pool after hours with a lifeguard who had a key, the State's evidence, and the reasonable inferences that can be drawn from it, provided a sufficient basis for a reasonable jury to conclude that Baer was not licensed or authorized to enter or remain at the pool after hours and that Baer knew that he lacked such authorization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Baer and the other teenagers entered the locked pool on a weekend evening around 10 p.m. or later. Lifeguard-who was merely a juvenile employee of the pool and not, say, a manager-used his key to access the premises. Lifeguard testified that he had the key for the purpose of opening the pool Monday morning and was not authorized to go into the pool at night. Relying on logic and reasonable human experience, a jury could reasonably infer from these facts that this group of teenagers, out late on a weekend, was not allowed to access the closed pool and that Lifeguard did not have authority to take his friends \"night swimming.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Cristobal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947452\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/1170/\">\n    2014 UT App 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 4,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947452\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/1170/\">\n    322 P.3d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A reasonable inference is a conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence and is based on logic and reasonable human experience.\"). Even though Baer claims that he did not actually know that Lifeguard lacked authority to open the pool to him, no evidence suggested that Baer had reason to believe that Lifeguard was allowed to treat his friends to an after-hours swim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet other evidence supports the reasonable inference that Baer knew that his entry to the pool was unlawful. Before entering the premises, Baer parked his car next door at the middle school. One reasonable inference from that fact is that Baer was seeking to avoid detection and knew that the group was sneaking into a pool that was off-limits.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake City v. Carrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845581\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/1067/\">\n    2015 UT 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6845581\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/358/1067/\">\n    358 P.3d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Circumstantial evidence is particularly useful in establishing intent because direct evidence of intent is rarely available.

As a result, the trial court would not have granted a motion for a directed verdict on the burglary charge, and trial counsel therefore did not render ineffective assistance in failing to raise a futile motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6946321\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/320/55/\">\n    2014 UT App 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 34,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6946321\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/320/55/\">\n    320 P.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

He first explains that the \"service [he] is accused of stealing is use of the swimming pool.\" Then he asserts that \"the State failed to produce evidence showing that [Baer] did know that accepting [Lifeguard's] invitation to swim was not proper\" or that Lifeguard \"was not permitted to open the pool to his friends,\" because no evidence showed that \"the fee couldn't be waived or that employees weren't allowed to bring friends in without cost.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 Under Utah law, \"[a] person commits theft if he obtains services which he knows are available only for compensation by deception, threat, force, or any other means designed to avoid the due payment for them.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-6-409\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-6-409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) (LexisNexis\n   2017). The same facts that support a finding that Baer entered the pool unlawfully also support the reasonable inference that Baer knew that swimming in the pool was available only for a fee.\n   <em>\n    Supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b613. Again, contrary to Baer's assertions, the State submitted some evidence that could support a finding that Baer did know that accepting Lifeguard's invitation to swim when the pool was closed to the public \"was not proper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 In sum, if trial counsel had moved for a directed verdict on the burglary or theft of services charges, those efforts would have been futile.

The Jury Instructions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Baer next contends that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to demand that the jury be properly instructed on the applicable mental states for burglary and theft of services. We conclude that Baer has not carried his burden of persuasion and that his ineffective assistance claims in connection with the two instructions therefore fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 The Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure require an appellant's brief to \"explain, with reasoned analysis supported by citations to legal authority and the record, why the party should prevail on appeal.\" Utah R.

Although Baer asserts that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to ensure the instructions properly explained the applicable mental states and asserts that the instructions were inadequate, he does not identify or discuss the offending instructions and fails to make a cogent argument about what should have been done to make them passable. As a result, Baer's terse briefing on the adequacy of the jury instructions and his counsel's performance effectively \"shift[s] the burden of research and argument\" to this court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986426\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/264/770/\">\n    2011 UT App 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6986426\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/264/770/\">\n    264 P.3d 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Likewise, Baer has not devoted adequate attention to showing how, given the facts of this case, there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's failure to object to the instructions, the outcome would have been different. Baer therefore has not demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel related to the jury instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b621 We conclude that, because the State introduced sufficient evidence of burglary and theft of services, Baer's trial counsel did not perform ineffectively by failing to move for a futile directed verdict on those charges. We further conclude that, because Baer has not carried his burden of persuasion, he cannot prevail on his ineffective assistance of counsel claims regarding his counsel's failure to object to the jury instructions. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    In connection with the underlying events in this case, Baer was convicted of four other misdemeanor offenses, including theft, destruction of property, tampering with evidence, and contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
