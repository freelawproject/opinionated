Before trial, Hood sought to exclude evidence that he had been excommunicated from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, arguing that the evidence was inadmissible \"other act\" evidence under rule 404(b) of the Utah Rules of Evidence. The district court admitted the evidence to explain the context of Hood's relationship with the alleged victim. We conclude that this was a proper, non-propensity purpose and that the evidence was relevant to assessing the victim's credibility on the question of consent. But because we also conclude that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of the evidence and that its admission was harmful, we vacate Hood's convictions and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    Relationship Between Hood and W.B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Hood met the alleged victim, W.B., on a dating website in March 2013. W.B. was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and assumed that Hood was as well because his profile picture showed a photograph of the church's founder in the background. According to W.B., on their first date, Hood told her he had not gone to church for some time but had attended that same day and wanted to resume his involvement in the church. He said he was grateful to meet someone like her who was a member so that she could help him come back into \"full fellowship\" with the church. At trial, W.B. explained that \"full fellowship\" means taking steps to \"live the teachings of the gospel\" and being able to \"take the sacrament\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"receive further blessings.\" At some point, Hood disclosed to W.B. that he had been excommunicated from the church.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Over the next several months, Hood and W.B. continued dating, but their relationship was volatile and involved a series of breakups and reconciliations. W.B. acknowledged that the couple had engaged in various acts of sexual intimacy short of intercourse during their relationship. She testified that although such physical intimacy before marriage conflicted with her religious beliefs, Hood manipulated her into submitting to these acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 W.B. also testified that she told Hood she would not engage in premarital sexual\n   intercourse because church doctrine forbade it. Despite knowing her opposition, Hood once pushed her against the kitchen wall and penetrated her vaginally and anally with his penis while saying, \"Isn't this a fun game we're playing?\" According to W.B., she told Hood, \"No, ... this isn't fun.\" After this incident, she met with her ecclesiastical leader, the bishop, and confessed that she \"had allowed\" the act even though she did not want it to happen. She testified that the bishop counseled her to refrain from participating in the sacrament for three weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 At trial, Hood painted a different picture of the couple's relationship. He testified that W.B. was eager to engage in sexual activity, including oral sex and intercourse, and \"never talked to [him] about not wanting to have sex because she was taking her religion seriously.\" Hood testified that he and W.B. talked little about religion and that the topic was not central to their relationship. According to Hood, they had a sexual relationship for months before he told W.B. that he was trying to return to the church after having been excommunicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    Charged Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 6 On October 19, 2013, W.B. left Hood's apartment after an argument, inadvertently leaving her checkbook there. That night, Hood sent her a text that she had forgotten her checkbook, and W.B. responded, asking if she could retrieve it the next day. Because of the argument, she suggested he hand her the checkbook at the door if he did not want her to come into the apartment. But when she arrived the next day, Hood hugged her and told her he was sorry for what had happened. W.B. testified she felt ill that morning and told Hood that she was \"really tired.\" He led her into his bedroom and suggested she take a nap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 7 W.B. testified that, after she fell asleep, Hood entered the room, removed her pants, and performed oral sex on her. When she woke, Hood held her down and ignored her pleas to stop. According to W.B., she was sobbing when Hood put on a condom. She begged, \"No, Howard, no,\" then froze in \"complete and utter shock\" while he raped her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 8 In contrast, Hood testified that W.B. initiated the encounter by suggesting they take a nap together. According to Hood, they began \"making out\" in the bedroom and he performed oral sex on W.B. only after she asked him to give her an orgasm. Hood testified that, after the oral sex, he retrieved condoms from his car before returning to the bedroom to have intercourse with her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Motion to Exclude Under Rule 404(b)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State charged Hood with one count of rape and one count of forcible sodomy. At trial, Hood voiced concern over whether the State intended to elicit testimony regarding his excommunication from the church.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hood acknowledged that although it may be permissible to explain that he was not a church member, it was a 404(b) issue \"to say he's been excommunicated in the past.\" The district court initially agreed that there was \"no reason\" for such evidence. The State objected, arguing that Hood's excommunication was a central component of his relationship with W.B. The State explained that W.B. would testify that \"Hood made it very clear that he was excommunicated, but that he wanted to come back to the church and that ... plea for help, spiritually speaking, was one of her reasons for staying in contact with him.\" The State posited that Hood's excommunication and his professed desire to return to the church were \"very probative of why [W.B.] maintain[ed] contact with this person who [was] making ... repeated [sexual] overtures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 Hood conceded that W.B. could testify that he \"left the church, ... he wasn't a member, he's trying to come back to the church,\" but he objected to the admission of evidence that he had been excommunicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The district court questioned whether it was possible to \"shape or mold [W.B.'s] testimony beyond what the facts actually are\" to avoid mentioning the excommunication. It noted that Hood's status in the church was \"a fairly central part of the ongoing relationship between these parties\" and ruled that it would allow Hood's statements to W.B. regarding his excommunication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Use of Excommunication Evidence at Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 11 At trial, the State presented evidence that Hood had been excommunicated from the church but never disclosed what Hood did to merit that sanction. In its opening statement, the State referred to Hood's professed desire to \"get back [to being] active in the church\" and his pleas for W.B. to help him do so as the method he used to manipulate W.B. into forgiving him and staying in the relationship. The prosecutor did not use the term \"excommunication\" or otherwise refer to official church discipline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 12 During trial, however, the State elicited testimony about Hood's excommunication from three witnesses. First, W.B. testified that Hood told her he had been excommunicated. Because he had lost his membership in the church, Hood told her that he needed to \"retake the discussions\" with the church missionaries and then \"be found worthy to be rebaptized to be able to have the blessings of the gospel in his life.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 13 Second, during cross-examination, Hood confirmed that he told W.B. of his excommunication. In a subsequent line of questioning, the State reiterated that Hood had been \"officially excommunicated from the church.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b6 14 Third, the State offered testimony from Hood's ex-wife about his excommunication. She testified that, soon after they met, Hood told her he \"was trying to get in good standing with the church because he had been excommunicated.\" She explained that \"there's certain things that if you do them, like morality, different things like that, then you have to go and confess to your bishop or stake president or whatnot, and then ... they hold a council, and if they find that you're lacking, they can excommunicate you.\" Hood's ex-wife testified that obeying the \"law of chastity\" was important to maintaining good standing in the church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 15 In its closing argument, the State directly referred to Hood's excommunication. The prosecutor argued that Hood's professed \"interest in rekindling the flame of faith\" explained why the \"na\u00efve\" and \"religious\" W.B. continued to forgive and wanted to \"believe that he will be better.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 16 The jury convicted Hood of rape and forcible sodomy. He appeals those convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 17 Hood argues that the district court erred by allowing the State to elicit testimony about Hood's \"prior conviction for an unknown transgression in an ... ecclesiastical court.\" A district court's decision to admit other-act evidence under rule 404(b) is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under this \"deferential standard of review,\" the question before the appellate court \"is not whether we would have admitted [the] evidence. It is whether the district judge abused his broad discretion in doing so.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 18 Hood raised three additional issues on appeal, but because his first claim of error requires us to vacate his convictions and remand for a new trial, it is unnecessary for us to reach the remaining issues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Under that rule, \"[e]vidence of a crime, wrong, or other act is not admissible to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in conformity with the character.\" Utah R. Evid. 404(b)(1). However, such evidence \"may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6995647\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/223/1137/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 404(b)(2). In other words, evidence \"is not admissible to prove that a defendant has a propensity for bad behavior and has acted in conformity with his dubious character,\" but may be admissible \"if it is offered for a proper, noncharacter purpose.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Burke\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988572\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/1102/\">\n    2011 UT App 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6988572\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/256/1102/\">\n    256 P.3d 1102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 As our supreme court has recognized, the difficulty in applying rule 404(b)\"springs from the fact that evidence of prior bad acts often will yield dual inferences-and thus betray both a permissible purpose and an improper one.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Verde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    2012 UT 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 16,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6977244\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/296/673/\">\n    296 P.3d 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    abrogated on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

On one hand, exposing the jury to evidence of a defendant's acts of misconduct may lead to an impermissible inference \"that the defendant has a reprehensible character, that he probably acted in conformity with it, and that he should be punished for his immoral character in any event.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. \"On the other hand, the rule also recognizes that acts of prior misconduct may also sustain an alternative-and entirely permissible-inference.\"\n   <em>\n    Thornton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    2017 UT 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12342540\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/391/1016/\">\n    391 P.3d 1016\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Applicability of Rule 404(b)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 Before analyzing whether these requirements were met, we first address the State's alternative argument that the evidence at issue is not subject to rule 404(b). The State contends that evidence of Hood's excommunication does not fall within rule 404(b) for three reasons: (1) excommunication is not \"a crime, wrong, or other act,\" (2) Hood's statements about his excommunication were not offered to prove that they were true but only that they had been made, and (3) telling W.B. that he had been excommunicated was intrinsic to the crimes with which he was charged and not subject to rule 404(b). Although none of these arguments were made to the district court, an appellate court may affirm \"on any legal ground or theory apparent on the record,\" even if such ground or theory \"was not raised in the lower court, and was not considered or passed on by the lower court.\"\n   <em>\n    Goodsel v. Department of Bus. Regulation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10480873\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/523/1230/#p1232\">\n    523 P.2d 1230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1232 (Utah 1974) (quotation simplified). But, for the reasons set forth below, we do not find these alternative arguments persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A. Other Act Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22 First, the State claims that excommunication does not fall within rule 404(b) because it \"represents a person's standing in the [church], not an act performed by the defendant.\" We agree with the State that a person's status as an excommunicated member of the church does not necessarily imply the commission of a bad act. But in the unique context of this case, evidence\n   of excommunication strongly implied that Hood had committed an act relevant to his propensity to commit the crimes for which he was on trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 According to an official church publication cited by both parties, a disciplinary council \"must be held in cases of murder, incest, or apostasy,\" \"when a prominent Church leader commits a serious transgression, when the transgressor is a predator who may be a threat to other persons, when the person shows a pattern of repeated serious transgressions, when a serious transgression is widely known, and when the transgressor is guilty of serious deceptive practices and false representations or other terms of fraud or dishonesty in business transactions.\" Elder M. Russell Ballard,\n   <em>\n    A Chance to Start Over\n   </em>\n   , Ensign (September 1990), www.lds.org/ensign/1990/09/a-chance-to-start-over-church-disciplinary-councils-and-the-restoration-of-blessings?lang=eng [https://perma.cc/GVL7-8PWE]. Disciplinary councils may also be convened \"following serious transgression such as abortion, transsexual operation, attempted murder, rape, forcible sexual abuse, intentionally inflicting serious physical injuries on others, adultery, fornication, homosexual relations, child abuse (sexual or physical), spouse abuse, deliberate abandonment of family responsibilities, robbery, burglary, embezzlement, theft, sale of illegal drugs, fraud, perjury, or false swearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 The State correctly points out that \"excommunication may result from other acts which, to many or most people, do not reflect poorly on a person's character.\" For instance, excommunication based on theological disagreements, or \"apostasy,\" would not imply the commission of \"a crime, wrong, or other act\" within the meaning of rule 404(b). But the vast majority of \"transgressions\" that lead to excommunication in the church are \"serious criminal offenses,\" including sexual abuse.\n   <em>\n    See Church Discipline\n   </em>\n   , The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Newsroom, www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-discipline [https://perma.cc/J8XZ-WW84]. Here, the jury was left to speculate about the \"transgression\" Hood had committed. And the only evidence presented suggested that the act resulting in Hood's excommunication was similar in kind to the charged conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 25 Hood was on trial for rape and forcible sodomy. The only testimony regarding potential reasons for excommunication referred to \"morality,\" and was given by his ex-wife who also testified that Hood had raped her three years earlier. Testimony that Hood was actively seeking to rejoin the church also dispelled any suggestion that his excommunication was based on theological disagreements with church doctrine. To a Utah jury likely to be familiar with the type of conduct that would trigger church discipline,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   the implication was that Hood had been excommunicated for an act similar in kind to the sexual abuse alleged by both his ex-wife and W.B. Where the evidence strongly implies that the defendant committed a \"bad act,\" the proponent of that evidence cannot avoid the application of rule 404(b) by stopping short of identifying the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 26 For example, evidence that a defendant was fired from his last job might not suggest that he committed a bad act, given the various reasons why an employee might be terminated. But if that employee were on trial for sexually harassing a co-worker\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the jury is told multiple times that he was fired from his prior job\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the only evidence presented regarding grounds for termination is \"inappropriate behavior\" in the workplace\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the witness who provides that evidence has accused defendant of sexual harassment in the past, evidence that the defendant was fired strongly suggests that the termination resulted from similar conduct. Indeed, the likely (and perhaps only) inference a jury will draw is that the defendant committed a prior act that bears on his propensity to engage in the type of conduct for which he is on trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 27 In other contexts, we have held that a person's status can imply the commission of other acts, even when the State does not introduce evidence of the acts themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For instance, we have applied rule 404(b) to evidence of a defendant's parole status, even when the State introduces no evidence of the prior crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

While the exact reasons for Hood's excommunication were not disclosed, his ex-wife testified that there are certain acts involving \"morality\" that can trigger a church disciplinary council and lead to excommunication. At the very least, this testimony suggested that Hood had previously been adjudicated guilty of some act deemed immoral by a church disciplinary council. And W.B.'s testimony that her \"punishment\" for premarital sex was counseling by her local bishop to refrain from taking the sacrament for three weeks further suggested that a much more egregious act of immorality would lead to formal disciplinary proceedings and excommunication, the church's harshest penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b6 47 The nature of the charges against Hood exacerbates the potential for prejudice.

This alleged character trait carried special significance in light of the State's theory at trial. To prove that the sexual acts were nonconsensual, the State relied heavily on W.B.'s religious convictions and Hood's alleged refusal to honor her commitment to the \"law of chastity.\" Given this context, admission of the excommunication evidence created a significant risk that it would be considered for the improper purpose of showing that commission of the alleged crimes was in conformity with Hood's character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 49 With those impermissible character inferences in mind, we turn to whether the risk of unfair prejudice substantially outweighed the probative value of the evidence.

As is typical with allegations of sexual abuse, the alleged perpetrator and victim were the only witnesses to the charged conduct. The verdict hinged entirely on the jury's assessment of their relative credibility. Since there was no dispute that the acts occurred, the jury was specifically charged with deciding whether to believe Hood's account that the acts were consensual or W.B.'s account that they were not. That was not an easy task, given the evidence that the couple had an ongoing romantic relationship and had engaged in at least some consensual sexual activity in the past. To aid the jury in its credibility assessment, the State made a concerted effort to contrast W.B.'s character-particularly, her religious character-with Hood's. As a result, Hood's excommunication took on particular significance at trial. His excommunication and what it implied about his moral character was central to the State's theory of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b6 55 When viewed in light of the entire record, the erroneous admission of other-act evidence was not inconsequential. The reference to Hood's excommunication was not isolated. Instead, the State elicited evidence about Hood's excommunication from three separate witnesses and referred to it again to support its narrative during closing argument. Moreover, references to church doctrine and, by implication, Hood and W.B.'s comparative morality, were pervasive throughout trial. For example, W.B. testified about her interaction with the church missionaries, discussions with her bishop, her attendance at church services, priesthood blessings, the \"law of chastity\" and other church teachings, the founding of the church and \"restoration of the ... keys of the priesthood,\" and her religious convictions generally. In contrast, the State painted Hood as lacking any sincere religious convictions. At one point, the prosecutor even questioned whether Hood had made a \"real attempt ... to hear the Gospel again, the Gospel of Jesus Christ, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b6 56 In short, we agree with Hood that \"the entire trial devolved into an exploration of [his] perceived religious failings.\" The evidence suggested that W.B. was the type of person who would refuse consent based on her religious convictions and that Hood was the type of person who would disregard such objections. We are not suggesting that the State's strategy was necessarily improper, only that it exacerbated the potential prejudice from the improper admission of Hood's excommunication. In the context of this case, evidence that a disciplinary body had previously found Hood guilty of a sufficiently serious moral transgression that warranted expulsion from his faith may have suggested that he had an immoral character and the propensity to commit the crimes charged. In\n   a case that turned on conflicting testimony regarding consent, there is a reasonable probability that such propensity evidence unfairly influenced the jury's verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b6 57 The probative value of Hood's excommunication was substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice.
