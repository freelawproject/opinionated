We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 At the time Zemlicka filed her complaint against West Jordan City, section 601, since amended so as to avoid the problem presented by this case, required that \"\n   <em>\n    [a]t the time the action is filed\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff shall file an undertaking in a sum\n   <em>\n    fixed by the court\n   </em>\n   that is ... not less than $300.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-601(2) (LexisNexis 2016) (emphasis added). But this requirement is logistically impossible because the district court is tasked with fixing the amount of an undertaking in an action\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   the filing of the complaint that commences the action, which is the only way an undertaking in an amount fixed by the court could be filed at the same time that the complaint is filed. Yet experience suggests that district courts will not enter orders in connection with cases that have not yet been filed because the filing of the complaint is the mechanism by which an action is commenced and a judge is assigned. In effect, the now-superseded version of section 601 put the cart before the horse, requiring the court to fix the amount of an undertaking in an action before that action had even been filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Utah's federal courts apparently recognized this problem and set about to work around it through the adoption of a local rule that obviated the need for individualized judicial action in each case by fixing a standard amount for such undertakings and requiring plaintiffs, at the time the complaint is filed, to file a $300 bond with the clerk of the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DUCivR 67-1(c). And in 2017, the Utah Legislature apparently perceived the problem created by the prior version of the statute and amended section 601 along the lines of the local federal rule. Section 601 now provides: \"At the time the action is filed, the plaintiff shall file an undertaking ... in the amount of $300, unless otherwise ordered by the court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-601(2) (LexisNexis Supp. 2017). The 2017 amendment resolves the logistical impossibility\n   created by the prior statute, more fully discussed below, and obviates the problem presented by this case in future actions brought against government entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 On March 10, 2014, Zemlicka was driving in West Jordan City when the poorly lit street on which she was driving abruptly ended with a dirt ramp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, her car was thrown into the air, and she was seriously injured. On February 18, 2016, having previously complied with the pre-suit notice requirements of UGIA, Zemlicka filed a complaint against West Jordan City for negligence. On March 14, 2016, the district court notified Zemlicka that a $300 undertaking was required. She filed a $300 bond that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 On October 6, 2016, nearly seven months later and while the parties were engaged in discovery-and after the applicable statute of limitations had run-West Jordan City moved to dismiss Zemlicka's suit for her failure to file an undertaking at the time her complaint was filed rather than a few weeks later when the court instructed her to file a $300 undertaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-601(2) (LexisNexis 2016). The district court granted West Jordan City's motion and dismissed Zemlicka's suit, determining that Zemlicka \"failed to strictly comply\" with section 601 \"because, 'at the time the action [was] filed,' the Plaintiff did not 'file an undertaking in the sum fixed by the court that is not less than $300.00.' \" Zemlicka appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Zemlicka contends that the district court erred in its interpretation of the prior version of section 601.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Statutory interpretation is a matter of law that we review for correctness,\" affording no deference to the district court's interpretation.\n   <em>\n    Bilanzich v.

This contention seems to rely on what West Jordan City sees as \"the well-settled rule\" in Utah that a plaintiff\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   file a $300 undertaking when the complaint is filed to satisfy the statutory undertaking requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While this view effectively ignores the \"in a sum fixed by the court\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   requirement, we recognize that the Utah Supreme Court has, in passing, stated that section 601 requires a plaintiff to \"include an undertaking at the time of filing,\"\n   <em>\n    Marziale v.

But the undertaking must be in an amount \"fixed by the court,\" and as we have already pointed out, a district court will not fix the amount of the undertaking before a complaint has been filed, thereby actually commencing the action. Because \"time\" is \"a period during which something (as an action, process, or condition) exists or continues,\"\n   <em>\n    Time\n   </em>\n   , Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2394 (1993), and because the prior version of section 601 imposed on the court the duty to fix the amount of the undertaking, an action, once filed in the technical sense, will not be considered filed and effective for purposes of section 601 until the court fixes the amount of the undertaking, whereupon the plaintiff is obliged to post an undertaking in that amount. Accordingly, once the complaint is filed, the court is obligated to fix an undertaking in an amount that is discretionary with the court but which may not be \"less than $300.\" Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 63G-7-601(2). Once the amount is fixed by the court, the plaintiff must promptly\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   file an undertaking\n   upon entry of the court's order fixing the amount which, of necessity, will be a time later than when the complaint was filed.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiesel v.

An undertaking must therefore be filed as soon as the amount is fixed by the court, or the plaintiff risks having the suit dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10384840\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/794/838/\">\n    794 P.2d at 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing that \"[f]ailure to pay the undertaking is an affirmative defense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 Here, on March 14, 2016, the court notified Zemlicka that she needed to post a $300 undertaking. She did so immediately. But, in its decision granting West Jordan City's motion to dismiss, the district court stated that it was merely advising Zemlicka of the undertaking requirement, not fixing the amount of the undertaking. We will not set aside a factual finding unless it is \"without factual support in the record or if [we] on the entire evidence [are] left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made.\"\n   <em>\n    Jouflas v. Fox Television Stations, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10313163\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/927/170/#p174\">\n    927 P.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 (Utah 1996) (quotation simplified). Because section 601 required the court to fix the amount of the undertaking, and there was nothing in the record establishing that the court fixed the amount before March 14, 2016, the court erred in implicitly determining that the amount was set before this date. On the contrary, the court is deemed to have fixed the amount on March 14, 2016, less than a month after the action was filed, when its clerk notified Zemlicka that she must post a $300 undertaking. Zemlicka was required to file her undertaking contemporaneously with the court fixing the amount of the undertaking, which she did by filing it later that same day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 Given the legislative intent behind section 601, West Jordan City's objection to Zemlicka's late undertaking \"is at best but a technical one,\" because \"[t]he only legitimate advantage [West Jordan City] was entitled to was protection from loss of costs.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bunting Tractor Co. v.

But Zemlicka \"stands to lose forever the right to pursue what might well be a meritorious cause of action. It would have been one thing to dismiss the action without prejudice and require [Zemlicka] to incur the additional expense and inconvenience of filing anew, but it is quite another to dismiss with prejudice and completely, effectively and permanently bar [her] from remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 192-93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 We conclude that Zemlicka complied with the requirements of the version of section 601 applicable to her case, as properly understood. And we again note that the problem presented in this case will be avoided in the future because in the amended version of section 601, the Legislature has fixed the amount of the initial undertaking to be filed in such cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 We reverse the district court's grant of West Jordan City's motion to dismiss because Zemlicka complied with the prior version of section 601. We remand the case for resolution on its merits.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    Although the Legislature recently amended the language of the statute at issue, the new statutory language does not guide our interpretation of the prior version of section 601.
