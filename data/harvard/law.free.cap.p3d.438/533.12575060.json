But the mere fact that a guest passenger qualifies as an \"insured\" does not mean the passenger is automatically entitled to UIM benefits. The long-standing rule in Washington is that a third-party guest passenger can be excluded from UIM coverage if that passenger has already been compensated\n   through the named insured's liability coverage. This rule has been codified in a somewhat convoluted manner by a vehicle-based (as opposed to a person-based) exclusion, providing that a vehicle insured for liability purposes can, by definition, be excluded from also being a source of UIM benefits to third parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   \u00b62 Here, Joseph Thompson was injured as a third-party guest passenger in a vehicle insured through Progressive Direct Insurance Company. Progressive tendered the limits of its third-party liability coverage to Mr. Thompson. However, Progressive denied Mr. Thompson's claim for UIM benefits based on the terms of its policy, which excluded UIM benefits to guest passengers for injuries arising from the negligent operation of its named insured's vehicle. Because Progressive's denial of coverage was consistent with the terms of its policy, public policy, and state law, we uphold Progressive's benefit decision. The superior court's judgment to the contrary is reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 Joseph Thompson was injured in a single-vehicle accident while traveling as a guest passenger in a vehicle driven by Stacie Haney. Ms. Haney was the \"[n]amed insured\" under an automobile insurance policy (the Policy) issued by Progressive, and the vehicle driven by Ms. Haney met the definition of a \"[c]overed auto\" under the general terms of the Policy. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 24, 31. Mr. Thompson was not a named insured under the Policy, and he was not a relative of Ms. Haney, but he met the statutory and policy definition of an \"insured\" and \"insured person.\" RCW 48.22.005(5)(b)(i) ; CP at 37, 40. Progressive agreed, for purposes of these proceedings, that its named insured was solely responsible for the accident giving rise to Mr. Thompson's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 The Policy issued to Ms. Haney included both liability coverage, for bodily injury and property damage to others, and UIM coverage. Progressive tendered to Mr. Thompson the $ 100,000 liability limits of the Policy for his bodily injuries sustained in the accident. Because Mr. Thompson alleged that this liability payment did not fully compensate him for the damages resulting from these injuries, he subsequently initiated a claim under the UIM portion of the Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 In relevant part, the UIM portion of the Progressive Policy defines an \"[i]nsured person\" as including \"any person\n   <strong>\n    occupying\n   </strong>\n   , but not operating, a\n   <strong>\n    covered auto\n   </strong>\n   .\" CP at 40 (bolded terms are defined terms in the Policy).

Progressive explained that Ms. Haney's vehicle did not meet the policy definition of an \"underinsured motor vehicle\" as it was a \"covered auto\" under the Policy. CP at 66. Progressive also stated its Policy was \"in compliance with the statute [ RCW 48.22.005 and RCW 48.22.030 ] on all points including on who an 'insured person' is, and more importantly what an 'underinsured motor vehicle' is.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b67 Mr. Thompson initiated a declaratory judgment action in superior court, seeking a determination that he was entitled to UIM coverage and benefits under the Policy. The superior court granted summary judgment in favor of Mr. Thompson, holding that UIM coverage was required because Mr. Thompson met the \"definition of 'insured' under RCW 48.22.005,\" CP at 209, and Progressive could not use its Policy to erode the statutory definition. Mr. Thompson was also awarded attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b68 Progressive appeals the order granting Mr. Thompson's motion for summary judgment and the final judgment establishing attorney fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b69 The parties agree that under the terms of Progressive's Policy, Mr. Thompson was excluded from UIM coverage. While Mr. Thompson fell under the definition of an \"insured person,\" CP at 40, he was not injured through the operation of a qualifying vehicle. Specifically, the vehicle giving rise to Mr. Thompson's injuries was covered by the Policy and Mr. Thompson was not the named insured or a relative of the named insured. As previously noted, UIM benefits are typically triggered in the context of liability involving a third-party vehicle, not a vehicle covered by the same policy. The only exception is when the named insured or a family member of the named insured is the person seeking UIM benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b610 Recognizing that the terms of Progressive's Policy do not afford him UIM coverage, Mr. Thompson argues that excluding the named insured's vehicle from coverage as an \"underinsured motor vehicle\" violates state law and public policy.

That was not an issue.

The UIM statute contemplates coverage only for bodily injury, death, or property damage caused by the operation of third-party vehicles.

Nevertheless, the dissenters also wished to overrule\n   <em>\n    Millers\n   </em>\n   because the exclusion barring underinsured motorist coverage for the passenger limited insurance coverage on a basis other than the risk of the insurer and thereby contravened Washington's policy of full compensation for accident victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b620 I concur in the reasoning of the dissenters in\n   <em>\n    Blackburn v.

Safeco Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Washington State Legislature adopted House Bill 1233, titled \"Motor Vehicle Insurance-Personal Injury Protection Benefits.\" LAWS OF 1993, ch. 242. Joseph Thompson contends the 1993 bill legislatively overruled\n   <em>\n    Millers Casualty Insurance Co. v. Briggs\n   </em>\n   and BLACKBURN V. SAFECO INSURANCE CO. The relevant portion of the bill declared:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CHAPTER 242\n   </strong>\n   [Engrossed Substitute House Bill 1233]MOTOR VEHICLE INSURANCE-PERSONAL INJURYPROTECTION BENEFITS\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    AN ACT Relating to mandatory offering of personal injury protection insurance; adding new sections to chapter 48.22 RCW; creating a new section; and providing an effective date.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    NEW SECTION.\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Sec. 1.\n   </strong>\n   Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section\n   <em>\n    apply throughout this chapter\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (5) \"Insured\" means:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (b) A person who sustains bodily injury caused by accident while: (i) Occupying or using the insured automobile with the permission of the named insured....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    NEW SECTION.\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    Sec. 2.\n   </strong>\n   (1) No new automobile liability insurance policy or renewal of such an existing policy may be issued unless personal injury protection coverage benefits ... for medical and hospital expenses, funeral expenses, income continuation, and loss of services sustained by an insured ... are offered as an optional coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (Emphasis added.) Sections 3 to 5 of House Bill 1233 address the extent to which a casualty insurer must afford personal injury protection coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b622 This appeal concerns section 1 of House Bill 1233 's definition of \"insured\" and whether that definition extends to more than the provisions of the bill and to an underinsured motor vehicle insurance statute found in RCW 48.22.030. Note that section 1 of House Bill 1233 applies its definitions to \"this chapter.\" The prior portions of the bill, however, reference two distinct \"chapters\": first, chapter 242, the number from Washington LAWS OF 1993; and second, chapter 48.22 RCW. Confusion arises as to whether the definitions announced in section 1 of House Bill 1233 apply to chapter 242 of the LAWS OF 1993, to chapter 48.22 RCW, or to both. The confusion escalates when one learns that section 1 of House Bill 1233 became RCW 48.22.005 and one observes that chapter 48.22 RCW refers to creditor coverage, vendor coverage, and underinsured motorist coverage in addition to the sections for personal injury protection coverage added by House Bill 1233.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b623 As a result of House Bill 1233, the Washington State code reviser created three new code sections and placed sections 3 through 5 of the bill into RCW 48.22.090, RCW 48.22.095, and RCW 48.22.100. The reviser created a new code section and inserted verbatim section 1 of the House Bill 1233 into RCW 48.22.005. RCW 48.22.005 now reads in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (5) \"Insured\" means:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (b) a person who sustains bodily injury caused by accident while (i) Occupying or\n   using the insured automobile with the permission of the named insured....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b624 We must juxtapose RCW 48.22.005 with RCW 48.22.030(2), the underinsured motor vehicle insurance statute. The latter statute declares:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   No new policy or renewal of an existing policy insuring against loss resulting from liability ... shall be issued ... unless coverage is provided therein ... for the protection of persons\n   <em>\n    insured\n   </em>\n   thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of underinsured motor vehicles[.] ... except while operating or occupying a motor vehicle owned or available for the regular use by the named insured or any family member, and which is not insured under the liability coverage of the policy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   (Emphasis added.) The lengthy sentence and confusing language of RCW 48.22.030 may nonsensically suggest that the exclusion from underinsured motor vehicle coverage cannot apply if the car, in which the insured rode, is not listed in the liability policy. But no one raises this point. Surprisingly the Washington appellate courts have never addressed the ambiguity caused by the two different references to a \"chapter\" in House Bill 1233 or addressed the aggravation of the uncertainty resulting from the insertion of section 1 of the bill in RCW 48.22.005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b625 Joseph Thompson rode in a car driven by Stacie Haney and insured for liability coverage by Progressive Direct Insurance Company. Haney's negligence caused the accident. Thompson was not a family member of Haney. Thompson recovered $ 100,000 under the liability insurance endorsement of the Progressive insurance policy, but he claims the $ 100,000 does not fully compensate him for the injuries sustained in the accident. He seeks to recover underinsured motorist benefits under the Progressive policy. The policy excludes from the definition of \"underinsured motor vehicle\" a vehicle covered under the liability endorsement of the insurance policy except as to Haney or her family members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   \u00b626 Joseph Thompson astutely argues that the definitions inserted into RCW 48.22.005 should control the remainder of chapter RCW 48.22. Thompson particularly asks that RCW 48.22.005's definition of \"insured\" control the meaning of \"insured\" in RCW 48.22.030. RCW 48.22.030 demands a motor vehicle casualty policy cover an \"insured\" under the underinsured motor vehicle endorsement. RCW 48.22.005, for purposes of \"this chapter,\" defines an \"insured\" as a person who sustains bodily injury caused by accident while occupying the insured automobile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b627 I disagree with Joseph Thompson's analysis. The Washington State Legislature holds the prerogative in declaring public policy with regard to requirements for casualty insurance. Therefore, our fundamental purpose in construing an insurance statute is to ascertain and fulfill the intent of the legislature.\n   <em>\n    In re Schneider\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4020341\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/173/353/#p363\">\n    173 Wash.2d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=268%20P.3d%20215\">\n    268 P.3d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).

Regardless, the bill does not expressly identify which section of House Bill 1233 becomes the \"created\" section as opposed to the added sections, and the bill does not declare where in the Revised Code of Washington the created section should fall. I might guess that the legislature intended section 1 of House Bill 1233 to be the \"newly created\" section, and that, if the legislature considered the question, it might wish the \"created section\" to lie inside RCW 48.22. But House Bill 1233 does not expressly declare that the definitions listed in the new section, including the definition for \"insured,\" should control all of the provisions of chapter 48.22 RCW. The legislature did not direct where to insert the created section within RCW 48.22. The code reviser could have\n   placed this new or created section after RCW 48.22.030 and immediately before the three sections addressing personal injury protection coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b629 All definitions listed in section 1 of House Bill 1233 and, in turn, contained in RCW 48.22.005 correspond to words or phrases found elsewhere in House Bill 1233 and, in turn, the personal injury protection coverage statutes codified in RCW 48.22.090 to RCW 48.22.100. Or all such definitions help to define other terms inside section 1 of House Bill 1233 and RCW 48.22.005. RCW 48.22.030, which creates mandatory underinsured motor vehicle coverage, contains its own two internal definitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   \u00b630 House Bill 1233 shows a primary, if not exclusive, intent in imposing mandatory requirements on insurance companies to offer personal injury protection coverage for automobile insurance policies. The title to the bill only references personal injury protection benefits. House Bill 1233 shows no intent to modify the law with regard to mandatory underinsured motor vehicle insurance coverage. RCW 48.22.005's definitions should be read in this light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   \u00b631 I find no Washington case law that addresses whether legislative intent as expressed in an underlying bill holds priority over the manner in which a code reviser inserts the language of the bill into a code. Nevertheless, the populace elects legislators, not code compilers, to enact law. Washington courts have declared that the code reviser's labeling of a statute should not change the meaning of the legislature's enactment.\n   <em>\n    Tesoro Refining &amp; Marketing Co. v.
