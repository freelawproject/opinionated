Wells Fargo filed this action seeking, among other things, reformation of a vesting deed. Following a bench trial, the court amended the deed of trust entered into by the parties to reflect what all parties believed they were doing at the time-creating and conveying an enforceable deed of trust to secure the loan. Appellants challenge that decision. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 On March 15, 2003, Lynnette created the OMI Trust, designating herself as the trustee and her daughter, Justine, as the sole beneficiary. The only asset placed into the\n   trust was the real property (the Property) at issue in this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Lynnette refinanced the Property several times. In each instance, she transferred the Property by quitclaim deed from herself, as trustee of the OMI Trust, to herself as an individual. After executing a deed of trust on the Property and closing the refinance, Lynnette typically conveyed the Property back to herself, as the trustee of the OMI Trust, by quitclaim deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Lynnette broke from this pattern in one such iteration. In February 2006, Lynnette executed a quitclaim deed (the 2006 Quitclaim Deed), purportedly transferring the Property to Lynnette and Justine as individuals, which was recorded on March 3, 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead of identifying the grantor as the trustee of the OMI Trust-the record owner of the Property at the time-the 2006 Quitclaim Deed instead listed the grantor as \"Lynnette Noerring, a married woman.\" Following the recording of that quitclaim deed, the Noerrings refinanced the mortgage on the Property with a loan from WMC Mortgage Corp., which loan was secured by a trust deed, also recorded on March 3, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Five months later, the Noerrings obtained a loan (the New Century Note) from New Century Mortgage Corp. (New Century). This loan satisfied the WMC loan and was, by its terms, to be secured by a trust deed on the Property. In executing the New Century Note, the Noerrings represented that they were title owners of the Property. Along with the note, the Noerrings executed several other documents at the closing, acknowledging that the purpose of the transaction was for a \"residential mortgage loan,\" which entailed providing the lender a security interest in the Property. The New Century Trust Deed was signed by both Lynnette and Justine and recorded on August 29, 2006. The New Century Note was ultimately assigned to Wells Fargo as trustee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The Noerrings later applied for and received two modifications to the New Century Note and made payments for approximately five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 25, 2010, Lynnette passed away.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   A little over a year later, Justine defaulted on the New Century Note. A few months after the default, Wells Fargo conducted a title search on the Property in anticipation of foreclosure. The search revealed that the title owner of the Property was Lynnette Noerring, as trustee for the OMI Trust, and not Lynnette as an individual or Lynnette and Justine as individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Wells Fargo then initiated this action seeking, among other things, reformation of the 2006 Quitclaim Deed. Specifically, Wells Fargo sought \"[a] judgment reforming the [2006 Quitclaim Deed] to reflect that\n   <em>\n    Lynnette Noerring, as trustee of the OMI Trust\n   </em>\n   , conveyed the Property as the grantor to the Noerrings, so that the Noerrings will be the correct owner and grantor/trustor of the Property under the [New Century Trust Deed].\" (Emphasis added.) Wells Fargo also sought an order declaring the New Century Trust Deed to be valid and that it \"encumbers and constitutes a first priority lien against the entire Property.\" Subsequently, Wells Fargo also requested that the New Century Trust Deed be reformed to reflect that Lynnette, as trustee of the OMI Trust, conveyed the security interest in the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 Following a bench trial, the court concluded that Justine and Lynnette, individually, and Lynnette, as trustee for the OMI Trust, intended to grant a security interest in the Property to New Century in order to secure the New Century Note. The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that the Noerrings and New Century made a mutual mistake regarding the New Century\n   Trust Deed. Specifically, the court determined that the Noerrings and New Century intended to create a valid trust deed and convey a valid security interest in the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, the trial court ordered reformation of the New Century Trust Deed. The court changed the grantor of the Property from Lynnette and Justine, as individuals, to Lynnette, as trustee of the OMI Trust. Justine and Darwin Long (collectively, Appellants) challenge the trial court's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Appellants raise three issues on appeal.

Particularly, Appellants argue that, based on the Nonclaim Statutes, Wells Fargo was required to present its claim for reformation of the deed within one year of Lynnette's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because Wells Fargo did not seek reformation within this one-year window, Appellants argue, any claim is barred \"against the deceased settlor's estate, the trustee, the trust estate, and the beneficiaries of the deceased settlor's trust.\" (Quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-7-509\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-7-509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1).) Wells Fargo argues in response that the Nonclaim Statutes are not applicable to this action because \"any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge, or other lien upon property of the deceased settlor's estate\" is exempt from the one-year presentment period.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-7-509\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-7-509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(a). We first review the Nonclaim Statutes generally, then consider the applicability of the Nonclaim Statutes to Wells Fargo's reformation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 The Nonclaim Statutes generally require creditors to present claims against a decedent's estate or a deceased settlor within one year of the person's death.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-7-509\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 75-3-803(1) ;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-7-509\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 75-7-509(1). Failure to present a claim timely will likely result in that claim being barred as against the trust or estate because the purpose of the Nonclaim Statutes is \"to promote a speedy and efficient system\" for settling and distributing the estate or trust of the decedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Ostler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992928\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/227/242/\">\n    2009 UT 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992928\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/227/242/\">\n    227 P.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Daigle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10433660\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/634/71/#p76\">\n    634 P.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 76 (Colo. 1981) (en banc) ).

The\n   <em>\n    Daigle\n   </em>\n   court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A nonclaim statute operates to deprive a court of jurisdiction. The personal representative of an estate can neither waive it nor toll it. A nonclaim statute imposes a condition precedent to the enforcement of a right of action; that is to say, the claim must be presented within the time set in the notice to creditors or be barred. A statute of limitations, on the other hand, does not bar the right of action but only the remedy. Such a statute may be tolled. Such a statute is a defense which is waived if not affirmatively pleaded.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Daigle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10433660\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/634/71/#p76\">\n    634 P.2d at 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Thus, the Nonclaim Statutes are not statutes of limitation but impose a bar to enforcement of late-filed claims against an estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ostler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992928\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/227/242/\">\n    2009 UT 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 21,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992928\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/227/242/\">\n    227 P.3d 242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, if Wells Fargo's reformation claims are made against Lynnette's estate and the Nonclaim Statutes apply, the trial court would have lacked jurisdiction to consider these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 Wells Fargo asserts that its claims are exempt from the one-year presentment period contained in the Nonclaim Statutes because it is a lienholder. Relevant here, the Nonclaim Statutes exempt \"any proceeding to enforce any mortgage, pledge, or other lien upon property of the deceased settlor's estate or the trust estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-7-509\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-7-509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(a). Wells Fargo asserts that this provision applies in this case. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 Armed with the knowledge that a mistake in the 2006 Quitclaim Deed-and likewise an error in the New Century Trust Deed-prevented foreclosure on the Property, Wells Fargo filed a complaint in the trial court seeking reformation. Wells Fargo requested that the New Century Trust Deed be reformed to reflect a proper conveyance to New Century of a security interest in the Property. Reformation was necessary, in Wells Fargo's view, because-absent altering the language of the New Century Trust Deed-Wells Fargo could not proceed to foreclose on the Property. Because of the mistake in the New Century Trust Deed and lack of a valid security interest in the Property, Wells Fargo sought a judgment for reformation, an equitable remedy preliminary to any enforcement action under the circumstances. Accordingly, Wells Fargo's action below sought to reframe the underlying vesting instrument, not to enforce its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 But this conclusion does not end our inquiry. For Wells Fargo's claims to be jurisdictionally barred, they must constitute \"claims\" within the meaning of the Nonclaim Statutes. Appellants argue that Wells Fargo's reformation claims are \"claims\" within\n   the Nonclaim Statutes and are therefore barred because Wells Fargo did not present these reformation claims to Lynnette Noerring's estate within one year of Lynnette's passing. We also reject this argument and conclude that the Nonclaim Statutes do not apply to the issues presented on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 As noted, the Nonclaim Statutes require presentation within one year of claims against a decedent's estate that arose before the death of the decedent. In this context, \"claims\" \"include[ ] liabilities of the decedent ..., whether arising in contract, in tort, or otherwise, and ... [do] not include ... demands or disputes regarding title of a decedent ... to specific assets alleged to be included in the estate.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2075-1-201\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 75-1-201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018). Put another way, \"claims\" refer to debts or demands against the decedent that might have been enforced in the decedent's lifetime. As used in this provision, however, \"the term[ ] 'claim' does not include causes of action purely equitable, and in which purely equitable relief is sought.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Estate of Sharp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10472402\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/537/1034/#p1037\">\n    537 P.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1037 (Utah 1975) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10472402\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/537/1034/#p1037\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (determining that \"equitable claims for relief beyond the money judgment, such as for enforcement of liens or trusts or for enforcement of rights in specific property are not 'claims' within the [nonclaim] statutes\" (quotation simplified) ).

Having brought the action within three years of discovery of that information, the court concluded that the statute of limitations did not bar Wells Fargo's claim for reformation. Appellants do not challenge this finding on appeal, but instead assert that, as a matter of law, the statute of limitations began running in 2006 because New Century had actual or constructive knowledge of the New Century Trust Deed, which contained the mistaken statements. Because New Century-and by imputation, Wells Fargo-had sufficient notice of the mistake in the title to trigger the statute of limitations in 2006, they assert, the statute of limitations expired before the complaint was filed in 2013. In other words, Appellants ask us to supplant the trial court's factual finding-the 2011 discovery of the mistake-with a legal conclusion (constructive notice) that, by operation of the recording statutes, Wells Fargo reasonably should have known of the mistake in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b622 In the context of Utah's recording statutes, we recognize two types of notice, actual and constructive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    FDIC v.

Lynnette and Justine represented in the deed that they were title owners of the Property with authority to convey it. By endorsing the New Century Trust Deed, they further agreed to convey an interest in the Property to New Century as security for the New Century Note. Although Lynnette and Justine, in their individual capacities, could not do this in reality, this defect is not apparent in the trust deed. Consequently, Wells Fargo's knowledge of the contents of the 2006 Quitclaim Deed and the New Century Trust Deed does not equate to discovery of the facts constituting the mistake.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8870393\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/81/244/\">\n    17 P.2d at 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

At the time Lynnette and Justine entered into the New Century Trust Deed, Lynnette was the sole trustee of the OMI Trust and Justine\n   was the beneficiary. As trustee, Lynnette was authorized-with consent of the beneficiary, Justine-to mortgage or pledge the Property as security on behalf of the trust. Here, the trial court determined that New Century, Lynnette, and Justine intended to use the Property to secure the New Century Note. Indeed, each party stated as much in the resulting trust deed. Appellants do not challenge this finding, nor do they assert that Lynnette, at that time, could not have encumbered the Property on behalf of the OMI Trust. Instead, they argue that the court could not add the OMI Trust entity to the New Century Trust Deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b631 There is no question that Lynnette, in her capacity as trustee of the OMI Trust, did not sign the New Century Trust Deed. This oversight prompted the present reformation litigation. Lynnette and Justine, as individuals, and Lynnette, as trustee of the OMI Trust, all shared the same interests, however, and benefited from the loan. Though reformation is inappropriate \"when it will result in injury of innocent third parties,\" this is not such a situation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   27 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 70:45 (4th ed. 2018). Had Lynnette, as trustee of the OMI Trust, correctly transferred her interest in the Property for the New Century Note, the individuals present would be identical, i.e., Lynnette, Justine, and New Century. Moreover, by Lynnette and Justine's involvement, Lynnette, as trustee of the OMI Trust, had adequate notice of the transaction and opportunity to advance any opposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Farmers Union Oil Co. of Garrison v.

Accordingly, we discern no error or lack of authority on the part of the trial court to reform the New Century Trust Deed.

This particular cause of action-equitable reformation-is equitable in nature and therefore was not a \"claim\" within the meaning of the Nonclaim Statutes. Accordingly, the trial court had jurisdiction to decide the issues raised in this appeal. Additionally, we are not persuaded that, under the circumstances of this case, Wells Fargo had constructive notice of the mistakes in the 2006 Quitclaim Deed or New Century Trust Deed prior to 2011. Finally, we conclude that the trial court retained authority to reform the New Century Trust\n   Deed to reflect the intent of the parties. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Because Lynnette and Justine share a last name, we refer to each by her first name throughout this opinion.

Although Wells Fargo initially requested the remedy of reformation of the 2006 Quitclaim Deed, it later asserted that the court could alternatively reform the New Century Trust Deed. Appellants did not challenge the court's adoption of this alternative remedy, but instead focused their arguments below, as on appeal, on the absence of the OMI Trust as a party to the New Century Trust Deed. The trial court could not reform the New Century Trust Deed, Appellants argued, because that reformation would entail drawing the OMI Trust-a separate legal entity that was not a party to the New Century Trust Deed-into that transaction. Because the trial court ordered reformation of the New Century Trust Deed, we likewise focus our attention on that aspect of the court's decision.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Where the applicable provision has not substantively changed, we cite the most recent version of the Utah Code for convenience.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    We note that Wells Fargo asserted several claims in its complaint, some of which may have been subject to the Nonclaim Statutes' one-year presentation period. But the decision of the trial court as well as the parties' argument on appeal focuses on Wells Fargo's cause of action for reformation. We accordingly limit our review to that legal theory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The parties do not dispute either the applicable statute of limitations or whether it is subject to tolling under the statutory discovery rule.

But the deed was not defective simply because it could not convey title to the Property under the circumstances. Quitclaim deeds \"do not imply the conveyance of any particular interest in property\" but rather convey only the interest the grantor holds at the time, \"be that interest what it may.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nix v.
