Subsequently, Plaintiff filed suit, claiming personal injuries. At trial, Defendant made three separate oral motions for judgment as a matter of law-each on a discrete point of law. One of those motions was granted, and two were denied. At the close of his case-in-chief, Defendant again renewed the third motion for judgment as a matter of law related to Utah's no-fault tort threshold, but the court again denied the motion. Prior to submission of the case to the jury, Defendant also objected to the trial court's refusal to give a requested jury instruction. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff, awarding $300,000 in general damages. Defendant then filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or alternatively, for a new trial, which the trial court denied. Defendant appeals and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Plaintiff's vehicle was struck by Defendant's vehicle after Defendant failed to stop at a stop sign. Plaintiff brought a civil action against Defendant for damages resulting from the accident. The parties engaged in discovery, and Plaintiff produced approximately $11,000 in chiropractic bills.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 At trial, Plaintiff elected not to seek an award of economic damages but instead chose to focus on non-economic damages associated with her herniated disc. Plaintiff argued to the jury that, based on her permanent injury, she should be compensated $50 to $75 per day for pain and suffering until she reached the age of eighty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In addition to her own testimony, Plaintiff called several witnesses to testify on her behalf. Her chiropractor (Chiropractor) testified to Plaintiff's injuries, stating that she had a herniated disc ; that the disc injury was \"permanent\"; and that it would \"plague\" her for the rest of her life. Chiropractor also testified that with physical therapy, Plaintiff was able to \"get fairly close to normal range of motion. We couldn't ever get 100 percent, and we made her very comfortable. We were able to get rid of a lot of the symptoms. ... [but the scar tissue is] not going to go away.\" He stated that during \"five re-exams through\n   the course of her treatment,\" he was able to restore most of Plaintiff's bodily function, but not all of it. Additionally, Plaintiff submitted, and the trial court admitted, MRI\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   results, which Chiropractor discussed and which showed disc bulges and a disc herniation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Additionally, Plaintiff's daughter testified to Plaintiff's limitations and inability to perform the same tasks that she did prior to the accident. Her daughter stated that she witnessed Plaintiff having difficulty picking up small children and that Plaintiff had been unable to ride an amusement park ride. Furthermore, Plaintiff's friend, with whom she had lived for sixteen months following the accident, testified concerning the negative effect Plaintiff's injuries had on Plaintiff's life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 At the close of Plaintiff's case-in-chief, Defendant made three separate oral motions for judgment as a matter of law. The first motion argued that Plaintiff had not carried her burden of demonstrating sufficient evidence of Defendant causing the accident. The trial court denied that motion. The second motion argued that Plaintiff had not introduced any evidence of economic damages, including the chiropractic costs, future costs of surgery, or any other future economic damages, and when Plaintiff stipulated that she was not seeking such damages, the motion was granted by the trial court. The third motion argued that Plaintiff failed to introduce evidence sufficient to satisfy the threshold requirement set forth in Utah Code section 31A-22-309(l)(a). Defendant's bases for the third motion were that (1) because the second motion for judgment as a matter of law-alleging that no economic damages were introduced by Plaintiff-had been granted, so too should the third motion, and (2) Plaintiff had not presented expert testimony demonstrating that a permanent impairment rating had been given to Plaintiff based upon \"objective findings.\" The trial court denied Defendant's third motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 At the close of his case, Defendant renewed his third motion for judgment as a matter of law. The trial court again denied the motion, ruling that the issue of whether Plaintiff was entitled to an award of general damages should go to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The jury was instructed that it could consider certain factors in awarding non-economic damages. Those factors were \"(1) the nature and extent of injuries; (2) the pain and suffering, both mental and physical; (3) the extent to which [Plaintiff] has been prevented from pursuing her ordinary affairs; (4) the extent to which [Plaintiff] has been limited in her enjoyment of life; and (5) whether the consequences of these injuries are likely to continue, and for how long.\" The jury was also instructed that its verdict was not to be rendered upon the basis of any passion or prejudice toward anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 Finally, Defendant objected to the trial court instructing the jury on causation by utilizing the version published in the second edition of the Model Utah Jury Instructions (MUJI 2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant asked the court to employ a different instruction which included the word \"proximate.\" The court declined and instructed the jury using the MUJI 2 version. The case was submitted to the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of Plaintiff, awarding general damages in the amount of $300,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 Defendant filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, or, in the alternative, a motion for a new trial. The motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict renewed Defendant's third motion for judgment as a matter of law. The motion for a new trial was sought on two bases: (1) that the $300,000 verdict was not supported by the evidence, and (2) that the verdict was excessive and was a product of passion or prejudice against Defendant, who had not been present at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court denied Defendant's motions. Defendant appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Defendant brings several issues on appeal. First, he argues that the trial court erred in denying his third motion for judgment as a matter of law based upon Plaintiff's alleged failure to meet the threshold requirement set forth in Utah Code section 31A-22-309(1)(a). \"Appellate courts review the grant or denial of a motion for [judgment as a matter of law] for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    Proctor v.

Threshold Requirement of Section 31A-22-309(1)(a)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 The parties dispute whether section 31A-22-309(1)(a) requires a plaintiff to demonstrate, at trial, that she has met the threshold requirement set forth in the statute. Utah Code section 31A-22-309(1)(a) requires plaintiffs to whom the statute applies to demonstrate, at trial, that they have met the threshold requirement set forth in the statute. The relevant section states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   A person who has or is required to have direct benefit coverage under a policy which includes personal injury protection may not maintain a cause of action for general damages arising out of personal injuries alleged to have been caused by an automobile accident, except where the person has sustained one or more of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) death;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (ii) dismemberment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (iii) permanent disability or permanent impairment based upon objective findings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (iv) permanent disfigurement; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (v) medical expenses to a person in excess of $3,000.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 31A-22-309(1)(a) (LexisNexis 2017).

Therefore, despite Plaintiff's assertion that the statute \"does not require a plaintiff to prove any elements at trial,\" the plain language of this section requires a plaintiff to demonstrate, most often at trial because causation and the amount of damages are frequently rife with issues of fact,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   that he or she meets at least one of the five threshold requirements.

Nevertheless, the trial court allowed the jury to assess general damages, surmising that because the legislature had provided in a different statute that punitive damages could be assessed when the defendant was found to have been intoxicated in the accident, the legislature must have meant to allow general damages as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-8-201 (LexisNexis 2012) (establishing that an award of punitive damages may be awarded against an intoxicated driver even if compensatory or general damages are not proven). Our supreme court rejected this assertion under a plain language analysis and held that the punitive damages statute made no reference to section 31A-22-309(1) and therefore did not create an exception \"to the threshold requirements\" of that statute.\n   <em>\n    C.T.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10316160\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/977/479/\">\n    1999 UT 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10316160\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/977/479/\">\n    977 P.2d 479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Statutory Threshold\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b629 With the plain language definitions set out, we now analyze Defendant's argument that Plaintiff did not demonstrate the threshold injury of permanent disability or permanent impairment through \"objective findings,\" as required by Utah Code section 31A-22-309(1)(a)(iii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b630 Based on the plain language definitions and relevant case law, Plaintiff has met the statutory threshold through testimony and other evidence at trial.

Chiropractor also testified that with physical therapy, Plaintiff was able to regain most bodily function, but not all of it. He stated that throughout \"five re-exams through the course of her treatment,\" they were able to \"get fairly close to normal range of motion.\" He further explained, \"We couldn't ever get 100 percent, and we made her very comfortable. We were able to get rid of a lot of the symptoms. ... [but the scar tissue is] not going to go away.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b631 Furthermore, along with Chiropractor's examinations and treatment of Plaintiff, an MRI film was admitted into evidence that showed the existence of the herniated disc injury to which Chiropractor testified. Chiropractor determined-based on the examinations, treatment, and MRI-that Plaintiff had suffered a permanent impairment, and he testified to that effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   To further corroborate Chiropractor's determination, both Plaintiff's daughter and friend testified to \"the changes and differences that [Plaintiff] suffers from now because of her injuries.\" They described the \"impact the crash has had on [Plaintiff's] life.... the limitations, pain, and other ways that the injuries affect [Plaintiff] on a daily basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b632 This type of testimony (1) shows permanence based on Chiropractor's statement that Plaintiff would be \"plagued\" for the rest of her life; (2) demonstrates impairment because Plaintiff suffered the loss of bodily function; and (3) is objective because the impairment was determined after a number of \"reproducible, measurable or observable\" exams,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SAIF Corp. v.

Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b633 Next, Defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict based upon Plaintiff's failure to introduce any evidence that could meet the threshold requirement set forth in Utah Code section 31A-22-309(1)(a). \"On ... a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we will reverse the trial court's ruling only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, we conclude that the evidence is insufficient to support the verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    Utah Dep't of Transp. v.

While juries should not be permitted to \"arbitrarily ignore competent, credible and uncontradicted evidence,\" courts have long held that juries are \"not bound to slavishly follow the evidence and the figures given by any particular witness.

No other medical experts testified on behalf of Plaintiff, and the evidence demonstrated that she never received a permanent impairment rating from any physician. As a matter of law, Plaintiff thus failed to meet the prerequisite that she sustained a permanent disability or permanent impairment based upon objective findings in that the only medical professional who testified as to any permanent condition that she claimed to have suffered could not, as her treating physician, provide such findings as a matter of law as recognized by Utah case law and by his own testimony.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    But the statute does not support such a reading. Section 31A-22-309(1)(a)(iii) does not refer to an impairment \"rating.\" We decline to rewrite the statute to include such a term. While impairment ratings may be ubiquitous in personal injury actions, their frequent use is irrelevant in construing this statute.
