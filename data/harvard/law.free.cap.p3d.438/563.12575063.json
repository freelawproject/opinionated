The river and its watershed are home to numerous species of salmon and trout, including endangered Chinook and summer chum salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Water from the Dungeness watershed has been scarce for decades and critically low stream flows in the summer and fall have proven detrimental to recovery of endangered fish populations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 In 2005, the Elwha-Dungeness Planning Unit enacted a watershed plan, seeking to address the situation and make water management recommendations to the Department of Ecology (DOE) for regulation of the Dungeness Basin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In November 2012, DOE promulgated an administrative rule (Dungeness Rule) that regulated the use and appropriation of all surface and groundwater in the watershed. The Dungeness Rule established minimum instream flows (MIFs) for the Dungeness River and its tributaries, required mitigation and metering for all new water appropriations, including permit exempt wells (PE wells), and closed the basin to new surface water withdrawals for part of the year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 Clallam County property owners Magdalena Bassett and Denman Bassett, and the Olympic Resource Protection Council (ORPC),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a non-profit corporation who seeks to balance environmental protection with private property rights, (collectively \"plaintiffs\") challenged the Dungeness Rule in superior\n   court, claiming that it failed to meet procedural and substantive Administrative Procedures Act (APA) requirements. The court upheld the rule and the plaintiffs appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 DOE neither exceeded its statutory authority nor violated any required rulemaking procedures. In addition, the Dungeness Rule is not arbitrary and capricious. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   I. DUNGENESS RULE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 In November 2012, DOE filed the Dungeness Rule with an effective date of January 2, 2013. WAC 173-518-010. To protect low stream flows and existing water rights, DOE found that water was not reliably available for new consumptive uses in the Dungeness watershed. WAC 173-518-050. DOE wanted to satisfy present and future human needs, retain natural surface water bodies in the watershed, protect instream values and resources, and implement its obligations under the local watershed plan. WAC 173-518-020.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 The Dungeness Rule established MIFs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the Dungeness River and its tributaries. It also heavily regulated access to surface water and groundwater in the basin. We begin by detailing the primary effects of the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A. INSTREAM FLOWS AND RESERVES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 The Dungeness Rule established MIFs for the Dungeness River and eight smaller creeks in the basin. WAC 173-518-040 &amp; Table II. These MIFs became appropriations of water under the prior appropriation doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   so that future appropriations could not disturb them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WAC 173-518-040(3) ; RCW 90.03.345. DOE based the MIFs on recommendations of the 2005 Elwha-Dungeness Watershed Plan, discussed further below. WAC 173-518-040(1), (2). DOE's objective in establishing MIFs was the protection and preservation of wildlife, fish, scenic, aesthetic, and other environmental and navigational values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 DOE also established reserves of groundwater, not subject to the MIFs, specifically for domestic use.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   WAC 173-518-080. DOE found that the public interest in access to domestic water overrode potential impacts to instream resources. WAC 173-518-080. Domestic water users who complied with a list of DOE conditions could use water from the reserves for their domestic needs, despite potential impacts to MIFs. WAC 173-518-080(2). The rule forbade any consumptive use\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   from impacting MIFs unless it came from the groundwater reserve or was subject to mitigation, as discussed below. WAC 173-518-040(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B. CLOSURES AND MITIGATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 Because of water scarcity, DOE determined that surface water was not reliably available for new consumptive uses in the basin. The rule closed year-round eight specific tributaries as well as all unnamed tributaries to the Dungeness River. WAC 173-518-050. It also closed the Dungeness River mainstem between July 15 and November 15 every year. WAC 173-518-050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 Surface water and groundwater sources within the Dungeness watershed are hydraulically connected. WAC 173-518-070(1). Accordingly, the Dungeness Rule closed the watershed to new groundwater appropriations, including new permit-exempt wells,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   subject to three specific exceptions. WAC 173-518-070. A new prospective groundwater user would be required to either (1) use the water for a nonconsumptive use; (2) demonstrate scientifically to DOE's satisfaction that the use would not adversely affect any closed surface waters; or (3) obtain mitigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   WAC 173-518-070(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 To obtain mitigation, the rule established a Dungeness water exchange, through which new users could purchase credits to offset any new consumptive water use. WAC 173-518-070(3)(a)(i). Alternatively, new consumptive users could propose their own mitigation plan. WAC 173-518-070(3)(a)(ii), - 075. Mitigation plan requirements included that new consumptive water uses not impair any existing water rights. WAC 173-518-075(2)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 Finally, the rule required metering of all future new surface water and groundwater appropriations in the basin. WAC 173-518-060.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II. PASSAGE OF RULE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A. BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 The Dungeness watershed included parts of Clallam and Jefferson counties around the Dungeness River, near Sequim. The Dungeness mainstem averaged a flow of 701 cubic feet per second during June and 171 cubic feet per second in September, the months with the highest and lowest streamflows, between 1924 and 2011. Historically, irrigators diverted up to 80 percent of the Dungeness's natural flow. In 1998, companies and irrigation districts began to voluntarily limit their diversions to no more than 50 percent of the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 In January 2012, groundwater levels were declining due to variations in rainfall, changes in irrigation practices, irrigation ditch piping, and increased well withdrawals associated with population growth. Approximately 14,000 wells and well hookups withdrew about 5.98 million gallons per day (gpd), 2.71 million gpd of which was consumptive. This amount did not include uses for irrigation, golf course, dairy, or industrial water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1. Elwha-Dungeness Watershed Plan\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b616 In 2005, the Elwha-Dungeness Planning Unit, consisting of Clallam County, the City of Port Angeles, the Elwha Klallam Tribe, the Jamestown S'Klallam Tribe, the Agnew Irrigation District, and DOE adopted the Elwha-Dungeness Watershed Plan (Plan). The Plan assessed the status of water resources in Water Resource Inventory Area (WRIA) 18, the area ultimately affected by the Dungeness Rule, and addressed competing demands for water within the WRIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 The Plan was the result \"of a lengthy, collaborative, and consensus-based process involving all key stakeholders in the watershed.\" Administrative Record (AR) at ECY069806. It addressed water quantity, water quality, habitat, instream flows, stormwater, land use and management, education and outreach, and watershed management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 The Plan suggested strategies for water management in the Dungeness Basin, including protection of instream flows and limitation of PE wells. It recommended that continued groundwater withdrawals be conditioned on mitigation to surface water impacts and increased regulation of PE wells. It suggested the creation of a groundwater reserve to facilitate land use planning, manage growth, and protect instream flows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 A \"central purpose\" of the Plan was \"to recommend instream flows for streams\n   and rivers within the WRIA, for use by [DOE] as rule-making discussions beg[a]n.\" AR at ECY070473. The planning unit found that river flows were critical to fish at all lifestages and that optimal volume and timing of flows provide numerous ecological benefits to fish. The Plan's recommended instream flows intended to condition new water rights in the basin on maintenance of the regulatory instream flow level in the river.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b620 The Plan recognized the over-appropriation of water in the basin. It observed that some streams had water rights exceeding natural flows in low flow seasons and instructed DOE, \"through its rule-making procedure, [to] adopt instream flow levels and then use them in its management of subsequent water rights applications for WRIA 18 streams.\" AR at ECY070473. It proposed specific instream flow numbers for numerous streams in the basin, including the Dungeness mainstem. These recommended numbers are identical to those DOE ultimately adopted in the Dungeness Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   WAC 173-518-040, Table II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   2. Dungeness Rule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 In 2006, DOE began working with the local community in eastern Clallam County to draft the Dungeness Rule's language. It put development of the rule on hold in late 2010 while local water resource managers focused on issues outside the scope of the rule. In February 2011, DOE agreed with Clallam County and the Sequim-Dungeness Water Users Association (WUA) that it would have a rule in place by August 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622 DOE filed a proposed version of the Dungeness Rule on May 9, 2012, held a public hearing on the rule on June 28, and left the public comment period open until July 9. In November 2012, DOE filed a concise explanatory statement, describing the rule's effects and responding to each of the hundreds of public comments. DOE published the final rule on November 16. It went into effect on January 2, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   B. COST-BENEFIT AND LEAST BURDENSOME ALTERNATIVE ANALYSES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b623 Alongside the final rule, DOE published a final cost-benefit analysis (CBA) which determined that, over a 20 year period, the Dungeness Rule would cost between $ 9.4 million and $ 26.1 million and provide between $ 32.1 million and $ 79.7 million in benefits. DOE maintained that the CBA was optional because the Dungeness Rule was not a significant legislative rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b624 DOE also published a least-burdensome alternatives (LBA) analysis, in which it determined that the Dungeness Rule as written was the least burdensome out of seven alternatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 DOE did not perform a separate analysis to determine whether the rule produced the maximum net benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   III. LEGAL CHALLENGE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b626 Under the Dungeness Rule, the Bassetts could not obtain a water right for their Clallam County property which reduced its value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b627 In January 2014, ORPC formally requested that DOE amend the Dungeness Rule, claiming that the rule was inconsistent with state law and established precedent. Specifically, it attacked DOE's use of the overriding considerations of public interest (OCPI) exception to create reserves of water and DOE's establishment of MIFs in the Dungeness watershed without applying either a maximum net benefits test or the four-part test for new water appropriations. DOE denied the petition on March 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b628 In December 2014, the Bassetts and ORPC filed a petition for a declaratory judgment that the Dungeness Rule was invalid. The Center for Environmental Law and Policy (CELP) intervened as a defendant. In December 2016, the superior court concluded that the plaintiffs had not met their burden to show the Dungeness Rule was invalid and dismissed the petition with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b629 Plaintiffs petitioned for direct review at the Supreme Court. After briefing was\n   complete, the Supreme Court transferred the case to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   I. LEGAL PRINCIPLES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   A.

It states that the utilization and management of Washington waters shall be guided by a number of principles and contains a list of beneficial uses of water, including, as relevant here, domestic use, stock watering, commercial, agricultural, irrigation, fish and wildlife maintenance and enhancement, and preservation of environmental and aesthetic values. RCW 90.54.020(1). The WRA does not specifically prioritize between these many competing beneficial water uses. However, it provides that \"[a]llocation of waters among potential uses and users shall be based generally on the securing of the maximum net benefits for the people of the state.\" RCW 90.54.020(2). Maximum net benefits constitute \"total benefits less costs including opportunities lost.\" RCW 90.54.020(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b639 Additional water management fundamentals include that \"[t]he quality of the natural environment shall be protected and, where possible, enhanced\" by retaining base flows of rivers and streams \"necessary to provide for preservation of wildlife, fish, scenic, aesthetic and other environmental values, and navigational values,\" but also that \"[a]dequate and safe supplies of water shall be preserved and protected in potable condition to satisfy human domestic needs.\" RCW 90.54.020(3), (5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b640 In 1997, the legislature enacted the WPA in order to \"develop a more thorough and cooperative method of determining what the current water resource situation is in each water resource inventory area of the state and to provide local citizens with the maximum possible input concerning their goals and objectives for water resource management and development.\" RCW 90.82.005.

The Minimum Water Flows and Levels Act (MWFLA) authorizes DOE to \"establish minimum water flows or levels\" to protect fish or wildlife, or \"whenever it appears to be in the public interest.\" RCW 90.22.010. MIFs adopted under this statute \"shall be provided for through the adoption of rules.\" RCW 90.22.020.

The word \"shall\" appears 22 times in RCW 90.54.020. Some examples include the WRA's declarations that \"[t]he quality of the natural environment\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be preserved\"; \"[p]erennial rivers and streams of the state\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be retained with base flows\"; \"[l]akes and ponds\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be retained substantially in their natural condition\"; \"[w]aters of the state\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be of high quality\"; DOE, other state agencies, and local governments \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   evaluate the potential for the development of new storage projects and the benefits and effects of storage in reducing damage to stream banks and property\"; \"[a]dequate and safe supplies of water\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be preserved and protected in potable condition to satisfy human domestic needs.\" RCW 90.54.020(3), (4), (5) (emphasis added). If the legislature's use of the word \"shall\" imposed a formal test on DOE before it allocated any amount of water, DOE would be overwhelmed with countless conflicting tests and unable to perform its water management duties. We reject this argument because it would lead to an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b655 When the legislature intends to impose a specific balancing test on DOE, it has shown that it knows how to do so. For example, the water code establishes a four-part test DOE must apply when considering new water permits. That statute states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [DOE] shall make and file as part of the record in the matter, written findings of fact concerning all things investigated, and if it shall find that there is water available for appropriation for a beneficial use, and the appropriation thereof as proposed in the application will not impair existing rights or be detrimental to the public welfare, it shall issue a permit stating the amount of water to which the applicant shall be entitled and the beneficial use or uses to which it may be applied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   RCW 90.03.290(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b656 If the legislature meant to require DOE to make specific maximum net benefits findings for every allocation of water, it could have used similar language to that in the water code, requiring DOE to \"make and file as part of the record\" a written maximum net benefits finding. It did not do so because the maximum net benefits language of the WRA instructs DOE how to generally exercise its discretion and expertise in water management. It does not impose a formal test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   C. FOUR-PART APPROPRIATIONS TEST\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b657 Plaintiffs contend that DOE exceeded its statutory authority by appropriating water for instream flows without applying the water code's four-part test for new appropriations. They contend that instream flows are water appropriations with priority dates that must go through the same process as any other water appropriation. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b658 When evaluating applications for water appropriations, the water code instructs DOE to verify that the permit satisfies four criteria: \"(1) water is available for appropriation (2) for a beneficial use and (3) an appropriation will not impair existing rights or (4) be detrimental to the public welfare.\"\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12440922\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/184/465/#p471\">\n    184 Wash.2d at 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=362%20P.3d%20959\">\n    362 P.3d 959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RCW 90.03.290(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   \u00b659 Earlier subsections of this statute clarify that it specifically concerns applications to appropriate water. When an application complying with the water code and applicable rules has been filed, subsection (1) directs DOE to \"investigate the application, and determine what water, if any, is available for appropriation, and find and determine to what beneficial use or uses it can be applied.\" RCW 90.03.290(1). Another subsection details the process for issuance of preliminary permits when a water right application fails to furnish sufficient information for DOE to issue a permanent appropriation permit. RCW 90.03.290(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   \u00b660 As discussed above, DOE's authority to establish MIFs comes from multiple sources, all of which use a different process than the water code's applications to appropriate water. The MWFLA gives DOE authority to establish MIFs \"for the purposes of protecting fish, game, birds or other wildlife resources, or recreational or aesthetic values ... whenever it appears to be in the public interest.\" RCW 90.22.010. It also specifies that MIFs should be established \"through the adoption of rules\" and provides several procedural requirements, including a public hearing with notice to the affected community. RCW 90.22.020\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b661 In this case, DOE's MIF authority derives from the WPA, which allows it to set MIFs based on the recommendation of a Watershed Plan through an expedited process sidestepping many APA procedural requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RCW 90.82.080(1)(b). This provision includes many procedural safeguards, including that DOE may only promulgate rules under this statute if the local governments in the area agree to set MIFs and create a formal watershed plan. RCW 90.82.080.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   \u00b662 Regardless which MIF authority DOE invoked in this case, application of the four-part test for new water appropriations is inconsistent with the purpose of MIFs. The first part of the test inquires whether water is \"available for appropriation.\" RCW 90.03.290(3). The very purpose of establishing MIFs is to ensure that water remains available in the basin. If water must be available for DOE to establish MIFs, DOE would be\n   unable to use them when they are most vital to protect instream values and resources.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b663 Plaintiffs emphasize that MIFs are \"appropriations\" within the meaning of the water code and thus must be subject to the four-part test. Plaintiffs are correct that, \"[\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    nce established\n   </em>\n   , a minimum flow constitutes an appropriation with a priority date as of the effective date of the rule establishing the minimum flow.\"\n   <em>\n    Postema\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1361334\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/142/68/#p82\">\n    142 Wash.2d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20P.3d%20726\">\n    11 P.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). However, the process for establishing MIFs is very different than that for granting an appropriation permit under RCW 90.03.290 's appropriation procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b664 Plaintiffs also compare MIFs to reservations, which must \"meet the same requirements as any appropriation of water under the water code.\" Br. of Appellant at 27 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Swinomish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4298466\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/178/571/#p580\">\n    178 Wash.2d at 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20P.3d%206\">\n    311 P.3d 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ) (emphasis omitted).

Unlike MIFs, reservations involve withdrawal of water for out-of-stream use. Determining whether water is \"available\" for such out-of-stream uses makes sense, as it would with a permit application. This reasoning does not apply to MIFs, where requiring water availability would defeat their very purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b665 We conclude that DOE may exercise its authority to set MIFs without resorting to the four-part test for evaluation of water appropriation permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   III. RESERVES AND OCPI EXCEPTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   \u00b666 The Dungeness Rule established reserves of water, not subject to MIFs, specifically for domestic use. DOE found that these reserves served overriding considerations of public interest. WAC 173-518-080(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   RCW 90.54.020(3)(a). If domestic water users complied with a list of specific conditions, they could use reserve water despite potential impacts to the MIFs. WAC 173-518-080.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   \u00b667 Plaintiffs claim that DOE exceeded its statutory authority by establishing these reserves. They contend that the legislature's express approval of the Dungeness Rule's water reserves does not cure this defect because it does not address conflicting case law from\n   <em>\n    Swinomish\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Foster\n   </em>\n   relating to the overriding considerations of public interest exception.

These reservations constitute appropriations within the meaning of the water code with priority dates as of the effective dates of their establishment. RCW 90.03.345. DOE creates these reservations by administrative rule. RCW 90.54.050.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b669 Once MIFs are established for a body of water, they are appropriations \"which may not be impaired\" by subsequent withdrawals.\n   <em>\n    Postema\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1361334\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/142/68/#p82\">\n    142 Wash.2d at 81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20P.3d%20726\">\n    11 P.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Based on the foregoing, the priority date for new PE wells that conflict with MIFs is the date when water is first put to a beneficial use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   C. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS AND LEAST BURDENSOME ALTERNATIVES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   \u00b6103 Plaintiffs claim that DOE erred in its CBA and LBA analyses by refusing to consider the \"cost\" of lost legal rights for potential drillers of future PE wells. They claim that DOE erred by refusing to assign any value to the \"right\" to drill a PE well in the Dungeness basin, and thus erred by failing to consider the cost of these lost rights in its CBA and LBA. Because the Dungeness Rule was not a \"significant legislative rule,\" DOE was not required to perform a CBA or LBA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   \u00b6104 The APA provides a list of procedural requirements state agencies must follow before adopting a \"significant legislative rule.\" RCW 34.05.328(1). These requirements include a determination that the probable benefits of the rule are greater than its probable costs and that the rule is the least burdensome alternative that will achieve the general goals and specific objectives it seeks to accomplish. RCW 34.05.328(1)(d), (e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   \u00b6105 A \"significant legislative rule\" is one that \"adopts substantive provisions of law pursuant to delegated legislative authority, the violation of which subjects a violator of such rule to a penalty or sanction\" or that \"establishes, alters, or revokes any qualification or standard for the issuance, suspension, or revocation of a license or permit.\" RCW 34.05.328(5)(c)(iii). The Dungeness Rule clearly meets this definition. It adopts numerous substantive provisions of law, including MIFs, closure of the basin to new withdrawals, and metering and mitigation requirements. However, the WPA provides an exception to the normal definition of \"significant legislative rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   \u00b6106 Under the WPA, DOE may use an expedited rulemaking process when setting MIFs set in accordance with watershed plans. RCW 90.82.080. When utilizing this process, DOE may use the standard APA rulemaking process, an expedited APA process, or a process \"that uses public hearings and notice provided by the county legislative authority to the greatest extent possible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   RCW 90.82.080(1)(b). Rules adopted under this section \"do not constitute significant legislative rules.\" RCW 90.82.080(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   \u00b6107 A \"central purpose\" of the Elwha-Dungeness Plan was to establish MIFs and the plan proposed specific instream flow numbers for numerous streams in the basin, including the Dungeness mainstem. Each MIF established by the Dungeness Rule is identical to the recommended MIF proposed in the plan. WAC 173-518-040, Table II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \u00b6108 The plan also provided many recommendations besides MIFs. It recommended continued groundwater withdrawals be conditioned on mitigation to surface water impacts and increased regulation of PE wells. It suggested creation of a groundwater reserve to facilitate land use planning, managed growth, and protection of instream flows. It also recommended that, for new wells, it be made clear \"that the date of priority ... of a water right is the date the water is put to beneficial use, not the date the well was drilled.\" ECY070408.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   \u00b6109 The plan additionally recommended establishment of a \"limited groundwater reserve\" to keep some available water for future appropriation. ECY070402. DOE implemented this recommendation with its creation of reservations of water for domestic use, not subject to MIFs. WAC 173-518-080.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   \u00b6110 Both the Plan and the Rule contemplated creation of MIFs, priority dates for PE wells based on when water is put to a beneficial use, and establishment of water reserves. To the extent plaintiffs have identified minor discrepancies between the Plan and the Rule, the overall character and purpose of the rule was still to enact the recommendations of the plan. DOE used the Plan as \"the foundation\" for developing the Rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   AR at ECY002041.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   \u00b6111 DOE adopted the Dungeness Rule pursuant to its authority to establish MIFs consistent with watershed plans under the WPA. Consequently, the Rule is not a \"significant legislative rule\" and DOE was not required to perform a CBA or LBA analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   VI. ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   \u00b6112 Finally, plaintiffs claim that the Dungeness Rule is arbitrary and capricious for many of the same reasons discussed above. They claim it was arbitrary and capricious because DOE did not make maximum net benefits findings, did not consider public interest under the four-part test for new appropriations, and appropriated more water for fish than naturally exists in the basin. They additionally claim DOE was arbitrary and capricious by foreclosing future domestic use, approving a mitigation plan before acquiring year-round mitigation, and \"attempt[ing] to make new law regarding the priority date of [PE] wells.\" Br. of Appellant at 47-48.

In order to meet these goals, DOE adopted each of the provisions laid out above, as well as requiring metering for all water use in the Dungeness Basin, establishing maximum depletion amounts to limit adverse impacts caused by new mitigated appropriations, and adopting several other water management provisions not raised by plaintiffs.
