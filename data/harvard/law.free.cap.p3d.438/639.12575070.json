She also argues that ASRS violated its fiduciary duty in denying her request for a retroactive retirement date. She further argues that ASRS breached statutory and constitutional provisions protecting her retirement benefits against forfeiture, diminution, or impairment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm. The plain language of A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(A) prohibits an ASRS member from electing a retirement date before the date that ASRS receives the member's retirement application. Also, Lagerman's request for a retroactive retirement date was properly denied because she was unable to show that she could not have submitted a retirement application before the retroactive date that she had sought. Further, ASRS did not violate its fiduciary duty to Lagerman, and it did not cause her to forfeit her benefits or cause her benefits to diminish or become impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In 1978, Lagerman became an ASRS member when she was hired as a securities examiner with the Arizona Corporation Commission, and her membership continued when she later worked as an attorney with the Arizona Attorney General's Office (\"AGO\") from 1981 to February 2003. An active member is a state employee who works at least 20 weeks in each fiscal year, works at least 20 hours each week, and makes member contributions to ASRS. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-711(1). As an ASRS member, Lagerman received annual member statements. After Lagerman left the AGO in February\n   2003, ASRS mailed her an annual member statement for the time period of July 1, 2003 through June 30, 2004. The member statement included Lagerman's early retirement date (the earliest date she could retire under the law) and her normal retirement date for all three statutory definitions of normal retirement. For ASRS members who joined before July 1, 2011, \"normal retirement date\" means the earliest of the following: (1) a member's 65th birthday, (2) a member's 62nd birthday and completion of at least ten years of service, or (3) the first day that the sum of a member's age and years of service equals 80. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-711(27)(a). Lagerman's earliest normal retirement date was December 23, 2007, under the 80-points definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Although Lagerman was not an active member in 2005, ASRS allowed her to complete a service purchase that she had submitted in 2003 because it had not timely processed her request. An active member of ASRS may purchase credited service for prior public employment by paying a certain amount into ASRS. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-743. The service purchase accelerated Lagerman's 80-points normal retirement date to July 23, 2005, which was reflected in her member statement for the time period of July 1, 2004 through June 30, 2005.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 In summer 2006, Lagerman was diagnosed with cancer and underwent chemotherapy. During and following chemotherapy, Lagerman's mental and physical abilities deteriorated; she had difficulty concentrating and holding conversations. During this time, ASRS continued to mail her annual member statements from the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2005, through the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2010. Each member statement that she received moved the stated normal retirement date to the end of the applicable period. The member statements also stated that \"[r]etirees receiving a monthly benefit are permitted under certain circumstances to return to work and still receive their benefit. For details on the return to work options, visit the ASRS website.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 ASRS stopped mailing the member statements to its members, including Lagerman, June 30, 2011. ASRS gave notice to its members that they must access their retirement information on their ASRS online accounts. Lagerman had already created an online ASRS account in 2007. She had also contacted ASRS in 2008 for assistance in resetting her account password.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 On April 6, 2016, ASRS received Lagerman's completed ASRS retirement application and processed her retirement effective as of that date. Lagerman appealed to the ASRS Assistant Director and requested a retirement date of August 2006. In her appeal letter, she noted that she had attended a benefits exposition at the AGO at which the ASRS representative stated that employees could not work more than 20 hours per week after retirement. She also noted that in 2003 the AGO informed her that she could not work more than 20 hours per week after retiring. She further noted that when she left the AGO, she \"did not retire because [she] wanted to continue [her] professional career with full time work.\" The ASRS Assistant Director denied her appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 Lagerman appealed to the ASRS Director, who denied the appeal. She then appealed that decision, and an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") held a hearing in January 2017. During the hearing, Lagerman's counsel asked ASRS employee Jenna Orozco whether the lump sum amount ASRS would have to pay Lagerman if it granted her request for a retroactive retirement under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-715(D)(4) was a factor in denying the request. Orozco denied that ASRS considered the amount of money that it would have to pay Lagerman when it rejected her request. Another ASRS employee, Ryan Falls, testified that he had no knowledge about the facts in Lagerman's case and was called to testify only about the actuarial concepts of the retirement system. During closing argument, counsel for ASRS also explained that Falls's testimony was offered simply to show that actuarial reasons to limit retroactive retirements under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-715(D)(4) exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The ALJ recommended affirming the ASRS Director's determination, which the ASRS Appeals Committee accepted. Lagerman then appealed to the superior court, which affirmed the ASRS Appeals Committee's decision. Lagerman timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Statutory Interpretation of A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(A)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 Lagerman argues that the superior court erred in concluding that A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(A) does not allow her to elect a retirement date that occurred before the date she submitted her retirement application. This Court reviews the superior court's decision de novo and determines \"whether the administrative action was not supported by substantial evidence or was illegal, arbitrary and capricious, or involved an abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Pendergast v.

As such, she argues that she could wait until many years after she terminated work to retroactively elect to have her retirement begin just after she was eligible for full retirement. She is incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b613 The statute states that a member's retirement date \"shall not be earlier\" than (1) the day following the date of termination, (2) the date ASRS receives the member's completed retirement application, or (3) the date specified by the member under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(I).

By allowing a member to retire without terminating employment, A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(I) is inconsistent with the plain language of A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(A), under which a member may not retire and continue work. To address this inconsistency, we apply the\n   rules of statutory construction and consider the statute's history, context, and purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stein v.

The legislature added what is now subpart (I), allowing a retired member to continue to work on a limited basis, in 1999 with Senate Bill 1083. Before that amendment, A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(A) provided that the commencement of a member's retirement \"shall not be earlier than the day following the date of termination of employment or the date ASRS receives the member's completed retirement application.\" The legislature added the third clause to subpart (A) (\"the date specified by the member\") in 1999, at the same time it amended the statute to add what is now subpart (I). 1999 Ariz. Sess. Laws, ch. 327, \u00a7 15 (1st Reg. Sess.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 The plain language of the statute before the amendment provided that a member could not elect to begin receiving retirement benefits before the date of the member's termination of employment or the date that ASRS received the member's completed retirement application. The purpose of the amendment was merely to allow retired members to work on a limited basis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   2.

Clarifies that a member who has attained a normal retirement date but continues to work less than the hours required for active ASRS membership may do so without losing that member's retirement pension.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Senate Fact Sheet, S.B. 1083, 44th Leg., 1st Reg. Sess. (Ariz. Feb. 1, 1999);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(I). Nothing in the legislative history indicates that when the legislature amended subpart (A) to accommodate the new provision in what is now subpart (I), it intended to eliminate the requirement that a member must submit a completed retirement application before beginning retirement, or that it intended to allow an employee to retroactively elect a retirement date many years in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b617 Related statutes support this interpretation. Arizona Revised Statutes section 38-757(A) states, \"\n   <em>\n    After application on a form prescribed by the director\n   </em>\n   , a member may retire on reaching the member's normal retirement date.\" (Emphasis added.) Also, A.R.S. \u00a7 38-766(A) states that a retired member who works at least 20 weeks in a fiscal year and at least 20 hours per week resumes active membership in ASRS. In such event, the statute states that the member's retirement benefits will be suspended until the member either (1) terminates employment\n   <em>\n    and completes an application for re-retirement\n   </em>\n   or (2) attains a normal retirement date, no longer meets the active membership criteria,\n   <em>\n    and completes an application for re-retirement\n   </em>\n   . A.R.S. \u00a7 38-766(A). Therefore, the ASRS statutory scheme requires that a member's retirement may not commence before the member submits a retirement application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 Lagerman contends that any ambiguity in A.R.S. \u00a7 38-764(A) must be construed in her favor. \"[I]f the meaning of a ... provision remains uncertain after consideration of the parties' intentions, as reflected by their language in view of surrounding circumstances, a secondary rule of construction requires the provision to be construed against the drafter.\"\n   <em>\n    Pendergast\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324684\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/535/\">\n    234 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   541 \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324684\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/234/535/\">\n    323 P.3d at 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    MT Builders, L.L.C. v.

Here, the plain language in the statute is unambiguous because the language can be interpreted only one way grammatically. And an inconsistency created by the 1999 amendment has been resolved by looking at the legislative history and statutory scheme, which show that the legislature intended that a member cannot receive retirement benefits before the member submits a retirement application. Because the intent of the legislature is clear, we need not construe the statute against ASRS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

She claims that ASRS breached its fiduciary duty by (a) taking financial and actuarial consequences into account when denying her request for a retroactive retirement date under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-715(D)(4) and (b) failing to raise her retirement options during her previous conversations with ASRS representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b620 ASRS owes a fiduciary duty to its members, including Lagerman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

Here, nothing in the record shows that Lagerman was unable to apply before the retroactive effective date through no fault of her own. Therefore, ASRS did not breach its fiduciary duty by declining to grant her a retroactive retirement date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b621 Lagerman cites other instances in which ASRS granted retroactive retirement dates, and she contends that her cancer history warranted a retroactive date. But ASRS granted retroactive retirement dates in those cases because the members were not at fault, including instances of administrative errors and instances when the member clearly expressed an intent to retire. Although Lagerman experienced mental and physical difficulties after receiving chemotherapy, her cancer diagnosis could not serve as a basis for allowing a retroactive retirement date because she was not diagnosed with cancer until summer 2006, a year after she became eligible for retirement in July 2005. Furthermore, she did not clearly show her intent to retire until 2016. Following the language of A.R.S. \u00a7 38-715(D)(4), this evidence supports the ALJ and Director's decision that her cancer did not prevent her from applying for retirement when she became eligible in 2005. Although she claims that she did not retire in 2005 because an ASRS representative had previously advised her that she would not be able to return to work full-time for the State if she collected retirement benefits at any time, she provides no evidence for this other than her own testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Royal Globe Ins.

App. 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1248981\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz-app/20/432/#p434\">\n    513 P.2d 970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 972 (App. 1973) (this Court defers to the ALJ's credibility determinations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b622 Lagerman also argues that Falls and Orozco's testimony showed that ASRS considered the potential financial and actuarial consequences of granting her request for retroactive retirement in denying her request. Assuming without deciding that ASRS might breach a fiduciary duty by considering the financial consequences of a waiver, the record shows that ASRS provided Falls's testimony to simply demonstrate that the limiting of retroactive retirements under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-715(D)(4) has an actuarial purpose. Falls testified that he had no knowledge of the facts in Lagerman's case and was called to testify only about the actuarial concepts for the retirement system. Moreover, Orozco testified that financial consequences were not a factor in determining whether to grant Lagerman's request for a retroactive retirement date. Therefore, this argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b623 Next, Lagerman notes that she had various contacts with ASRS between 2003 and 2016, and she argues that ASRS breached its fiduciary duty by failing to inform her of her retirement options before 2016. Under A.R.S. \u00a7 38-755(A), ASRS \"shall make information concerning a member's account accessible to the member in written or electronic form. This information shall include the member's current account balance, contact information, beneficiary election, estimated retirement date and estimated benefit amount.\" The record shows that ASRS complied with A.R.S. \u00a7 38-755(A) by mailing Lagerman retirement statements\n   and by later posting the information online for Lagerman to review. The record also shows that each time Lagerman contacted ASRS, the contact's purpose was logged-and none of the contacts before 2016 concerned how or when she could receive her retirement benefits. Instead, the contacts focused on other subjects, such as resetting her password or addressing service purchase issues. The last contact logged was in March 2016, when Lagerman called to update her beneficiary designation and to schedule an appointment in April 2016 to start her retirement. Lagerman does not cite any authority for the proposition that ASRS representatives must explain a member's retirement options every time they hear from a member, and we know of no authority. As such, this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b624 Lagerman also excuses her delayed application by claiming that she was confused because of the multiple normal retirement dates and because ASRS began including return-to-work information on the member statements after she began her battle with cancer. If Lagerman was confused about the member statements and the normal retirement dates, she could have contacted ASRS for clarification, but she did not do so. Likewise, if she had questions about returning to work, she could have searched for the information on the ASRS website or contacted an ASRS representative, but again, she did not do so. As such, this argument is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Remaining Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b625 Lagerman argues that ASRS's refusal to allow her to elect a retirement date that was before the date she had submitted her retirement application caused her to forfeit about $220,000 in retirement benefits, thereby violating A.R.S. \u00a7 38-757(A). That subsection states that a member's right to retirement benefits is nonforfeitable upon attainment of the member's normal retirement date. A.R.S. \u00a7 38-757(A). Although the statute affirms that a member's right to retirement benefits is vested after reaching the member's normal retirement date, the vesting does not extinguish the member's need to satisfy other statutory requirements before making a retirement effective, such as filing a retirement application.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v. Elected Officials' Ret. Plan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309881\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/33/\">\n    241 Ariz. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 44 \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309881\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/33/\">\n    383 P.3d 1107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1118 (2016). Thus, this argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b626 She also argues that ASRS's actions diminished or impaired her retirement benefits. The Arizona Constitution, Article 29, Section 1 (C)-(D) provides, \"Membership in a public retirement system is a contractual relationship that is subject to article II, section 25[,]\" and \"[p]ublic retirement system benefits shall not be diminished or impaired[.]\" The ASRS contractual relationship is described in the ASRS statutes, which require a member to file a retirement application before the member can receive retirement benefits. A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 38-757(A), -764(A), -766(A). After submitting her application in April 2016, which the contractual relationship requires, Lagerman has been receiving monthly payments from ASRS. And because Lagerman elected a joint and survivor annuity option naming her husband as the beneficiary, ASRS will pay any remaining monthly benefits to her husband after her passing. Thus, her retirement benefits have not been diminished or impaired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b627 Lagerman requests attorneys' fees under Arizona Rule of Civil Appellate Procedure 21 and A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-341.01 and -348. As the unsuccessful party on appeal, she is not entitled to attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b628 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
