U.S. Bank National Association's (U.S. Bank's) agent sent Ms. Ukpoma a notice that her loan balance was accelerated and the entire amount was immediately due and payable. The notice contradictorily stated she could reinstate the loan if she paid the delinquent payments plus various charges 11 or more days before an unscheduled trustee's sale. No such sale ever occurred. For various reasons, U.S. Bank did not bring this judicial foreclosure action until more than eight years after its agent sent its notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 We are asked to decide whether the agent's notice was sufficiently clear and unequivocal so as to constitute an acceleration of the installment loan. A majority of this panel concludes that the agent's notice was unclear and did not accelerate the loan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 We also discuss whether initiating a nonjudicial foreclosure tolls the statute of limitations for commencing a judicial foreclosure action. This author believes there is no tolling but a majority of this panel believes otherwise. We publish this opinion to encourage further debate of this important issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 We unanimously conclude that U.S. Bank can judicially foreclose its deed of trust, and we affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b65 In December 2006, Angela Ukpoma executed a promissory note for the purchase of her home. The note, secured by a deed of trust, required her to pay monthly installments for 30 years. U.S. Bank is the note holder and assignee of the deed of trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b66 Ms. Ukpoma failed to make a scheduled payment on October 1, 2007, and has failed to make any further payments. On or about February 1, 2008, Quality Loan Service Corporation (QLS) sent Ms. Ukpoma a notice of default. The notice provides in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   You are hereby notified that [U.S. Bank] has elected to accelerate the loan described herein, and has declared the entire balance of $ 252,000.00, plus accrued costs, immediately due and payable. NOTWITHSTANDING SAID ACCELERATION, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REINSTATE THE LOAN BY PAYING THE DELINQUENT PAYMENTS, LATE CHARGES, COSTS AND FEES ON OR BEFORE THE ELEVENTH (11TH) DAY BEFORE THE DATE OF THE TRUSTEE'S SALE ....\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 307. In the notice, QLS identified itself as \"Agent for U.S. Bank ..., the Beneficiary.\" CP at 307.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 QLS did not initiate a trustee's sale until its notice of trustee's sale dated November 7, 2008. The notice set forth the delinquent balance. The cure amount showed that\n   the loan had not been accelerated. QLS discontinued the first sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 QLS subsequently initiated and discontinued multiple other trustee's sales. The initiation dates are June 18, 2009, February 23, 2010, May 14, 2010, June 11, 2010, August 22, 2011, and March 13, 2014. Similar to the initial notice of trustee's sale, these notices set forth the delinquent balance and cure amounts. All of the notices showed that the loan had not been accelerated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Ms. Ukpoma also filed for bankruptcy protection in 2008 and again in late 2010. The bankruptcy stays shielded Ms. Ukpoma's property for approximately one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b610 On May 13, 2016, U.S. Bank filed the present action to judicially foreclosure its deed of trust. U.S. Bank moved for summary judgment. Ms. Ukpoma responded that the February 1, 2008 default notice accelerated the installment loan so that the action was barred by RCW 4.16.040, the six-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 The trial court concluded that QLS's notice was ineffective to accelerate the installment loan. It alternatively concluded that the statute of limitations had not run because the bankruptcies combined with the nonjudicial foreclosures sufficiently tolled the statute. Given these conclusions, the trial court granted U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Ms. Ukpoma appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.

The question before us is whether to construe the February 2008 notice as a clear and unequivocal acceleration of the installment note. We decline to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 The February 2008 notice was unclear. It declared the full amount immediately due and payable. But it then contradicted itself by advising Ms. Ukpoma that she could reinstate the loan by paying the delinquent payments plus various charges 11 or more days before an unscheduled trustee's sale. Nine months later, when QLS first initiated the trustee's sale, the notice showed that the note had not been accelerated. It unequivocally\n   permitted Ms. Ukpoma to reinstate her loan by paying the delinquent payments, plus late charges, costs, and fees. All subsequent notices showed that the note had not been accelerated. To construe the February 2008 notice as a clear and unequivocal acceleration of the installment note would provide a windfall to Ms. Ukpoma, who never lost her right to reinstate the loan by simply paying the delinquent payments, plus late charges, costs, and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 We therefore hold that QLS's February 2008 notice did not accelerate the installment note. And because the note never accelerated, the six-year statute of limitations has not run on all of the installment payments. We conclude that the trial court did not err in granting U.S. Bank's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   C. THIS AUTHOR BELIEVES THAT INITIATING NONJUDICIAL FORECLOSURE DOES NOT TOLL THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Because the installment note was never accelerated, we need not address whether commencement of the various nonjudicial foreclosures tolled the statute of limitations. But because the secondary opinion addresses this issue, this author wishes to respond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 This author believes that\n   <em>\n    Bingham v. Lechner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1072109\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/111/118/\">\n    111 Wash.

The\n   <em>\n    Bingham\n   </em>\n   court writes, \"The trial court found, and the parties agree, that commencement of a nonjudicial foreclosure tolls the statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 127,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20P.3d%20562\">\n    45 P.3d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Bingham\n   </em>\n   court never questioned or analyzed this issue. In fact, nothing in the nonjudicial foreclosure statute, RCW 61.24.030, mentions tolling. This is impliedly acknowledged by the secondary opinion's reliance on RCW 4.16.230 instead of RCW 61.24.030.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 RCW 4.16.230 provides in relevant part: \"When the commencement of an action is stayed by injunction or a statutory prohibition, the time of the continuance of the injunction or prohibition shall not be a part of the time limited for the commencement of the action.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   automatically stays all proceedings against a debtor, including the action here, a judicial foreclosure action. Apart from this, the secondary opinion does not cite any statute that stays a judicial foreclosure action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b622 RCW 61.24.030(4), cited in the secondary opinion, is certainly not such a statute. RCW 61.24.030 provides in relevant part: \"It shall be requisite to a\n   <em>\n    trustee's sale\n   </em>\n   ... (4) [t]hat no action commenced by the beneficiary of the deed of trust is now pending to seek satisfaction of [the secured debt].\" (Emphasis added). A trustee's sale is a nonjudicial foreclosure. RCW 61.24.005(17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b623 RCW 61.24.030(4) thus prevents a deed of trust beneficiary from commencing a\n   <em>\n    nonjudicial\n   </em>\n   foreclosure if a judicial foreclosure action is pending. It does not operate in reverse-to prevent a deed of trust beneficiary from commencing a\n   <em>\n    judicial\n   </em>\n   foreclosure action if a nonjudicial foreclosure is pending. Because RCW 61.24.030(4) did not stay the commencement of this judicial foreclosure action, RCW 4.16.230 did not toll the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b624 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   I CONCUR:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Korsmo, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    By statute, the borrower has a right to reinstate the loan by paying the delinquent payments, late charges, costs, and fees at any time 11 days or more before the trustee's sale.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    part V of the statutory form for \"Notice of Trustee's Sale\" contained in RCW 61.24.040(2)(d) ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    part V of the form in former RCW 61.24.040(1)(f) (2008).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-41\">\n   Korsmo, J.

It could hardly be more clear,\n   stating, \"[T]he beneficiary has elected to accelerate the loan described herein\" and \"[the beneficiary] has declared the entire principal balance of $ 252,000.00, plus accrued costs, immediately due and payable.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 307. \"NOTWITHSTANDING SAID ACCELERATION\" reinforces the fact of acceleration, even if it is followed by an offer of terms on which Ms. Ukpoma could reinstate the loan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ms. Ukpoma never reinstated the loan. The unambiguous acceleration stands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b629 The lead opinion acknowledges that it finds ambiguity sua sponte. It does so in a matter that was decided on summary judgment. Three declarations were offered in support of summary judgment by U.S. Bank National Association on behalf of the beneficiary mortgage trust\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the Trust), and none of the three assert that the Trust did not elect to accelerate the obligation in 2008. For all we know, the reason the Trust later offered lesser cure amounts was the result of loss mitigation and mediation requirements enacted beginning in 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b630 The Trust argues that it was entitled to summary judgment on different grounds (reason enough not to speculate about ambiguity). It argues first, that the acceleration language in QLS's notice of default was ineffective. Its second argument is that as a result of tolling, its judicial foreclosure action was not time barred when commenced on May 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b631 The first ground is unpersuasive. The Trust does not deny that in 2008 it \"elected to accelerate the loan described [in QLS's notice of default]\" and \"declared the entire principal balance of $ 252,000.00, plus accrued costs, immediately due and payable,\" as asserted by QLS's notice. CP at 307. For summary judgment purposes, we assume that it did. But it argues that QLS's notice of default failed to comply with Ms. Ukpoma's deed of trust in two respects: first, it was issued by QLS, not the Trust;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and second, it did not provide Ms. Ukpoma with notice and an opportunity to cure prior to acceleration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b632 If the Trust elected to accelerate and declare the entire loan balance due without providing the required form of notice, then\n   <em>\n    the promisee\n   </em>\n   -Ms. Ukpoma-could elect whether to claim a breach or waive it.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colo.
