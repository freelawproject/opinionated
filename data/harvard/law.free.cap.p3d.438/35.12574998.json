Specifically, Robinson objected to the four points added to his criminal history score based on his prior conviction for assault on a police officer. In determining that the assault was a \"person crime with injury\" for purposes of the sentencing guidelines, the district court looked to the PSR, police report, and photographs from the prior crime and concluded that an \"injury\" occurred where Robinson punched the police officer in the face, causing pain and a laceration to his nose. Robinson argues that the court should not have relied on such evidence and that the court abused its discretion by finding that the injury sustained by the police officer qualified for the four-point assessment. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 Following an episode of domestic violence between Robinson and his wife, the State charged Robinson with several offenses, including aggravated assault. In exchange for the State dismissing six of the charges, Robinson pled guilty to one count of aggravated assault, a third-degree felony, with a weapon enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 At the district court's request, Adult Probation and Parole (AP&amp;P) conducted an investigation and submitted a PSR. As part of the PSR, AP&amp;P calculated a criminal history assessment score for Robinson, which it then incorporated into the Utah Sentencing Commission's general matrix (Sentencing Matrix). The Sentencing Matrix \"compare[s] a defendant's 'criminal history assessment' score with the degree of the offense of which he ha[s] been convicted\" to \"assist sentencing judges in deciding whether or not to incarcerate.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Egbert\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10402144\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/748/558/#p561\">\n    748 P.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 561-62 (Utah 1987) (Durham, J., dissenting).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 Robinson received a criminal history assessment score of eight, placing him in criminal history category III. Four of the eight criminal history points were based on Robinson's prior conviction for attempted homicide, which AP&amp;P categorized as a \"person crime with injury.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   When viewed in conjunction with the third-degree felony to which Robinson pled guilty, Robinson's category\n   III score produced a recommendation of an \"intermediate sanction\" on the Sentencing Matrix-i.e., \"any sanction between regular probation and prison.\" Utah Sentencing Comm'n,\n   <em>\n    Adult Sentencing &amp; Release Guidelines\n   </em>\n   17 (2015), https://www.utah.gov/pmn/files/172049.pdf. AP&amp; P recommended, however, that the district court deviate from that recommendation and impose the maximum sentence of one-to-ten years in the Utah State Prison \"due to the extremely brutal nature of the offense, as well as the defendant's repeated history of violent behaviors,\" which indicate that Robinson is \"an immediate public safety risk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5 Robinson challenged the accuracy of the PSR, arguing that AP&amp;P had incorrectly categorized his prior attempted homicide conviction as a \"person crime with injury\" based on the mistaken belief that the offense had resulted in death. Because no injury or death had occurred during the commission of that prior crime, Robinson argued that he should have been awarded only two points instead of four toward the total score on his criminal history assessment. A reduced criminal history score of six would have placed him in criminal history category II, resulting in a recommendation of \"probation\" under the Sentencing Matrix.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 6 After reviewing the objections to the PSR, AP&amp;P admitted that it had erroneously stated that Robinson had previously caused the death of another individual. But AP&amp;P determined that Robinson should nevertheless be assessed four points for committing a prior person crime with injury based on a separate class A misdemeanor conviction for assaulting a police officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b6 7 Robinson moved the district court to correct the PSR, contending that AP&amp;P's amended evaluation was \"driven by the earlier error[ ] rather than a fair assessment of the facts\" underlying the prior assault conviction. Robinson further argued that the award of four points was \"particularly inappropriate\" because the PSR for the prior assault conviction reflected that the police officer reported \"no physical or emotional injury as a result of the incident.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b6 8 The district court requested that Robinson submit the police report, photographs, and PSR from the prior assault case for it to consider. Before relying on that evidence to determine whether Robinson's prior person crime conviction involved an injury, the court asked, \"[D]oes anybody contest what the photograph and the police reports say?\" Robinson's counsel responded, \"No.\" The court followed up by asking, \"[D]oes everybody agree the police reports are what they are? This is what they say? The photographs of the police officer.\" In response, Robinson's counsel stated, \"That is correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 9 The district court ultimately determined that Robinson's prior assault conviction qualified as a \"person crime with injury\" under the Sentencing Matrix. Because the sentencing guidelines do not include a definition of \"injury,\" the district court referred to the Utah Criminal Code, which defines \"bodily injury\" as \"physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-1-601\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-1-601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (LexisNexis 2017). Based on this definition, the court found \"the officer did have an injury,\" even if it was minor. In support of its finding, the court pointed to the police report, which stated that the officer had been \"punched in the nose by [Robinson],\" and the photograph, which showed \"blood on the left side of his nose.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 10 The district court adopted the PSR, including the four-point enhancement for the prior assault, and ultimately sentenced Robinson to one-to-ten years in prison, the maximum permissible sentence for a third-degree felony with an enhancement for the use of a dangerous weapon. In doing so, the court stated that its decision to send Robinson to prison was not \"based on those two extra points.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 11 Robinson appeals. Although he does not challenge the ultimate sentence imposed, he asserts that his PSR \"will follow him through the justice system\" and seeks \"a remand for the purpose of correcting the inaccuracy in his PSR.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 12 Robinson raises two sentencing issues on appeal, one procedural and one substantive. As to the procedural issue, he\n   contends that the district court failed to comply with its legal duty to properly resolve the alleged inaccuracy contained in the PSR. \"Whether the [district] court properly complied with a legal duty to resolve on the record the accuracy of contested information in sentencing reports is a question of law that we review for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Waterfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947712\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/1194/\">\n    2014 UT App 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 29,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6947712\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/1194/\">\n    322 P.3d 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). Robinson also argues that the court erred in relying on unreliable police reports and photographs to resolve his objection. Whether the court based its sentencing decision on reliable information also \"presents a question of law that is reviewed for correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Maroney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9194778\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/94/295/\">\n    2004 UT App 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9194778\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/94/295/\">\n    94 P.3d 295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 13 Substantively, Robinson contends that the district court abused its discretion in determining that the injury sustained by the police officer rendered that conviction a \"person crime with injury.\" This sentencing determination resulted in a higher criminal history assessment score. District courts are afforded wide latitude in sentencing, and we will reverse a sentencing decision only if the court abused its discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Procedural Challenge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 14 Under Utah Code section 77-18-1(6)(a), \"[a]ny alleged inaccuracies in the [PSR], which have not been resolved by the parties and the department prior to sentencing, shall be brought to the attention of the sentencing judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2077-18-1\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 77-18-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6)(a) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018). To resolve such issues, the district court must: (1) \"consider the objection raised;\" (2) \"make findings on the record regarding the accuracy of the information at issue;\" and (3) \"determine on the record the relevance of that information as it relates to sentencing.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Abelon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6809891\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/369/113/\">\n    2016 UT App 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6809891\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/369/113/\">\n    369 P.3d 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 15 At sentencing, Robinson objected to the PSR's calculation of his criminal history assessment score. Specifically, Robinson claimed that his prior conviction for assault on a police officer did not qualify as a \"person crime with injury,\" which carried a four-point assessment. Robinson argued that assessing four points was only \"rational when ... someone is convicted or pleads guilty to an offense which requires as an element some type of injury, [and] this isn't such an offense.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 16 The district court considered Robinson's objection and made findings on the record that Robinson's prior conviction qualified as a person crime with injury for purposes of calculating his criminal history score. On appeal, Robinson challenges the court's use of the police report and photographs from the prior offense in making that determination. Whether it was permissible for the court to look to this evidence to categorize the prior conviction involves two sub-issues, only the first of which was preserved. First, we consider whether the district court properly looked beyond the elements of the prior offense to the underlying facts that gave rise to that conviction. Second, because we conclude that the court properly looked beyond the elements of the offense, we consider whether the court based its determination on sufficiently reliable evidence. This second sub-issue was not preserved, and although Robinson asks us to reach it through the plain error exception to the preservation rule, Robinson cannot establish plain error on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2076\">\n    2017 UT 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567068\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/416/443/\">\n    416 P.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that appellate courts do not consider unpreserved arguments unless an exception to the preservation rule applies and acknowledging plain error as an exception to the preservation rule).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   A. Consideration of Facts Underlying Prior Conviction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 17 First, Robinson contends that the district court erred in categorizing his prior conviction for assault on a police officer\n   as a \"person crime with injury\" because that offense does not include injury as an element. But nothing in the language of the Sentencing Matrix limits the application of the \"person crime with injury\" category to crimes in which injury is an element of the offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 18 The phrase appears only once in the 2015 Utah Sentencing Guidelines, written as \"person crime w/injury\" at the top of the Sentencing Matrix.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Utah Sentencing Comm'n,\n   <em>\n    Adult Sentencing &amp; Release Guidelines\n   </em>\n   19 (2015), https://www.utah.gov/pmn/files/172049.pdf. The instructions accompanying the Sentencing Matrix provide no guidance on how to interpret the phrase. Nor do they define or place any limitation on the term \"injury.\" If the sentencing commission had wished to limit application of the four points to those person crimes in which injury was an element of the offense, it could have easily done so, either in the instructions or by changing the language in the Sentencing Matrix to \"person crime w/injury as an element.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b6 19 In contrast, the instructions to the Sentencing Matrix do define the term \"person crime.\" A person crime means \"any offense listed in Utah Code Annotated 76-3-203.5(c), as well as those designated as person crimes in Addendum B.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Addendum B instructs courts to \"first determine the degree of the offense (1st degree, 2nd degree, or 3rd degree) by referring to the judgment and commitment order or other official court document. Then, look on this list to determine whether the offense is categorized as\n   <em>\n    murder, death, person, possession,\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    other.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43. While offenses that constitute \"person\" crimes are listed by statute number, Addendum B does not indicate which of those person crimes should be categorized as \"person crimes w/injury.\" This omission strongly suggests that such a determination is not categorical based on the elements of the prior offense, but depends on the facts underlying the prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b6 20 In the absence of any contrary direction in the sentencing guidelines, we apply the general proposition that the sentencing court \"must be permitted to consider any and all information that reasonably might bear on the proper sentence for the particular defendant, given the crime committed.\"\n   <em>\n    Wasman v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339284\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/559/#p563\">\n    468 U.S. 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339284\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/559/#p563\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11339284\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/559/#p563\">\n    82 L.Ed.2d 424\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

In particular, \"the decision whether to grant probation is within the complete discretion of the trial court,\" and, in making that decision, district courts properly consider a defendant's \"character, personality[,] and attitude\" in conjunction with his or her \"prior record.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

We see no reason why, as part of this assessment, courts should be\n   prohibited from considering the underlying facts forming the basis of a defendant's prior person crime conviction, including whether the victim of that crime was injured.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Due Process Challenge to Reliability of Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 21 Having decided that a court may look beyond the elements of the prior offense in categorizing a prior conviction as a \"person crime with injury,\" we turn to the second procedural sub-issue: whether the court's determination was based on reliable evidence. The State argues that Robinson has waived this issue under the doctrine of invited error. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 22 Under the doctrine of invited error, \"where a party makes an affirmative representation encouraging the court to proceed without further consideration of an issue, an appellate court need not consider the party's objection to that action on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Bruun\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346009\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/905/\">\n    2017 UT App 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 59,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12346009\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/405/905/\">\n    405 P.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified). According to the State, Robinson repeatedly assured the district court that he did not contest the reliability of the police reports and photographs. In support of its position, the State points to the sentencing hearing where the court asked, \"[D]oes anybody contest what the photograph and the police reports say?\" Robinson responded, \"No.\" Soon after, the court again inquired, \"[D]oes everybody agree the police reports are what they are? This is what they say? The photographs of the police officer.\" In response, Robinson stated, \"That is correct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 23 The district court's inquiry went to the authenticity of the documents, not their reliability. Under rule 901(a) of the Utah Rules of Evidence, a \"proponent must produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item is what the proponent claims it is.\" Utah R. Evid. 901(a). In affirming that the documents \"are what they are\" or say \"what they say,\" Robinson waived any challenge to the authenticity of the documents, an evidentiary issue distinct from Robinson's challenge to the reliability of the evidence. Because Robinson never affirmatively represented that he had no objection to the court considering the documents for purposes of sentencing, he did not waive the issue asserted on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 24 But neither did Robinson preserve the issue. To preserve an issue for appeal, a party \"must specifically raise the issue in a timely fashion and must introduce supporting evidence and relevant legal authority.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although Robinson objected to looking beyond the elements of the offense in determining whether his prior assault conviction was a person crime with injury, he never argued that the police report and photographs from the prior offense were unreliable. Because the issue was unpreserved, Robinson must establish an exception to the preservation requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 25 Robinson argues that the court's reliance on this evidence amounted to plain error. To prevail under the plain-error exception to the preservation rule, Robinson must establish that: (1) \"an error exists\"; (2) \"the error should have been obvious to the district court\"; and (3) \"absent the error, there is a reasonable likelihood of a more favorable outcome.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

These two sub-issues are each subject to a different standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Legal Interpretation of \"Injury\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b6 31 We first consider whether the district court correctly interpreted the term \"injury,\" as used in the Sentencing Matrix, to include minor injury. Sentencing guidelines are commonly interpreted using traditional canons of statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Enrique-Ascencio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276603\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/857/668/#p672\">\n    857 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 672 (5th Cir. 2017) (\"Federal sentencing guidelines are analyzed according to the rules of statutory interpretation.\");\n   <em>\n    State v.

But as we have explained,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b618-19, the sentencing guidelines neither define the term, nor do they specify the type or severity of injuries contemplated by this category of offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Notably, the sentencing commission did not use a modifier to limit the prior person crime category to only those crimes involving \"serious\" or \"substantial\" injuries, as the legislature often does throughout the Utah Criminal Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-1-601\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 76-1-601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , -102, -103, 76-5-107, 76-6-102 (LexisNexis 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b6 33 In the absence of a specialized definition, we interpret \"injury\" according to its plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Hearon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408051\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/409/85/\">\n    2017 UT App 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12408051\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/409/85/\">\n    409 P.3d 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A starting point for a court's assessment of ordinary meaning is the dictionary.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 (quotation simplified). Black's Law Dictionary defines \"bodily injury\" as \"[p]hysical damage to a person's body.\"\n   <em>\n    Injury\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Similarly, the Utah Code's definition provides that \"bodily injury\" includes \"physical pain, illness, or any impairment of physical condition.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076-1-601\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76-1-601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Either definition is sufficiently broad to include a punch to the face resulting in pain and a small laceration. Therefore, the district court did not err in concluding that \"a minor injury ... is nonetheless an injury\" that qualifies for the four-point assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   B. Factual Finding that an Injury Occurred\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 34 Second, we review the district court's factual finding that Robinson's prior assault conviction involved injury. We defer to factual findings at sentencing unless they are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Rhodes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10377396\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/818/1048/#p1049\">\n    818 P.2d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1049-50 (Utah Ct. App. 1991). In finding that the victim of the prior assault was injured, the district court relied on the prior PSR as well as a police report and photographs of the victim's injuries. According to the police report, Robinson \"punched [the police officer] in the nose,\" resulting in \"a cut on the [left] side of [his] nose.\" This account was reiterated in the PSR and corroborated by a photograph depicting the victim with a small laceration and blood on the left side of his nose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 35 Although the police officer reported in his victim impact statement that he suffered no physical or emotional injury as a result of the incident, the district court, as the finder of fact, was entitled to resolve apparent conflicts in the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886170\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/344/644/\">\n    2015 UT App 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6886170\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/344/644/\">\n    344 P.3d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is the role of the factfinder to examine and resolve such conflicts.\"). This conflict alone does not render the court's finding clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b6 36 We conclude that the district court properly resolved the alleged inaccuracy in the PSR and did not abuse its discretion in assessing four criminal history points for Robinson's prior assault conviction. Accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    This category no longer appears in the Utah Sentencing Guidelines. \"The distinction between prior person crimes with or without injury has been replaced with a specific number for a specific type of offense by severity.\" Utah Sentencing Comm'n,\n    <em>\n     Adult Sentencing &amp; Release Guidelines\n    </em>\n    1 (2017), https://justice.utah.gov/Sentencing/Guidelines/Adult/2017% 20Adult% 20Sentencing% 20and% 20Release% 20Guidelines.pdf.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    We note that the United States Supreme Court has adopted a categorical approach to determining whether a prior offense triggers an enhanced sentence under federal recidivism statutes.

Therefore, the court's determination that Robinson's prior conviction involved injury had no impact on the statutorily prescribed sentence. We express no opinion on whether the categorical approach would apply if the classification of Robinson's prior conviction had subjected him to an increased penalty.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
