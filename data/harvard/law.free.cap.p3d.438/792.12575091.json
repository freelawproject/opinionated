The CWA's stated objective is \"to restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.\" The CWA set a goal of eliminating the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the United States by 1985. To make progress towards this goal, Congress established a permitting system known as the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES), which is administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 The CWA allows for states to administer their own permits, and in 1974 the State of Montana and EPA signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA), which transferred the responsibility of issuing NPDES permits within Montana to DEQ.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   DEQ issues permits under the Montana Pollution Discharge Elimination System (MPDES). EPA continues to review, comment on, and/or make recommendations to DEQ regarding proposed permits. Under the MOA, if EPA does not\n   object to a proposed permit, its non-objection \"shall be considered as concurrence\" in the issuing of the permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Because pollution into the nation's waters was not eliminated by 1985, the CWA has been amended in the years since. Following the enactment of the CWA, EPA discovered that a driver of pollution is discharges from municipal separate storm sewer systems (MS4s). The CWA was then amended by Congress in 1987 to add provisions addressing storm water discharges from certain municipalities-and set deadlines for permits regarding MS4s serving populations of 250,000 or more (large MS4s) and those serving populations of more than 100,000 but less than 250,000 (medium MS4s). The 1987 CWA amendments further required EPA, \"in consultation with State and local officials,\" to study and regulate additional storm water discharges as needed to protect water quality. This led to the eventual regulation of certain MS4 systems serving populations of less than 100,000 (small MS4s). MS4 discharge permits may be issued either as an individual permit to a single MS4 or as a general permit to a group of MS4s. Montana has no large or medium MS4s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 As part of its further regulation of storm water discharges, EPA issued its \"Phase I Rule\" in 1990, which addressed large and medium MS4s. Nine years later, in 1999, EPA issued its \"Phase II Rule\" which addressed small MS4s. While all MS4 discharge permits must include terms and conditions to \"reduce the discharge of pollutants\" from the MS4 to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), small MS4s were able to choose to either be regulated as if they were large or medium MS4s under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.26\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) or to include six minimum control measures (MCM) within their storm water management programs (SWMP).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The six MCMs constitute narrative effluent limitations requiring the implementation of best management practices (BMPs), which EPA determined to be \"generally the most appropriate form of effluent limitations\" regarding small MS4s.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The six MCMs are: (1) public\n   education and outreach on storm water impacts; (2) public involvement/participation; (3) illicit discharge detection and elimination; (4) construction site storm water runoff control; (5) post-construction storm water management in new development and\n   redevelopment; and (6) pollution prevention/good housekeeping for municipal operations. EPA further determined that implementation of BMPs consistent with provisions of the SWMP constituted compliance with the standard of reducing pollutants to the \"maximum extent practicable.\" EPA \"intentionally\" did not provide \"a precise definition of MEP to allow maximum flexibility in MS4 permitting.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 DEQ is responsible for administering the provisions of the Montana Water Quality Act (MWQA), one of which is the issuance of MPDES permits. In 2003, the Montana Board of Environmental Review (BER) first adopted rules for the small MS4 MPDES permit program to comply with the requirements of the CWA. In accordance with these rules, small MS4s in Montana include the cities of Billings, Missoula, Great Falls, Bozeman, Butte, Helena, and Kalispell (collectively MS4 cities), portions of Yellowstone, Missoula, and Cascade counties, as well as Malmstrom Air Force Base, Montana State University, and the University of Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 DEQ issued the first five-year MS4 general permit in 2005 and the second in 2010. In 2014, DEQ began working on the third MS4 general permit and convened meetings involving stakeholders, including the MS4 cities. The MS4 cities, as a result of these meetings, proposed that DEQ extend the 2010 general permit for a period of two years while the MS4 cities, DEQ, and other stakeholders formed a storm water working group to develop a new MS4 general permit. DEQ agreed to this arrangement, and issued an MS4 general permit effective from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Beginning in January 2015, the storm water working group convened monthly meetings. The storm water working group included the MS4 cities, DEQ, EPA, representatives from the three MS4 counties, Montana State University, Malmstrom Air Force Base, Waterkeeper, Montana Environmental Information Center (MEIC), and the Clark Fork Coalition. The storm water working group met monthly until April 2016 as DEQ developed the proposed 2017 general permit. On September 19, 2016, DEQ issued a public notice stating its intention to hold a public hearing on the issuance of the 2017 draft permit, and provided information on obtaining a copy of the draft permit, accompanying fact sheet and environmental assessment, and how the public could provide comments regarding the draft permit. DEQ received written public comments from EPA, Waterkeeper, Department of the Air Force, and the MS4 cities of Billings, Great Falls, Kalispell, Helena, Missoula, Butte-Silver Bow, and Bozeman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 DEQ held a public hearing on the draft permit on October 21, 2016. Testimony was presented by Waterkeeper, the city of Helena,\n   and the city of Bozeman at the hearing. Waterkeeper testified regarding the changes from the 2015 general permit to the draft permit, stating that the draft permit is \"a really good permit,\" while also noting some areas of the permit needed \"tweaks.\" In written comments, EPA stated that it reviewed the draft permit and provided comments that were \"minor in nature,\" and further \"commend[ed] the state on this Permit.\" EPA did not object to the issuance of the General Permit under its permit review authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b611 On November 30, 2016, DEQ issued the General Permit. EPA did not object to its issuance under its permit review authority, and the General Permit went into effect on January 1, 2017. On December 30, 2016, Waterkeeper sued DEQ in the District Court, alleging that the General Permit was deficient in several respects. The City of Billings, one of the MS4 cities regulated by the General Permit, intervened in the case. Waterkeeper then filed a motion for summary judgment, while DEQ and the City of Billings each filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court held a hearing on the motions on March 13, 2018, at which all parties agreed that no material facts were in dispute and the matter could be determined based upon the arguments of the parties and the administrative record. On June 14, 2018, the District Court denied Waterkeeper's motion, granted DEQ's and the City\n   of Billings' cross-motions, and affirmed DEQ's issuance of the General Permit. Waterkeeper appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de novo, and apply the same criteria applied by the district court under M.

Whether the General Permit complies with public participation requirements?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Waterkeeper, a public-benefit non-profit corporation dedicated to protecting the water quality of Montana's Upper Missouri River Basin, argues that the General Permit does not comply with mandatory public participation requirements pursuant to both federal and state law because the General Permit contains BMP and TMDL requirements that are chosen by individual MS4s under the General Permit after the General Permit has already been issued. The District Court found that the permit did not violate public participation requirements because the General Permit, and its included BMPs and TMDLs, were already subject to public review and comment. The District Court further noted that the General Permit contains language requiring additional public outreach, education, participation, and review. We agree with the District Court that the General Permit does not violate public participation requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 After two MS4 general permit iterations, DEQ began development on the third. Concerned and motivated by the desire to develop a quality, modern permit, the MS4 cities requested, received, and spearheaded a storm water working group to develop the third general permit. The previous general permit was then extended for a two-year period by DEQ while the storm water working group went to work. The General Permit was developed over a nearly two-year period with input from DEQ, Montana MS4s, environmental groups (including Waterkeeper), and the general public. At the public hearing on the permit prior to its issuance, Waterkeeper even testified to the General Permit being \"a really good permit.\" The District Court correctly noted that the General Permit had significant public participation during its development and before it was ultimately issued by DEQ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Waterkeeper now takes issue with the General Permit's inclusion of a menu of possible BMPs for individual MS4s to choose from when implementing their SWMP. Because the final BMPs are not chosen until after the issuance of the General Permit, Waterkeeper argues that when a BMP is ultimately chosen by an MS4, that constitutes a change that adds significant new conditions to the MS4 permit. This argument is unconvincing. The BMPs listed in the General Permit were developed with two years of input from numerous\n   stakeholders, including the general public. The MS4s regulated by the General Permit are essentially being tasked with choosing from an already-approved menu. Much like the experience of attending a wedding reception does not become a fundamentally different activity for a guest once he or she chooses between the given dinner options of chicken or fish, an\n   MS4 choosing which preapproved BMPs to implement in their SWMP does not alter the essential terms of the General Permit. The guest is still attending a wedding reception regardless of his or her dinner choice; and Montana's MS4s are still having their storm water discharges regulated pursuant to the existing terms of the General Permit regardless of which combination of already-specified BMPs are ultimately used. EPA's small MS4 regulations were developed to allow for flexibility in permitting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System--Regulations for Revision of the Water Pollution Control Program Addressing Storm Water Discharges,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20Fed.%20Reg.%2068%2C722\">\n    64 Fed. Reg. 68,722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,754 (Dec. 8, 1999). It is not unlawful, arbitrary, or capricious for DEQ to use this intentional flexibility when issuing MPDES permits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 Although this is a matter of first impression in Montana, Maryland's highest court recently faced a nearly identical situation of an MS4 choosing from a specified menu of BMPs in an NPDES general permit and a local water group objecting based on public participation requirements. In\n   <em>\n    Md. Dep't of the Env't v.

Local water groups sued alleging, among other things, that the permit violated public participation requirements because MS4 permittees would be choosing BMPs after the permit was issued.

The CAFOs at issue in the case were required to develop nutrient management plans, which the Second Circuit held were effluent limits because the CAFOs were required to set waste application rates in the plans.\n   <em>\n    Waterkeeper All.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1546929\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/399/486/\">\n    399 F.3d at 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Maryland Court found that \"the most critical element of the restoration plans-the BMPs-is already included in the Permits because the Permits incorporate the Manual and Guidance, which set forth those practices.\"\n   <em>\n    Md. Dep't of the Env't\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265703\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/447/88/\">\n    134 A.3d at 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Maryland Court upheld the permits because \"the Counties must submit restoration plans derived from\n   <strong>\n    specified\n   </strong>\n   best management practices[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Md.

The situation at issue with the General Permit in this case is nearly identical to that of\n   <em>\n    Md. Dep't of the Env't\n   </em>\n   , and we reach the same conclusion with respect to public participation requirements. The act of an MS4 choosing between specified BMPs in an MPDES general permit does not constitute a new effluent limit requiring further public participation before the permit can take effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621\n   <em>\n    2.

When the permit was issued, EPA regulations specifically stated that narrative effluent limitations were the most appropriate form of effluent limitations.

For the construction site storm water management MCM, the list of BMPs is nearly seven pages long. The post-construction site storm water management in new and redevelopment MCM contains a list of applicable BMPs nearly eight pages long. Under the EPA and DEQ regulations in place at the time, implementation of these BMPs \"constitute[s] compliance\" with the MEP standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b629 Waterkeeper specifically alleges that the post-construction storm water management requirements of the General Permit are\n   deficient in that they require that all MS4s implement post-construction storm water management \"controls that are designed to infiltrate, evapotranspire, and/or capture for reuse the post-construction runoff generated from the first 0.5 inches of rainfall from a 24-hour storm preceded by 48 hours of no measurable precipitation.\" This specific 0.5-inch performance standard is unchanged from the 2015 general permit, and DEQ notes that it represents the 90th percentile rainfall frequency event. Waterkeeper contends that this standard is arbitrary and capricious because the General Permit's rule requiring capture of only the 90th percentile is not fully supported by substantial evidence, and therefore does not meet the MEP standard. Waterkeeper notes that a general permit issued in eastern Washington requires 100% retention of post-construction storm water runoff and faults DEQ for not sufficiently explaining why this standard would not be practicable in Montana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b630 The record reflects that DEQ did explain its decision in setting the numerical standard at issue here. More importantly, however, the General Permit includes several new BMP requirements to allow MS4s to meet the MEP standard. The numerical requirement is only one portion of the MCM, and DEQ has adequately explained its reasoning for setting this standard. Because we defer to an agency's determination in areas of its expertise, it was not arbitrary and capricious for DEQ to use its chosen post-construction storm water runoff standard in the General Permit.\n   <em>\n    Somont Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. The numerical runoff control standard has not changed from the 2015\n   general permit; however, the narrative standards have improved in the General Permit. Pursuant to both federal and state regulations, and mindful of the deference afforded to DEQ, these narrative effluent limitations constitute compliance with the MEP standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b631 Waterkeeper also faults the General Permit's construction site storm water management MCM for incorporating the minimum standards from another permit-the Non-Numeric Technology-Based Effluent Limits in the most current Montana DEQ General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Construction Activity (Construction Storm Water Permit)-into the General Permit here. Waterkeeper alleges that this decision is unsupported because the MEP standard may require more stringent standards and controls than those found in the Construction Storm Water Permit. DEQ explained that this overlap was done to ensure regulatory consistency, because numerous construction sites are located within the boundaries of the MS4s regulated by the General Permit. The record supports that DEQ's decision to incorporate the standards of the Construction Storm Water Permit into this portion of the General Permit was not arbitrary and capricious. DEQ provided reasons for why the decision was made; the record supports the conclusion that these incorporated standards, when combined with other BMPs in the General Permit, meet the MEP standard for narrative effluent limits; and the General Permit improves on the ordinances required by the 2015 general permit. Once again, we defer to DEQ's decision because it considered relevant factors regarding this MCM and there has not been \"a clear error of judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    North Fork Pres.

The General Permit incorporates applicable TMDLs for certain MS4s's impaired waterways. Waterkeeper alleges that this TMDL WLA incorporation is a violation of the CWA because the General Permit neither establishes baseline levels of pollution nor requires measurable pollutant reductions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b634 When developing water quality-based effluent limits for a permit, DEQ is required to ensure that those effluent limits \"are consistent with the assumptions and requirements of any available wasteload allocation for the discharge prepared by the State and\n   approved by EPA pursuant to\n   40 CFR 130.7.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20122.44\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 122.44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(vii)(B).

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b635 On appeal, Waterkeeper argues that the District Court misunderstood its position, and it is simply arguing that DEQ abused its discretion by not including enforceable and measurable pollutant reduction requirements tied to applicable WLAs. The General Permit requires MS4s to apply BMPs which address impaired waterbodies, report their progress, show their upcoming plans, implement a monitoring program, and provide a mechanism for public review. DEQ's interpretation of its rule regarding TMDLs is not unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, or unsupported by substantial evidence because EPA first approved the TMDLs in a separate process and then reviewed and concurred in the issuance of the General Permit which contained those TMDLs.\n   <em>\n    Clark Fork Coal.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 20.
