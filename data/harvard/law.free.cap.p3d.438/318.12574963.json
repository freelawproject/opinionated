After investigation, he determined that O'Connell had failed to drive in a safe and prudent manner and had rear-ended another vehicle. In total, five vehicles were damaged in the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   During his investigation, Officer Kaleczyc learned O'Connell had missed a turn and was looking for an opportunity to turn around. O'Connell explained she was in the process of looping back around when the accident happened. Based on his review of O'Connell's phone log and text messages, Officer Kaleczyc determined that O'Connell was not using her cell phone while driving. O'Connell informed Officer Kaleczyc that she took prescription medication for Lupus, depression, and sleeping. Officer Kaleczyc reported that he observed no behaviors indicating O'Connell was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. On June 3, 2016, Officer Kaleczyc charged O'Connell with careless driving for failure to operate her truck in a safe and prudent manner in violation of \u00a7 61-8-302, MCA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 On June 9, 2016, O'Connell pleaded guilty to careless driving in violation of \u00a7 61-8-302, MCA, and Helena Municipal Court sentenced her with a $90 fine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 On October 9, 2016, after reviewing O'Connell's toxicology report, the Helena Attorney's Office (City) additionally charged O'Connell with driving under the influence (DUI). O'Connell pleaded not guilty and moved the Municipal Court to dismiss her DUI charge as a subsequent prosecution barred by \u00a7 46-11-504(1), MCA. On December 22, 2016, the Municipal Court denied O'Connell's motion to dismiss the DUI charge. Pursuant to a plea agreement, O'Connell pleaded guilty to negligent endangerment, preserved her right to appeal, and timely appealed the denial of her motion to dismiss to the District Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 On appeal, the parties stipulated to the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   On June 3, 2016, O'Connell caused a multiple-car accident at the intersection of Lyndale and Last Chance Gulch. O'Connell told the dispatched officer she didn't have a clear memory of how she caused the accident. She was cited for careless driving.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   When O'Connell reported she took medication for depression, difficulty sleeping, and Lupus, the citing officer asked for a blood\n   sample. O'Connell agreed to provide one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 9, 2016, O'Connell pleaded guilty to the careless driving charge. On August 22, 2016, the City received the toxicology report on O'Connell's blood sample, revealing the presence of four medications in O'Connell's blood. On October 9, 2016, the City cited O'Connell with DUI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   O'Connell filed a motion to dismiss the DUI charge on statutory and constitutional grounds. O'Connell's opening brief, the City's response, and O'Connell's reply were filed, but no hearing was held. On December 22, 2016, the Helena Municipal\n   Court issued an order denying O'Connell's motion to dismiss her DUI charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   O'Connell's counsel informed the City that O'Connell's driving was impaired by a sudden onset of dizziness. O'Connell acknowledged she chose to continue driving when she became impaired, resulting in the multiple-vehicle accident. The City offered O'Connell the opportunity to plead guilty to an amended charge, negligent endangerment. O'Connell accepted, pleaded guilty to negligent endangerment, and preserved her right to appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b67 O'Connell appealed to the District Court, which issued a June 1, 2017 order affirming the Municipal Court's denial of her motion.

O'Connell argues if a prosecution results in a conviction, \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, bars a subsequent prosecution based on\n   an offense arising out of the same transaction. O'Connell argues that her DUI charge arose from the same transaction, the accident, as her careless driving conviction. The City argues that \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, does not bar her subsequent DUI charge, because the DUI charge did not arise from the same transaction as the careless driving conviction. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-1-202(23), MCA :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Same transaction\" means conduct consisting of a series of acts or omissions that are motivated by:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a) a purpose to accomplish a criminal objective and that are necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of that objective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b611 Specifically, O'Connell argues her conduct fell within the meaning of \"same transaction\" because the conduct that led up to both the careless driving and DUI charge was the same conduct-continuing to drive after she became dizzy. O'Connell asserts that\n   <em>\n    State v.

Contrarily, the City argues that absolute liability offenses, including DUI, require no proof of mental state and do not carry a criminal objective. Therefore, absolute liability offenses cannot be part of a \"same transaction,\" even if they arose from the same incident. The City asserts\n   <em>\n    State ex. rel Booth v.

Based on the particular jurisdictional circumstances of a case, either \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA, or \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, provides a party with statutory protection against double jeopardy. Both statutes protect against subsequent prosecutions based on the same transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b613 Although the parties relied on \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, as the basis for their arguments in briefing, at oral argument both parties indicated that \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA, was the more applicable statute in this case. We agree. Section 46-11-503, MCA, provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   46-11-503 Prosecution based on same transaction barred by former prosecution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (1) When two or more offenses are known to the prosecutor, are supported by probable cause, and are consummated prior to the original charge and jurisdiction and venue of the offenses lie in a single court, a prosecution is barred if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (a) the former prosecution resulted in an acquittal. There is an acquittal whenever the prosecution results in a finding of not guilty by the trier of fact or in a determination that there is\n   insufficient evidence to warrant a conviction. A finding of guilty of a lesser included offense that is subsequently set aside is an acquittal of the greater offense that was charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (b) the former prosecution resulted in a conviction that has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (c) after a charge had been filed, the prosecution was terminated by a final order or judgment for the defendant that has not been set aside, reversed, or vacated; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (d) the former prosecution was terminated for reasons not amounting to an acquittal and takes place:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (i) in a jury trial, when the jury is impaneled and sworn; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (ii) in a nonjury trial, after the first witness is sworn but before a judgment as to guilt or innocence is reached.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (2) A prosecution based upon the same transaction as a former prosecution is not barred under subsection (1)(d) when:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (a) the defendant consents to the termination or waives the right to object to the termination; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (b) the trial court finds that the termination is necessary because:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (i) it is physically impossible to proceed with the trial in conformity with law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (ii) there is a legal defect in the proceedings that would make any judgment entered upon a verdict reversible as a matter of law;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (iii) prejudicial conduct makes it impossible to proceed with the trial without manifest injustice to either the defendant or the state;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (iv) the jury is unable to agree upon a verdict; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (v) false statements of a juror on voir dire prevent a fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b614 Section 46-11-503, MCA, applies where jurisdiction and venue of the offenses lie in a single court, whereas \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, bars a subsequent prosecution where the conduct constituting the offense is charged and resolved in any state or federal jurisdiction. Here, the jurisdiction and venue of O'Connell's offenses lie in a single court. Section 46-11-503, MCA, is therefore the more appropriate and specific statute to this case. O'Connell has consistently claimed that the City's subsequent prosecution for DUI violated her statutory protections against double jeopardy under Montana law. The City understood O'Connell's claim and responded to the merits of her argument accordingly. The District Court had full opportunity to address O'Connell's claims. Thus, the parties' failure to specifically refer to \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA, does not waive its consideration in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b615 Although the parties devote considerable argument to whether the DUI and careless driving charges arose out of the \"same transaction,\" that issue is not dispositive in this case. For purposes of this appeal, we assume the DUI and careless driving charges arose out of the same transaction. Section 46-11-503(1), MCA, requires this Court to preliminarily consider whether both offenses, careless driving and DUI, were supported by probable cause when the initial offense was resolved. O'Connell's careless driving charge was resolved when she pleaded guilty to the charge on June 9, 2016. If probable cause did not exist to charge the DUI offense by June 9, 2016, \u00a7 46-1-503, MCA, did not bar its subsequent prosecution, regardless of whether it arose out of the same transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b616 \"Probable cause\" is defined as \"[a] reasonable ground to suspect that a person has committed or is committing a crime.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    Probable cause\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (10th ed. 2009). Probable cause exists:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   if the facts and circumstances within an officer's personal knowledge, or related to the officer by a reliable source, are sufficient to warrant a reasonable person to believe that another person is committing or has committed an offense.\" The probable cause determination must be based on an assessment of all relevant circumstances, evaluated in light of the knowledge of a trained law enforcement officer. Mere suspicion is not enough to establish probable cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    City of Missoula v.

O'Connell agreed she caused a multiple-vehicle accident. She told Officer Kaleczyc her memory was unclear as to how she caused the accident. Upon investigation, Officer Kaleczyc determined that an accident occurred and that he had reasonable grounds to believe O'Connell caused the accident. He reasonably concluded that O'Connell failed to operate her truck in a safe and prudent manner and issued her a citation for careless driving in violation of \u00a7 61-8-302, MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \u00b618 O'Connell advised Officer Kaleczyc she was prescribed medication for Lupus, depression, and difficulty sleeping. Officer Kaleczyc reported he observed no behaviors indicating O'Connell was under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Therefore, Officer Kaleczyc had no more than an unconfirmed suspicion that O'Connell potentially was under the\n   influence of medication. Accordingly, he requested that O'Connell provide a blood sample.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b619 On August 22, 2016, the City received the toxicology report on O'Connell's blood sample, revealing the presence of four medications in O'Connell's blood at the time of the accident. After examination of the toxicology report, the City established probable cause to charge O'Connell with DUI. Probable cause did not yet exist for the City to charge O'Connell with DUI on June 9, 2016, the day O'Connell's initial offense, careless driving, was resolved through her guilty plea and imposition of sentence. Therefore, \u00a7 46-11-503, MCA, did not bar the subsequent DUI charge from prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b620 Although the District Court's determination upholding the Municipal Court's denial of O'Connell's motion to dismiss was not based on lack of probable cause to charge the DUI offense, we \"will affirm the district court when it reaches the right result, even if it reaches the right result for the wrong reason.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
