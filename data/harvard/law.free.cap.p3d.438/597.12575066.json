Feenix sought coverage under the insurance policy's coverage for collapse due to decay, claiming the collapse was caused by a gradual decline in strength, soundness. Berkley denied coverage for the loss. The trial court granted summary judgment to Berkley on the coverage issue. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Feenix Parkside LLC (Feenix) owns a single story commercial building in Auburn, Washington. The building was built approximately 40 years ago, around 1979. On or about July 4, 2015, a portion of the building's roof truss system failed, and that portion of the roof collapsed. At that time, Feenix was insured by a Continental Western Insurance Company policy issued by Berkley North Pacific (Berkley). Feenix submitted a claim to Berkley. Berkley retained Independent Adjuster Rob Stone from McLarens Young and Engineer Mark Schaefer with Pacific Engineering Technologies Inc. (PET) to investigate the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Stone and Schaefer initially inspected the building on July 8, 2015. Schaefer again inspected the building on July 13, 21, and 27, 2015. Based on his inspections and research, Schaefer performed a structural analysis of the roof truss system. In his opinion, the roof trusses failed when the top chord members fractured as a result of applied tension perpendicular to the wood grain immediately adjacent to the rear exterior bearing wall. He determined that the roof trusses failed because of two concurrent factors: (1) the configuration of the truss plate connection adjacent to the rear exterior bearing wall had inadequate strength to resist the applied loads, and (2) higher than normal temperatures reduced the strength of the wood trusses by up to 30 percent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In a letter dated August 19, 2015, Berkley denied Feenix's claim because the loss was caused by \"defective methods in construction and excessive temperatures in the attic,\" which are not covered causes of loss under the policy's collapse coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Feenix retained CT Engineering Inc. to conduct an independent investigation of the loss shortly after receiving Berkley's denial. CT Engineering concluded,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [W]ater penetrated thru [sic] the upper layer of roofing and collected between the two layers providing a concealed, encapsulated water delivery system. The water between the roofing layers sought the drain location although [sic] became trapped. As the water volume increased, so did the pressure on the old roofing layer which we believe, slowly allowed the water to penetrate into the interior of the building near the roof drains. The water wicked through the blocking and delivered moisture to the truss bearing ends. In support of this, water staining is clearly visible in both the blocking and truss bearing ends [on] each side of the roof drains.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 CT Engineering also wrote, \"It is our opinion that the cause of the truss collapse is due to the combined effects of both an elevated temperature in the attic space due to solar radiation gain (125 -150 degrees) as well as a moisture content exceeding 19% for an extended period of time.\" Based on CT Engineering's findings, Feenix requested that Berkley reconsider its denial of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 As a result of Feenix's letter, Berkley reopened its investigation and instructed PET to determine whether \" 'hidden decay' \" contributed to the roof collapse. On July 13, 2016, PET revisited the building site and inspected portions of the original roof sheathing and roof trusses still onsite. Schaefer did not alter his opinions on the cause of the collapse, and noted the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 Visual examination of the failure surfaces in the top chord members of trusses in place shortly after the collapse showed no evidence of wood decay in the failure surface.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 Examination of the failure surfaces in the top chord members truss pieces stored on site in 2016 showed no evidence of wood decay in the failure surface.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Examination of the failure surfaces in the top chord members truss pieces stored at the MDE [Inc.] in 2016 showed no evidence of wood decay in the failure surface. The darkened wood along the shafts of nails that were exposed in the failure plane appears to be iron staining, which is a common phenomenon in wood where elevated moisture is present at some point. Iron staining does not reduce the strength of the affected wood.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b68 Following PET's supplemental report, Berkley confirmed its denial of Feenix's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 On September 23, 2016, Feenix sued Berkley. Berkley and Feenix filed cross motions for summary judgment on the issue of coverage for the building roof collapse. On August 4, 2017, the trial court granted Berkley's motion for summary judgment and denied Feenix's motion. On September 18, 2017, the trial court entered an amended order on the parties' cross motions, which reflected all submissions and materials considered by the trial court at the summary judgment hearing. The amended order did not alter or modify the legal conclusions and findings of fact in the trial court's August 4, 2017 orders. Feenix appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 Feenix makes two arguments. First, it argues that the trial court erred in finding the term \"decay\" unambiguous in Berkley's insurance policy. Second, it argues that the trial court erred by construing the term \"system\" against Feenix and in favor of Berkley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b611 An order granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo, \"with the reviewing court performing the same inquiry as the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Ski Acres.

It did not. The policy here is nearly identical to the policy in\n   <em>\n    Easthampton\n   </em>\n   . The policy references \" 'Fungus', Wet Rot, Dry Rot, And Bacteria\" when it initially excludes them from covered causes of loss or damage in section B.1.h. And the policy again mentions fungus, wet rot, dry rot, and bacteria under section E, which provides \"Additional Coverage - Limited Coverage,\" for those losses. The only reasonable implication is that the plain and ordinary meaning of \"decay,\" as used in the policy, is not limited to organic rot. Rather, it encompasses \"decay\" in a broader sense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b627 Berkley also contends that Feenix's definition of \"decay\" is substantially similar to \"deterioration,\" a term that the policy specifically references as an exclusion. It argues that \"deteriorate\" means \" 'to grow worse; degenerate; to weaken or disintegrate; decay.' \" And, because the policy contains a specific reference to \"deterioration,\" \"decay\" necessarily means something other than to grow worse over time, i.e., gradually lose strength, soundness, prosperity or degree in excellence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b628 The policy provides an exclusion for deterioration at COL Form section B.2.d(2): \"We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following: ... Rust or other corrosion, decay, deterioration, hidden or latent defect or any quality in property that causes it to damage or destroy itself.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b629 Though the policy uses both terms, a distinction between decay and deterioration is not so apparent as Berkley would argue.

But he doesn't point to specific areas of decay that led to the collapse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   As [Berkley's counsel] discussed further this morning, there are several spots throughout, the sleeper, the end of one of the trusses, a couple of spots where decay was noted, but Mr. McCann actually testified that there was no decay in the trusses. And that is -- this is at his deposition page 56 lines 3 to 12, and that the wood's exposure to water and heat over time was not the same as decay. It wasn't synonymous with decay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   \u00b632 Feenix's expert testified in his deposition, \"The sleeper obviously sits on the trusses, and it's in a decayed state, and I'm saying that it had a factor in the decay -- or the collapse of the trusses.\" He continued, \"[W]hat I am saying is that I did not find any decay in the truss members themselves.\" And, when asked if \"moisture content of wood exceeding 19 percent\" was the \"equivalent of wood decay,\" McCann answered, \"No.\" The record indicates the sleeper had wet rot and the trusses did not. In the context of his testimony, McCann was using \"decay\" to indicate \"wet rot.\" Using that definition, the trial court could have correctly concluded there was no evidence of decay in the trusses. But, that is not the proper definition of \"decay.\" That conclusion was not appropriate under the correct definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   \u00b633 The trial court also found that the phrase \"hidden from view\" would be rendered meaningless unless decay requires \"some kind of material decomposition that is visible rather than more general just weakening of the material over time that doesn't have any visual component to it.\" But, the phrase \"decay that is hidden from view\" must be interpreted in context of the entire sentence which concludes \"unless the presence of such decay is known to an insured prior to collapse.\" Decay that is not hidden from view is not covered. Decay that is hidden from view is not covered if known to an insured prior to collapse. Coverage turns on what the insured could have known by viewing the property or what the insured did know. Presumably known risks could be addressed prior to collapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   \u00b634 The trial court erred in concluding that the \"only reasonable interpretation\" of \"decay\" is one that indicates some kind of decomposition of the material, and rejecting Feenix's definition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Issue of Fact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   \u00b635 Feenix asserts that it raised a material issue of fact as to whether decay, under the broader definition it advanced, caused the collapse. Feenix's expert opined,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   [T]he cause of the truss collapse is due to the combined effects of both an elevated temperature in the attic space due to solar radiation gain (125-150 degrees) as well as a moisture content exceeding 19% for an extended period of time. The net effect of these conditions cause a reduction in the allowable stresses of the truss top chord by sixty percent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b636 Thus, Feenix presented evidence of weather conditions-moisture and extreme\n   heat-that caused damage that led to the roof collapse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b637 The COL Form section B.3 provides,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   We will not pay for loss or damage caused by or resulting from any of the following, 3.a. through 3.c.

As a result, the exclusion of weather conditions is not applicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   \u00b638 The expert evidence Feenix offered demonstrates the existence of genuine issues of material fact concerning the cause of the collapse.
