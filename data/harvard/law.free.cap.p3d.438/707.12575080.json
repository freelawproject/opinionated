The trial court imposed concurrent prison terms, the longest of which was 3.25 years. On appeal, Duarte challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his burglary and aggravated assault convictions, arguing that under A.R.S. \u00a7 13-1204(A)(4) a \"sleeping victim's capacity to resist is not substantially impaired.\" He also contends the court erred in precluding a victim's prior conviction for impeachment purposes.

Duarte and J.C. had been in an on-again, off-again relationship for several years and had three children, M.D., A.D.J., and A.D. One afternoon in May 2016, Duarte called J.C. several times, threatening to go to J.C.'s house to \"[b]reak [her] stuff\" and \"hurt [her].\" J.C. told him not to come over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 That evening, J.C., her friend V.M., A.D.J., and A.D. went to the mall and got dinner. After returning home, J.C. and A.D.J. went to sleep in J.C.'s bed, A.D. slept in her room, and V.M. fell asleep on the couch in the living room. Later that night, Duarte entered J.C.'s house through the unlocked back door. He went into J.C.'s room and began hitting her. Duarte demanded to \"look through [her] phone,\" grabbed it, and refused J.C.'s requests to return it. He then went outside and threw it on the sidewalk, shattering it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 A grand jury indicted Duarte for one count of second-degree burglary, aggravated assault on an incapacitated victim (J.C.), and three counts of disorderly conduct (V.M., A.D.J., and A.D.). He was convicted as charged and sentenced as described above. We have jurisdiction over Duarte's appeal pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 12-120.21(A)(1), 13-4031, and 13-4033(A)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Duarte argues his burglary and aggravated assault convictions \"must be reversed because there was insufficient evidence that [J.C.] was incapacitated within the meaning of the statute defining aggravated assault.\" We review de novo the sufficiency of the evidence and issues of statutory interpretation.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Four days before trial in this case, Duarte filed a notice of his intent to use J.C.'s prior conviction for impeachment under Rule 609. He attached a copy of J.C.'s signed plea agreement and sentencing minute entry. The day before trial, Duarte also filed a motion in limine to cross-examine J.C. about \"her prior involvement in hindering a prosecution,\" citing Rule 608(b) and arguing that her conviction was probative of her truthfulness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b622 The trial court heard argument on the issue just before J.C. testified at trial. The state asserted that J.C.'s \"very old conviction\" did not \"bear on [her] propensity for testimonial untruthfulness\" because the elements of hindering prosecution do not require an untruthful act. It therefore reasoned that the prior conviction was not appropriate impeachment evidence. In reply, Duarte stated that a defense investigator had obtained police reports from the incident and that J.C.'s prior conviction \"was because of her false statements to law enforcement specifically.\" He therefore maintained the conviction was \"very probative\" because J.C.'s testimony \"drives this entire case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b623 The trial court precluded evidence of J.C.'s prior conviction. With regard to Rule 609, the court noted, \"[T]here are an untold number of ways that a person can attempt to hinder prosecution, which goes from lying to police all the way to not informing police, and not informing police is not lying to police.\" Thus, based on \"[what was] presented to it through the plea agreement,\" the court concluded that J.C. was not necessarily convicted of \"a crime of dishonesty.\" The court further explained the conviction was more than ten years old, Duarte did not give the state reasonable written notice that he intended to use the conviction, and \"there [were] no specific facts or circumstances from which [it] could find that the probative value substantially outweigh[ed the] prejudicial effect.\" Similarly, with regard to Rule 608, the court reasoned that it did not \"have anything in front of [it] from which [it] could actually conclude that this\" prior conviction \"goes to truthfulness or untruthfulness of the witness.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    Rule 609\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b624 On appeal, Duarte contends J.C.'s prior conviction was admissible under Rule 609(a)(2) because it involved \"an element of untruthfulness.\" Alternatively, he argues the conviction was admissible under Rule 609(a)(2) because \"the factual basis clearly established that the offense involved lying to police officers while they were conducting an investigation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b625 When attacking a witness's character for truthfulness, evidence of a prior criminal conviction \"must be admitted if the court can readily determine that establishing the elements of the crime required proving-or the witness's admitting-a dishonest act or false statement.\" Ariz.
