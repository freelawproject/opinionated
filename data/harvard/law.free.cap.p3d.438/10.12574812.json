In this case, we must determine what the consequences are, under this statute, if prospective adoptive parents file an adoption petition in the wrong district. The biological father (Father) of the child in question (Child) contends that the statute speaks to a court's subject-matter jurisdiction, and asserts that a petition filed in the wrong district must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The prospective adoptive parents (Petitioners), on the other hand, contend that the statute speaks simply to venue, and assert that when a petition is filed in the wrong district, the court has jurisdiction to continue to adjudicate the case, but must transfer the case upon request to the proper district. For the reasons set forth herein, we find Petitioners' position persuasive, and therefore affirm the district court's decision to deny Father's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b62 In early 2014, Father engaged in a brief romantic relationship with a woman (Mother) who became pregnant and gave birth to Child in November 2014. After the relationship ended, Father asserts that he had no\n   further communication or interaction with Mother, and therefore claims to have been unaware of Mother's pregnancy or of Child's existence until after Child was born, and unaware that he was Child's father until December 2017. It is undisputed that Father has never had any relationship with Child, who is now four years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In the meantime, in the spring of 2017 Mother decided to place Child for adoption, and began working with an adoption agency toward that end. The adoption agency selected Petitioners as a potential adoptive family, and Petitioners filed a petition for adoption in April 2017. Despite the fact that Petitioners reside in Utah County, part of Utah's Fourth Judicial District, they filed their petition in Tooele County, part of Utah's Third Judicial District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Immediately after filing their petition, Petitioners asked the court to authorize a \"commissioner\" to take Mother's relinquishment, in accordance with Utah Code section 78B-6-124(1)(b). The court approved Petitioner's request, and signed an order appointing a representative of the adoption agency to take Mother's relinquishment. After the order was signed, Mother met with the representative and signed a document relinquishing her parental rights to Child. One of that document's provisions stated that Mother's relinquishment was irrevocable \"as to [Petitioners],\" but that Mother was \"not ... consenting to the adoption of [Child] by any other person or persons.\" In addition, the document provided that, \"[i]f [Petitioners] are unable to complete the adoption of [Child] for any reason, and the adoption petition is dismissed or denied, it is in [Child's] best interest that he be returned to [Mother's] custody and control.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Soon after Mother signed the relinquishment, Petitioners filed a copy of it with the court, and a few days later the court signed an order awarding temporary custody of Child to Petitioners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Just a few months later, before the adoption was finalized, Mother filed a motion to set aside her relinquishment, asserting that she did not sign the document freely and voluntarily. The district court, after a half-day evidentiary hearing, determined that Mother had acted voluntarily and was not under duress or undue influence, and denied Mother's motion. The court's decision to deny Mother's motion is not at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 About a month later, in early January 2018, Father entered an appearance in the adoption case and filed a motion seeking leave to intervene, asking that the adoption proceedings be dismissed. A few weeks later, Father filed a second motion, raising for the first time his argument-advanced here in this appeal-that the district court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over the case because Petitioners filed their petition in the wrong district.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 After full briefing and oral argument, the district court denied Father's motion to dismiss, and determined that it did have subject-matter jurisdiction over the case. Father then asked for permission to appeal the district court's interlocutory order regarding jurisdiction, and we granted that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The issue presented in this case is one of statutory interpretation: whether Utah Code section 78B-6-105(1)(a) acts as a limit on a district court's subject-matter jurisdiction, or is merely a venue statute. \"We review questions of statutory interpretation for correctness, affording no deference to the district court's legal conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

All parties agree that this language demands that adoption proceedings be initiated by the filing of a petition.

Petitioners, on the other hand, point out that any Utah district court has subject-matter jurisdiction over adoption cases as a class, and read the statute as a venue provision that does not implicate a court's jurisdiction, but merely allows any party to request that the petition be transferred to the proper district. To resolve this dispute, we start by examining the concept of subject-matter jurisdiction, and then return to a further examination of the text of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 \"The notion of 'jurisdiction' is a slippery one.\"\n   <em>\n    In re adoption of B.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20UT%2059\">\n    2017 UT 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 125,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567132\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/417/1/\">\n    417 P.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, unless the adoption is one that must be filed in juvenile court pursuant to Utah Code section 78A-6-103(1)(o),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-6-105(1)(c), any district court has subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate an adoption case, even one filed in the wrong district, but must transfer the case to the correct district upon the filing of a proper request.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10322420\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p2d/926/892/#p898\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-3-308 (stating that, when a case is filed in the wrong venue, a party may file \"a written motion requesting the trial be moved to the proper county\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 The provision in Utah's adoption code that requires that an adoption case be \"commenced\" by the filing of a petition in a particular judicial district is a provision that\n   speaks to venue, and not to subject-matter jurisdiction. Petitioners did indeed file their petition in the wrong venue, but this did not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction, because any district court in Utah has subject-matter jurisdiction over any adoption case that does not have to be filed in juvenile court. The consequence for filing in the wrong district is not automatic dismissal; it is that any party, upon proper motion, may request that the case be transferred to the correct district. Unless and until such a request is made, however, the court in which the case is filed may continue to adjudicate the case, and its rulings are not void. For all of these reasons, we affirm the district court's decision to deny Father's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, and we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    This provision of the relinquishment explains why the parties are litigating about whether Utah Code section 78B-6-105(1)(a) speaks to subject-matter jurisdiction or to venue: if the statute is jurisdictional, Petitioners' petition should be dismissed, and in that event Father intends to assert that Child should be returned to Mother's custody and control.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Father emphasizes the statute's use of the word \"shall,\" which is usually interpreted as a mandatory command,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2068-3-12\">\n     Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 68-3-12\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1)(j) (LexisNexis 2016) (defining \"shall\" as meaning \"that an action is required or mandatory\"), and argues that adoption petitioners are commanded to file their adoption petition in the proper district. This argument is correct, as far as it goes, but the legislature's use of the word \"shall,\" in this context, fails to answer the question at the center of this dispute because it tells us nothing about what the intended consequences are for filing the petition in the wrong place. Indeed, this case nicely illustrates one reason why some legal scholars have noted that the word \"shall\" is \"a semantic mess\": because \"a recurrent issue in the huge constellation of\n    <em>\n     shall-must\n    </em>\n    holdings\" concerns \"the effect of failing to honor a mandatory provision's terms,\" which presents \"an issue for a treatise on remedies, not interpretation.\" Antonin Scalia &amp; Bryan A. Garner,\n    <em>\n     Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts\n    </em>\n    113, 115 (2012).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Father points out that subsection (1)(c) of the statute appears to be jurisdictional, in that it places some adoption cases within the exclusive jurisdiction of the juvenile court, and infers therefrom that the other subsections must therefore also be jurisdictional. Father is arguably correct that subsection (1)(c) speaks to a juvenile court's subject-matter jurisdiction-that provision states that adoption proceedings \"shall be commenced by filing a petition\" in \"juvenile court as provided in Subsection 78A-6-103(1).\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-6-105(1)(c) (LexisNexis Supp. 2018). The referenced section of the Juvenile Court Act states that \"the juvenile court has exclusive original jurisdiction\" over \"adoptions\" in cases where \"the juvenile court has previously entered an order terminating the rights of a parent and finds that adoption is in the best interest of the child.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2068-3-12\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78A-6-103(1)(o) (Supp. 2018). This language does appear to encompass express limits on the authority of courts other than juvenile courts to hear a particular sub-class of adoption cases. However, it does not follow that, just because subsection (c) is jurisdictional, subsections (a) and (b) must also be jurisdictional. On this issue, the title of the statute provides helpful guidance, instructing us that the statute concerns itself with \"[d]istrict court venue\" but with \"[j]urisdiction of juvenile court.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2068-3-12\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 78B-6-105 ;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 19. As we read the statute, the legislature has placed most adoption cases within the broad subject-matter jurisdiction of district courts, but has placed one sub-class of adoption cases within the narrower subject-matter jurisdiction of juvenile courts. Within the first (broader) category, we do not perceive the legislature as having set any jurisdictional limits on the ability of any particular judicial district or individual district court to hear any of the cases that fall within their purview.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    Furthermore, unlike some other comparable state statutes,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%201-22-109\">\n     Wyo.

The Salt Lake County district court granted the motion, and transferred the petition to Davis County.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Had there been a jurisdictional defect of the kind Father envisions, transfer would not have been possible-indeed, the only action a court without jurisdiction can take is to dismiss the case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Hollenbach v.

No party took issue with the Salt Lake County district court's decision to transfer (rather than dismiss) the case, and we did not reach the propriety of that transfer on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Father also argues that construing the relevant statute as a venue statute rather than as a jurisdictional statute would have \"constitutional implications,\" because he points out that fathers are required to \"strictly\" comply with other provisions of Utah's adoption code, and argues that \"it would be unconstitutional to impose a 'strict compliance' standard for biological fathers but a more relaxed standard for adoptive parents.\" Our conclusion herein regarding the meaning of the relevant statute-and, specifically, regarding the intended consequences of filing a petition in the wrong district-has nothing to do with requiring \"strict\" or \"relaxed\" compliance with the statutory mandates. Our conclusion is simply that the legislature intended the statute to function as a venue statute, and therefore a court does not lack subject-matter jurisdiction over an adoption petition filed in the wrong district any more than it would lack subject-matter jurisdiction over a divorce case or a tort case filed in the wrong county. We see no constitutional infirmities with the legislature's creation of a venue statute in this context, and therefore reject Father's constitutional arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
