On appeal, we reverse Crow's conviction of possession of a stolen firearm because his trial counsel ineffectively failed to object to inadmissible profile testimony and the testimony prejudiced Crow's defense. Based on state Supreme Court precedent, we also remand for resentencing because the State failed to present sufficient proof of crimes included in Crow's offender score calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b62 We take our facts from testimony during a jury trial. We start with a stolen gun. On October 22, 2014, Joseph Carnevali returned to his pickup truck parked in downtown Seattle and discovered his Ruger 9mm LC9 handgun, he stored in the pickup console, to be missing. Carnevali reported the stolen firearm and identified the firearm's serial number to the Seattle Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b63 We move from Seattle to Yakima. On June 13, 2015, Officer Chris Taylor of the Yakima Police Department patrolled the streets of Yakima in a marked police car. Officer Taylor saw Bryan Crow exit a vehicle parked at a residence. Taylor recognized Crow from earlier contacts and from Crow's horn tattoos on his head. Officer Taylor knew Crow had a warrant for his arrest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b64 Officer Chris Taylor approached Bryan Crow and, from a comfortable distance, called Crow's name. Crow turned and looked at Officer Taylor and then ran. Taylor yelled: \"stop, you're under arrest.\" Report of Proceedings (RP) at 173.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b65 Officer Chris Taylor, while eight to ten feet from Bryan Crow, fired a Taser at Crow. The Taser caused Crow to stumble, but otherwise did not disable Crow. Crow reached into his waistband with his right hand and retrieved a handgun. Crow flung the weapon and continued to run from Officer Taylor. Officer Taylor threw his Taser to the ground and drew his service firearm. Crow jumped a fence and continued running, after which Taylor ended his chase. Taylor took possession of the handgun Crow discarded. Taylor knew then that prior convictions rendered Crow ineligible from owning firearms. Officer Taylor radioed for assistance, and other Yakima Police Department officers later seized Crow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b66 Officer Chris Taylor transported Bryan Crow to the county jail. Officer Taylor entered the serial number from the gun, a Ruger 9mm handgun, into the gun registry index. The check revealed that the gun had been stolen in Seattle on October 23, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   PROCEDURE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b67 The State of Washington charged Bryan Crow with first degree unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm. At trial, Crow stipulated to an earlier conviction that precluded him from possessing a firearm. During trial, Crow argued that he lacked knowledge that the Ruger firearm was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b68 During trial, the prosecution introduced police testimony outlining patterns regarding felons and stolen firearms and the difficulty of a felon gaining possession of a firearm. Bryan Crow's trial counsel did not object to any of this questioning. The police testimony and the lack of evidentiary objections presents the focus of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b69 The State questioned Officer Chris Taylor regarding the method by which and the location at which a person can legally purchase a firearm. When asked if someone could lawfully sell, gift, or transfer a gun to Crow, Officer Taylor answered: \"No.\" RP at 195.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b610 On cross-examination, Crow's attorney asked questions of Taylor regarding how someone would know if a gun is stolen or not:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: You testified about the firearm that was recovered. The serial numbers, and I understand from your testimony, the serial numbers weren't ground off?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   TAYLOR: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [Defense Counsel]: How is-how is someone supposed to know if a gun is stolen or not?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   TAYLOR: There's two ways. Obviously, the direct knowledge would be if they stole it, but a lot of times the way that I found people that know the firearm was stolen that they buy it illegally. If they buy it on the street from somebody who's not a legitimate gun salesman, buy it for a cheap price, most of the people that I come into contact with stolen firearms will say they bought it from somebody for fifty bucks, a hundred bucks. They assume that it's stolen based on the fact that it's not a legitimate gun sale and they're buying it so cheap.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   RP at 198-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 On redirect examination, the State inquired about the methods by which prohibited persons obtain firearms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   TAYLOR: From my training and experience, they [those prohibited from possessing firearms] either will steal them or they will buy them from somebody that is selling them illegally on the street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [The State]: Okay and how are those illegally obtained firearms, where do they typically come from in your training and experience?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   TAYLOR: Burglaries, vehicle prowls, things like that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [The State]: In your training and experience, do fleeing suspects often attempt to discard stolen property when they're being pursued?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   TAYLOR: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [The State]: Why is that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   TAYLOR: Because nobody wants to be caught with stuff that they know they shouldn't have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [The State]: In your training and experience, what actions are indicative of somebody knowing something is stolen property?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   TAYLOR: Typically they're going to try to distance themselves as much as possible from it. They'll tell you stuff like I have no idea about it, I don't know anything about it, I don't know who I got it from or they'll give you very vague answers. I got it from Bob, over there, around this time. There's no specifics that you're able-what they try to do is make it so there's no specifics that you can follow up with to confirm whether they knew or not knew or did not know that it was stolen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [The State]: So, discarding and flight are pretty common?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   TAYLOR: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [The State]: ... Okay. In your training and experience, what percentage of people apprehended are prohibited people with firearms are those guns stolen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   TAYLOR: Pretty high percentage. I would-I couldn't guess a number, but I would say the majority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [The State]: Okay. And-and in the case where those firearms are not reported, is there a reason that sometimes they're not reported as stolen or not in the system?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   TAYLOR: A lot of times we come across firearms that are unregistered. Maybe they don't have an owner attached to it because they've been sold or transferred prior to Initiative 594 so there's not a record or the person who had the burglary with the firearms stolen doesn't have their serial numbers, so they're not able to list it. So, we're not able to confirm that the firearm is in fact stolen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   RP at 201-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b612 During trial, Yakima Officer Booker Ward testified regarding the ways a person could illegally obtain a firearm. The testimony is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [The State]: Okay. In your training and experience, how do prohibited persons get firearms?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   WARD: Usually through burglaries, vehicle prowls, some way of that nature.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [The State]: Okay, what percentage are stolen in your training and experience that turn up in prohibited person[']s hands?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   WARD: I would say a high percentage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [The State]: Okay, based on Mr. Crow's status of being convicted of a serious offense at the time of the arrest, were there any lawful means at that time for Bryan Crow to receive a firearm or possess a firearm?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   WARD: Any, no he shouldn't have been able to. Not with the background checks and that kind of stuff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [The State]: Okay, was there any lawful means which another person could give a prohibited person, such as Mr. Crow, a firearm?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   WARD: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [The State]: No?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   WARD: I don't believe so. You'd have to-once again, do the background checks and that kind of stuff and transfers and ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   RP at 219-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b613 During trial, the prosecution asked similar questions to Detective Gonzalo Deloza:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [The State]: In your training and experience, what percentage of firearms possessed by prohibited persons are stolen?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   DELOZA: It's hard-it's hard to say because a lot of the guns that are reported, not every has the serial numbers on them, but a lot of people-most of the people that I know that are prohibited from having firearms obviously they're not allowed to have them so they had to get them\n   somewhere else and most of them are stolen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   RP at 239-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b614 The trial court presented the jury two jury instructions that centered on the possession of a stolen firearm charge:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   INSTRUCTION NO. 15\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   To convict the defendant of the crime of possessing a stolen firearm, each of the following elements of the crime must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (1) That on or about June 13, 2015, the defendant possessed, or carried, or was in control of stolen firearm; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (2)\n   <em>\n    That the defendant acted with knowledge that the firearm had been stolen;\n   </em>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   (3) That the defendant withheld or appropriated the firearm to the use of someone other than the true owner or person entitled thereto; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (4) That any of these acts occurred in the State of Washington.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   If you find from the evidence that each of these elements has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   On the other hand, if, after weighing all the evidence, you have a reasonable doubt as to any one of these elements, then it will be your duty to return a verdict of not guilty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Clerk's Papers (CP) at 169 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   INSTRUCTION NO. 9\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   A person knows or acts knowingly or with knowledge with respect to a fact, circumstance, or result when he or she is aware of that fact, circumstance, or result. It is not necessary that the person know that the fact, circumstance, or result is defined by law as being unlawful or an element of a crime.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   If a person has information that would lead a reasonable person in the same situation to believe that a fact exists, the jury is permitted but not required to find that he or she acted with knowledge of that fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   When acting knowingly as to a particular fact is required to establish an element of a crime, the element is also established if a person acts intentionally as to that fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   CP at 163.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b615 During closing statement, the State's counsel remarked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   What's our common sense tell us? The gun is stolen. What's the evidence show us? The testimony of all the officers, there's no way for him to lawfully get a gun. There's flight, there's discarding the evidence. Common practice of what I think Detective Gonzalez, Gonzo Deloza, excuse me,\n   <em>\n    they always try to get rid of it\n   </em>\n   thinking that then they have exonerated themselves essentially if they don't have it on their person. But, that's not the case of the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   RP at 303 (emphasis added). During closing, defense counsel commented:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Now, more importantly or just as important, but more issues in it is possession of a stolen firearm. No evidence was presented that the defendant knew, had actual knowledge, that this was stolen. The State even concedes that it has no actual knowledge of this. That's why they had to use reasonable inferences to overcome or sugar coat the fact that they have no knowledge element in their case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Now, the knowledge that he knew is Instruction No. 13 states that dispose of a stolen firearm knowing that it had been stolen. There has been no evidence whatsoever that Mr. Crow knew that this gun was stolen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   This is a case where there is a stolen firearm and there is no knowledge by the defendant and the State is trying to bootstrap another offense onto it. This is a case where they have no evidence whatsoever of knowledge and they have no evidence whatsoever that my client specifically knew, specifically knew. We're talking about did Mr. Crow [know] that this firearm was stolen. That's the standard right there. All this other inference and everything else is not an issue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   RP at 305-06. In rebuttal, the prosecution argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   [Defense counsel] doesn't talk about or dispute whether or not he had actual possession of a firearm. He didn't do that. But, it's clear that he had possession. All the testimony and evidence shows that he had actual possession of a firearm.\n   <em>\n    It would be an impossible burden to have to prove actual knowledge.\n   </em>\n   What tool could we use that could get inside of somebody's head to find out what they actually know? Remember, it's proof beyond any doubt, well how could you ever prove what's inside somebody's head? I can't prove what's in your head right now at all, no more than what you could prove in mine. You may be thinking if I could go home as quickly as possible. I don't know. But, it would be an impossible burden. That's why the instructions are very clear.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   We heard the testimony. These guns are stolen. That's how\n   <em>\n    these guys are getting them.\n   </em>\n   Okay. They're stolen on the streets. They're stolen in burglaries, they're stolen in car prowls. What did we hear from Mr. Carnevali? Stolen in a car prowl. They're traded around. That's the common sense you've got to bring to the analysis of this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   RP at 308-10 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b616 During deliberations, the jurors sent the trial court a note:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   We believe a reasonable person would assume the firearm is stolen. Are we allowed to say the [d]efendant would believe the same and would that count as knowledge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   CP at 173. In response, the trial court referred the jury to the previously given jury instructions. The jury convicted Bryan Crow of unlawful possession of a firearm and possession of a stolen firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b617 At Bryan Crow's sentencing, the State did not provide any document of record to show that Crow had been convicted of three prior adult felonies and one prior juvenile felony. At sentencing, in response to the trial judge's inquiry, the prosecution stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [THE STATE]: Yes, Judge, I've laid out the criminal history. Mr. Crow is current on community custody or was at the time, I believe he still is if he would be in custody for assault three. Assault two, which was a case I had where he got a deadly weapon enhancement. He assaulted a kid on a bike with a knife. That was a case I have that he was on community custody for at the time he was caught with the firearm in this case, the stolen firearm. He has been convicted of bail jumping and another unlawful possession of a firearm as a juvenile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   RP at 337.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b618 When sentencing Bryan Crow, the court commented:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court also takes into consideration his prior criminal history, which in this Court's opinion is rather significant. We have a charge as a juvenile of unlawful possession of a firearm in the second degree, that having been committed on May 14, 2010.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   We have three felony convictions since adulthood. October 8, 2012, he was-he was engaged in felony bail jumping, in essence failed to show up for Court at a time when he had been ordered to. He acquired a strike offense, assault in the second degree with a deadly weapon for a crime allegedly or for a crime actually committed on August 10, 2013 and then just about three months later was charged with assault in the third degree, actually he wasn't charged, he committed the crime of assault in the third degree, which is a felony charge and those are significant because it shows a history of criminal violence and it shows a history of use of firearms or deadly weapons and at a time when he's not to be in possession of those.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   RP at 340-41. Bryan Crow did not object to the State's recitation of his criminal history or to the sentencing court's comments about the history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   \u00b619 The trial court calculated Bryan Crow's offender score as four and imposed a seventy-seven-month prison sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   LAW AND ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   \u00b620 Bryan Crow appeals his conviction of possession of a stolen firearm and his sentence. He does not appeal his conviction for\n   unlawful possession of a firearm. His argument to overturn his one conviction surrounds law enforcement officers' testimony concerning the probability that a firearm possessed by a convicted felon is a stolen gun. Crow's trial counsel never objected to the testimony. On appeal, Crow contends that the testimony constituted improper profile testimony and thereby violated his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. He further contends that his trial counsel engaged in ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the officers' testimony. Because we agree that counsel engaged in ineffective assistance of counsel, we do not address Crow's contention that admission of the evidence was manifest constitutional error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \u00b621 Bryan Crow's assignments of error demand that we first assess the admissibility of the law enforcement officers' testimony. Assuming inadmissibility, we must also determine if Crow waived the inadmissibility by questioning one officer on the same subject matter. We begin by asking whether the State presented objectionable testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Issue 1: Whether the State, when prosecuting a felon charged with possession of a stolen firearm, may admit evidence about the inability of a felon to lawfully obtain a gun, evidence of the high probability that any gun possessed by the felon is stolen, and an officer's opinion that one possessing a stolen firearm flees and discards the firearm when approached by a law enforcement officer?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Answer 1: Yes, as to testimony that the felon may not obtain a gun lawfully. No, as to other testimony.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \u00b622 To obtain a conviction for possession of a stolen firearm, the State must prove that Bryan Crow knew the gun was stolen.

With profile evidence, the State attempts in part to convict the accused on evidence beyond the individual circumstances of the case and on one or more traits the accused possesses in common with others who purportedly commit the same crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \u00b624 No evidence rule expressly addresses the admissibility or inadmissibility of profile testimony. As a result, one federal circuit directs trial courts to focus the inquiry not on defining and classifying evidence into categories of profile or nonprofile, but to examine the bounds of applicable rules of evidence.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nevertheless, profile testimony implicates at least four rules. First, profile testimony may lack any relevance and thus breach ER 402. Second, such evidence, though relevant, may unduly prejudice the accused or confuse the jury and thus violate ER 403. Third, the evidence may constitute impermissible character evidence under ER 404(a) because the profile emphasizes a trait of the accused. Fourth, law enforcement officers typically present profile evidence to bolster a conclusion about the defendant when listing characteristics that, in the opinion of law enforcement officers, are typical of a person engaged in a specific illegal activity.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Robinson,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%201554\">\n    978 F.2d 1554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1563 (10th Cir. 1992).

The appeals court reversed the conviction because of introduction of profile evidence. Martinez claimed he did not know the car to be stolen. Nevertheless, when officers stopped Martinez, he drove a Toyota 4-Runner on Interstate 10 in southern California on the road to Guatemala. The car had a different license plate than the plate before the car's theft. Over Martinez's objection, the trial court allowed two California Highway Patrol officers to testify. One officer declared that the Toyota 4-Runner fit the profile of the type of vehicles stolen from southern California and driven to Central America. The almost exclusive route used by those persons moving vehicles to Central America was Interstate 10 through El Paso, Texas and down through Mexico. The officer also stated that more than half of the investigations he has been involved in have been \"cold-plated,\" which means the license plates on the stolen vehicle do not reflect a stolen vehicle. Another officer testified that the bulk of stolen vehicles went to Guatemala and El Salvador. He added that Toyota 4-by-4 pickups, Toyota 4-Runners, Nissan pickups, Nissan Pathfinders, and Isuzus are targeted for thefts because they can be hot-wired and the vehicles are ideal for the terrain in Central America. Over half the people that he personally interviewed had a false certificate of title with the same number, 1468770, found on the certificate of title carried by Martinez. The court wrote that every defendant has a right to be tried based on the evidence against him or her, not on the techniques utilized by law enforcement officers in investigating criminal activity.

Cifuentes claimed to have purchased the vehicle from an unknown man in Los Angeles. Over objection, the prosecution offered as an expert a Los Angeles police detective, John Toland, who testified of car theft rings in Los Angeles organized along ethnic lines, including Guatemalan ethnicity. The Guatemalan ring, he testified, tended to steal Japanese four-wheel drive vehicles, to use forged registrations, and to travel in small groups approaching the Mexican border. Because Cifuentes was Guatemalan and his possession of the Isuzu matched the profile developed by Toland, the jury, according to the reviewing court, was invited to infer that defendant knew his Isuzu was stolen because he was part of a Guatemalan car theft ring. The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   \u00b637 To analyze whether the State's evidence against Bryan Crow constituted impermissible profile testimony, we list and categorize the comments uttered by Yakima police officers during trial. Some comments overlap in substance with other comments. In referring to a felon disqualified to own or possess a firearm, the State labels such person a \"prohibited person.\" We refer to such person, including Bryan Crow, as a \"disqualified person.\" Presumably Crow contends the State tried to convict him by conjoining him into a class of disqualified persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \u00b638 The evidentiary categories are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   1. No one could lawfully sell, gift, or transfer a gun to Bryan Crow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   2. Bryan Crow could not have lawfully obtained a firearm because a background check would have established Crow to be disallowed to possess a gun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   3. A disqualified person will obtain a firearm by stealing it or buying it unlawfully on the street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   4. Illegally obtained firearms are typically stolen during burglaries and vehicle prowls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   5. A person who knows he possesses a stolen firearm commonly discards the gun and flees when approached by a law enforcement officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   6. The majority of disqualified people apprehended with a firearm have a stolen firearm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   7. Most or a high percentage of firearms in the hands of a disqualified person are stolen firearms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   \u00b639 We hold that the statements in categories one and two do not constitute inadmissible evidence. One might argue that the State attempted to lump Bryan Crow into a category of people unable to legally possess a gun. Nevertheless, the statement focuses on Bryan Crow, not people like Bryan Crow. The comment is a straightforward statement that Bryan Crow could not legally purchase a gun. Crow essentially admitted this legal fact when he stipulated to a felony that disqualified him from ownership or possession of a gun. Comments in category two merely reiterated the contents of category one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b640 We hold the remaining categories of Yakima police officer testimony to be inadmissible. The testimony sought to convict Bryan Crow of a crime based on what others do. Category three told jurors that most, if not all, disqualified persons obtain a firearm by stealing the gun or buying it unlawfully on the street. This testimony informs the jury that, because Crow falls into the profile of a disqualified person, he likely stole the gun or purchased it unlawfully on the street such that he should have known the gun was stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b641 Category four states the obvious that illegally obtained firearms are typically stolen during burglaries and vehicle prowls. We suppose the only other way to steal a gun would be to grab a gun in the outdoors. The evidence probably has no relevance to charges against Bryan Crow and any relevance would be unduly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b642 Categories five, six, and seven also attempt to convict Bryan Crow based on characteristics of him in common with others. The State needed to prove that Crow knew the Ruger handgun to be stolen. The State presented testimony that, when accosted, Crow fled and threw his gun to the ground. The State linked this behavior of Crow with the testimony that a person who knows he possesses a stolen firearm commonly discards the gun and flees when approached by a law enforcement officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   \u00b643 The State presented testimony that, when Officer Chris Taylor told Bryan Crow that the latter was under arrest, Crow possessed a gun. The State then linked this evidence with expert police officer testimony that the majority of disqualified persons apprehended with a firearm have a stolen firearm. The State also linked the behavior of Crow with expert opinion that most or a high percentage of firearms in the hands of a disqualified person are stolen firearms. In short, the State, in part, sought to convict Bryan Crow by comparing him to other guilty people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b644 The Yakima Police Department officers answered questions in the context of their knowledge based on \"training and experience.\" Thus, the State used the imprimatur of expertise and law enforcement to group Bryan Crow with other guilty persons.\n   <em>\n    State v.

In a\n   prosecution for possession of cocaine with intent to deliver, a law enforcement officer testified about characteristics or behavior of a typical drug dealer. He declared that a drug dealer usually receives money from users, often carries substantial sums of money and narcotics on his or her person, often keeps drugs in his or her mouth, and often abuses drugs. On appeal, Ignacio Avendano-Lopez asserted that the introduction of this testimony required reversal because its prejudicial effect outweighed any probative value. This court refused to characterize the officer's testimony as \"criminal profile\" testimony. According to this court, the officer's testimony did not identify any group as being more likely to commit drug offenses. Rather, the evidence explained the arcane world of drug dealing and drug transactions and assisted the trier of fact in understanding the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   \u00b647 We question the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Avendano-Lopez\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   The law enforcement officer's testimony implied that someone who receives money from a user and who holds large sums of cash also sold and delivered drugs. The State presented the officer's testimony because some of the officer's testimony fit evidence presented as to Avendano-Lopez's behavior during the time of the charged crime. The State should not be free to present profile testimony in the guise of background evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    Issue 2: Whether Bryan Crow \"opened the door\" for admission of profile evidence?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Answer 2: Yes, as to a disqualified person obtaining a firearm by stealing the gun or buying the gun illegally.

Obviously, the direct knowledge would be if they stole it, but a lot of times the way that I found people that know the firearm was stolen that they buy it illegally. If they buy it on the street from somebody who's not a legitimate gun salesman, buy it for a cheap price, most of the people that I come into contact with stolen firearms will say they bought it from somebody for fifty bucks, a hundred bucks.

Trial counsel could have more effectively argued the lack of knowledge without the State's profile testimony, particularly since Crow closely fit the profile. Allowing the State to present testimony of why Crow should know of the gun being stolen does not illustrate for the jury the lack of evidence to prove knowledge.

Weighing the probative value of the evidence versus its prejudicial effect is always going to be a case-specific factual determination. There is no basis for imposing an appellate ban on all \"profile\" evidence, particularly where there was no challenge in the trial court and, hence, no balancing undertaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   \u00b691 The majority's interpretation of the evidence as \"profile\" is unduly strained. No evidence was presented that Mr. Crow was a member of a group that probably or always possesses stolen guns, nor was proof of such a necessary feature of the State's cases. The evidence presented simply did not constitute a \"profile.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   \u00b692 Here, the State had to prove that Mr. Crow \"knew\" the gun he carried was stolen, and had to do so in a circumstantial manner. Even after eliminating the possibility that Mr. Crow could lawfully own or possess the weapon, it still needed to contest his claim that he lawfully bought the weapon on the street. Hence, the characteristics of the stolen gun market were necessarily probative evidence. Evidence concerning the nature of these back-alley transactions was significantly probative. If there had been a challenge, the trial court easily could have, and probably would have, admitted the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \u00b693 Moreover, the evidence was not unduly prejudicial to Mr. Crow. The jury already knew that he was a convicted felon who could not lawfully possess guns and that there was no lawful way for him to acquire them. Evidence that he unlawfully possessed the stolen gun in question was properly before the jury, as was the fact that the gun had been stolen in Seattle. The alleged profile evidence did little to additionally, and unduly, prejudice Mr. Crow in light of the prejudicial evidence already before the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   \u00b694 The majority's analysis would better fit the profile category if Mr. Crow had been charged with theft of the gun. In that circumstance, inferring theft from the fact of possession would be a clearer example of a profiling. But here, instead, it was the knowledge element of the possession of a stolen firearm statute that was at issue, not the identity of the thief. Explaining to jurors how those weapons typically were acquired, in the absence of lawful means, was probative evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   \u00b695 If an objection had been made at trial, it likely would have been overruled. Since Mr. Crow does not get to try his case in this court, his waiver in the trial court should preclude our review of it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   \u00b696\n   <em>\n    Ineffective Assistance.\n   </em>\n   To avoid these problems of waiver and the fact that this was not profile evidence, the majority contends that trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting. Given that he had no reason to know of, let alone rely on, the foreign authorities that the majority considers, it simply cannot be said that counsel was ineffective. Moreover, counsel made good use of the evidence in closing argument. There was neither prejudice nor error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   \u00b697 Of course, Mr. Crow needs to establish both. Courts must evaluate counsel's performance using a two-prong test that requires determination whether or not (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   counsel's performance failed to meet a standard of reasonableness and (2) actual prejudice resulted from counsel's failures.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

He had no true defense to the charge-and the State had an entirely circumstantial case on the knowledge element-so it only made sense to highlight the weakness of the State's case to attack the prosecutor's contention that Crow knew the weapon was stolen.
