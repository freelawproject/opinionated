After their biological father relinquished his parental rights, Victim and her two older siblings (Sister and Brother) were adopted by Roberts's mother (Mother).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Roberts would frequently visit the house where Mother and Victim lived and would \"cuddle\" with Victim and Sister and read them books at bedtime. Often, Roberts would \"fall asleep with them in the bed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Once, when Victim was about seven years old and Roberts was in his mid-twenties, Roberts lay in Victim's bed and touched her vagina \"skin-to-skin.\" He \"cuddled up against [her] ... with his body pressed against [her] back\" and then \"put his hand down [her] underwear.\" Roberts \"patted\" Victim's vagina \"a few times\" and then \"just rested [his hand] there\" before resuming patting. This pattern continued for about thirty minutes. Eventually, Victim \"got out of bed and went in the bathroom\" because she \"did not like what was happening.\" Thinking that Roberts had fallen asleep, Victim crawled back into her bed. Again, Roberts \"cuddled up against [her] and put his hand down [her] pants.\" He did not say anything to Victim, or try to kiss or digitally penetrate her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 Because she \"still loved and cared about\" Roberts and was \"happy living at\" Mother's house, Victim \"decided [she] was never going to tell anyone\" what had happened that night. Then, nearly ten years later, she disclosed the touching to Brother and his fianc\u00e9e (Fianc\u00e9e). Victim had moved out of Mother's house and was living with her father, who testified that, prior to the move, Victim \"was struggling\" and had received treatment for \"self-harming behaviors.\" While Victim was visiting Mother's house one day, she and Brother started drinking alcohol mixed with an energy drink. Brother and Fianc\u00e9e mentioned to Victim that they planned on \"getting a place\" with Roberts. This made Victim fear that Roberts would abuse Fianc\u00e9e. Victim then became \"very drunk,\" and Brother and Fianc\u00e9e took her to the mall to \"walk it off.\" While there, Victim became \"hysterical,\" \"[fell] over in the parking lot,\" and repeated \"over and over\" that Roberts had raped her. Once she calmed down, Victim explained to Brother and Fianc\u00e9e that Roberts \"used to come lay in bed with her and touch her at night,\" but she did not offer any more details.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 After this disclosure and a report made by Brother, police interviewed Roberts. Roberts admitted that he would sleep in Victim and Sister's bunkbed and \"cuddle with them,\" but he denied ever touching Victim inappropriately. The police investigator asked whether on the night in question he could have touched Victim's vagina \"accidentally,\" and Roberts responded, \"Possibly,\" but denied that it would have been for sexual gratification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 At trial, the defense called Mother, who testified that Roberts and Victim had a \"[l]oving, caring\" relationship. She also testified that, although Roberts would cuddle\n   with Victim and Sister, their room was not far from hers and their doors were \"[a]lways open.\" On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Mother whether she was ever interviewed by the Division of Child and Family Services (DCFS) \"about [her] being emotionally abusive to\" Victim. After Mother testified that she was aware of an accusation of emotional abuse but was not interviewed by DCFS, defense counsel objected to the line of questioning on relevance grounds. The trial court sustained the objection, and the prosecutor moved on to another topic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 Later, during closing argument, the prosecutor twice stated that Roberts's penis was \"pressed up against\" Victim's buttocks as he lay with her. The second time, after the prosecutor said that Roberts was \"spooning with his front pushed against [Victim's] back with his penis around her buttocks,\" defense counsel objected. The trial court sustained the objection and explained to the jury that there was no evidence in the record of the \"relative positions\" of Roberts and Victim. The prosecutor then told the jury that it could use its \"common sense understanding\" to infer the relative positions of Roberts and Victim as they lay in the bed. Defense counsel did not renew the objection or ask the court to take any further action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 The defense's strategy at trial was to focus on Roberts's lack of sexual intent rather than attack the credibility of Victim, who had testified emotionally about the abuse. Roberts, who testified at trial, admitted that he cuddled with Victim and Sister and that he told police that he may have touched Victim's vagina accidentally, but he denied touching her with any sexual intent. In his closing argument, defense counsel stated that he did not think Victim was lying, and that the jury could believe both Victim and Roberts and still find Roberts not guilty. Counsel emphasized the isolated nature of the incident and argued that, because he did not have \"the specific intent to arouse or gratify somebody's sexual desire,\" Roberts was not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 At the close of evidence, the State asked the trial court \"to expand [by one year] the time frame that was originally pled\" in the information. Without hearing \"much of an opposition\" to such an amendment, the trial court granted the request. After being given instructions, including an instruction that counsel's \"statements and arguments are not evidence,\" the jury retired to deliberate. When it returned, the jury convicted Roberts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child. Roberts appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 Roberts raises several issues on appeal that can be separated into three categories. First, Roberts contends that the prosecutor made improper statements during closing argument that warranted a mistrial or a limiting instruction. Defense counsel did not request these remedies at trial, and Roberts asks us to review this unpreserved issue under the doctrines of plain error and ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Prosecutor's Comments During Closing Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b613 Roberts first contends that the trial court \"committed plain error by failing to sua sponte order a mistrial or by failing to give a limiting instruction to the jury\" after the prosecutor twice remarked in closing that Roberts's penis was \"pressed up against\" Victim's buttocks. Alternatively, he contends that his defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective \"by failing to move for a mistrial or request[ ] a specific\" limiting instruction in response to those comments. We conclude, however, that a mistrial was not required here and that, even assuming a limiting instruction was required, the court adequately instructed the jury. We also conclude that Roberts's defense counsel was not ineffective in not requesting a mistrial or a limiting instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A.

The Utah Supreme Court has suggested that any duty to sua sponte declare a mistrial would arise only if the underlying error \"render[ed] the trial a farce and a mockery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8866379\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/14/403/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 153 n.2 (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Here, the prosecutor made two statements during closing argument describing Roberts's penis as being \"pressed up against\" Victim's buttocks. Although Victim did not testify to these specific facts, the jury heard evidence that Roberts had \"cuddled up\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   [Victim]\" and was lying behind her in her bed with his body \"\n   <em>\n    pressed against\n   </em>\n   the back of [her body]\" and \"\n   <em>\n    pressed up against\n   </em>\n   [her]\" when he wrapped his arm around her and touched her vagina. (Emphases added.) Given the wide discretion afforded attorneys in closing argument and the reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the evidence about Roberts pressing against Victim, the prosecutor's statements were not so egregiously unreasonable that we can fault the trial court for not intervening and sua sponte declaring a mistrial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hummel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339531\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/393/314/\">\n    2017 UT 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 110,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12339531\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/393/314/\">\n    393 P.3d 314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Dennis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8866379\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah-2d/14/403/\">\n    385 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   153 &amp; n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b617 Roberts alternatively suggests that the trial court plainly erred by not providing a limiting instruction in response to the prosecutor's closing argument. But after defense counsel objected to the prosecutor's statements, the court sustained his objection and gave some instruction to the jury. The court explained to the jury that the objection to counsel's argument was sustained because \"no evidence regarding the size of the child versus the size of the adult was ever ... proffered.\" Accordingly, the jury was specifically told there was no direct evidence on this point. The court also twice instructed the jury that counsel's statements, including closing argument, \"are not evidence\" and that it must rely on the evidence regardless of any conflict with counsel's statements. And on appeal, Roberts does not articulate why the court's instructions, taken as a whole, were inadequate. In light of the instructions that the trial court gave, and without some description of what more the court should have done, we are not persuaded that the court plainly erred in how it instructed the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 Having concluded that the trial court did not plainly err, we address Roberts's alternative contention that defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective when he \"failed to request a remedy, either moving for a mistrial or requesting a curative instruction\" in response to the prosecutor's statements. Although Roberts requests a rule 23B remand on this claim, it \"is not necessary to remand\" when the existing record \"demonstrate[s] that counsel's performance was not deficient.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20UT%2018\">\n    2015 UT 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 42,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575917\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/1166/\">\n    441 P.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b619 Proving deficient performance is a \"heavy burden.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Again, defense counsel did object, and the trial court sustained the objection and gave some correction to the jury, pointing out that there was no direct evidence of Roberts's and Victim's relative body positions. When the prosecutor then argued that his statements were a reasonable inference from the evidence, defense counsel may have been satisfied with the result because it highlighted the lack of direct evidence that Roberts's penis was pressed against Victim's buttocks.

Although defense counsel ultimately succeeded in terminating this line of questioning on relevance grounds, the jury heard Mother testify that she did not recall that her sister had accused her of emotionally abusing Victim and she denied that DCFS interviewed her about the allegation.

Decision Not to Challenge Victim's Credibility\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b628 Second, Roberts contends that defense counsel may have been ineffective for not challenging Victim's credibility at trial and seeks a remand to \"be able to determine whether or not counsel had some strategy in abandoning the credibility issue.\" Specifically, Roberts raises the following related arguments:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \u2022 Defense counsel should have obtained Victim's medical records;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \u2022 Defense counsel should have investigated whether Victim suffered from reactive attachment disorder (RAD);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \u2022 Defense counsel should have called Sister as a witness to undermine Victim's account of sexual abuse;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \u2022 Defense counsel should have challenged Victim's credibility through the testimony of Brother and Fianc\u00e9e; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   \u2022 Defense counsel should not have vouched for Victim in his closing argument by saying that he did not believe Victim was lying.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   To support his arguments, Roberts includes an affidavit from a private investigator detailing that Sister never saw or experienced any inappropriate behavior herself and that Brother and Fianc\u00e9e stated to the investigator that Victim is untruthful.

The record reflects that, at least at one point, defense counsel considered the strategy Roberts advocates on appeal. For example, he intended to have Mother testify to Victim's character for truthfulness and introduce evidence that Victim received counseling and therapy for self-harming behavior. In addition, Mother informed defense counsel of her belief that Victim suffered from RAD. At trial, however, defense counsel abandoned this strategy. After Victim's apparently emotional testimony, during which Victim stated that she still loved Roberts and that it was \"hard\" for her to testify at trial, it was not unreasonable for defense counsel to decide that he did not want to attack Victim's credibility and appear unsympathetic to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b631 We also note that this strategy was particularly reasonable here. Roberts testified at trial and had already admitted to police officers that he would often \"cuddle\" with Victim and would fall asleep in her bed. And although not a confession, he conceded it was possible that the touching Victim described could have happened \"accidentally.\" With these facts, defense counsel could reasonably decide to focus on Roberts's intent, without challenging the details of Victim's story or appearing to attack a vulnerable witness. Some may question whether this was the best strategy. But \"the question of deficient performance is not whether some strategy other than the one that counsel employed looks superior given the actual results of trial. It is whether a reasonable, competent lawyer could have chosen the strategy that was employed in the real-time context of trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
