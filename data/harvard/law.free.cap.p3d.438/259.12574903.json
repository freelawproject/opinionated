(\"Father\") appeals the juvenile court's order terminating his parental rights to M.T., his daughter, on the grounds of abuse of a child and fifteen months' out-of-home placement. The issue before us is whether the court erred in denying Father's motion that urged dismissal of the termination proceeding based on the doctrine of res judicata, which we refer to as claim preclusion. Because Father did not meet his burden of establishing the elements of claim preclusion, the court did not err when it denied his motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Father and Hannah B. (\"Mother\"), who were never married, are the biological parents of M.T., born in 2013. In 2015, the Arizona Department of Child Safety (\"DCS\") received a report that Mother's home was unsafe for M.T. Mother agreed to allow M.T. to stay in Father's care until further notice. When Father was indicted on charges arising from his alleged sexual misconduct with several victims (each under the age of 15) between 2005 and 2007, DCS placed M.T. with a family member. DCS then filed a dependency petition alleging Father was neglecting M.T. due to his incarceration, which the juvenile court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In January 2017, DCS moved to terminate Mother's and Father's parental rights pursuant to Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 8-533. Regarding Father, DCS alleged M.T. had been in an out-of-home placement for more than fifteen months, Father had not remedied the circumstance causing the out-of-home placement, and due to the severity of his pending criminal charges, it was unlikely he could properly parent in the near future. A.R.S. \u00a7 8-533(B)(8)(c). Following a termination hearing in May 2017, the juvenile court terminated Mother's parental rights but found DCS did not meet its burden of proof as to Father.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court explained that (1) Father\n   appeared to have a strong relationship with M.T. at the time he was incarcerated; (2) he had access to limited services and visits while incarcerated; and (3) it did not appear Father's criminal charges would be resolved until trial, which was scheduled to occur in October 2017. Although the court denied DCS's motion, it did not dismiss the underlying dependency; instead, the court set a permanency planning hearing for Father in December 2017, seemingly anticipating a conclusion in Father's criminal trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 At Father's request, however, the October trial date was later vacated and rescheduled for February 2018. Shortly thereafter, DCS filed a petition to terminate Father's parental rights, alleging fifteen months' out-of-home placement and abuse of a child under \u00a7 8-533(B)(2). Father moved to dismiss, arguing both grounds were barred by claim preclusion, which the juvenile court denied. At the subsequent termination hearing, the court heard expert testimony on the abuse allegations as well as testimony from DCS caseworkers regarding Father's ability to resume parenting if found not guilty of his pending criminal charges. During closing arguments, Father again argued claim preclusion applied to both grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 After the hearing, but before the juvenile court issued its ruling, Father's criminal charges were dismissed without prejudice based on the unavailability of a witness. Father requested a new trial to re-open the defense portion of the termination hearing, asserting in part (1) the fifteen-month ground \"must be dismissed\" because he would be able to \"resume effective parenting\" in the near future and (2) the dismissal cast doubt on whether sufficient evidence proved he \"willfully abused or failed to protect a child.\" The court denied Father's motion but allowed Father to supplement the record with evidence of the dismissal and gave all parties the opportunity to submit supplemental closing arguments. The court's subsequent ruling found that DCS had proven, by clear and convincing evidence, both statutory grounds for termination and, by a preponderance of the evidence, that termination was in M.T.'s best interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Addressing the abuse ground, the juvenile court concluded the \"[e]vidence presented establishes that over a period of time ... Father engaged in acts of sexual conduct and sexual assault with a minor.\" Supporting this conclusion was one victim's forensic interview, which the court found especially credible \"after considering ... the [expert] testimony regarding the medical evidence of [this victim's] scarring and trauma.\" As for the fifteen-month ground, the court found that at the time of the second hearing (1) M.T. had been in an out-of-home placement for more than 30 months; (2) Father was incapable of providing for M.T. due to incarceration; and (3) despite Father's charges being dismissed, Father would not be capable of exercising proper and effective parental control in the near future because he would need \"to obtain a psychosexual evaluation and possible treatment.\" Father timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 Father argues the juvenile court erred by denying his motion to dismiss because DCS's second request for termination was \"barred by operation of the doctrine of [claim preclusion].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review the applicability of this doctrine de novo.\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

An order denying a petition to terminate parental rights seldom leads directly to the termination of wardship or of agency involvement. It is one thing to say that such an order bars a second termination proceeding when there has been\n   <em>\n    no change\n   </em>\n   in the operative facts which led to the initiation of the first proceeding; it is very different-and clearly wrong-to contend that, if new substantial material facts come into existence which justify the filing of a new termination proceeding, evidence and facts which were or could have been considered in the earlier proceeding cannot be considered or reconsidered in the later one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 904-05 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Juvenile Appeal (83-DE)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=460%20A.2d%201277\">\n    460 A.2d at 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that claim preclusion affords little protection against subsequent hearings because the court looks at the conditions at the time of termination and \"[a]n adjudication that a ground for termination did not exist at one time does not mean such ground has not arisen at a later time\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Here, Father's criminal trial was scheduled for October 2017, but it was continued until February 2018 and expected to last approximately one month.
