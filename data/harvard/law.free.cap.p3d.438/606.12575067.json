Larry and Carla Seaquist allege that Caldier defamed Seaquist and placed him in a false light through political campaign materials and in an interview. Caldier moved for summary judgment dismissing the Seaquists' claims. The Seaquists appeal the trial court's order granting Caldier's motion for summary judgment dismissal of both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Although some of Caldier's statements were unquestionably misleading and ignoble, the Seaquists have not established a prima facie case of defamation or false light by evidence of convincing clarity. Therefore, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. FACTUAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2014, Caldier challenged Seaquist for his 26th District State Representative position. On August 29, 2014, after attending a political candidate endorsement interview at the\n   <em>\n    Kitsap Sun\n   </em>\n   office in Bremerton, both candidates exited the building and went to their respective vehicles. Seaquist's vehicle was parked directly behind Caldier's along the street. While both candidates were sitting in their cars, but before either drove off, Seaquist took two identical photos of the back of Caldier's car. Seaquist later stated that he was impressed with the mechanics of the car's convertible roof and that he took the photograph to assist him in remembering the car's make and model.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 The photos show the back of a white Lexus IS250 C convertible with the top down. The photos are a wide angle shot, with the street on the left, sidewalk and parking lot on the right, and the bottom of the frame shows the dashboard of the vehicle from which the photos were taken. On close inspection, a portion of Caldier's face can be seen through the rearview mirror of the Lexus. Caldier's red sunglasses cover most of the portion of her face that can be seen in the mirror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 Caldier noticed what Seaquist was doing, exited her car, and asked Seaquist if he had taken photos. Seaquist responded in the affirmative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Four days later, on September 2, Caldier posted on Facebook saying, \"I came out of a candidate interview and saw Rep. Larry Seaquest [sic], my opponent, taking pictures of me as I got into my car. Wow. ... I felt like I was being stalked!\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 708. Individuals commented on Caldier's post saying things like, \"That's kinda creepy,\" \"Wow, gross,\" \"You might just be his midnight fantasy,\" and \"I am happy to be your bodyguard.\" CP at 708-09. Caldier \"liked\" a number of the comments referring to Seaquist as weird, creepy, and gross. CP at 508-12. Eventually Caldier removed the post.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 On September 5, Caldier filed a police report with the Bremerton Police Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   She spoke with Officer Robert Davis Jr. who filled out the demographic and narrative pages of a police report. Caldier said that \"on a couple of occasions\" Seaquist took her photograph getting out of a car or in public. CP at 84. Officer Davis wrote, \"I advised Caldier that from what she has told me Seaquist has not committed any crime.\" CP at 84. The report also notes that Caldier stated people had taken photos of her home and children and trespassed on her property. Caldier further stated that she did not want Seaquist contacted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 A week later, on September 12, Steven Gardner of the\n   <em>\n    Kitsap Sun\n   </em>\n   wrote an article discussing Caldier's Facebook post and police report, and garnered comments from both candidates about the incident. The article included Seaquist's photo of Caldier and her car, which Caldier acknowledges she saw when she read the article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 On October 8, the Caldier campaign released a video ad on YouTube and local television mentioning the incident. A portion of the video included an actor saying, \"Seaquist was caught secretly photographing Michelle, invading her privacy.\" Ex. B. When the actor said this, the screen showed a doctored photograph making Seaquist appear to be hunched over taking a photo with text underneath stating, \"Larry Seaquist was caught secretly taking photos of Caldier.\" CP at 712 (capitalization omitted). The video also showed text saying, \"Source: Police report filed September 5, 2014.\" Ex. 1 at Ex. B (capitalization omitted). Caldier approved the video.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 On October 10, Caldier was interviewed on a radio show. The following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   [Host]: Well, let me ask both of you, then-Melanie and Michelle [Caldier]-you're Republicans, right? And we're told that Republicans have a war on women. Why in the world did you choose the Republican Party? Why don't you each step in and let me know? Michelle, why don't you go first?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [Caldier]: Well, it's funny because I did not even know that there was a war on women. In fact, I have had so much support from the party, and, you know, with some of the experiences I've gone through. I've been actually harassed and had people take pictures of me, had my opponent take pictures of me. I'd have to say that the Democrats probably have more of a war of women, with my experience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   CP at 88-89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 Sometime near October 16, Caldier sent out a campaign mailer to voters in Kitsap and Pierce counties. One side of the mailer contained the same doctored image of Seaquist as seen in the campaign video. Seaquist was made to appear hunched over, with his coat collar up, sneakily taking a photo with a camera phone while in a grassy area. In print, the mailer read, \"WHY WAS LARRY SEAQUIST TAKING PICTURES of Michelle Caldier?\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 93. Underneath this, the mailer stated, \"CALDIER FILES POLICE REPORT.\" CP at 93.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 On the other side of the mailer, a number of statements were under the heading, \"CALDIER FILES POLICE REPORT AGAINST SEAQUIST.\" CP at 94. On the left side were two separate statements, \"Why Were Seaquist Campaign People Taking Pictures at Caldier Home?\" and, directly beneath, \"Caldier Files Police Report Against Seaquist.\" CP at 94. The middle of the mailer had the heading, \"Multiple Incidents Lead to Concern by Caldier.\" CP at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 Under this, there was text on the left and an image of a demographic page of the police report Caldier filed against Seaquist. The text stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   It started with unwelcome strangers taking pictures of her home. Then the mailbox was tampered with leading to the likelihood of trespassing-a Federal offense. The final straw was an inappropriate intrusion by Larry Seaquist himself, sneakily\n   taking pictures of Michelle while she was getting in to her car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Enough is enough! Michelle filed a police report seen here to communicate a message to Larry Seaquist and his campaign staff that they had crossed the line. Friendly campaigning had turned into what felt like stalking and harassment to Ms. Caldier, so she took action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   CP at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b614 Under this block of text, there was a photo. The photo showed the hands of a person taking a photo of Caldier in her car. The photographer was at the passenger side window taking the photo of Caldier's profile. Next to this photo and under the police report image was a photo of Seaquist. Under Seaquist's photo and in large lettering, the mailer stated, \"Larry Seaquist Should be Ashamed.\" Under this, \"You would expect a higher level of integrity from a man with Larry Seaquist's experience. Has the Seaquist team resorted to dirty tactics to win? It appears so.\" CP at 94. Finally, on the right side of the mailer, there was a picture of Caldier with the accompanying text, \" 'I don't think a female candidate is supposed to feel like I have felt in the privacy of my own home and car. This kind of behavior is concerning and possibly illegal.'-Michelle Caldier.\" CP at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b615 A website promoting Caldier's campaign, Larryseaquistfacts.com, posted the same graphics and statements as the mailer, except for Caldier's picture and quote. The website contained additional information recounting and criticizing Seaquist's political stances. Caldier acknowledged that this website promoted her campaign, but she denied running it or directing the content of the site. Caldier's campaign staff, however, acknowledged running the website as part of the Caldier campaign.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b616 After the Seaquists filed suit alleging defamation and false light. The lawsuit was dismissed, but later reinstated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 After the superior court vacated its prior dismissal and findings, Caldier moved for summary judgment, which the superior court granted in part and denied in part. In its order, the court examined each statement and denied summary judgment regarding the statements it found to potentially support a defamation by implication claim. Because the court noted a split of authorities as to whether defamation by implication was a viable theory in this State, it certified the question to this court. However, the Seaquists renounced any defamation by implication claim and, as a result, we denied discretionary review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b618 The trial court, after requiring the Seaquists to expressly state they waived any defamation by implication claims, granted Caldier's motion for summary judgment dismissing the case. The Seaquists appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   I.

Political mudslinging is expected by audiences during contentious elections. The race between Caldier and Seaquist for the 26th District State Representative position was no exception. It is through a political campaign lens that we consider Caldier's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Facebook Post\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b631 Caldier's Facebook post stated, \"I came out of a candidate interview and saw Rep. Larry Seaquest [sic], my opponent, taking pictures of me as I got into my car. Wow. ... I felt like I was being stalked!\" CP at 708.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b632 Here, the Seaquists did not present evidence that this statement was substantially false. Seaquist admits to taking pictures of Caldier after she got into her car and before driving away. Although it appears that Caldier was seated in her car when the photo was taken, the gist of the statement is true. Caldier's accompanying opinion about feeling \"stalked\" cannot be defamatory because there are no provable facts to the contrary. Caldier\n   <em>\n    feeling\n   </em>\n   \"stalked\" is her opinion based on her perception of the incident. Accordingly, the Seaquists' defamation claim as to the Facebook post was properly dismissed by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Campaign Video\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b633 Caldier's campaign published an attack video capitalizing on Seaquist taking the photos. A portion of the video included an actor saying, \"Seaquist was caught secretly photographing Michelle, invading her privacy.\" Ex. B. When she said this, on screen, there was a\n   doctored graphic showing Seaquist hunched over taking a photo and text underneath stating, \"Larry Seaquist was caught secretly taking photos of Caldier.\" Ex. B. The video also reads, \"Source: Police report filed September 5, 2014.\" Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \u00b634 Again, Seaquist did take pictures of Caldier without her permission. If Caldier had not noticed Seaquist taking the photos, seemingly no one else would have known. While Seaquist says he was not being secretive, it is not provably false to describe his actions as secretive. The phrase, \"invading her privacy,\" is an opinion and is not provably false either. While the Seaquists point out that it is not illegal to take photos of someone on the street and that a person has no legal expectation of privacy when moving about in public, a person's feeling of privacy is not provably false. Caldier's opinions and feelings about her personal privacy cannot be the basis of a defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b635 Further, although the photoshopped image of Seaquist taking a photo is deceiving, the gist is true. Similarly, Caldier did indeed file a police report on September 5, 2014, alleging that Seaquist had taken pictures of her. Accordingly, the campaign attack video cannot be the basis of a defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Radio Show Statement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b636 On the radio show, Caldier stated, \"I have had so much support from the [Republican] party, and, you know, with some of the experiences I've gone through. I've been actually harassed and had people take pictures of me, had my opponent take pictures of me. I'd have to say that the Democrats probably have more of a war on women, with my experience.\" CP at 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b637 Here, the only statement Caldier makes referencing Seaquist is that he took pictures of her. This statement is true. Accordingly, Caldier's statements on the radio show cannot be the basis of a defamation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Campaign Mailer and Website\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b638 Caldier's campaign mailer contained a number of statements attacking Seaquist. Many of these statements were repeated on the website, Larryseaquistfacts.com.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    True Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b639 The mailer contained three true statements: (1) \"WHY WAS LARRY SEAQUIST TAKING PICTURES of Michelle Caldier?\" (2) \"CALDIER FILES POLICE REPORT,\" and (3) \"CALDIER FILES POLICE REPORT AGAINST SEAQUIST.\" CP at 93-94. Seaquist did take pictures of Caldier, and Caldier did indeed file a police report after the incident. Although Seaquist disagrees with the content of the police report itself, Caldier's broad statement about filing a report is factually correct. Caldier simply states true facts; Seaquist took pictures of Caldier and she filed a police report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Opinions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   \u00b640 The mailer contained multiple opinions. The mailer stated, \"Larry Seaquist should be ashamed. You would expect a higher level of integrity from a man with Larry Seaquist's experience. Has the Seaquist team resorted to dirty tactics to win? It appears so.\" CP at 94. It also read, \" 'I don't think a female candidate is supposed to feel like I have felt in the privacy of my own home and car. This kind of behavior is concerning and possibly illegal.'-Michelle Caldier.\" CP at 94. These statements are nonactionable opinions and do not imply undisclosed defamatory facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    Statements About Others, Not Seaquist\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b641 The mailer asked, \"Why were Seaquist campaign people taking pictures at Caldier home?\" CP at 94. Although posed as a question, this statement implies that Seaquist's \"campaign people\" took pictures of Caldier's home. The group of \"campaign people\" is so broad as to leave a person unsure of who Caldier is referring to. She does not attribute actions directly to Seaquist, his campaign staff, or anyone directly under Seaquist's direction. This question is not defamatory to Seaquist, it asks a question about other people, not him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   d.\n   <em>\n    Mixed Statements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b642 The body of the mailer had the heading: \"Multiple Incidents Lead to Concern by Caldier.\" CP at 94. This was followed by two paragraphs:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   It started with unwelcome strangers taking pictures of her home. Then the mailbox was tampered with leading to the likelihood of trespassing-a Federal offense. The final straw was an inappropriate intrusion by Larry Seaquist himself, sneakily taking pictures of Michelle while she was getting in to her car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Enough is enough! Michelle filed a police report seen here to communicate a message to Larry Seaquist and his campaign staff that they had crossed the line. Friendly campaigning had turned into what felt like stalking and harassment to Ms. Caldier, so she took action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   CP at 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b643 This portion of the mailer described what gave Caldier concern. This concern is an expressed opinion. Caldier stated that strangers took pictures of her home and that her mailbox was tampered with. However, she did not directly attribute either of these to Seaquist. Caldier again states that Seaquist took her picture, which is true. Explaining why Caldier filed a police report and expressing a feeling of stalking and harassment are opinions. Although the placement of certain statements in proximity to others suggested connections and correlations between them, the mailer did not expressly note anything beyond true facts, opinions, or actions not attributed to Seaquist himself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   e.\n   <em>\n    Doctored Image and Photo\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b644 The Seaquists take issue with two images on the mailer. The first was the same doctored image of Seaquist holding a phone that was included in the campaign video. As we discussed above, the gist of this image is true. The second photo was a person's hands taking a photo of Caldier in her car. The photographer was at the passenger side window taking the photo of Caldier's profile. The broad gist of what the photo is attempting to recreate is true. Although the position of the photographer may be misleading, Seaquist did take a photo of Caldier in her car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   f.\n   <em>\n    Campaign Mailer as a Whole\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b645 We next view Caldier's campaign mailer as a whole to construe it by its ordinary meaning to a person reading it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1157805\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/96/473/#p486\">\n    96 Wash.2d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=635%20P.2d%201081\">\n    635 P.2d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although the mailer is unquestionably misleading and ignoble, we hold that it is not provably false. The statements are either true, directed at people other than Seaquist personally, or opinion.

The statements are either true, opinion, or statements about others.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Seaquists Failed To Establish a Prima Facie Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b647 Accordingly, the Seaquists have failed to prove the falsity requirement of defamation with convincing clarity because all of Caldier's statements were either true, opinion, or statements concerning actions not attributable to Seaquist.

Saint James Sch.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8356185\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/959/72/#p93\">\n    959 So.2d 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 93 (Ala. 2006) ;\n   <em>\n    Kitt v.

App. 1999). Requiring a prima facie showing of a false light claim weighs First Amendment considerations alongside the personal interests intended to be protected by invasion of privacy torts. Our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Eastwood\n   </em>\n   held that false light is subject to the defamation statute of limitations period because of the parallels between the two torts.\n   <em>\n    Eastwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1195514\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/106/466/#p471\">\n    106 Wash.2d at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=722%20P.2d%201295\">\n    722 P.2d 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, we implement a requirement that a plaintiff must present a prima facie case of false light to overcome a motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Alleged False Light of Seaquist\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   \u00b651 Here, for the same reasons the Seaquists were unable to show falsity for defamation, they fail to show falsity for a false light claim. The Seaquists allege only that Caldier made false statements. We emphasize again that the Seaquists do not allege that the implications of her statements are false. Because no statement is provably false, the Seaquists do not present a prima facie case of false light. Accordingly, the trial court did not err when it granted summary judgment in favor of Caldier on the false light claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   \u00b652 The Seaquists were required to establish a prima facie case for their defamation and false light claims. Because they failed to establish a prima facie case for either a defamation or a false light claim, we affirm the trial court's summary judgment dismissal of both claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Maxa, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Melnick, J.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-100\">\n    At some time during 2014, Caldier's neighbor alerted her that some of her mail was on the ground instead of inside the mailbox as if a person had gone through it. Caldier also noticed someone who said he was a real estate appraiser taking photographs of her recently purchased house. Caldier's sister, who served as her campaign manager, also noticed someone taking photos of her own house.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    Caldier made a special motion to strike the complaint under the Washington act limiting \"Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation\" (anti-SLAPP statute), RCW 4.24.525. Following the trial court's dismissal of the Seaquists' claim under that statute and during the pendency of an appeal, our Supreme Court found the anti-SLAPP statute unconstitutional.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Davis v.
