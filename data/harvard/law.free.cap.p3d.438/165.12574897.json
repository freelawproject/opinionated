Sandoval also argues that she received ineffective assistance of counsel when her attorney failed to request an \"unwitting possession\" jury instruction. Finally, Sandoval argues that we should remand for the trial court to inquire into her ability to pay legal financial obligations (LFOs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm the convictions but remand for the trial court to reconsider the imposition of LFOs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. INCIDENT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 On March 6, Sandoval entered into an agreement with a car dealership. The agreement allowed Sandoval to take home and use a vehicle for three days to determine whether she wanted to purchase it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 After three days, the dealership lost contact with Sandoval and made unsuccessful attempts to retrieve the vehicle. The dealership reported the vehicle stolen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 On April 2, the police found Sandoval and her husband in the stolen vehicle at the address listed in the agreement. The police arrested Sandoval for possession of a stolen vehicle and searched her incident to that arrest. In Sandoval's purse, the police found a credit card with somebody else's name on it, Sandoval's sister's birth certificate, and a pipe with methamphetamine residue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The credit card had been stolen in early February. At that time, the card was active and could have been used to buy goods. Shortly thereafter, the card's owner cancelled the card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 The State charged Sandoval with possession of a stolen vehicle, possession of stolen property in the second degree, identity theft in the second degree, and possession of a controlled substance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II. TRIAL AND SENTENCING\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 As relevant here, the court instructed the jury on the elements of possession of stolen property in the second degree. The court told the jury that the State had to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the stolen property was an access device.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 The court defined an access device as, \"any card, plate, code, account number, or other means of account access that can be used alone or in conjunction with another access device to obtain money, goods, services, or anything else of value.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 47. In the same instruction, the court stated, \"The phrase 'can be used' refers to the status of the access device when it was last in possession of its lawful owner, regardless of its status at a later time.\" CP at 47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 The jury convicted Sandoval on all charges except identity theft in the second degree. The State dismissed that charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 At sentencing, the court imposed numerous LFOs, including a $ 250 jury-demand fee. Sandoval appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   I. ACCESS DEVICE DEFINED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 Sandoval makes three assignments of error which are premised on her argument that the court incorrectly instructed the jury on the definition of the term \"access device.\" According to Sandoval, an access device must be able to obtain something of value at the time it is found on a defendant, not at the time it was last in the possession of its lawful owner. Sandoval argues that insufficient evidence supports her conviction for possession of stolen property in the second degree, that the trial court erroneously instructed the jury on the definition of access device, and that the court impermissibly commented on the evidence with the instruction. We disagree with Sandoval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A. Legal Principles\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 RCW 9A.56.010(1) defines \"access device.\" The definition contains the phrase \"can be used.\" \"Can be used\" is not statutorily defined. Sandoval argues that the court's jury instruction contained an erroneous definition for the phrase \"can be used.\" Sandoval's argument is two-fold. First, Sandoval argues that we should not follow\n   <em>\n    State v.

Schloredt made the same argument that Sandoval makes. He argued that because the term \"can be used\" in RCW 9A.56.0101(1) is written in the present tense, the state must show that an access device can be used at the time the device is found on a defendant.\n   <em>\n    Schloredt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"184244\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/97/789/\">\n    97 Wash.

After discussing why the instruction inaccurately interpreted\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   , the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   Furthermore, the question faced by the court in\n   <em>\n    Barnett\n   </em>\n   was whether the specific facts in that case were legally sufficient for the court to uphold an exceptional sentence based on abuse occurring over a \"prolonged period of time.\" This is not an appropriate basis on which to create a jury instruction defining \"prolonged period of time.\" Thus, we clarify that legal definitions should not be fashioned out of courts' findings regarding legal sufficiency.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Brush\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793198\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/550/#p557\">\n    183 Wash.2d at 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=353%20P.3d%20213\">\n    353 P.3d 213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Read in its entirety, it is clear that the court had concerns about defining highly fact-specific terms, such as \"prolonged,\" based on previous sufficiency of the evidence rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b640 Whether abuse occurs over a prolonged period of time is a fact-specific and subjective determination. One jury's finding, based on its facts, should not control or dictate the outcome of later cases, based on their facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b641 Thus,\n   <em>\n    Brush\n   </em>\n   recognizes that courts should not fashion jury instructions based on previous sufficiency of the evidence cases to define certain terms, e.g., prolonged, which should be left to the sound discretion of the jury. Doing otherwise could constrain later juries in making findings. It also could relieve the State of having to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in subsequent cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b642 In contrast, determining the point in time for a jury to calculate whether an instrument \"can be used\" is not a fact-specific inquiry. Defining the phrase does not constrain juries in subsequent cases. Unlike a definition of the word \"prolonged,\" the proper definition of the phrase \"can be used\" is independent of the facts of any given case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b643 This conclusion is further supported by\n   <em>\n    Schloredt\n   </em>\n   's analysis.\n   <em>\n    Schloredt\n   </em>\n   engaged in statutory interpretation to define the phrase \"can be used.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"184244\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/97/789/\">\n    97 Wash.

The court did not construe facts in the state's favor or determine whether any reasonable jury could find that \"can be used\" is susceptible to the interpretation that the relevant time is the time in which the instrument was last in possession of its lawful owner. Instead, only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the court reached its legal conclusion for the appropriate definition of \"can be used\" did it look to the evidence presented to determine whether sufficient evidence supported the finding that the instrument was an \"access device.\"\n   <em>\n    Schloredt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"184244\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/97/789/\">\n    97 Wash.

Such probability is lacking here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b651 Viewing the evidence, jury instructions, and verdicts leads to the conclusion that the jury disbelieved Sandoval's testimony. For instance, Sandoval testified that she was not aware that another person's credit card was in her purse until after she was arrested. However, in convicting Sandoval of possession of stolen property in the second degree, the jury necessarily found to the contrary. The jury found beyond a reasonable doubt that Sandoval knowingly possessed the credit card.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b652 Furthermore, Sandoval testified that she obtained the credit card and methamphetamine pipe at the same time, and both items were found on Sandoval in the same location. Therefore, if the jury found that the State carried its burden in showing beyond a reasonable doubt that Sandoval\n   <em>\n    knowingly\n   </em>\n   possessed the credit card, then it is doubtful that Sandoval could have carried her burden to show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that she\n   <em>\n    unwittingly\n   </em>\n   possessed the methamphetamine pipe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b653 Thus, we conclude that it was not reasonably probable that the jury would have found Sandoval not guilty of possession of a controlled substance if they had been instructed on the unwitting possession defense. Sandoval was not prejudiced by her counsel's failure to request the instruction. Because Sandoval has not met her burden to prove prejudice, her ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   III.
