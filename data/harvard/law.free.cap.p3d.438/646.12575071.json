Al-Thanayyan (\"Father\") appeals from the property allocation, parenting time restrictions, and award of attorneys' fees in the decree dissolving his marriage to Tiffany Lee Lehn (\"Mother\"). Father claims that the family court inequitably allocated community property and debt in Mother's favor. He also argues that the court had no authority to require him to post a cash bond of $ 2.5 million for each child to secure their safe return from Kuwait and that the record does not support the need for a bond in that amount. He further claims that the court abused its discretion by awarding Mother her attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 We affirm the decree. The family court did not abuse its discretion in allocating the community property and debt in Mother's favor because the allocation was equitable given Father's attempt to hide the community's interest in his Kuwaiti businesses and the income from those businesses. The court also had discretion to impose the cash bond under its authority to determine parenting time in the children's best interests, and the amount was not an abuse of discretion given the degree of risk that Father might relocate\n   the children to Kuwait and fail to return them to Mother. Further, the court properly awarded Mother attorneys' fees because it found that a substantial financial disparity existed between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 Father is a Kuwaiti citizen who has United States lawful permanent resident status, and Mother is a United States citizen. The parties were married in Arizona in 2006. Shortly thereafter, the parties moved to Kuwait and lived there for five years. Their older child was born in Kuwait in 2008. While the parties lived in Kuwait, Mother and the older child would travel to the United States. When Mother became pregnant with the parties' second child in 2011, Father gave the consent required by Kuwaiti law for her to return permanently to the United States. The children are dual citizens of Kuwait and the United States. When Mother returned to the United States, the parties purchased a home in Arizona. Father traveled to Arizona several times a year, and Mother brought the children to Kuwait each summer for a month-long visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 During the marriage, Father worked for the Kuwait Municipal Ministry and a Kuwaiti business called Uptown Trading Company (\"Uptown\"). In the dissolution proceedings, Mother claimed Father also owned other Kuwaiti businesses, including Al-Thanayyan International Company (\"AIC\"), Smart Tech, Smart Zone, and Free Zone, and sought disclosure from Father of financial documents concerning those entities. Father did not provide the requested discovery, claiming that he could not obtain the business records because AIC was a family business in which he had no ownership interest and the other companies were merely AIC's subsidiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b65 At trial, Mother provided evidence that Father was previously listed on the AIC website as an authorized partner, co-founder, and owner and identified himself as its chief executive officer on business cards and social media. Both parties presented evidence that in Kuwait, to bear the name \"Al-Thanayyan International Company,\" the company would need to be owned by a person with that surname. Father claimed his father started AIC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 The evidence showed that the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce registry had listed Father as an authorized partner of AIC and Smart Zone, but that he was no longer listed as such at the time of trial. Mother's expert, Mary Ann Sharp, testified that the Chamber of Commerce would not have listed Father as an owner unless it received documentary evidence of an ownership interest. Sharp agreed, however, that the Kuwait Ministry of Commerce, not the Chamber of Commerce, maintains the official registry of business ownership in Kuwait, and Father was not listed as an owner of any business on the Kuwait Ministry's registry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b67 As further evidence that Father had an ownership interest in or earned additional income from these businesses, Mother testified that during the marriage Father's income was higher than he claimed. Mother's evidence established that Father deposited an average of $ 12,000 per month in a United States bank account, paid the mortgage and the two children's private school tuition, and gave Mother $ 8,000 per month for her expenses even though he claimed that he only earned $ 12,337 per month from the Kuwait Ministry and Uptown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b68 The family court found that Father likely had an ownership interest in these Kuwaiti businesses and had received income for the benefit of the community \"at some point in time.\" The court also found that he had provided insufficient disclosure of those interests or had otherwise hidden assets. For that reason, the court could not determine the value of these business interests. To compensate Mother for her share of the community's interest in these businesses, the court ordered Father to pay the entire balance of a $ 241,000 community debt and awarded Mother 85 percent of the community Metro Health Savings Federal Credit Union account, which contained $ 21,132.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b69 Both parties called experts in international law to address Mother's request that Father's parenting time occur only in Arizona because she feared that if he were permitted to take the children to Kuwait, he would not return them to the United States. Mother also requested that Father be ordered to surrender his passport and United\n   States permanent resident card to his attorney before exercising parenting time in the United States. Mother was concerned because Kuwait is not a signatory to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction (\"Hague Convention\"), which \"seeks 'to secure the prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting State,' and 'to ensure that rights of custody and of access under the law of one Contracting State are effectively respected in the other Contracting States.' \"\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

Father's expert testified that the parties could enter into a written agreement requiring Father to return the children to Mother in Arizona, but he conceded that such an agreement would be revocable, and he could not cite any case previously implementing such an agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Mother's expert, attorney Jeremy Morley, testified that he \"concentrate[s] exclusively on international family law matters, particularly, including international child custody matters, and international child abduction prevention [and] recovery.\" He admitted that his opinions about Father were based on facts obtained from Mother and Father's expert, and he acknowledged that to the extent those facts may be incorrect, his opinions would lack foundation. Morley relied on official statements and information about Kuwaiti law from the United States Department of State, the United Kingdom, and non-governmental organizations that provide information relating to international child abductions. Morley testified that he had done extensive research into international child custody disputes, written several articles and two treatises on the subject, and provided expert testimony in courts across the United States and internationally. Father stipulated that Morley was an expert. Morley testified about some of the factors listed by section 7 of the Uniform Child Abduction Prevention Act (\"UCAPA\") and further testified that other United States courts have applied similar risk assessment factors. On cross-examination, Father questioned the level of Morley's experience with Kuwaiti cases and the bases for his opinions but did agree with some of Morley's testimony on Kuwait family law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Evidence showed that Father had told one child to lie to Mother about having a cell phone and had also told that same child he was old enough to visit Kuwait on his own and \"more than that.\" According to Mother, Father refused to explain to her what he meant by the latter comment. Additionally, Father petitioned for divorce in Kuwait and falsely alleged that Mother left Kuwait without legal justification and submitted a power of attorney stating that he is the children's natural guardian.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b613 The family court ordered Father to exercise parenting time in Arizona unless Mother agreed in writing and was given the children's passports. Additionally, the court ordered that Father could exercise parenting time in Kuwait, but only if he first posted a $ 2.5 million cash bond per child to secure their safe return. The family court based these parenting time orders on the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Kuwait is not a signatory of the Hague Convention and has no extradition treaty with the United States;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 The\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     potential\n    </em>\n   </em>\n   legal structures in Kuwait, if any, for Mother to utilize in order to ensure the return of her Children are insufficient and/or illusory;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022 Father has insufficient ties to the United States and/or Arizona, given his lack of employment, family ties and property (especially in light of the recent sale of his home);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022 Father has significant ties to Kuwait, to include employment, family and property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   \u2022 Father is a risk for not returning the Children if they visit him in Kuwait.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 It is in the Children's best interests to have parenting time with Father;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 A security bond is the only appropriate and available legal structure to allow Father to exercise parenting time in Kuwait; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 It is in the Children's best interests to impose a security bond that is substantial enough to provide a monetary incentive and/or act as a deterrent to abducting the Children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The family court then awarded Mother a portion of her attorneys' fees after finding a substantial disparity of financial resources between the parties, and Father timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

In this case, the unequal allocation of the community debt and bank account was within the court's discretion based on the evidence, which supported the court's finding that Father attempted to hide the community's interest in or income from the Kuwaiti businesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R.S. \u00a7 25-318(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b616 In ordering Father to pay the entire $ 241,000 community debt, the court referred to its \"findings regarding his business interests.\" Although the court did not specifically refer to these findings in allocating the community bank account, the court's allocation of that asset is similarly supported by its rejection of Father's claim that he did not have an ownership interest in the Kuwaiti businesses. Thus, the court did not abuse its discretion in equitably allocating other community assets or obligations to compensate Mother for her share of the community interest in the businesses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Martin v.

Neither contention has merit. First, the court's finding that Father had received income from his business interests \"for the benefit of the community\" necessarily implies that Father's business interests existed during the marriage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b618 Second, Father cannot complain about the lack of a valuation of his business interests because his attempts to hide these interests and recalcitrance in disclosing information about them made a valuation impossible.

These filings could be viewed as an attempt to establish rights under Kuwaiti law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b622 The finding that Mother would have no significant legal recourse is supported by evidence that Kuwait has not adopted the Hague Convention or entered into a bilateral agreement with the United States regarding the return of internationally abducted children. Thus, no procedure for the return of the children exists other than those available under Kuwaiti law. Testimony showed that Mother would need Father's permission to leave Kuwait with the children and any written agreement that required Father to return the children could be revoked. Thus, the evidence supports the conclusion that Mother would have little recourse available to challenge Father's rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b623 Father contends the family court abused its discretion by relying on Morley's testimony because he relied on information from Mother, unidentified international law experts, and governmental informational sources.

He explained that his opinions about Father were based on facts provided by Mother and Father's expert, and he acknowledged that his opinions may lack foundation if those facts were incorrect. The factual statement Mother provided to Morley, however, was\n   substantially consistent with her trial testimony.

He relied on official statements and information about Kuwaiti law from the United States Department of State, the United Kingdom, and non-governmental organizations that provide information relating to international child abductions. Morley testified that he had gained significant knowledge about international child custody disputes, written several articles and two treatises on the subject, and provided expert testimony in the United States and internationally. Father also stipulated that Morley was an expert and that his own expert agreed with some of Morley's testimony regarding Kuwait family law. The family court acknowledged the strengths and weaknesses in both experts' positions and was in the best position to judge their credibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747634\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/343/\">\n    193 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   347 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747634\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/343/\">\n    972 P.2d at 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, the court had authority to impose the bond pursuant to \u00a7 25-403.02(D).

Pursuant to UCAPA \u00a7 8(d)(2), an abduction prevention order may include a bond or other security \"in an amount sufficient to serve as a financial deterrent to abduction....\" Having found the evidence supports the court's finding that the children were at risk of not being returned to Arizona if Father were allowed to take them to Kuwait, we affirm the imposition of a security bond.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b628 Father further argues that the amount of the bond was not related to the anticipated costs Mother might incur in litigating the forced return of the children from Kuwait and was excessive given his assets and income. The purpose of the bond, however, was not to compensate Mother for\n   the costs she might incur, but to deter Father from abducting the children. Thus, the cases Father cites concerning supersedeas or other bonds are not persuasive. The family court found that Father had undisclosed ownership interests in and income from Kuwaiti businesses. Because Father had failed to disclose relevant financial records, Mother had no precise evidence of Father's income and ownership interests in the Kuwaiti businesses. She did provide evidence, however, that at least one of Father's businesses in Kuwait may be worth $ 3 million. Therefore, Father cannot now complain that the amount the court found would act as a deterrent was excessive. Furthermore, given the court's authority to prohibit international travel altogether,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Katare,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=283%20P.3d%20546\">\n    283 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   555 \u00b6 34, we cannot conclude that the amount of the bond, although significant, is an abuse of discretion.

However, Mother's ability to pay is not dispositive. \"[ Section] 25-324 does not require 'a showing of actual inability to pay as a predicate' for an award; 'all a party need show is that a relative financial disparity in income and/or assets exists between the parties.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Magee v.

Although the family court was unable to attribute a specific amount of income to Father from the Kuwaiti businesses, Mother's evidence suggested that Father's income was much higher than reported on the child support order or income tax returns. On appeal, we do not reweigh this evidence and will defer to the family court's resolution of this factual dispute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gutierrez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747634\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/343/\">\n    193 Ariz. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   347 \u00b6 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"747634\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/193/343/\">\n    972 P.2d at 680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Both parties request an award of attorneys' fees and costs under A.R.S. \u00a7 25-324, and Father also requests fees under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.01. This matter does not arise out of contract; therefore, fees are not warranted under A.R.S. \u00a7 12-341.01.
