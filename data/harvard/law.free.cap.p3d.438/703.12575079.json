The sole issue presented on appeal is whether Pitts' claim for workers' compensation benefits, based on post-traumatic stress disorder (\"PTSD\"), was untimely under Arizona Revised Statutes (\"A.R.S.\") section 23-1061(A). Because insufficient evidence supported the ALJ's finding of untimeliness, we set aside the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b62 Pitts worked for the City of Chandler as a police officer between July 2002 and April 2017. In May 2013, Pitts was on duty in his patrol vehicle with his fianc\u00e9e, who was participating in a ride-along. That evening, Pitts received a service call. Dispatch explained there was a man acting in a disorderly manner and possibly brandishing a gun outside Chandler Regional Hospital. The dispatcher told Pitts the man was walking up the road with hospital security guards following at a distance. Upon arriving in his patrol car, Pitts directed his spotlight at a man fitting the suspect's description. The man then stopped, leveled his gun, and fired. The first bullet shattered the windshield, spraying glass toward Pitts' face and eyes. As multiple bullets continued to pelt the car, Pitts got out and returned fire. Pitts shot the man in the shoulder, ending the gunfight. Neither Pitts nor his fianc\u00e9e were injured by the spray of bullets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 Pitts took three weeks off work after the incident. A week or two into his leave, his superiors required him to see the police department psychologist, who advised Pitts to \"get back on that horse.\" Although Pitts told the department psychologist he felt unready to work, he resumed his duties a week later. The department psychologist did not provide a diagnosis at that time, and Pitts did not seek or receive any additional treatment related to the shooting incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Almost a year later, the man went on trial for shooting at Pitts. Pitts attended the three-week trial daily and testified about the events of that evening. The shooter was convicted and sentenced to over 50 years in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Between the shooting incident and the trial, Pitts experienced emotional problems, including difficulty sleeping and nightmares, anxiety, and social withdrawal. Pitts also became hypervigilant-constantly assessing potential threats to his safety and that of his family. A year after the trial, the shooter's sentence was reduced. Pitts testified at the hearing that the sentence reduction was a \"gut punch.\" In his opinion, the reduction in sentence was based solely on a legal technicality. Over the next six months, Pitts' depression worsened: he lost interest in his children and home life, began having panic and anxiety attacks at work, and experienced tunnel vision, insomnia, dissociative episodes where he lost track of time, and a hollow echoing sound in his ears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 On December 28, 2015, Pitts visited his primary care doctor to obtain sleep medication. The doctor's note from that visit states, \"[p]robable PTSD,\" and opined that Pitts needed to see a psychologist for evaluation. In the ICA proceeding that eventually followed, Pitts testified he did not recall the doctor mentioning the need for psychological treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 At the recommendation of fellow officers, Pitts saw a trauma psychologist in January 2016. This was the first time a medical professional diagnosed him with dissociative complex PTSD related to the shooting incident. Based on this medical assessment, he was taken off patrol duty. The trauma psychologist's treatment summary shows that his initial visit occurred on January 21, 2016, with a diagnosis that day or soon thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 Shortly before seeing the trauma psychologist, Pitts made an injury report to Corvel Enterprise Corp., Inc. (the \"Carrier\"). It was not until the Carrier refused to pay his medical bills that Pitts decided to pursue a workers' compensation claim. On October 27, 2016, he filed a worker's report of injury for PTSD stemming from the shooting incident. The Carrier again denied his claim for benefits, and he timely requested an ICA hearing. The ALJ held a hearing, limited to the issue of timeliness, and heard testimony from Pitts and his fianc\u00e9e.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Pitts' fianc\u00e9e testified that she had lived with Pitts since the incident and witnessed the May 2013 shooting. She explained that sometime in July 2015, Pitts began to disassociate, hide in his room, and stop communicating, doing chores, or getting dressed for the day. He appeared depressed and quit interacting with his children. His fianc\u00e9e testified that Pitts became hypervigilant about his family's safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b610 Following the hearing, the ALJ determined Pitts' claim was untimely and that the ICA thus lacked jurisdiction. Pitts timely requested administrative review, and the ALJ supplemented and affirmed the decision. Pitts next brought this special action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b611 Pitts asserts that the ALJ erred in finding his claim untimely, arguing that he did not know of his condition until early 2016 when he was diagnosed with PTSD and began treatment. The City and the Carrier respond that the ALJ correctly concluded that Pitts knew both the nature and seriousness of his injury within one year of the incident. Because neither the City nor the Carrier presented adequate evidence to support a finding that the claim was untimely, we set aside the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b612 A workers' compensation claim must be filed \"within one year after the injury occurred or the right thereto accrued.\" A.R.S. \u00a7 23-1061(A). A compensable injury becomes manifest-and the one-year period begins to run-when the injured employee recognizes the nature of his injury, the seriousness of the injury, and the probable causal relationship between the injury and the employment.\n   <em>\n    Pac.

Here, the ALJ found that Pitts' claim was untimely based solely on testimony from Pitts and his fianc\u00e9e. The ALJ's conclusion, in relevant part, read as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Here ... the applicant knew, in the year following the shooting incident that he was missing more time from work than previously, for reasons related to the shooting. He had constant difficulty sleeping, nightmares, emotional instability and social withdrawal throughout the first year following the incident. Those symptoms only increased over the next eighteen months, which finally led the applicant to see his primary care doctor in December 2015 to\n   get sleep medication. While he may not have known what was happening to him ... he did not seek medical or psychological help with his symptoms between June, 2013, and December, 2015, though there is no evidence that he was prevented from doing so.... Based on all the foregoing, it is found that the applicant's claim was untimely filed....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 In contrast to many physical injuries where a diagnosis is immediate and obvious, the emergence of a mental health injury is difficult to pinpoint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Glendale v.

While the ALJ found that Pitts understood\n   he missed work \"for reasons related to the shooting\" immediately following the incident, no evidence of record supports a finding that he knew or should have known of his condition at the time of the shooting or at any specific time thereafter when he began to avoid work. Pitts concedes he did not seek medical or psychological help with his symptoms in the years immediately following the shooting. However, neither the City nor the Carrier-who bear the burden of production in their affirmative defense-presented evidence to identify at what point in time Pitts' condition required him to do so.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pac.
