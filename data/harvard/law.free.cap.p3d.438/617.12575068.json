On appeal, Mr. Mayhew claims the district court erred in admitting photos and videos as other acts evidence under W.R.E. 404(b). He also contends that the district court abused its discretion in admitting evidence not identified in the State's pretrial disclosure and without proper foundation. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ISSUES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] Mr. Mayhew presents two issues on appeal, which he frames as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by admitting evidence pursuant to W.R.E. 404(b) that did not fit an acceptable purpose and was used solely to prove the character of the Defendant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   II. Did the trial court abuse its discretion by admitting evidence not listed in the pretrial proceedings and without proper foundation?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b63] William Mayhew lived near his grown daughter and her family in Sheridan, Wyoming, starting in the early 1990s. She and her husband had three daughters: HS, born in 1989; MT, born in 1992; and ST, born in 1997. In May 2015, MT revealed to her aunt that Mr. Mayhew, her grandfather, had sexually abused her and her sisters. MT's aunt informed MT's father, and he reported the allegations to law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   [\u00b64] Following an investigation, the State charged Mr. Mayhew with five counts of third-degree sexual assault: two counts for acts against HS; one count each for acts against MT and ST; and one count for acts against AR, a boy who grew up in Mr. Mayhew's neighborhood.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before trial, Mr. Mayhew requested notice of the State's intent to submit other acts evidence under W.R.E. 404(b). In response, the State provided its Rule 404(b) notice, followed by three addenda, which identified the following other acts evidence the State intended to introduce:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   --testimony by the director of a children's program at a local church, along with related emails, concerning the church's 2012 decision to terminate Mr. Mayhew as a Sunday school instructor for violating the church's policy against adults transporting children alone;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   --testimony by a former director of the Joy Junction Children's Ministry concerning a 2009 complaint from the mother of a five-year-old girl that when she picked up her daughter from a swimming pool activity, she saw that Mr. Mayhew had her daughter's legs wrapped around him;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   --testimony that arresting officers found a box at Mr. Mayhew's home that contained photos of young girls who were Joy Junction participants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   --photos and videos of young girls taken by Mr. Mayhew while participating in children's programs;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   --testimony by Mr. Mayhew's wife's younger sister that in 1962, when she was ten years old, Mr. Mayhew pinned her against a pillar and rubbed his hands on her crotch area, and a few weeks later took her to a cabin in the woods where he fondled her, pinned her down, and tried to remove her underwear;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   --testimony that in law enforcement's examination of Mr. Mayhew's computers, it discovered the use of programs and techniques used in the child exploitive community, twenty-four media files of children classified as closely related to child erotica, and 5,785 files that contained children;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   --testimony by Mr. Mayhew's daughter that he sexually abused her beginning when she was four years old and continuing until she was about twelve years old, including five specific incidents during that period; and\n   --testimony by Mr. Mayhew's wife that after the local church terminated him from Sunday school activities, she saw him burn a collection of photos in their fireplace, and testimony by HS that she also witnessed the burning of photos, which her grandmother told her were from Joy Junction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b65] The State offered the other acts evidence for the purposes of showing Mr. Mayhew's motive, intent, and lack of mistake or accident. Mr. Mayhew objected to the evidence, and on December 5, 2017, the district court heard argument on the State's notice. During the hearing, the State narrowed its proffered other acts evidence and sought admission only of Mr. Mayhew's daughter's testimony and the photos and videos of young girls Mr. Mayhew took while participating in youth activity programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b66] The district court issued an oral ruling, in which it applied the Rule 404(b) -required factors, which was followed by a summary written order that found the proffered evidence admissible. The court found that the evidence was relevant to Mr. Mayhew's motive and intent, and that its probative value was not substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   [\u00b67] At trial, the victims of the charged conduct described Mr. Mayhew's sexual abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   HS testified that Mr. Mayhew sexually abused her from the age of five until she was about ten or eleven years old. She testified that on multiple occasions, he would have her lie on his bed, face down and clothed, and he would lie on top of her, bouncing up and down. He called this the \"smooshing game.\" On other occasions, Mr. Mayhew had her apply lotion to his erect penis. He also on multiple occasions directed HS to lie on his bed, unclothed from the waist down, spread her legs, and touch herself, with him sometimes moving her hands when she \"wasn't doing it right.\" HS also described occasions when Mr. Mayhew would instruct her to use a vibrating massager on her vagina while he masturbated, would shower with her and wash her entire body, and would fondle her between her legs while driving with her in his truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   [\u00b68] During HS's testimony, a letter Mr. Mayhew had written to HS after she confronted him with her abuse allegations was admitted into evidence without objection. The letter read, with the emphasis in the typed original:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I have tried to write a letter to you this past year (some several pages long) but the words just didn't seem right. At times I felt I was not worthy to even communicate with you.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   What I found out during this time is I am not a person of words. Because of my rapid deteriorating health and your position of me not being able to talk to you, this appears to be the best communication avenue for me right now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    I just wanted you to know from my heart and soul I am truly sorry for the verbal and physical abuse I have done to you. It was wrong, wrong. Please, please forgive me, please.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I am also asking that during my last days that you visit often and allow my great granddaughter and great grandson [to] be around me and your grandma together.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b69] MT testified that Mr. Mayhew began sexually abusing her when she was five or six years old and that the abuse continued until sometime before she reached puberty. She described three specific memories of the abuse. The first incident occurred during a game of dress-up when she was five years old. Mr. Mayhew had her lie on his bed and use a vibrating massager on her genital area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On another occasion, Mr. Mayhew played a blindfold game with MT that required her to guess the identity of objects while blindfolded, one of which was his erect\n   penis. The third incident involved a game that Mr. Mayhew called \"squish it.\" During that game, he had MT lie on the floor, face up and clothed, and he would lie on top of her. MT could feel his erect penis when he did this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   [\u00b610] AR testified to a single incident of abuse that occurred during the summer of 1995, when he was about ten years old. AR lived near the Mayhews and would occasionally visit to play with their dog. On one such occasion, Mr. Mayhew brought out a vibrating massager and encouraged AR to use it on himself. AR testified that Mr. Mayhew initially showed AR how to use it on his leg and then he encouraged him to move the vibrator closer to his crotch area. Mr. Mayhew then put his hand on AR's crotch outside his pants to show him where to place the vibrator, while saying \"Doesn't that feel good?\" AR felt panicky, fled the Mayhew home, and reported the incident to his father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [\u00b611] In addition to the victims' testimony concerning the charged conduct, the State presented the other acts evidence the district court had ruled admissible. Mr. Mayhew's daughter testified that from the time she was four or five years old, he would make her wash his erect penis while he took baths. She also testified to specific incidents of abuse, including an incident when she was five or six, during which Mr. Mayhew told her, her sister, and a neighborhood friend they were going to play doctor and instructed them to get in a closet. He then called each child out individually, and when he called her out, he told her to take off her clothes and lie down, and then proceeded to examine her body, including her vagina, visually and with his hands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b612] The daughter described another incident that occurred during that same timeframe, in which she wet her pants and Mr. Mayhew ordered her to remove her clothes in front of her brother and sister and lie on the floor. He then put her in a diaper, touching her vagina while doing so, and made her wear nothing but the diaper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b613] The final incident the daughter testified to occurred when she was in the third or fourth grade. Mr. Mayhew would initiate games of hide and seek with the children and during one such game, he had her sit on his lap when she found him, and she could feel his erect penis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   [\u00b614] From the photos and videos the district court had ruled admissible, nine photos and six videos were offered and admitted into evidence. The photos were of young girls, most wearing swimming suits, and a few in shorts or skirts, with a focus on the girls' lower bodies and genital areas. Of the six videos admitted into evidence, four of them recorded clothed young girls straddling a table, with Mr. Mayhew encouraging them to scoot down the table without the use of their hands, a maneuver that required the girls to repeatedly thrust their hips. Another video showed a young girl in a skirt playing on monkey bars, and the final video was of a young girl in a park, wearing a skirt and sitting in a way that showed her underwear, with the recording focused on her underwear-covered genital area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   [\u00b615] Mr. Mayhew testified in his defense. As to the allegations contained in the other acts testimony of his daughter, he testified that he was a heavy drinker during his daughter's youth, and he could not recall that period of time. Although he could not recall that period, he testified as follows concerning her allegation that he made her wash his erect penis when he bathed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   A. One of the elements that stands out to me has to do with the male private part. And I'm sorry, but I can't say the name. Private part. I hope you understand what I'm talking about. That situation that stands out to me deals with the use of soap on my private part when it's stiff. For all the men in this room here -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [Objection sustained.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   A. My experience has been that it hurts, it hurts because the soap is - back then all the soaps around were alkalin[e] based and - it may be like the female private parts, using that alcohol-based soaps and that to clean is okay, but not for sensitive areas. And for the use of that is - I wouldn't have allowed that. I just wouldn't allow that. It hurts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   [\u00b616] Concerning his daughter's allegation that she felt Mr. Mayhew's erect penis when\n   he had her sit on his lap during a game of hide-and-seek, Mr. Mayhew testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   That's an interesting one. We lived on Gilbert. And one of the fun things we always did was we had fun with the hide and seek. It's a good thing for Dad. And one of the instances indicated here was that we had a - in the hide and seek there was a - if you'd understand, we had specific spots that we all liked to hide, because they were good spots to hide. And this particular one had the foundation and the furnace. And it was narrow, very narrow. In fact, for a 240-pound individual, it was a very tight squeeze to get in there, but it was a good spot to hide where there wasn't any lights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   That particular instance that was presented to the court is that spot. Because it's so narrow, there's no way - there's no way that anyone could sit on me because I couldn't sit because I'd have to stand up because it was so narrow. And so in that particular case, the closest that would come to that would be to sit on my knee. If you understand, if I'm sitting sideways hiding, that would the only way that somebody could be right with me, touching me, on me, would be to sit on my knee. Most of the time, obviously, I would stand up or kneel, but not - there's no way to lay down. No way to sit on my rear and have somebody sit on me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   [\u00b617] Concerning the photos of children in his possession, Mr. Mayhew testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The purpose of that was really simple. The families involved were families that, like you and me, we like pictures. We love pictures and especially of our family. And one of the things that we did was we took pictures, not only I, but other teachers, and we did something very simple. Without charge but under love, we went ahead and we did the pictures, shots, made prints, and the kids could take them home. The children could take them home. And response back with that, as you heard here this morning that parents received them and it was a great item that was used for our ministry that we had ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   [\u00b618] Mr. Mayhew provided no testimony on direct examination concerning the videos. On cross-examination, he agreed that he took the videos, that he did not have the capability to make or provide copies of those to parents, and that he did not share them with parents of the children in the videos.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   [\u00b619] With respect to the charged conduct, Mr. Mayhew denied that he inappropriately touched his granddaughters or AR with his hand or with a vibrator or that he had any sexual contact with his granddaughters or AR. Concerning the incident with AR, he admitted that AR was present on an occasion when he was using a vibrating massager on his own leg, but he denied using the massager in a sexual manner or touching AR. He testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   A. As I was using the massager, [AR] said, \"Give me the massager.\" And he says, \"I'm tough.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   And I said, \"Well, what do you mean by 'tough?' \"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   He says, \"I'm tough.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   I says, \"Okay. Let's see how tough you are.\" And I said what I want you to do is - and I pointed to the side of his head. And I said, \"I want you to go with the vibrator from your head down to your ankle, and I'd like to have you do it two times, and we'll see how tough you are.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Q. And then what happened?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   A. Well, he got on his knees and did exactly that, went from there but only down to his knees, of course, and did it twice. And I says - I don't know what he said, but I said, \"You are tough.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b620] Concerning the letter of apology he wrote to HS, Mr. Mayhew testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   Q. ... And you also admit that you did write that letter to [HS]; it's your apology?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   A. For the verbal and physical abuse. Nothing said about sexual.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   [\u00b621] The jury found Mr. Mayhew guilty of four counts of third-degree sexual assault, and the district court sentenced him to consecutive prison terms totaling twenty-eight to thirty-five years. Mr. Mayhew timely appealed his conviction to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   [\u00b622] Mr. Mayhew contends the nine photos and six videos were impermissible character evidence and that the district court therefore erred in admitting them under Rule 404(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further claims the district court erred in admitting the massaging vibrator into evidence.

How clear is it that the defendant committed the prior bad act?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   2.

The trial court should [then] weigh [the following] factors against the probative value of the evidence:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   1. The reprehensible nature of the prior bad act. The more reprehensible the act, the more likely the jury will be tempted to punish the defendant for the prior act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   2. The sympathetic character of the alleged victim of the prior bad act.

The similarity between the charged crime and the prior bad act. The more similar the acts, the greater is the likelihood that the jury will draw the improper inference that if the defendant did it once, he probably did it again.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   4. The comparative enormity of the charged crime and the prior bad act. When the prior act is a more serious offense than the charged crime, the introduction of that act will tend to place the defendant in a different and unfavorable light.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   5. The comparable relevance of the prior bad act to the proper and forbidden inferences.

In its Rule 404(b) notice, the State identified motive, intent, and lack of mistake or accident as the purposes for its proffered evidence, but its focus during the Rule 404(b) hearing was on motive. It argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   In light of the fact that we don't have DNA and we don't have an eyewitness and we don't have some of those other things that we use oftentimes to prove crimes, it's a credibility contest.

I'm not attracted to young individuals.\" And so this type of evidence goes to support that somebody who - and I'm going to quote from\n   <em>\n    Elliott v. State\n   </em>\n   and then\n   <em>\n    Wease v.

Evidence of motive would be such information. One who is a paraphiliac, whose preference or addiction for unusual sexual practices occurs in the form of pedophilia, could well be recognized as having a motive to commit the acts complained of by the victim. The fact finder could infer from the acts complained of by the older sister that Elliott was so motivated. Such information would be helpful to any professional in determining whether Elliott,\" the defendant, \"was so afflicted.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   So in that case the prior bad act was admissible for the purpose of proving motive that this type of incest involves aberrant sexual behavior. It's a type of sexual deviancy that is difficult to understand. Therefore, our trier of fact might wonder what would motivate the accused to behave in such a bizarre manner. The evidence of prior sexual acts was then probative under motive because of unusual sexual behavior involved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   That's what we have here. We have unusual sexual behavior involved. We have\n   three out of the four victims being family members, and young girls at that. And a jury is going to have a hard time wrapping their mind around that. And this 404(b) evidence speaks to his motive. Especially with respect to the videos and the photos. It's his manipulation of those girls at Joy Junction and his fixation on them that could be seen maybe by somebody like you as girls just shimmying down the table, but it's at his direction that they're asked not to use their hand[s] and thrust forwards towards him. That's his fixation on unusual conduct for a prurient reason. And the jury would be able to take that evidence and see that as his motive, sexual deviancy, his attraction to young individuals as helping them resolve the ultimate issue in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   [\u00b629] In response, and in applying the required factors to the photos and videos, the district court made the following observations:\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The Court is required to follow the mandatory procedure for testing the admissibility. The evidence must be offered for a proper purpose. The State argues that it is intent and motive and those are proper purposes. The evidence must be relevant, and under 401, evidence having tendency to make the existence of any fact more probable or less probable is relevant. It's a very low hurdle, if you will. I find that this evidence is relevant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   The next element is, \"The probative value of the evidence is not [to] be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice.\" And that's really the issue here, and they've given some additional questions and guidance to apply that, and I'll be talking about that in a moment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Then, finally, \"Upon request, the trial court instructs the jury that the similar acts evidence is to be considered only for the proper purpose,\" such as a limiting instruction is appropriate. And I certainly, if I allow this evidence in, I would allow the defense to offer a limiting instruction and would give a limiting instruction in some fashion. And we'll get to that if we need to at a later time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Further, \"The record must reflect that the trial court required the State not only to identify the proper purpose for which uncharged misconduct evidence is being offered, but also to explain how or why it is probative, and why it is more probative than prejudicial,\" and \"In determining the probative value,\" \"the trial court should consider the following factors: ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   * * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   ... \"Is the evidence unnecessarily cumulative?\" And here's where I try - and I don't know that I did it very well - to articulate, particularly with respect to the videos and the photographs, clearly, they're cumulative in the context of there are several of them. But that's what makes the probative value. So they are not unnecessarily cumulative. They are necessarily cumulative, because one of these in and of itself is sort of pretty meaningless. But the collective value of them is what makes them probative. So I don't think this - with respect to the videos and photographs, that they are unnecessarily cumulative. In fact, I specifically find that they are necessarily cumulative.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   And finally, \"How much time has lapsed between the charged crime and the prior bad act?\" And, here again, we have a significant distinction between the videos and the photos. They were relatively recent in time. And I don't recall specifically - I imagine the foundation of delay as to when they were taken, but they were relatively recent in time. But that is complicated because the allegations in this case are quite remote in time. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [The] Supreme Court has further articulated with respect to the balancing probative versus prejudice, there are additional factors that should be weighed or addressed. And one is the reprehensive nature of the prior bad act, the more reprehensible the act, the more likely the jury will be tempted to punish the defendant for the prior act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Taking pictures of young girls in a public setting is not reprehensible. I don't find that that is - I find that favorable for the State. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Two, the sympathetic character of the alleged victim of the prior bad act. Again, the jury will be tempted to punish the defendant for the prior act if the victim was especially vulnerable. Here the photographs, to the extent that they are victims, they are vulnerable. The fact that many of these videos were taken at our community's [ ] and swimming pool jumps out at me. Being a member of this community, my children played at that pool, my children played at the [ ], and to think that they were being photographed and viewed in this way is alarming. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   I think that when children are victims, even now children [who] are grown adults, and certainly the children in the videos and photographs, they are sympathetic. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   The next factor is the similarity between the charged crime and the prior act. The more similar the acts, the greater is the likelihood that the jury will draw the improper inference, that if the defendant did it once he probably did it again. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   With respect to that, taking pictures of young girls at the [ ] and the swimming pool or other public areas is substantially different than acting on and physically molesting a family member. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   The comparative enormity of the charged crime versus the video and the photographs I think is just the opposite of what the concern is here. Taking pictures of young girls in and of itself is not nearly as bad as molesting young family members. ... So I don't think this is sort of trying to use a sex offense for [a] jaywalking charge and that the sex offense is so much outweighed by the actual charge of jaywalking that it shouldn't come in. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The next factor is the comparative relevance of the prior bad act with proper and forbidden inferences. Evidence of the prior bad act may be much more probative of bad character than it is with legitimate inference permitted by 404(b). This factor, I think, plays right on point of the struggle that the Court is facing. One innocent picture of a child in a swimming suit is one thing. A collection of them is another thing. And it is really this - I can't think of a better word than what came to my mind in chambers when I looked at this. This is creepy. This is just creepy. And in that context, it's more character than it is probative on the allegations made of physical offense that happened many years ago. And I liken this to the assessment of having possession of child pornography of something that has been generated far afield and is viewed through some kind of electrons that flow through a wire to me is a different kind of crime than having a studio in which you are taking pornographic pictures of children.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   People disagree with me, and I appreciate that. Seems like there's a physical line that's crossed. And that kind of fits this. The taking [of] children's picture in a public setting really is not that relevant to acting on and physically molesting your granddaughters. So it is kind of this - just kind of creepiness about it to have this collection of pictures. But it's kind of different than actually acting on, and the allegations are that he molested his grandchildren. I'm having a hard time articulating, but this factor is one that I focus on. And I think with respect to the pictures and video, it is - it's more favorable for the exclusion of the evidence ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   And, finally, whether the prior act resulted in a conviction. The jury may be tempted to punish the defendant if they believe he escaped punishment from the prior bad act. Clearly, this evidence, all of it did not result in a conviction. I don't even know if it's illegal. I mean, prior acts or subsequent acts don't have to be criminal acts of conduct. So it doesn't have to result in a conviction. And taking a picture of somebody in a public setting, a little girl in a public setting [that] happens to be a provocative way by just the nature of catching that photograph at the certain time. I don't know that it's illegal. So I wouldn't expect a conviction to come from that. So I think that factor with respect to the photos and videos is favorable for the inclusion of the evidence. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-113\">\n   So, ultimately, the Court really has to go back to the definition of 403, and that is, taking all these considerations, the probative value must not be substantially outweighed by its potential for unfair prejudice, substantial[ly] outweigh and unfairness. And in the Court's discretion, after considering all of this and contemplating extensively, finds that this evidence is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice and it is admissible. So I am allowing the evidence to be admitted, including the photographs, the videos, and the allegations made by the daughter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Review of District Court Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   [\u00b630] The district court's written order, which summarized its oral findings and conclusions, stated that the photos and videos were admissible for the purposes of showing motive and intent.

He contends that this makes them irrelevant to the question of motive because motive must precede a criminal act.

In so arguing, Mr. Mayhew points to the prosecutor's statement that \"[t]his is a man with a sexual affliction for the young. Those were his trophies to view at his pleasure, for his pleasure, over and over and over again.\" We disagree that this reflects a purely character argument divorced from motive. While it was perhaps not as artfully or clearly put as it could have been, the prosecutor was arguing\n   Mr. Mayhew's sexual preference for children, which was his alleged motive for the charged conduct. Additionally, this was not the sole statement concerning Mr. Mayhew's motive. The prosecutor also argued, \"This is a man who is - the defendant is a man who is sexually motivated by the prepubescent, a man with a sexual affliction for the young,\" and \"I'm willing to bet that most of us in this room don't have 900 printed photos of our own children, let alone somebody else's, in a shoe box. This is a man with a sexual affliction for the young.\" Thus, while the prosecutor could have articulated the motive connection more clearly, we are unable to find that the argument deviated from the proper use for which the photos and videos were admitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   [\u00b644] Finally, Mr. Mayhew suggests that the limiting instruction the district court gave the jury concerning the other acts evidence was inadequate because it referenced only prior acts, not acts subsequent to the charged crimes. While Mr. Mayhew offered his own limiting instruction, which was refused by the district court, he offered no objection to the limiting instruction the court did give.

And a number of statements relating to the vibrator existed, and I gather its availability for inspection was there as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-181\">\n   I then asked [defense counsel] any specific prejudice beyond just a failure to list it. And, essentially, she said, well, why do we have the requirement to disclose it to begin with if it's not going to be followed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   I then looked at the pretrial memo, and, indeed, it had not been included specifically. However, based on the Court's discretion, I didn't find that there was significant prejudice to the defendant and there was clear knowledge of its existence and its involvement in this case. So I allowed it in over the defendant's objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-183\">\n   Then when it was offered, at the time it was offered, defendant, again, objected based on the same basis, and I overruled that. So that's the record.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   [Defense Counsel], anything else you'd like to make of record on that issue?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-185\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-186\">\n   Just in respect to that specific witness. Because of those objections, I feel I missed a foundation objection. So before it's presented, if it's presented to further witnesses from here on out, I would like some foundation established in regard to that and not just presenting it. So, I guess, that's just a heads-up to the State, because I would be objecting at that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-187\">\n   The other portion that I just want for the record is that this is indicated in another report as being something that was manufactured in 2004, which is outside the dates of the alleged offense, which is probably\n   why I didn't anticipate it really being an error, but I can save that for cross-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-188\">\n   THE COURT: [Prosecutor]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, I think foundation was laid. The victim was testifying that the defendant made her use a vibrator on herself. And I approached and showed it to her and she said, yeah, that's it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   I don't know what other foundation is required. She's looking at it. It's not like a 5-year-old child is going to have serial numbers memorized from a vibrator. She looks at it, she sees it, that's it. So I think there is sufficient foundation. It's been admitted into evidence, and so it can't be unadmitted now.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   THE COURT: Do you expect to call an officer or somebody to say, yeah, we seized this, and here's the chain of custody and this is how it came about?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-192\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   THE COURT: Frankly, when I asked [defense counsel] any other basis, I was contemplating a foundation basis, but that wasn't what was articulated, so it was admitted. So I think it's been waived. But I do think it's kind of sitting out there right now without a whole lot of explanation of how it got to the courtroom today, where it was found and those sorts of things.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Right. And that's my job to do that with another witness when the time is appropriate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   THE COURT: Based on that linking up of that, the objection is overruled. I mean, I think it's waived. You have to be specific in your basis of your objection for me to rule on them, and that wasn't any more specific, so -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: With respect to foundation, the victims are not going to have personal knowledge as to the chain of events for it to be. Seized; so foundationally, is this the vibrator that he used?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   THE COURT: I understand. And that would be a different assessment if the objection was foundation and you approached the bench and said, oh, I've got witness A, B, and C that are going to link this all up, which is essentially what you're telling me now. But it's been admitted. So I do still anticipate the State linking that up to some extent, irrespective of having been admitted or not because it flushes out the case, but I anticipate you doing that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   Based on that, the objection by the defendant and this new objection, foundation, is overruled. And 31 is admitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: And I also just want to state for the record, Your Honor, that defense counsel went to the police department on December 19th, met with Sergeant Keller, examined for herself all of the evidence, it was all opened for her. She had an opportunity to view it long before even the State did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   THE COURT: All right. That's the record with respect to Exhibit 31.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   [\u00b649] Through the testimony of Sergeant Daniel Keller of the Sheridan police department, the State established the chain of custody as the district court requested. Defense counsel then cross-examined Sergeant Keller concerning the vibrator's date of manufacture and established that a manufacturer representative told him the vibrator was manufactured in 2004. In closing argument, defense counsel then argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-202\">\n   And you did hear from Sergeant Keller, and specifically you heard that he followed up with the manufacturer of the vibrator that was introduced into evidence. And what he testified about in regard to that is when calling the manufacturer, he found out the manufacturing date, and that manufacturing date was June of 2004. Outside all of the dates that are presented to you in the elements instructions that are in your packet.

Accordingly, review for plain error is the only review available to Mr. Young.

Accordingly, we question whether the appellant's claim is properly considered for the first time on appeal. We are reluctant to decide the case on this basis, however, because the issue was not raised or briefed by the parties.

The Court held it was error to admit the photos.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-226\">\n    Finally, the nude photos of the victim and his brother were not relevant or probative to show the appellant's motive for assaulting the victim. At the hearing, the State claimed the photos were relevant and probative to show the appellant had a \"fetish with anal sex.\" On appeal, the State argued that the photos show that the appellant was sexually attracted to children-more specifically his child. Unfortunately, neither party designated the photos as part of the record on appeal, which makes it much more difficult to determine whether these photos are more sinister than innocent family photos. The district court found that:\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n    These images show the children taking baths or potty training. Other images, however, are more disturbing. Many of the offered images show E.A.M. and L.A.W. playing outdoors in the mud while nude, with mud smeared on the children's body and genitalia. Others show [the appellant] sitting in the bathtub with L.A.W. on his lap. At least three of the images focus on the children's genitals or buttocks.

Perhaps if the photos depicted the victim engaging in some sort of inappropriate behavior dealing with the buttocks area or showed the appellant engaging in some sort of sexually suggestive activity with the victim, we would find a different result. But the fact that even the district court leaves open the possibility that these photos may be innocent in nature demonstrates that an insinuation to the contrary would be more unfairly prejudicial to the appellant than what very minimal (if any) probative value the photos may have\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-229\">\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 28,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6980474\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/286/97/\">\n     286 P.3d at 110-11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-230\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Mersereau\n    </em>\n    , the photos in the defendant's possession were of his own children, which is not as unusual as a large collection of photos of children unrelated to the accused.
