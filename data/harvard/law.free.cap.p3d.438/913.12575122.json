Haik (Haik) and Pearl Raty (Raty). Raty filed various counterclaims seeking to compel SLC to supply water to her lot in the Albion Basin Subdivision in Little Cottonwood Canyon. Haik and Raty appeal the district court's grant of partial summary judgment to SLC and the District on their declaratory judgment claim. Raty appeals the district court's dismissal of her counterclaims. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 This appeal involves two sets of claims: (1) those asserted by SLC and the District seeking a declaratory judgment of Haik's and Raty's claimed water rights, and (2) those asserted by Raty seeking to compel SLC to provide water to her undeveloped lot. We discuss separately the relevant facts of each set of claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Haik's and Raty's Water Rights\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 Haik and Raty claim water rights to Little Cottonwood Creek (the Creek), and seek to divert that water to their lots in the Albion Basin Subdivision. Their claimed rights are portions of an award made to the South Despain Ditch (the Ditch) in the Morse Decree of 1910. That award was a first primary right to a flow of .25 cubic feet per second (the Original Water Right).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 In 1934, the Ditch signed an agreement (the 1934 Agreement) that granted SLC the right to use most of the Original Water Right \"during the winter or non-irrigation season from October 1 to April 1 of the following year.\" During that \"non-irrigation\" period, the Ditch had only the right to 7,500 gallons per day, which was to be diverted from the Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 The Ditch was originally used by four separate Despain families. In 1950, one of those families sold its property, and the purchaser\n   claimed a one-fourth interest in the Original Water Right. The state engineer approved a change application, which authorized the purchaser to move the point of diversion from the Creek to a well on his property and to use the water to support three houses, livestock, and irrigation. After the purchaser filed a proof map and proof of permanent change, the state engineer certified the change application and designated the purchaser's water right as WRN 57-7800.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 In 1978, the property with WRN 57-7800's point of diversion (the well) and place of use was subdivided into four lots. In 2000, the state engineer's records showed that the owner of one of those lots (Lot 31) owned 100 percent of WRN 57-7800. At that time, the state engineer approved a change application filed by Lot 31's owner, authorizing returning the point of diversion to the Creek. The approved change application specified that it was \"subject to the conditions and provisions of\" the 1934 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 In 2003, WRN 57-7800's owner conveyed it by quitclaim deed to six separate parties, in equal interests, as tenants in common. Haik was one of those six parties; Raty acquired her interest later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   WRN 57-7800 was divided into six new water right numbers, representing the six parties' relative interests. Each of the parties filed change applications with the state engineer, requesting to divert water from the Creek to their respective Albion Basin lots for year-round domestic use. The state engineer approved two of those change applications, but did not approve or deny Haik's or Raty's applications, which remain pending.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 SLC and the District filed this action seeking judicial review of the state engineer's decision on the two approved change applications. Additionally, they filed a cause of action seeking a declaratory judgment of the validity, nature, and priority of the water rights claimed by the two approved change application holders as well as the rights claimed by Haik and Raty. SLC and the District eventually reached a settlement agreement with the holders of the two approved change applications, in which SLC acquired the water rights of those two parties. As a result, all claims were dismissed except the claim seeking a declaratory judgment of Haik's and Raty's claimed water rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 In the petition, SLC and the District alleged they had standing to bring their claim: SLC \"owns a majority of the rights\" to use the Creek's water, including its rights acquired from the Ditch in the 1934 Agreement. The petition also alleged that the water drawn under SLC's rights is treated in the District's water treatment plant, and the District sells that water to its member cities. It estimated that approximately 500,000 Salt Lake County residents depend on the District for a portion of their water. Further, the District had submitted an application to appropriate \"50,000 acre-feet of high flow\" water from the Creek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 SLC and the District asserted that Haik's and Raty's proposed use of their claimed water rights would \"impair and interfere with [SLC's and the District's] respective rights to divert, treat and provide [the Creek's] water to the members of the public.\" They also said that, if the owner of WRN 57-7800 were to change the point of diversion from the well on Lot 31 to the Creek-as authorized by an approved change application-the water available to Creek water right holders, including SLC and the District, would diminish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Haik and Raty filed a motion to dismiss SLC and the District's claim for lack of standing. They asserted that the petition did not allege an injury or a reasonable probability of future injury, as required to invoke the court's jurisdiction. The court denied the motion to dismiss, concluding that SLC and the District \"have standing to assert [their claim] based on overlapping interests in a common source [of water], [the Creek].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 After discovery, SLC filed a motion for partial summary judgment. In that motion, it asked for a declaratory judgment that Haik's and Raty's claimed water rights to the Creek were limited by the 1934 Agreement. That is, during the \"winter or non-irrigation months,\" Haik and Raty were each entitled to no more than their appropriate portion of the 7,500 gallons reserved by the Ditch in the 1934 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 The district court granted SLC's motion for partial summary judgment. It concluded that, because the 1934 Agreement was \"admitted and unambiguous,\" \"any rights owned by [Haik or Raty] are limited\" by the 1934 Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b614 SLC and the District filed another motion for partial summary judgment, claiming that any portion of WRN 57-7800 Haik and Raty acquired had been forfeited as the result of seven consecutive years of nonuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 73-1-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a) (LexisNexis 2012). In support, they asserted that Haik and Raty produced no evidence of having used any portion of WRN 57-7800 from 2003, when they obtained their claimed rights, through January 2014, shortly before SLC and the District filed their claim. Further, \"there has been no opportunity for [Haik and Raty] to use WRN 57-7800, as they have no interest in Lot 31[,] ... its current point of diversion.\" And although Haik and Raty offered evidence that others had used the water, they never entered an agreement with any other person or entity to allow that use, as the forfeiture statute requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-1-4(2)(e)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b615 Haik and Raty opposed the motion for partial summary judgment. They argued that their water rights had been put to beneficial use and in support presented records and testimony that showed WRN 57-7800's water allowance had been diverted to the Ditch, and that others, including successors of the Original Water Right, had used substantially all of the diverted water. They also argued that the motion did not legally establish forfeiture because it did not address the volume, materiality, or substantiality of any nonuse, but instead merely alleged there had been no use at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b616 The district court granted SLC and the District's motion for partial summary judgment, declaring \"that any portion of WRN 57-7800 acquired by [Haik and Raty] has been forfeited by nonuse.\" The court determined that SLC and the District \"submitted straightforward facts, that ... [n]o use has been made by anyone of WRN 57-7800 as it existed in Lot 31 since 2003, and no nonuse application has been filed.\" It noted that Haik and Raty did not own an interest in Lot 31 that would have allowed them to use WRN 57-7800's point of diversion. And although an approved change application authorized the owners of WRN 57-7800 to change the point of diversion from the well on Lot 31 to the Creek, Haik and Raty never attempted to certify that change.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b617 The court also considered Haik's and Raty's proposed evidence of beneficial use. It noted the evidence tended to show that water had been diverted to the Ditch, and that others, including successors to the Original Water Right, used the water. But the court concluded, \"[D]iversion does not equal use, and does not support an inference of use.\" And absent a lease or agreement with Haik or Raty, the fact that others used the water was legally insufficient. (Citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 73-1-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(e)(i).) The court explained that the Original Water Right is no longer a communal water right, and WRN 57-7800 is a separate right, representing a one-fourth interest of the Original Water Right. Because the relevant water right is WRN 57-7800, not the Original Water Right, the court concluded that use by the Ditch's successors was also insufficient. In the end, the court concluded that \"any rights received under the 2003 transfer ... were lost after 7 years of undisputed non-use.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Raty's Counterclaims\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b618 Raty filed various counterclaims against SLC attempting to compel SLC to\n   provide water to her lot in the Albion Basin Subdivision. Raty's lot is outside SLC's corporate boundaries, but the Albion Basin Subdivision is inside the city's approved service area. Specifically, SLC holds an approved change application authorizing it to divert water to the Albion Basin Subdivision for the domestic requirements of thirty-five houses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b619 First, Raty argued she was entitled to receive water from SLC under Article XI, Section 6 of the Utah Constitution, which requires municipalities to preserve, maintain, and operate the water it owns or controls \"for supplying its inhabitants with water at reasonable charges.\" Utah Const. art. XI, \u00a7 6. Second, she argued she was entitled to protections from SLC's refusal to supply her lot with water under the due process clause of the Utah Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. I, \u00a7 7. Third, she argued that, in refusing to supply her lot with water, SLC was in violation of the uniform operation of laws provision of the Utah Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. I, \u00a7 24. Fourth, Raty sought a declaration that SLC's provision of water outside of its city limits was subject to regulation by the Public Service Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b620 SLC and the District moved to dismiss Raty's counterclaims, asserting each failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The district court agreed and dismissed Raty's counterclaims. It determined that Raty failed to allege she was entitled to water from SLC under Article XI, Section 6 because her lot was outside Salt Lake City's corporate boundaries and she was therefore not an \"inhabitant\" of Salt Lake City as required to receive protection under that provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b621 The court also determined that Raty failed \"to allege a violation of uniform treatment of laws\" because she did not identify \"any similarly situated person ... that had been treated differently\" and she did not allege \"personal animus or bias\" against her. Further, SLC's decision \"to curtail further development in Albion Basin in order to protect the watershed\" was \"unquestionably a legitimate interest of the city.\" The court determined Raty's due process claim failed \"for lack of a protectable property interest\" because she \"does not have a resident's right to water service.\" And the court refused to declare that SLC was subject to public regulation as a utility, citing multiple opinions of the Utah Supreme Court that rejected such a theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b622 The district court entered a final judgment reflecting its rulings on SLC and the District's motions for partial summary judgment and Raty's counterclaims. Haik and Raty appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b623 First, Haik and Raty argue that SLC and the District lacked standing to bring their claim. \"[W]hether a given individual or association has standing to request a particular form of relief is primarily a question of law, although there may be factual findings that bear on the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington County Water Conservancy Dist. v.

The court based that conclusion on \"straightforward facts\" submitted by SLC and the District that showed a complete lack of use during that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \u00b646 After reviewing Haik's and Raty's arguments, we conclude they have failed to show that the district court erred in making that determination. As the district court noted, Haik and Raty offer no evidence of having used the water associated with WRN 57-7800 since 2003. What they rely on is evidence establishing that water was diverted to the Ditch, and testimony that the diverted water was used by others, including parties with interests in the Original Water Right. They assert that those diversion records \"absolutely establish that water was delivered,\" and that WRN 57-7800 has been used \"to the present day by users and owners of the [Original Water Right].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b647 But this evidence is legally insufficient to show that Haik and Raty put their individual portions of WRN 57-7800 to beneficial use. The forfeiture statute states that a water right is subject to forfeiture when the unused water is \"permitted to run to waste\" or \"beneficially used by others without right with the knowledge of the water right holder.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-1-4(2)(d)(i)-(ii). Use by others will save a water right holder from forfeiture only when such use is \"according to a lease or other agreement with the appropriator or the appropriator's successor in interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 73-1-4(2)(e)(i). Because Haik and Raty offer no evidence of a lease or agreement\n   under which any third party has used their portions of WRN 57-7800 since 2003, their evidence of use fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b648 This is true regardless of whether successors to the Original Water Right have used the water that represents WRN 57-7800. As the district court noted, the Original Water Right is no longer a communal right. One of the four original Despain families sold the property, and the purchaser claimed a one-fourth interest, which became WRN 57-7800. SLC and the District's claim is directed at Haik's and Raty's portions of WRN 57-7800, not the Original Water Right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b649 In sum, we conclude that Haik and Raty have failed to show that the district court's ruling on beneficial use was in error. We agree with the court's conclusion that Haik and Raty \"offer no evidence of having used the water associated with WRN 57-7800 since\" 2003, the time they claim to have acquired their respective portions of that right. Further, they offer no evidence of having entered a lease or other agreement authorizing any third party to use their water rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   B. Analysis of Volume, Materiality, or Substantiality\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   \u00b650 Haik and Raty argue the district court erred by failing to analyze the volume, materiality, or substantiality of their nonuse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delta Canal Co. v.

But as the district court noted in its ruling, there was \"no need for quantitative analysis\" because the evidence showed a complete absence of use during the statutory period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b651 In the context of forfeiture, \"beneficial use has two different components: the type of use and the amount of use.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22 (quotation simplified). As to the amount of use, \"[f]orfeiture occurs when an appropriator fails to use\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   amounts of a water allowance\" during the statutory period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 (emphasis added). That is, because \"[a] water right is maintained only to the extent it is used efficiently and for a proper purpose,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45, \"a water right may be forfeited either in whole or in part,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b652 The\n   <em>\n    Delta Canal\n   </em>\n   opinion, upon which Haik and Raty rely, provides guidance on the proper analysis in the context of partial forfeiture claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 39-41. Haik and Raty rely on two principles from\n   <em>\n    Delta Canal\n   </em>\n   , neither of which apply here. The first principle is that courts should focus on whether \"an appropriator has failed to use material amounts of its volume allowance,\" as opposed to its \"flow allowance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. Second, \"to deter forfeiture claims premised on de minimis non-use,\" courts should focus on the \"materiality\" or \"substantiality\" of any nonuse.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b653 But, as SLC and the District note, those principles presuppose that the water right holder has put the water to some amount of use. Contrary to Haik's and Raty's assertions, the district court did not \"repudiate\" the analysis described in\n   <em>\n    Delta Canal\n   </em>\n   . Instead, it correctly determined that the analysis \"is simple\" in this case because there was no evidence of any beneficial use. That is, if there is no use, \"there is no need for quantitative analysis\" of the extent of that use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b654 We agree with the district court. A quantitative analysis of volume and materiality is necessary only when there is some evidence of beneficial use. Here, there is none.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   C. Statute of Limitations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b655 Haik and Raty argue the district court erred in determining that SLC and the District's forfeiture claim was not barred by\n   the statute of limitations in Utah Code section 73-1-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b656 Under Utah Code section 73-1-4, a \"water right may not be forfeited unless a judicial action to declare the right forfeited is commenced ... within 15 years from the end of the latest period of nonuse of at least seven years.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2073-1-4\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 73-1-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(c)(i) (LexisNexis 2012).
