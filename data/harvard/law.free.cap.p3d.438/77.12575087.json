We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 Perea, a member of the Ogden Trece gang, was visiting an Ogden home with several friends, including other Trece gang members. He got into a heated argument with members of the rival Norte\u00f1os gang who were attending a wedding reception at a house across the street. Perea and his friends then got into a vehicle. As the vehicle pulled away, Perea, in the front passenger seat, climbed out the window, reached over the roof, and fired ten shots into the wedding crowd. Two people were killed, and others were injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 A few days later, Perea confessed to police that he was the only person in the vehicle with a gun and that he fired the shots into the crowd. He also told police that he used a .22 caliber weapon, although the police had not disclosed that .22 was the caliber of gun used in the shooting. At trial, a witness (Witness), who had been standing on the walkway of the house where the wedding was held, testified that it was Perea who fired from the vehicle into the crowd. Passengers in the vehicle also testified that it was Perea who fired the shots. A jury convicted Perea on two counts each of aggravated murder and attempted murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the aggravated murder convictions and three years to life for the attempted murder convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Perea appealed his convictions. The Utah Supreme Court upheld them and noted \"the overwhelming evidence of Mr. Perea's guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Perea\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945379\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/624/\">\n    2013 UT 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 103,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6945379\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/322/624/\">\n    322 P.3d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court expressly upheld the admission of Perea's confession into evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96. Perea later filed a petition for postconviction relief, but the district court summarily dismissed it, determining that the Supreme Court, on direct appeal, had already adjudicated the claims raised in the petition. This court affirmed the district court's dismissal of that postconviction petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perea v.

She also stated that she felt \"the police were pressuring [her] to testify in a certain way\" at trial. Perea filed this postconviction factual innocence petition based on Witness's affidavit, contending that he was convicted on the strength of perjured testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 The State moved for summary judgment, arguing that Perea's \"pleaded facts and proffered evidence ... are insufficient as a matter of law to demonstrate that he is entitled to factual innocence post-conviction\n   relief.\" Determining that \"the evidence presented by [Perea] does not show that he did not engage in the conduct for which he was convicted,\" the district court granted the motion and dismissed Perea's petition. Perea appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Perea contends that the district court erred in summarily dismissing his factual innocence petition without holding an evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We review the district court's decision de novo.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gressman v.

After a petition is filed, the district court conducts an initial review, determining whether the allegations in the petition are \"merely relitigating facts, issues, or evidence presented in previous proceedings or presenting issues that appear frivolous or speculative on their face,\" and whether \"the petition has satisfied the requirements of Subsection 2(a)\" of the Factual Innocence Statute.

After the State has filed a response, \"the court shall order a hearing if it finds the petition meets the requirements of Subsections (2) and (3) and finds there is a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence regarding the charges of which the petitioner was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902597\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/338/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-9-402(9)(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b611 A bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence \"means that the newly discovered material evidence presented by the petitioner, if credible, would clearly establish the factual innocence of the petitioner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902597\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/338/266/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-9-401.5(1) (2012). \"Factual innocence\" means that the petitioner did not \"engage in the conduct for which [the petitioner] was convicted,\" \"engage in conduct relating to any lesser included offenses of the crime for which [the petitioner] was convicted,\" or \"commit any other felony arising out of or reasonably connected to the facts supporting the indictment or information upon which [the petitioner] was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-9-401.5(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b612 Here, the district court determined upon its initial review that Perea's petition included a potentially troubling averment from Witness, and therefore ordered a response from the State. The State moved for summary judgment, arguing that Perea's petition did not meet the statutory requirements of subsections (2) and (3) because the newly discovered evidence did not establish Perea's factual innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902597\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/338/266/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 78B-9-402(2)-(3) (Supp. 2018). The district court considered whether Perea's petition raised a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence and concluded that Witness's affidavit failed to demonstrate that Perea \"did not engage in the conduct for which he was convicted. At most, assuming the statements in the affidavit are credible, the affidavit merely demonstrates that [Witness] did not see who shot the gun. She does not indicate that [Perea] did not shoot the gun or identify somebody else as the shooter.\" For that reason, the court concluded that Witness's affidavit did not present a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b613 Perea contends that the district court erred because Witness's affidavit, \"combined with previously available information, clearly contradicts the State's claim that [Perea] fired the fatal bullets-or any bullets at all.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Section 402 directs the court to view the petitioner's averment of newly discovered evidence '\n   <em>\n    with all the other evidence\n   </em>\n   ' to determine whether the petitioner has met the threshold requirements for a hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256123\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/486/\">\n    2013 UT 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 46,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256123\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/486/\">\n    308 P.3d 486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original) (quoting Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 78B-9-402(2)(a)(v) ). For a petitioner to be entitled to a hearing, the newly discovered evidence must demonstrate factual innocence in light of all the other evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b614 Witness's affidavit, even when viewed in its most favorable light, does not demonstrate a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence. Even with Witness recanting, all other evidence still points to Perea firing the gun from the vehicle into the crowd-the conduct for which he was convicted. Witness states that she did not see Perea \"with the gun that evening\" and \"clearly did not see the face of the shooter in the vehicle.\" This does not contradict the State's evidence presented at trial that Perea was the one who fired the shots from the vehicle, including Perea's own confession and the testimony of other witnesses who were in the vehicle that Perea fired the gun from the vehicle. Because the newly discovered evidence does not meet section 402's statutory requirements, the district court did not err in dismissing Perea's petition without a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b615 Perea also contends that the district court erred in granting the State's motion for summary judgment. \"The court shall grant summary judgment if the moving party shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Utah R. Civ. P. 56(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   And we affirm a \"grant of summary judgment only if there are no disputed issues of material fact and, with the facts and all reasonable inferences viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Jensen ex rel.

Because Perea's petition did not demonstrate a bona fide and compelling issue of factual innocence, and consequently no genuine dispute of any\n   <em>\n    material\n   </em>\n   fact remained, the district court properly granted summary judgment to the State. We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in granting the State's motion for\n   summary judgment and dismissing Perea's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    Perea also contends that the district court erred in denying his petition because the police violated his constitutional rights by suppressing evidence in his favor.
