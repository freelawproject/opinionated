RCW 51.32.160 gives a worker the right to file an application to reopen a claim for aggravation of an industrial injury. Case law requires the worker to prove aggravation by presenting expert medical evidence of objective worsening of the injury since closure of the claim. If the Department of Labor and Industries (Department) denies the claim, the worker has the right to appeal, but review is limited to the administrative record. In 2011, the legislature amended chapter 51.36 RCW, \"Medical Aid,\" to establish a network of health care providers to treat injured workers. In addition to adopting rules to establish the health care provider network, the Department amended the WAC that governs reopening a claim for aggravation of an industrial injury, WAC 296-14-400. The amendment to WAC 296-14-400 mandates that only a\n   Department network provider can submit medical documentation in support of an application to reopen a claim to obtain benefits for aggravation of an industrial injury. We conclude the amendment to WAC 296-14-400 conflicts with the intent and purpose of the IIA; the amendment to chapter 51.36 RCW, Medical Aid; RCW 51.32.160 ; and long-standing case law and the right of a worker to prove aggravation of an industrial injury. We conclude the Department exceeded its statutory authority in promulgating the amendment to WAC 296-14-400 and the amendment is invalid. We reverse the declaratory judgment order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    Permanent Partial Disability Award\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 The facts are not in dispute. In 2007, Ronald V. Ma'ae worked as a journeyman carpenter for Safeway Services LLC. On January 19, Ma'ae suffered a back and shoulder injury. On February 5, 2007, the Department of Labor and Industries (Department) allowed the claim for industrial injury benefits under the Industrial Insurance Act (IIA), Title 51 RCW. On July 24, 2009, the Department closed the claim and awarded Ma'ae permanent partial disability benefits for \"right upper extremity impairment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    2011 Amendment to Chapter 51.36 RCW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b63 In 2011, the legislature amended the IIA, chapter 51.36 RCW, \"Medical Aid,\" to establish a health care provider network to treat injured workers. LAWS OF 2011, ch. 6, \u00a7 1. RCW 51.36.010(1) states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The legislature finds that high quality medical treatment and adherence to occupational health best practices can prevent disability and reduce loss of family income for workers, and lower labor and insurance costs for employers. Injured workers deserve high quality medical care in accordance with current health care best practices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b64 The legislature directed the Department to establish \"a health care provider network to treat injured workers\" and \"minimum standards for [network] providers who treat\n   workers.\" RCW 51.36.010(1). The legislature states the Department \"may adopt rules related to this section.\" RCW 51.36.010(10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 In addition to promulgating and amending chapter 296-20 WAC, \"Medical Aid Rules,\" and chapter 296-14 WAC, \"Industrial Insurance Rules,\" to establish a health care provider network to treat injured workers,\n   the Department amended the rule on \"Reopenings for Benefits,\" WAC 296-14-400. As amended, WAC 296-14-400 mandates that effective January 1, 2013, \"where the department has established a provider network,\" medical documentation in support of a reopening application shall only \"be completed by network providers.\" WASH.

At the direction of the Department, Ma'ae participated in independent medical examinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 On September 5, 2014, the Department denied the reopening application because Dr. Johnson was not a member of the medical provider network.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   After further review, we have learned that Dr. H.

The Department argued it was entitled to judgment as a matter of\n   law because Dr. Johnson was not a member of the Department's medical provider network. The Department asserted the amendment to WAC 296-14-400\"mandates that the documentation for reopening application 'must be completed by network providers.' \" In opposition, Ma'ae argued the amendment to WAC 296-14-400 exceeded the authority of the Department to promulgate rules under RCW 51.36.010. In reply, the Department argued the legislature gave it the authority to amend WAC 296-14-400 to require a worker to submit documentation in support of an application to reopen from only a network provider. The Department asserted the BIIA does not have the authority to review the validity of the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b614 On June 25, 2015, a Board of Industrial Insurance Appeals judge (IAJ) issued a proposed decision and order affirming the decision of the Department to deny the application to reopen.

Ma'ae asserted the amendment exceeded the authority of the Department to promulgate rules under RCW 51.36.010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b616 On October 20, 2016, the superior court entered an order and judgment.

Ma'ae asserts the amendment conflicts with the intent and purpose of the IIA; the amendment to chapter 51.36 RCW, Medical Aid; the statute on aggravation, RCW 51.32.160 ; long-standing case law; and the right to present evidence of aggravation on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b618 The Washington Administrative Procedure Act, chapter 34.05 RCW, governs judicial review of an administrative rule.

Neither the plain and unambiguous language of the IIA, chapter 51.36 RCW, and RCW 51.32.160 nor long-standing case law and the right to appeal supports the Department's assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b637 The 2011 amendment to the Medical Aid statute, chapter 51.36 RCW, does not address either the statute that governs reopening a claim for aggravation of an industrial injury or case law that requires the worker to present medical testimony to establish a causal relationship between the injury and subsequent disability based on some objective findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b638 A worker has the right to submit an application to reopen a claim to obtain benefits for aggravation of an injury. Case law establishes the worker has the burden of proving aggravation of an injury under RCW 51.32.160 by presenting objective medical findings. The amendment to the WAC rule on reopening impermissibly restricts the right of an injured worker to meet this burden\n   of proof. The WAC amendment limits medical evidence of aggravation to documentation from only doctors who are members of the Department's approved health care provider network.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b639 Contrary to the Department's argument, a medical examination and report submitted in support of reopening a claim is not \"treatment\" under RCW 51.36.010. The plain and unambiguous language of RCW 51.36.010(1) and (2)(a) address the intent to establish a network of health care providers in order to provide \"high quality\" medical treatment, providers who \"treat injured workers,\" and \"proper and necessary medical and surgical services\" in accord \"with current health care best practices.\" The Department defines \"proper and necessary\" medical services as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   [ (2) ](a) Reflective of accepted standards of good practice, within the scope of practice of the provider's license or certification;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (b) Curative or rehabilitative.

Curative treatment produces permanent changes, which eliminate or lessen the clinical effects of an accepted condition. Rehabilitative treatment allows an injured or ill worker to regain functional activity in the presence of an interfering accepted condition.

The amendment to WAC 296-14-400 conflicts with the right of a worker to submit an application to reopen for aggravation and meet the burden to present medical testimony to prove some objective worsening. The amendment impermissibly limits the right of an injured worker to submit an application to reopen for aggravation with medical documentation only from a Department network provider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b641 We conclude the Department exceeded its authority by amending WAC 296-14-400 to limit a worker to submit medical documentation from only a network doctor in support of an application to reopen a claim for aggravation\n   under the IIA.
