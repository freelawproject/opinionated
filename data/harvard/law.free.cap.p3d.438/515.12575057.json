The State also alleged that Stewart had committed securities fraud and that some of those crimes were part of his pattern of unlawful activity. Because the statute of limitations had run on a number of the alleged acts, Stewart moved to exclude them. Stewart argued that a pattern of unlawful activity cannot be based on crimes that the State could not separately charge because the statute of limitations had run. The district court agreed and granted Stewart's motion. The State seeks interlocutory review of that decision. This requires us to interpret the Pattern of Unlawful Activity Act, Utah Code sections 76-10-1601 to 1609. We conclude that the statute does not prevent the State from using evidence of acts on which the statute of limitations has expired to prove a pattern of unlawful activity. We reverse the district court's order and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 2 In 2013, the State charged Stewart with, among other things, thirteen counts of securities fraud or, in the alternative, thirteen counts of communications fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State also charged Stewart with one count of a pattern of unlawful activity.

These rulings undercut the State's prosecution because the State relied on the theory that some of the counts of securities fraud and communications fraud were continuing offenses. In response, the State filed an amended information to exclude several of the charges on which the statute of limitations had expired. The\n   amended information charged two counts of securities fraud, one count of sale of an unregistered security, one count of unlicensed investment advisor activity, and one count of a pattern of unlawful activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 3 The State indicated that it planned to call twelve of Stewart's investors to testify about the investments they made on Stewart's advice-investments they claim Stewart had defrauded them into making. In other words, the State intended to call witnesses to testify concerning the untimely charges of securities fraud that the State had voluntarily dismissed in response to\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   . The State represented that it planned to use the investor testimony to prove the pattern of unlawful activity charge. Stewart moved to exclude that testimony arguing that time-barred offenses cannot support a pattern of unlawful activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 4 The district court excluded the evidence. The district court explained, \"\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   clarifies that securities fraud is not a continuing offense, and a claim for pattern of unlawful activity must be predicated on acts that, themselves, would be chargeable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court quoted\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that \"if the actual communication falls outside the statute of limitations, the State cannot rely on the presence of a predicate scheme to extend the limitations period.\" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868974\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/690/\">\n    2015 UT 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868974\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/690/\">\n    349 P.3d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The district court concluded that \"[b]ecause the predicate acts relied on by the State regarding [the original victims] are outside the statute of limitations for a communications fraud claim, they may not be used to prove the pattern of unlawful activity charge.\" We granted the State's petition for interlocutory appeal to review that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUE AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 5 The State contends that the trial court erred by excluding evidence of predicate acts that were part of the alleged pattern of unlawful activity. The State's challenge requires us to interpret Utah's Pattern of Unlawful Activity Act.

The Act proscribes a principal of a pattern of unlawful activity from using or investing the income derived from the unlawful activities. UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-1603(1). It also penalizes the acquisition or maintenance of an interest in or control of any enterprise that undertakes a pattern of unlawful activity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6985851\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/267/863/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-10-1603(2).

The statute requires that \"[a]t least one of the episodes comprising a pattern of unlawful activity shall have occurred after July 31, 1981.

In other words, under the district court's interpretation, the State has to base the unlawful pattern upon crimes for which the statute of limitations has not run. Stewart urges us to accept this interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 11 The State contends that the trial court misinterpreted the Act's plain language.

It did not, and in the absence of an express statement, we are left to examine the\n   statute for the best textual indications of what the Legislature intended. The State argues that the best interpretation of the statute is one that permits the pattern to include untimely criminal acts because the contrary interpretation-the one the district court adopted-renders the five-year lookback period meaningless. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 15 The lookback period requires that \"[t]he most recent act constituting part of a pattern ... occur[ ] within five years of the commission of the next preceding act alleged as part of the pattern.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-1602(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By its plain language, the lookback period requires that no more than five years separate the penultimate episode of unlawful activity from the most recent episode in the pattern. As noted above, the Act does not refer to the statute of limitations for the underlying crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 16 An examination of the definition of \"unlawful activity\" suggests that the Legislature intended that the lookback would serve as the only temporal consideration to establish a pattern of unlawful activity. Ninety crimes and categories of crimes, including both felonies and misdemeanors, fall within the definition of unlawful activity; each has its own statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6992507\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/234/1147/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 76-10-1602(4).

By way of example, imagine a prosecutor who relies on three instances of misdemeanor assault to establish a pattern of unlawful activity. If the statute required all three instances of assault to be not time barred, all three instances must occur within the two year statute of limitations for misdemeanor crimes. This interpretation renders the five-year lookback period meaningless.

The statute defines unlawful activity, in part, as conduct \"which would constitute any offense.\" UTAH CODE \u00a7 76-10-1602(4). Stewart argues that conduct which falls outside the limitations period is not chargeable and therefore cannot be deemed to be an offense. And Stewart finds some superficial support for that argument in our jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 19 In\n   <em>\n    State v. Crank\n   </em>\n   , we noted that a \"statute of limitations is not a mere limitation on penalty, but is a bar to prosecution.... The statute runs against the filing of [a] complaint or information; against the attempt\n   to prosecute.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8869952\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/105/332/\">\n    105 Utah 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8869952\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/utah/105/332/\">\n    142 P.2d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (1943).

We ultimately held that a \"[d]efendant has a right to insist that a complaint or information in as far as it charges an offense barred by limitations be quashed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 193.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 20 The flaw in Stewart's argument is that although a statute of limitations\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   serve as a bar to prosecution, it does not negate the illegality of conduct. In other words, a criminal act does not cease to be an offense just because the State cannot properly charge the defendant with the crime. This becomes plain when we remember that a \"criminal statute of limitations is an affirmative defense that can be forfeited if not raised before or during trial.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Kay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868974\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/690/\">\n    2015 UT 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868974\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/690/\">\n    349 P.3d 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , to reach its conclusion. The court explained that\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   clarifies that communications fraud is not a continuing offense, and \"a claim for pattern of unlawful activity must be predicated on acts that, themselves, would be chargeable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that \" 'if the actual communication falls outside the statute of limitations, the State cannot rely on the presence of a predicate scheme to extend the limitations period.' \" (Quoting\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6868974\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/349/690/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18 ). The court concluded that \"[b]ecause the predicate acts relied on by the State ... are outside the statute of limitations for a communications fraud claim, they may not be used to prove the pattern of unlawful activity charge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 22\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   examined the question of whether or not communications fraud is considered a continuing offense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. We concluded that communications fraud is not a continuing offense, despite the State's argument that the language \" 'scheme or artifice' compels the conclusion that communications fraud is a continuing offense inasmuch as 'schemes continue as long as they are in operation.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. We acknowledged that \"[a]mple authority recognizes that an ongoing criminal design or scheme is not the same as a continuing offense[,]\" and \"[e]ach are specific terms of art....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. The district court relied on our conclusion that \"if the actual communication falls outside the statute of limitations, the State cannot rely on the presence of a predicate scheme to extend the limitations,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18, but this conclusion does not speak to the question of whether those communications could be used to prove an unlawful pattern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b6 23 The district court also relied on other language in\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   that suggested that the underlying instances of unlawful activity must be within the statute of limitations to form the basis of a pattern charge. After concluding that the charges for communications fraud were untimely, we noted that \"because the pattern of unlawful activity charge was predicated on the four [untimely] charges of communications fraud, the district court correctly dismissed all of the charges....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. Although this language supports the district court's interpretation, in\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   we were not squarely presented with the issue that the State presses here-whether or not a pattern of unlawful activity may be based on untimely acts. In\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   , the State did not argue that the pattern of unlawful activity charge could stand alone without the underlying communications fraud charges. Nor did the State argue that anything else could sustain a pattern of unlawful activity charge. And because we were not presented with the issue in\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   , the language the district court relied upon-which\n   comprises one sentence devoid of analysis-did not examine the statute or consider the arguments that the parties raise here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 24 More specifically, we did not address the five-year lookback period provision in\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   , nor did the parties advance an argument about its significance in interpreting the statute. Here, we are faced with a more specific problem. We are asked to decide, even if a pattern of unlawful activity charge is not a continuing offense, whether individual crimes that are outside of the relevant statute of limitations can form the basis of the charge. Here, the parties placed this argument squarely before us, and after considering conflicting interpretations, we conclude that the reading that gives meaning to the five-year lookback provision is the better reading. Accordingly, we disavow the sentence in\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   that could be read to prohibit the use of untimely predicate acts to establish a pattern of unlawful activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 25 We conclude that the best reading of the Pattern of Unlawful Activity Act permits the State to base a pattern of unlawful activity on crimes on which the statute of limitations has expired.
