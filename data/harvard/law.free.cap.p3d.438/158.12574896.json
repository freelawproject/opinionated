(GHO) appeal the summary dismissal of their complaint for a refund of business and occupation (B &amp; O) taxes paid on certain premiums they\n   received from or on behalf of their members for providing Medicare Advantage (MA) plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The premiums at issue are described in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-24(g) and consist of \"payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under [ 42 U.S.C.] section 1395w-23 [and] premiums paid to such organizations under [part C of Title 42, chapter 7, subchapter XVIII of the United States Code]\" (collectively MA premiums). We hold that although MA premiums are subject to B &amp; O tax under state law, federal law preempts the imposition of B &amp; O taxes on MA premiums. Therefore, we reverse and remand to the trial court to determine the refund amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 GHC and its wholly owned subsidiary, GHO (collectively Group Health), provide health care coverage to members in Washington and Idaho. Group Health's health care plans include MA health benefit plans, which Group Health has contracted with the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) to provide. CMS is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, a federal agency. In exchange for providing MA plans to eligible members, Group Health receives MA premiums from CMS and from Group Health members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 In 2012, GHO requested a determination from the Washington State Department of Revenue (Department) as to whether Washington State B &amp; O tax applies to MA premiums. The Department responded that B &amp; O tax does apply, and Group Health paid B &amp; O tax based on MA premiums recorded as income from 2010 through February 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In May 2016, Group Health filed this lawsuit for a refund of those B &amp; O tax payments. It then moved for\n   summary judgment, arguing that (1) MA premiums are exempt from B &amp; O tax under RCW 82.04.322 and (2) federal law preempts the Department's imposition of B &amp; O tax on MA premiums. The trial court disagreed with both arguments and denied Group Health's motion. Because no genuine issues of material fact remained in dispute, the court entered summary judgment in favor of the Department. Group Health appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Applicability of B &amp; O Taxes to MA Premiums\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 Group Health argues that the trial court erred by concluding that MA premiums are not exempt from B &amp; O taxes under RCW 82.04.322.

The only dispute is whether MA premiums are \"taxable\" under RCW 48.14.0201 and therefore exempt from B &amp; O tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The B &amp; O tax statutes do not define \"taxable.\" Thus, we may look to the dictionary to discern its plain meaning.\n   <em>\n    Nissen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793756\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/183/863/#p881\">\n    183 Wash.2d at 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=357%20P.3d%2045\">\n    357 P.3d 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The dictionary defines \"taxable\" as \"[s]ubject to taxation.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1688 (10th ed. 2014). For the following reasons, we conclude that MA premiums are not \"subject to taxation\" under RCW 48.14.0201 and therefore are not exempt from B &amp; O tax under RCW 82.04.322.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 First, MA premiums are expressly exempt from taxation under RCW 48.14.0201, which is the state premium tax statute. At all times relevant hereto, that statute has required each \"taxpayer\" to pay a tax equal to two percent of all health care premiums and prepayments received by the taxpayer. RCW 48.14.0201 (2) :\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   former RCW 48.14.0201(2) (2009). But that statute also has, at all relevant times, provided the following exemption:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (6) The taxes imposed in this section do not apply to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (a) Amounts received by any taxpayer from the United States or any instrumentality thereof as prepayments for health care services provided under Title XVIII (medicare) of the federal social security act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   RCW 48.14.0201 (6)(a). Group Health does not dispute that GHO and GHC are \"taxpayers\" for purposes of the premium tax\n   statute, nor does it dispute that MA premiums are expressly exempted from premium taxes under subsection 6(a) of that statute. Because MA premiums are expressly exempted from premium taxes, MA premiums are not subject to taxation under RCW 48.14.0201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b610 Second, federal law expressly prohibits the Department from imposing premium taxes on MA premiums. Specifically, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-24(g) provides: \"No State may impose a premium tax or similar tax with respect to payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under section 1395w-23 of this title or premiums paid to such organizations under this part.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the parties disagree about whether this statute prohibits the Department from imposing B &amp; O taxes on MA premiums, they agree that it expressly prohibits the Department from imposing a\n   <em>\n    premium tax\n   </em>\n   on MA premiums. Accordingly, even without the exemption expressly provided under RCW 48.14.0201 (6)(a), MA premiums are not subject to taxation under RCW 48.14.0201 as a result of federal preemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b611 In short, under the plain language of RCW 82.04.322, MA premiums are not \"taxable\" under RCW 48.14.0201 because they are not subject to taxation under that statute. Therefore, Group Health has not met its burden to establish that MA premiums are exempt from B &amp; O taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 Group Health argues that we should interpret \"taxable\" to mean \"capable of being taxed,\" rather than \"subject to taxation.\" It argues that this case is factually distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Crown Zellerbach Corp. v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2428074\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/45/749/\">\n    45 Wash.2d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20P.2d%20305\">\n    278 P.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1954), a B &amp; O tax case in which our Supreme Court looked to the dictionary to define \"taxable\" as \" 'subject to taxation'.\"\n   <em>\n    Crown Zellerbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2428074\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/45/749/\">\n    45 Wash.2d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20P.2d%20305\">\n    278 P.2d 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1706 (3d ed. 1933) ). But our construction of the term \"taxable\" does not depend on\n   <em>\n    Crown Zellerbach\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, even\n   <em>\n    Crown Zellerbach\n   </em>\n   's definition of \"taxable\" was not dependent on the facts of that\n   case-the Supreme Court simply looked to the dictionary, as we do here. Therefore, it\n   is irrelevant here that\n   <em>\n    Crown Zellerbach\n   </em>\n   may be distinguishable on its facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 Furthermore, even if we were to interpret \"taxable\" as \"capable of being taxed,\" Group Health's argument that MA premiums are \"taxable\" under RCW 48.14.0201 would still fail. MA premiums are neither \"subject to taxation\" nor \"capable of being taxed\" under RCW 48.14.0201 because, as discussed, federal law prohibits the imposition of premium taxes on MA premiums, and MA premiums are, under the premium tax statute itself, expressly exempt from premium tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 Group Health next observes that the exemption under RCW 82.04.322 for premiums taxable under the premium tax statute and the premium tax statute's express exemption for MA premiums were both enacted at the same time, as part of the Health Care Reform Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   LAWS OF 1993, ch. 492, \u00a7\u00a7 301 (\n   <em>\n    codified\n   </em>\n   at RCW 48.14.0201 ), 303 (\n   <em>\n    codified\n   </em>\n   at RCW 82.04.322 ). It then argues that the Department's position \"fails to explain\" why the legislature would exempt MA premiums from the premium tax just to make them subject to the B &amp; O tax. This argument is unpersuasive because Group Health bears the burden of establishing that an exemption applies.\n   <em>\n    Avnet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452128\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/44/#p49\">\n    187 Wash.2d at 49-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20P.3d%20571\">\n    384 P.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Group Health's argument attempts to shift that burden to the Department to explain why the legislature chose the language it did. Furthermore, and as the Department points out, Group Health's argument \"presumes the answer,\" i.e., that the legislature intended to exempt MA premiums from all taxes. But Group Health has pointed to no expression of a legislative intent to make MA premiums completely immune from taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 To that end, Group Health cites\n   <em>\n    Columbia Riverkeeper v. Port of Vancouver USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=188%20Wash.%202d%20421\">\n    188 Wash.2d 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=395%20P.3d%201031\">\n    395 P.3d 1031\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), and\n   <em>\n    Citizens Alliance for Property Rights Legal Fund v.

But\n   <em>\n    Columbia Riverkeeper\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Citizens Alliance\n   </em>\n   both involved the Open Public Meetings Act of 1971 (OPMA), which declares that its provisions are \"remedial and shall be liberally construed.\" RCW 42.30.910. The OPMA also contains an express statement of legislative intent that our Supreme Court has characterized as \"some of the strongest language used in any legislation.\"\n   <em>\n    Equitable Shipyards, Inc. v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1167753\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/93/465/#p482\">\n    93 Wash.2d 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=611%20P.2d%20396\">\n    611 P.2d 396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   RCW 42.30.010 (\"It is the intent of this chapter that ... actions [of public agencies] be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly.\"). Here, by contrast, Group Health points to no statement in the Health Care Reform Act or in the B &amp; O tax chapter reflecting a clear legislative intent to exempt MA premiums from B &amp; O taxes. The absence of any such statement is particularly notable given that it is well established that \"the legislative purpose behind the B &amp; O tax scheme is to tax virtually all business activity in the state.\"\n   <em>\n    Impecoven v. Dep't of Revenue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1368198\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/120/357/#p363\">\n    120 Wash.2d 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20P.2d%20752\">\n    841 P.2d 752\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Moreover, Group Health's argument ignores the most obvious explanation for the exemption provided in RCW 82.04.322 -to avoid double taxation of premiums. If not for RCW 82.04.322, premiums received by insurers would be subject to both the premium tax\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the B &amp; O tax. Therefore, contrary to Group Health's assertions, adopting the Department's proffered interpretation of RCW 82.04.322 does not lead to \"absurd results.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b617 Group Health next points out that in another B &amp; O tax exemption statute, the legislature used \"strikingly different language\" than it used in RCW 82.04.322. Specifically, RCW 82.04.320 provides: \"[B &amp; O tax] shall not apply to any person in respect to insurance business\n   <em>\n    upon which a tax based on gross premiums is paid to the state\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Group Health argues that because the legislature used the phrase \"upon which a tax based on gross premiums is paid to the state\" to describe the scope of the exemption in RCW 82.04.320, then the term \"taxable\" in\n   RCW 82.04.322 must mean something else. But the fact that \"taxable\" means something other than that taxes have been paid to the state does not help Group Health here. Specifically, the difference between the language used in RCW 82.04.320 and RCW 82.04.322 is that the exemption in RCW 82.04.320 apparently depends on whether premium taxes have\n   been\n   <em>\n    paid\n   </em>\n   , whereas the exemption in RCW 82.04.322 depends on whether premium taxes\n   <em>\n    can be assessed\n   </em>\n   under RCW 48.14.0201. And as discussed above, MA premiums are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   subject to assessment under RCW 48.14.0201. The difference in language between RCW 82.04.320 and RCW 82.04.322 is not determinative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 As a final matter, Group Health argues that legislative history supports its argument that the MA premiums are exempt from B &amp; O taxes. But \"[w]e need not utilize interpretive tools such as legislative history when statutory language is unambiguous.\"\n   <em>\n    Spokane County v. Dep't of Fish &amp; Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=192%20Wash.%202d%20453\">\n    192 Wash.2d 453\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 458,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12571731\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/430/655/\">\n    430 P.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018). RCW 82.04.322 is not ambiguous. As discussed, MA premiums are not exempt from B &amp; O taxes under a plain language reading of that statute.

We are not persuaded by the Department's argument that B &amp; O tax is not similar to a premium tax merely because B &amp; O tax applies to noninsurance businesses and because the state has chosen to administer the B &amp; O tax differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b624\n   <em>\n    Group Health Cooperative v.

Here, like the city in\n   <em>\n    Group Health Cooperative\n   </em>\n   , the Department does not dispute that\n   it is taxing premium revenue on a gross basis. These characteristics are dispositive here. Thus, like the city, the Department cannot escape federal preemption by characterizing the B &amp; O tax as \"dissimilar\" to a premium tax simply because it is applicable to noninsurance businesses and because the state has unilaterally decided to administer the B &amp; O tax differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b625 The Department argues that\n   <em>\n    Group Health Cooperative\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from this case because the language in the FEHB statute's preemption provision and the language in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-24(g)\"differ[ ] sharply.\" But CMS itself has observed that the scope of state tax preemption for MA premiums was intended to mirror the scope of state tax preemption for FEHB premium revenue.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C968\">\n    63 Fed.

More importantly, B &amp; O tax is, as discussed, \"similar\" to a premium tax under the plain language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-24(g). In other words, the outcome here is not dictated by\n   <em>\n    Group Health Cooperative\n   </em>\n   or the FEHB statute, but by a plain language reading of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-24(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b626 Additionally, CMS's own regulations confirm that B &amp; O tax is preempted under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395w-24(g). For example, B &amp; O taxes do not fit within the savings clause that CMS promulgated to clarify the scope of the prohibition on state taxation of MA premiums. That clause provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt any MA organization from taxes, fees, or other monetary assessments\n   <em>\n    related to the net income or profit that accrues to, or is realized by, the organization from business conducted under this part,\n   </em>\n   if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20422.404\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 422.404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added). In other words, to fit within the savings clause, a state tax must be assessed\n   based on net income or profit. But the Department does not dispute that B &amp; O tax is not assessed against net income or profit. Rather, it is assessed on a gross receipts basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avnet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12452128\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/187/44/#p49\">\n    187 Wash.2d at 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=384%20P.3d%20571\">\n    384 P.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, B &amp; O tax is not saved from federal preemption by the savings clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b627 The Department asserts that the savings clause is illustrative, not exclusive. It argues that \"merely because [CMS] clarified that net income taxes are not included within the preemption provision does not mean that broadly applicable gross receipts taxes are 'similar taxes' to premium taxes.\" But when CMS first published the interim final\n   version of the savings clause, it explained that the savings clause was intended to \"clarify the scope of what constitutes a\n   <em>\n    prohibited\n   </em>\n   premium tax.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20Fed.%20Reg.%2034%2C968\">\n    63 Fed.
