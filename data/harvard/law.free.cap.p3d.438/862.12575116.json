Jordan appeals, arguing that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance by, among other things, failing to take steps necessary to introduce impeachment evidence against one of his stepchildren, and failing to object to the prosecutor's closing argument regarding Jordan's possession of certain photographs. Jordan also asserts that the State's evidence was insufficient to support a conviction on four of the counts on which he was convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In addition, Jordan seeks a remand under rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure so that the trial court can make evidentiary findings in connection with his contention that his trial counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance. In his rule 23B motion, Jordan also advances the argument regarding counsel's failure to impeach one of his step-children, and additionally argues that his counsel should have presented evidence that one of his step-children also had access to the computer that contained images of child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 For the reasons that follow, we affirm twenty-one of Jordan's thirty-three convictions, but vacate his conviction on one count for lack of sufficient evidence. We also grant Jordan's rule 23B motion, at least in part, with regard to his other eleven convictions, and remand this case to the trial court for further proceedings on those counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b64 In 2008, a woman (Mother) moved to West Valley City with her three children. At that time, Mother's oldest son (Mark\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) was twelve, and her younger son (Luke) was six. Jordan lived in the same part of the city.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mark met Jordan in the neighborhood and later introduced him to Mother. Mother and Jordan married in 2010, and later had two children of their own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b65 According to Mark, Jordan began to sexually abuse him in 2008, soon after they met, and continued to do so periodically for the next five or six years. In 2014, when Mark was seventeen, Jordan showed him photographs of Jordan sexually abusing Luke. Mark later testified that, after seeing the photographs of his little brother, \"I was devastated. I was done. I'd had enough.\" Later that same year, Mark informed Jordan that he would be moving out of the house in September 2014, as soon as he turned eighteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b66 The day after Mark's birthday, police received an anonymous call requesting a \"welfare check\" at the family residence, where Jordan, Mother, and Luke were present. When a police officer arrived, Luke maintained that he was \"fine.\" The officer and Jordan then left the residence. Once the officer and Jordan were gone, Luke decided that it was \"the perfect time to tell [his] mom\" that \"everything's not okay\" and that Jordan had been sexually abusing him for over five years. After hearing this, Mother met briefly with police later that evening, and then took both Luke and Mark in for police interviews the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b67 After investigation, the State charged Jordan with thirty-three criminal counts, including four counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, first degree felonies; four counts of sodomy upon a child, first degree felonies; four counts of forcible sodomy, first degree felonies; sixteen counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, second degree felonies; one count of tampering with a witness, a third degree felony; and four counts of dealing harmful material to a minor child, third degree felonies. Six of these counts involve Jordan's actions toward Luke, and twenty involve Jordan's actions toward Mark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 The case proceeded to trial, and Mark and Luke each testified that Jordan sexually abused them for years. Each separately testified that the abuse included mutual masturbation, mutual oral sex, and anal sex, as well as Jordan showing them pornography and taking nude or partially-nude photographs of them. Luke also testified that, shortly before he disclosed the abuse to Mother, Jordan took him into Jordan's office, showed him a gun, and told Luke that if he ever told anyone, Jordan would shoot him and his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b69 Also during trial, the prosecution introduced into evidence various photographs obtained from Jordan's laptop. A forensic examiner described five photographs recovered from the laptop (marked as Exhibits 32-36) that depicted young nude males. Relatedly, during Mark's testimony, Mark also described nine additional photos recovered from the laptop (marked as Exhibits 23-31) that depicted Mark's naked body, including his genitals. Mark explained that Jordan took eight of the nine photos while Mark was still a minor, and that the ninth photograph was a selfie that Mark took of himself, while he was a minor, and then electronically sent to Jordan. Mark testified that Jordan would sometimes ask him to take photographs of himself while naked and send them to Jordan, and that Jordan told him that if he did not do so he would be \"in trouble.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b610 At a later point in the trial, the prosecutor also asked Mother about two more photographs discovered on Jordan's laptop (marked as Exhibits 21-22). Mother explained that Exhibit 21 was a photograph of one of their then-toddler sons sitting naked on a counter in a bathroom, and that Jordan could be seen in the mirror taking the photo. Mother explained that Exhibit 22 showed the same child naked while \"walking outside\" near a canal. Mother stated that she did not know who took that photograph.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 During trial, but outside the presence of the jury, Jordan argued that the State would need expert testimony to establish that the persons depicted in Exhibits 33-36 were indeed under eighteen years of age. The trial court disagreed, determining that \"the jurors can look to their life experience and to their judgment in reviewing [the] evidence.\" The court later determined that there was sufficient evidence to allow the\n   charges related to those four exhibits to go to the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 During closing, the State made specific arguments regarding Exhibits 21 and 22. Referring to Exhibit 21-the photograph of the naked toddler in the bathroom-the State asked the jury to \"review that photo in light of all of the evidence,\" and stated that, \"when you do that, you know that [Jordan] wasn't taking a picture of his son because he's cute, because he wants a picture of his kid in the bathroom. He was doing it because it's child pornography.\" Referring to Exhibit 22-the photograph of the naked toddler walking outside-the prosecutor acknowledged that \"under normal circumstances, you could say, hey, that's just a dad taking a picture of his kid when he's naked, not a big deal,\" but that under the circumstances of this case, \"there should be no doubt that the defendant took that picture because he wanted a picture of a naked little boy. Why? Because he's sexually attracted to boys.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 The jury convicted Jordan on all thirty-three counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   ISSUES AND STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b614 Jordan appeals his convictions, and in addition has moved for remand under rule 23B of the Utah Rules of Appellate Procedure. \"A remand under rule 23B is 'available only upon a nonspeculative allegation of facts, not fully appearing in the record on appeal, which, if true, could support a determination that counsel was ineffective.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

App. P. 23B(a) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b615 In his appeal, Jordan raises two types of arguments. First, he contends that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. \"When a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised for the first time on appeal, there is no lower court ruling to review and we must decide whether the defendant was deprived of the effective assistance of counsel as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Beckering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879699\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/346/672/\">\n    2015 UT App 53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6879699\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/346/672/\">\n    346 P.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b616 Second, he contends that the State failed to introduce sufficient evidence to convict him on certain counts. \"When we review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the evidence and all inferences that may reasonably be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict,\" and we \"vacate the conviction only when the evidence, so viewed, is sufficiently inconclusive or inherently improbable that reasonable minds must have entertained a reasonable doubt\" about the defendant's guilt.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

We then turn to the arguments he raises on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   I. Jordan's Rule 23B Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b618 Jordan raises three issues in his rule 23B motion, two of which we discuss here at length. First, Jordan asserts that \"[t]rial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate or timely pursue a motion under rule 412 of the Utah [R]ules of Evidence\" that would have allowed Jordan to more effectively cross-examine Luke. Second, Jordan asserts that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to show that Mark, in addition to Jordan himself, \"had full access to\" Jordan's laptop computer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We discuss these issues, in turn, after a discussion of rule 23B generally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b619 In all criminal cases, \"the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" U.S. Const. amend.

At the preliminary hearing, trial counsel attempted to ask Luke about prior allegations of sexual abuse, but the State objected because Jordan had not yet filed a rule 412 motion and had not yet shown that the evidence he wished to present met any exception to rule 412. The trial court sustained the objection. Later, at a pretrial conference, Jordan's attorney stated that she \"may be requesting a [ rule] 412 hearing\" if she could \"round up the witnesses,\" but no such motion was ever filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b629 In support of his argument that trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to pursue a rule 412 motion, Jordan attaches to his rule 23B motion a report from a West Valley City police officer. According to that document, \"it was reported that while [Luke] was at his [biological] father's house [he] witnessed his half brother and sister who are ten and twelve years old having intercourse. [Luke] was also coaxed into having intercourse with [his] half sister.\" Later in his report, the officer explained that he was contacted by a caseworker from the Department of Child and Family Services who informed the officer \"that [the caseworker] had gone out and obtained statements from all the children involved\" and that \"the older children were denying [that] anything happened.\" Additionally, the caseworker reported that the children's father, Mother's previous husband, \"denied that he was told anything by [Luke].\" The caseworker also informed the officer that \"[s]he also looked at this history with the family and found a previous case where [Luke] had not been honest and made similar allegations. That case was closed as unfounded.\" The officer concluded his report by noting that both he and the caseworker \"determined that the allegations were false and that it did not appear that [Luke] was being honest\" about the prior allegations. The officer reported that he met with Mother and explained to her that Luke was not being honest, and Mother \"appeared very concerned that her son was doing this for attention,\" and that she \"wanted her son to stop telling lies.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b630 These are striking allegations. In our view, if these allegations had been brought to the trial court's attention in a rule 412 motion, there is a reasonable probability it would have determined that the \"threshold showing\" of falsity was met (depending, of course, on what other evidence was presented). Counsel could then have sought to use this evidence at trial during cross-examination of Luke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b631 On these facts, we conclude that the requirements of rule 23B are met. The facts set forth in the police report are not \"already in the record,\" are \"not speculative,\" and \"could support a determination that counsel was ineffective.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20UT%2018\">\n    2015 UT 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 18-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575917\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/1166/\">\n    441 P.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In support of this request, Jordan makes broad (and largely unsupported) allegations that Mother, Luke, and Mark had all \"colluded to falsely make accusations of sexual abuse against [Mother's] previous husband.\" As noted, rule 23B motions must be supported by \"non-speculative\" facts.\n   <em>\n    Tirado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341027\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/926/\">\n    2017 UT App 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12341027\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/392/926/\">\n    392 P.3d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"In the context of rule 23B, speculative allegations are those that have little basis in articulable facts but instead rest on generalized assertions.\"\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20UT%2018\">\n    2015 UT 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12575917\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/441/1166/\">\n    441 P.3d 1166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On this record, we cannot conclude that there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome on any of the charges that do not depend on Luke's testimony. Accordingly, we decline to apply Jordan's rule 412 argument to any charge other than the six charges involving Luke.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b633 The second issue Jordan raises in his rule 23B motion is an assertion that trial counsel performed deficiently by \"failing to show that [Mark] had full access\" to Jordan's laptop computer. On this issue, we likewise conclude that Jordan has met his burden under rule 23B, but conclude that the applicability of this argument is similarly limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   \u00b634 The State filed several charges against Jordan regarding child pornography. One of the specific elements that the State had to prove, in order to convict Jordan on those charges, was that Jordan had \"knowingly produce[d] [or] possess[ed] ... child pornography.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -5b-201(1)(a)(i) (LexisNexis 2017). \"[A]ctual physical possession is not necessary to convict a defendant\" of a possession crime.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Specifically, Jordan has submitted an affidavit from his brother in which Jordan's brother explained that, on multiple occasions, he observed Mark accessing Jordan's laptop by entering the password into the computer. Jordan supplements this with his own affidavit alleging that Mark had full access to his laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b637 This evidence, if true, would tend to support the conclusion that both Mark and Jordan had access to the laptop, which would require the State to meet a more stringent burden in order to prove that Jordan constructively possessed the images.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863634\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/137/#p150\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   With regard to ten of the sixteen child pornography charges, the State's evidence satisfied even the higher burden. Nine of those counts (Counts 15-23) were based on photographs of Mark, and Mark testified that Jordan took eight of those photos himself, and that Jordan asked Mark to send him the ninth one. Another of those counts was based on the photograph of Jordan's toddler son sitting on the bathroom counter, and Mother testified that Jordan took that photograph. With regard to these ten photographs, the State clearly met even the more stringent burden of demonstrating that Jordan had constructive possession of them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b638 With regard to the other six charged counts of sexual exploitation of a minor, however, the State presented no evidence of constructive possession other than Jordan's access to the laptop computer on which the photographs were found. Exhibits 32-36 were discovered without metadata,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   so the State's expert could not determine when the file was downloaded or viewed, or any details about when or how the photograph was taken. No other witness offered any evidence about where these photographs came from, how they were created, or how they ended up on Jordan's laptop. Likewise, Exhibit 22 (the photograph of Jordan's toddler son walking naked along a canal) had no metadata associated with it and, although Mother testified that her son was the child depicted in the photograph, no witness testified about who took the photograph or how it came to be on Jordan's laptop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b639 Accordingly, we conclude that the requirements of rule 23B are met, at least with regard to the charges associated with Exhibits 22 and 32-36.

Therefore, we conclude that Jordan has met his rule 23B burden with regard to these six charges, and we grant his rule 23B motion on \"constructive possession\" grounds, as it relates to Counts 14, 24, 25, 26, 27,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   II. Jordan's Appeal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \u00b640 Because we have granted Jordan's rule 23B motion only with respect to twelve of Jordan's thirty-three convictions, we must proceed to consider his appeal. There, Jordan raises two additional arguments. First, he takes issue with his convictions on Counts 13 and 14, asserting that his counsel was ineffective for \"failing to object to the prosecutor's misstatement of the law about what constitutes sexual exploitation of a minor and for failing to request an accurate jury instruction.\" Second, Jordan takes issue with his convictions on Counts 25-28, asserting that without expert testimony regarding the age of the individuals depicted in Exhibits 33-36, the State's evidence was insufficient. We address these arguments, in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \u00b641 On Counts 13 and 14, Jordan was convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor (child pornography) associated with the two photographs of his toddler-aged son, one taken in the bathroom and one taken along a canal. Jordan challenges those convictions, asserting that those two photographs were objectively not sexual in nature, and arguing that a defendant cannot be convicted of child pornography charges regarding objectively-innocuous photographs based simply on his intent in possessing them. He asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to raise these arguments at trial. We find Jordan's arguments persuasive with regard to Exhibit 22 (the canal photograph), but are unconvinced by his arguments with regard to Exhibit 21 (the bathroom photograph).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b642 A person commits the crime of sexual exploitation of a minor when that person \"knowingly produces [or] possesses ... child pornography\" or \"intentionally ... views child pornography.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076\">\n    Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -5b-201(1)(a) (LexisNexis 2017).

The court rejected the defendants' overbreadth challenge, instead agreeing with the State's reading of the sexual exploitation of a minor statute that \"depictions of nude or partially nude minors, without more, are not proscribed by the statute,\" and that \"the statute require[d] that the depiction be for the purpose of sexual arousal of any person.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (quotation simplified).

He was doing it because it's child pornography.\" The prosecutor further asserted that, \"in this case, in light of all of the evidence that you've heard, there should be no doubt that the defendant took that picture because he wanted a picture of a naked little boy. Why?

One way for the State to establish criminal liability under the exploitation of a minor statute was to prove that the photograph was created \"for the purpose of causing sexual arousal of any person.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Utah%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2076\">\n    Utah Code Ann\n    <em>\n     .\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -5b-103(10)(f) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483923\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/31/547/\">\n    2001 UT 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483923\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/31/547/\">\n    31 P.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Absent such evidence, Jordan correctly argues that asking the jury to examine his intent is in violation\n   of\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , because his only established relationship to the photograph is as its possessor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483923\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/31/547/\">\n    2001 UT 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9483923\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/31/547/\">\n    31 P.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b650 As discussed above, Mother testified that Jordan took the photograph marked as Exhibit 21 (the bathroom photo): she identified Jordan as the person visible in the mirror in the photo. Thus, Jordan's trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the prosecutor's closing argument regarding Exhibit 21, because the State's argument-asking the jury to consider Jordan's intent in producing the photograph-was not improper, and any such objection likely would have been overruled. \"The failure to raise futile objections does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Christensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926827\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/331/1128/\">\n    2014 UT App 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6926827\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/331/1128/\">\n    331 P.3d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation simplified).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b651 The same cannot be said, however, for Exhibit 22 (the canal photograph), because the State introduced no evidence regarding how it was produced. On cross-examination, Mother testified that although she knew Jordan took the bathroom photograph, she did not know who took the canal photograph. Additionally, the State's expert testified that there was no metadata associated with the canal photograph. And the State did not otherwise provide evidence that Jordan took the canal photograph. Given this evidentiary posture, it would not have been futile to object to the State's closing argument regarding Exhibit 22. With regard to this photograph, we conclude that the elements of ineffective assistance of counsel are met: we perceive no tactical reason why such an objection was not made, and we conclude that there would have been at least a reasonable probability of a better outcome for Jordan, with respect to this one count, had such an objection been made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b652 Accordingly, we affirm Jordan's conviction on Count 13 (the bathroom photograph), but remand for a new trial on Count 14, the count based on possession of Exhibit 22 (the canal photograph).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \u00b653 Second, Jordan asserts that, without supporting expert testimony, the State presented insufficient evidence to sustain a conviction on Counts 25-28-the counts convicting him for possession of Exhibits 33-36, four photographs depicting nude young males. We have already determined that these four counts should be remanded for further proceedings associated with the \"constructive possession\" issue raised in Jordan's rule 23B motion. We proceed to discuss the merits of this issue, because it will become relevant again in this case, no matter how the \"constructive possession\" issue is eventually resolved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b654 The four photographs depict post-pubescent nude young males. As noted above, the photographs were found on Jordan's laptop computer, but none of the electronic files contained any metadata, so no information was provided to the jury about when the photographs were taken or by whom. Similarly, no witness testified about the individuals\n   depicted in the photographs, and therefore no information was provided to the jury about the age of the individuals (for example, whether they are older or younger than eighteen).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b655 Jordan correctly asserts-and the State acknowledges-that it is the State's burden to prove that the individuals depicted in the photographs are minors. One obvious way for prosecutors to meet this burden is to have the individual depicted in the photograph testify, as Mark did in this case with regard to Exhibits 23-30, that he or she was under the age of eighteen when the photograph was taken. Alternatively, other information may be available about the individual depicted in the photograph that can be introduced into evidence through documents or the testimony of other witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b656 In many child pornography prosecutions, however, the individual depicted in the photograph is unavailable, and no additional information is known about them. That is the case here with regard to the individuals depicted in Exhibits 33-36. In such cases, at least where it is difficult for laypersons to tell whether the individual depicted is a minor, Jordan argues that the State cannot meet its burden without the assistance of expert testimony. The State, by contrast, citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Alinas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8364936\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/1046/\">\n    2007 UT 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8364936\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/171/1046/\">\n    171 P.3d 1046\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , asserts that it is the jury's responsibility to determine the age of the individuals depicted in photographs, and that expert testimony is never required in order to meet the State's burden of proof. On balance, we think that Jordan has the better of the argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b657 In\n   <em>\n    Alinas\n   </em>\n   , the defendant was convicted on child pornography charges. In that case, he was found in possession of photographs of very young girls, and even his attorney conceded \"that the images in this case do not appear to be ... non-minors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 18. Despite the fact that the individuals depicted in the photographs were clearly minors, the defendant nonetheless argued on appeal that \"the State failed to prove the age of the children depicted.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Our supreme court rejected that argument on the facts of that case, stating that \"courts have generally held that the jury themselves, through visual examination, are capable of making the determination whether the children depicted are under eighteen years of age.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31 (citing cases);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32 (stating that \"whether the children depicted are minors is a question of fact for the jury\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b658 The State focuses on this language from\n   <em>\n    Alinas\n   </em>\n   , and asserts that expert testimony is not required in order for the State to meet its burden of proving that the photographs constitute child pornography. This argument is facially appealing-the language our supreme court used could be interpreted in the manner the State urges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   \u00b659 But we are ultimately persuaded by Jordan's position on this point. Jordan correctly points out that the cases our supreme court cited in support of its conclusion are in accord: in obvious cases, like\n   <em>\n    Alinas\n   </em>\n   , where the individuals depicted are clearly minors, no expert testimony is required, but in close cases, where a layperson might not be able to tell whether the individual depicted is a minor, expert testimony is required. One case often cited for this proposition is\n   <em>\n    United States v. Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577842\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/368/\">\n    178 F.3d 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1999). In that case, the court stated that \"[t]he threshold question-whether the age of a model in a child pornography prosecution can be determined by a lay jury without the assistance of expert testimony-must be determined on a case by case basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577842\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/368/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"577842\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/178/368/\">\n    at 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We view our supreme court, by citing favorably to\n   <em>\n    Riccardi\n   </em>\n   , as adopting (rather than rejecting) this approach, and we interpret the\n   <em>\n    Alinas\n   </em>\n   court's statements regarding jury discretion as being tied to the facts of that case, where the pictures in question obviously (and by stipulation) depicted minors.

In this case, the trial court did examine the photographs, but ultimately determined that, because of the language used by our supreme court in\n   <em>\n    Alinas\n   </em>\n   , it was for the jury to determine whether the individuals depicted in the photographs were minors, and that expert testimony was not required.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted, we read\n   <em>\n    Alinas\n   </em>\n   differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   \u00b663 We have independently examined the four photographs in question, to determine whether a lay jury can \"determine the age of the models without the assistance of an expert.\"\n   <em>\n    Riccardi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9124108\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/258/1212/#p1218\">\n    258 F.Supp.2d at 1219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With respect to three of the images (Exhibits 33, 34, and 36), we conclude that no expert assistance is required to assist a jury in determining that the individuals depicted are indeed minors.

Two individuals appear in the photograph, but only parts of each individual are visible. Because the images only partially depict the two individuals, we cannot envision any principled way for a lay jury to determine, without the benefit of expert testimony to assist it, whether either of the individuals depicted is in fact a minor. Accordingly, we conclude that the State's evidence on this count (Count 27) was insufficient. On that count, therefore, we vacate the judgment of conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   \u00b665 Before turning to our conclusion, we deem it important to note that Jordan mounts no convincing appellate arguments-either on his direct appeal or in his rule 23B motion-regarding many of the counts on which he was convicted. No fewer than twenty counts\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   concerned Mark, and were supported largely by Mark's trial testimony. The only arguments Jordan advances on appeal that even arguably could affect his convictions on these counts are (a) the unsupported argument-rejected above,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b632 &amp; n.7-that Mark somehow participated in a scheme to coach his younger brother to level false allegations of sexual abuse, and (b) the argument-also rejected above with regard to Counts 13 and 15-23,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b637-that the State failed to prove that Jordan had constructive possession of certain photographs.

We reject this argument. As an initial matter, this instruction mirrors-word for word-Utah Code section 76-5b-301(3). It is therefore an accurate statement of the law. And second, Jordan's argument ignores that the jury was entitled to convict him of sexual exploitation of a minor for possessing even relatively innocuous photos of naked toddlers, regardless of his intent as a possessor, if it was convinced that he had improper intent as a producer. Therefore, counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to this instruction or for failing to request additional instructions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    If the \"constructive possession\" issue is resolved in favor of the State on remand (for instance, if it is determined that Mark did not actually have access to Jordan's laptop), then we would need to resolve the question of whether Jordan's convictions on those counts can be upheld. Alternatively, if the \"constructive possession\" issue is resolved in favor of Jordan on remand, a new trial will be necessary on these counts, and the parties may benefit from our guidance on these issues for the new trial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Even if the trial court had made a \"gatekeeping\" determination that the photographs clearly depicted minors (rather than a legal determination that\n    <em>\n     Alinas\n    </em>\n    did not require any such gatekeeping determination), we would review that gatekeeping determination in this context for correctness, because we do not perceive any factors that place the trial court in any better position than we are to make a determination regarding whether individuals depicted in photographs are clearly minors.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Adoption of Baby B.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256060\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/382/\">\n     2012 UT 35\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6\u00b6 40-41,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12256060\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/308/382/\">\n     308 P.3d 382\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (stating that \"[n]o deference is given to the lower court's analysis\" where \"the lower court has no comparative advantage\" in resolving the issue).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    As noted earlier, as part of his rule 23B motion, Jordan asserts that his trial counsel was ineffective by failing to retain and hire an expert witness who would have testified about the age of the models depicted in Exhibits 33-36. We find this argument unpersuasive, because the sort of expert testimony Jordan asserts that his trial counsel should have introduced is unlikely to have altered the jury's conclusion that the models were minors. Attached to his rule 23B motion, Jordan submits a report from an expert witness, who opines that it is \"impossible to determine\" whether the individuals depicted in the photographs are minors. That is, Jordan's proffered expert cannot offer a reliable opinion that the individuals are in fact eighteen years old or older. All the expert can say is that she cannot tell their ages, although with regard to Exhibit 36 she acknowledges that the individual is a \"possible adolescent.\" We have independently determined that three of the photographs were clear enough to go to the jury without expert testimony on the State's side, and although we acknowledge that defense counsel could have argued from the expert's assessment that the jury should harbor a reasonable doubt about the age of the three models, we do not think that the jury's conclusion regarding the models' minority would have been significantly swayed by testimony from a defense expert who could only say that she could not reliably determine whether the models were minors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Counts 3-4, 7-12, 15-23, and 30-32.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
