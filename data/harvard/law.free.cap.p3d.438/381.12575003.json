The trial court dismissed the petition both because it was untimely and because\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   does not apply retroactively. The Court of Appeals affirmed the post-conviction court's judgment on the latter ground.\n   <em>\n    Chavez v. State of Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412907\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/788/\">\n    283 Or.App. 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412907\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/788/\">\n    391 P.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017). On review, petitioner challenges both grounds that the trial court identified for dismissing his petition. We hold that, although the petition was timely, the only retroactivity argument that petitioner raises on review-that Oregon's post-conviction statutes require that all new constitutional rules be applied retroactively-is not well taken. Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals decision and the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the trial court granted the state's motion to dismiss the petition for post-conviction relief, we assume that the allegations in the petition are true and state the facts consistently with those allegations. In 1999, petitioner was charged with possessing and delivering cocaine. Before trial, the district attorney offered petitioner a plea deal: If petitioner would plead guilty to delivering a controlled substance, the state would dismiss the possession charge and recommend a light sentence. In discussing the plea with petitioner, petitioner's lawyer did not advise him of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to delivering a controlled substance. However, as part of the plea deal, petitioner did read and sign a plea petition, which recited:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   \"I know that if I am not a United States citizen, my plea may result in my deportation from the USA, or denial of naturalization, or exclusion from future admission to the United States.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner's attorney discounted that warning; she advised him that she \"did not think [he] would be deported as a result of his guilty plea.\" Finally, petitioner alleges that he \"has no recollection\" whether the trial judge discussed the\n   immigration consequences of his plea with him before he pled guilty to delivering a controlled substance. Petitioner did not appeal from the resulting judgment of conviction, which became final on September 2, 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2011, petitioner applied to become a naturalized United States citizen. In processing his application, the Department of Homeland Security discovered that he had been convicted of delivering a controlled substance and, as a result, was subject to deportation. On November 4, 2011, petitioner filed his first petition for post-conviction relief. He alleged that the Court's 2010 decision in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   demonstrated that his trial attorney's advice fell below the standard that the Sixth Amendment requires. Specifically, petitioner alleged that his attorney was constitutionally deficient because she did not advise him that, if he pled guilty to delivering a controlled substance, he would almost certainly be deported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The state moved to dismiss the petition, and the trial court granted the motion. The trial court reasoned that the petition was time-barred because petitioner reasonably could have anticipated\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and alternatively that\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   did not apply retroactively to decisions that became final before it was decided. The Oregon Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's judgment, reasoning that the argument that petitioner advanced for applying\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   retroactively could not be reconciled with the Court of Appeals and this court's decisions.\n   <em>\n    Chavez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412907\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/788/\">\n    283 Or.App. at 796-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12412907\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/283/788/\">\n    391 P.3d 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On review, the parties raise two issues. The first is whether the two-year statute of limitations in ORS 138.510(3)(a) bars petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim. The second is whether, if it does not, the Court's 2010 decision in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively to a conviction that became final in 1999. We begin with the first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   I. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ORS 138.510(3) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-18\">\n   \"A petition pursuant to ORS 138.510 to 138.680 must be filed within two years of the [date that the challenged conviction became final], unless the court on hearing a subsequent petition finds grounds for relief asserted which could\n   not reasonably have been raised in the original or amended petition.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As this court has explained, that subsection contains both a limitations period within which a post-conviction petition must be filed (two years from the date that the conviction became final) and an escape clause (the limitation period does not apply if the grounds for relief asserted in the petition could not reasonably have been raised within the limitations period).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartz v. State of Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/#p357\">\n    314 Or. 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357-58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/#p357\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Because petitioner filed this petition for post-conviction relief approximately 12 years after his conviction became final, ORS 138.510(3) bars his petition unless the ground for relief asserted in the petition comes within the escape clause. Generally, cases invoking the escape clause fall into one of two categories. In one, the applicable law is established within the two-year limitation period, and the question is whether the petitioner reasonably could have asserted that available legal ground for relief.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gutale v. State of Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574051\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/435/728/#p519\">\n    364 Or. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 519-20,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12574051\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/435/728/#p519\">\n    435 P.3d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2019) (holding that, even though\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   had been decided when the petitioner pled guilty, a reasonable trier of fact could find that the petitioner was not on notice that he should investigate the possibility of adverse immigration consequences within the two-year limitations period),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bartz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/#p357\">\n    314 Or. at 359-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2192858\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/314/353/#p357\">\n    839 P.2d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that the petitioner should have discovered within the limitations period a statutory defense to the charge to which he pled guilty). In the other category, a new constitutional rule is announced after the two-year limitation period expired, and the question is whether that \"new rule\" reasonably could have been raised within the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Verduzco v. State of Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    357 Or. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4364201\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/357/553/\">\n    355 P.3d 902\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This case falls in the latter category. Petitioner argues that, when he pled guilty in 1999, the accepted understanding was that failing to warn a defendant about the collateral consequences of a guilty plea, such as the possibility of deportation, did not constitute inadequate assistance for the purposes of the Sixth Amendment. Rather, a lawyer would fall below the standard that the\n   Sixth Amendment required only if he or she failed to warn a defendant about the direct consequences of a plea, such as the maximum sentence that could be imposed as a result of the plea. The state responds that, as a matter of state constitutional law, this court required lawyers to advise their clients about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea as early as 1985 and that, before the Court decided\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   in 2010, petitioners seeking post-conviction and habeas relief had argued that their lawyers violated the Sixth Amendment by failing to advise them of the immigration consequences of their pleas. In considering the parties' arguments, we first describe briefly the state of the law before\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   and then turn to the question whether petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim reasonably could have been raised within two years of September 2, 1999, the date his conviction became final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 2006, this court explained that the Sixth Amendment required defense counsel to advise their clients of the direct but not the collateral consequences of a guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez v. State of Oregon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862147\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/340/452/#p457\">\n    340 Or. 452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 457-58,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862147\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/340/452/#p457\">\n    134 P.3d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). As petitioner notes, the direct consequences of a plea include the maximum and mandatory minimum sentences that can be imposed as a result of the plea while the collateral consequences include deportation, the loss of a license to practice a profession, the termination of parental rights, and the like.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862147\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/340/452/#p457\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing Gabriel J.

As a result, before\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , the \"almost unanimou[s]\" rule was that a defense counsel's failure to advise a client about the immigration consequences of a guilty plea did not provide a basis for seeking state post-conviction or federal habeas relief.\n   <em>\n    Chaidez v.

In 1985, this court held that lawyers will fall below the standard that the Oregon Constitution requires if they fail to warn clients who are not United States citizens that a guilty plea \"may result\" in deportation and other adverse immigration consequences.\n   <em>\n    Lyons v.

After noting that, as a result of changes to immigration law in 1996, deportation was \"virtually inevitable\" for persons convicted of a specified class of crimes, the Court turned to the issue whether failing to advise a defendant of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea could be asserted as a basis for a Sixth Amendment inadequate assistance claim. In considering that issue, the Court noted that it had never adopted a distinction between \"direct\" and \"collateral\" consequences of a plea for the purposes of\n   the Sixth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    559 U.S. at 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court, however, found it unnecessary to decide the validity of that distinction in other contexts because it concluded that deportation, as a consequence of a criminal conviction, was sufficiently intertwined with the criminal process and sufficiently significant to a defendant considering a guilty plea to hold that the failure to advise a client of the immigration consequences of pleading guilty can violate the Sixth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Having reached that conclusion, the Court recognized that the federal immigration laws are not always clear\n   regarding the immigration consequences for persons convicted of some crimes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581896,12447673\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/356/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That is, when a citizen of another country is considering pleading guilty to one of the specified offenses for which removal is \"virtually inevitable,\" constitutionally adequate defense counsel should advise their clients of that likelihood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   altered the legal landscape in two respects. First, it departed from what had been the \"almost unanimou[s]\" rule that the failure to advise a client of the immigration consequences of a guilty plea will never be a cognizable basis for asserting an inadequate assistance claim under the Sixth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaidez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407511\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/342/#p350\">\n    568 U.S. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407511\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/342/#p350\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second,\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   imposed a higher requirement on counsel than this court had done in\n   <em>\n    Lyons\n   </em>\n   in 1985 and in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   in 2006. After\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , if the immigration consequences of pleading guilty to certain crimes are \"truly clear,\" as they were in this case, then the Sixth Amendment requires defense counsel to advise their clients not merely that a conviction \"may result\" in adverse immigration consequences but that deportation and other adverse immigration consequences will be \"virtually inevitable\" as a result of the plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   With that background in mind, we turn to the state's argument that petitioner reasonably could have raised his Sixth Amendment claim within two years of the date that his conviction became final in 1999.

In this case, petitioner never asserted a claim that was virtually identical to the claim that the Court later decided in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , as the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Verduzco\n   </em>\n   did.

Moreover, the timing in this case is problematic for the state.\n   <em>\n    Verduzco\n   </em>\n   was contemporaneous with\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   .

It is certainly true, as the state notes, that some litigants were raising similar claims before\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   .

Indeed, if this court did not anticipate\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   's holding when we decided\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   in 2006, we can hardly say that petitioner should have anticipated it five years earlier in 2001.

On that issue, petitioner recognizes that\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   announced a new federal constitutional rule that does not apply retroactively in federal court. He argues, however, that federal law permits states to apply new federal rules, such as the one announced in\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   , retroactively even though those rules do not apply retroactively in the federal courts. Additionally, he contends that, as a matter of state law, Oregon's 1959 post-conviction statute requires that all new state and federal constitutional rules apply retroactively in state post-conviction proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Before turning to petitioner's argument that the text, context, and history of Oregon's 1959 post-conviction statute require that all new federal constitutional rules apply retroactively in state post-conviction proceedings, we first discuss federal retroactivity\n   analysis. Oregon adopted its 1959 post-conviction statute as federal retroactivity analysis was being developed, and an understanding of the federal analysis provides important context for understanding the Oregon statute. With the federal cases in mind, we then turn to petitioner's state statutory arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Federal Retroactivity Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Before 1915, the grounds for petitioning for a writ of federal habeas corpus were limited; the only basis that a petitioner could assert was that the court that had rendered the judgment lacked jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Danforth v.

ORS 138.530(1). The act also supplied a rule for construing its terms. It provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    \"Whenever a person petitions for relief under ORS 138.510 to 138.680,\n    ORS 138.510 to 138.680 shall not be construed to deny relief where such relief would have been available prior to May 26, 1959, under the writ of habeas corpus, nor shall it be construed to affect any powers of executive clemency or pardon provided by law.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    ORS 138.530(2). Finally, the act gave trial courts discretion to grant \"release, new trial, modification of sentence, and such other relief as may be proper and just.\" ORS 138.520.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In this case, petitioner relies on ORS 138.530(2) and ORS 138.530(1)(a) to argue that the 1959 legislature intended that every new constitutional rule announced by this court and the United States Supreme Court will apply retroactively in all post-conviction proceedings brought pursuant to the 1959 act. Petitioner focuses initially on ORS 138.530(2), and we begin with that subsection.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    1.\n    <em>\n     ORS 138.530(2)\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    ORS 138.530(2) provides that post-conviction petitions filed pursuant to the 1959 act \"shall not be construed to deny relief where such relief would have been available prior to May 26, 1959, under the writ of habeas corpus.\" In arguing that ORS 138.530(2) requires the retroactive application of all new constitutional rules, petitioner starts from the premise that, before May 26, 1959, federal courts applied new federal constitutional rules retroactively in federal habeas corpus proceedings. Because ORS 138.530(2) provides that the post-conviction act shall not be construed to deny relief \"where such relief would have been available prior to May 26, 1959, under the writ of habeas corpus,\" he concludes that the legislature intended that all new constitutional rules will be applied retroactively in Oregon post-conviction proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    As petitioner recognizes, the rule of construction that ORS 138.530(2) provides turns on the scope of the \"relief [that] would have been available prior to May 26, 1959, under the writ of habeas corpus.\" The relief under the 1959 act should be as broad as the relief that previously\n    was available \"under the writ of habeas corpus.\" However, contrary to the assumption that underlies petitioner's argument, the statutory phrase \"writ of habeas corpus\" in ORS 138.530(2) refers to the state writ of habeas corpus, not the federal writ. Moreover, before 1959, the Oregon courts had not applied new constitutional rules retroactively. Rather, the issue had not arisen in state habeas. For that reason, no clear pattern of state habeas decisions existed that would permit us to infer that the 1959 legislature intended to codify a requirement that all new constitutional rules be applied retroactively. With that preface, we turn to a more complete discussion of the textual and contextual issues that petitioner's argument raises.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Textually, the phrase \"writ of habeas corpus\" in ORS 138.530(2) could refer to either the federal writ or the state writ. The legislature did not specify which writ it had in mind. Other sections of the 1959 act, however, refer to either the state statutory writ or the state constitutional writ. ORS 138.540(1) abolished a number of state \"common law post-conviction remedies\" \"[w]ith the exception of habeas corpus.\" Given the juxtaposition of \"habeas corpus\" with other state \"common law post-conviction remedies,\" we assume that the phrase, as used in that subsection of the statute, refers to the state writ. Similarly, ORS 138.530(3) provides that the act shall not be construed to limit this court's constitutionally based original jurisdiction in habeas corpus, again using the phrase to refer to a state writ. Finally, section 22 of the 1959 act amended the state habeas statutes to except post-conviction petitions under the 1959 act from the scope of those statutes.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Or. Laws 1959, ch. 636, \u00a7 22.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Ordinarily, we assume that the legislature used the phrase \"writ of habeas corpus\" in ORS 138.530(2) the same way that it used that phrase (or a variation of that phrase) throughout the act-namely, to refer to a state writ of habeas corpus.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Figueroa v. BNSF Railway Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414813\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/142/#p159\">\n     361 Or. 142\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 159,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12414813\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/361/142/#p159\">\n     390 P.3d 1019\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2017) (identifying that principle of statutory construction). Moreover, because a statutory post-conviction petition is the exclusive means for challenging the validity of a conviction under the 1959 act, this court has recognized that ORS 138.530(2) reflects the legislature's\n    intent to ensure that the relief available under the new post-conviction\n    act was as broad as that available under the state writ of habeas corpus, which has state constitutional underpinnings.\n    <em>\n     Benson v. Gladden\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2104239\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/242/132/#p136\">\n     242 Or. 132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 136-37,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2104239\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/242/132/#p136\">\n     407 P.2d 634\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1965). We accordingly look to the practice under the state writ of habeas corpus to determine whether, as petitioner argues, ORS 138.530(2) requires that all new constitutional rules be applied retroactively in state post-conviction proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    On that issue, no Oregon Supreme Court decision had held before 1959 that a new constitutional ruling would apply retroactively. Indeed, no Oregon Supreme Court decision had expressly identified that issue before 1959, nor does there appear to have been a practice of\n    <em>\n     sub silentio\n    </em>\n    applying new constitutional rulings retroactively in state habeas. In large part, the absence of any discussion of retroactivity before 1959 derived from the limited grounds on which habeas had been available before the enactment of the post-conviction act. As noted above, state habeas relief traditionally had been available only if the court imposing the conviction had lacked jurisdiction over the person or the subject.\n    <em>\n     Huffman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5033565\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/197/283/#p297\">\n     197 Or. at 297\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5033565\" index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/197/283/#p297\">\n     251 P.2d 87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Because those constitutional principles were well-established, they presumably did not raise questions regarding the retroactive application of \"new\" constitutional rules. At most, the only question that they raised was the application of established principles to analogous circumstances.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    To be sure, this court recognized in\n    <em>\n     Huffman\n    </em>\n    in 1952 that state habeas also would lie for \"other matter[s] rendering the proceeding void.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5033565\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/197/283/#p297\">\n     197 Or. at 298\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5033565\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/197/283/#p297\">\n     251 P.2d 87\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis omitted). However, the court had no occasion in\n    <em>\n     Huffman\n    </em>\n    to address whether the other matters that the petitioner raised in that case, if proved on remand, would announce \"new rules\" and whether, if they did so, they would apply retroactively.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    The same is true for the other cases arising before 1959.

After all, the court noted that it could find no authorities to guide it in its task.

In considering whether\n    <em>\n     Cannon\n    </em>\n    announced\n    a \"new\" constitutional rule that it applied retroactively, it is helpful to remember that the current federal definition of a \"new\" constitutional rule set out in\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    in 1989 did not exist either in 1955 when the court decided\n    <em>\n     Cannon\n    </em>\n    or in 1959 when the legislature enacted the post-conviction act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Desist\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170591\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/244/#p263\">\n     394 U.S. at 263\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170591\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/244/#p263\">\n     89 S.Ct. 1030\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Harlan, J., dissenting) (explaining in 1969 that, before asking whether a rule applies retroactively, \"it is necessary to determine whether a particular decision has really announced a 'new' rule at all or whether it has simply applied a well-established constitutional principle to govern a case which is closely analogous to those which have been previously considered in the prior case law\"). In our view,\n    <em>\n     Cannon\n    </em>\n    's holding is better understood as applying the constitutional principles established in\n    <em>\n     Sustar\n    </em>\n    to a new factual situation.

It follows that we cannot read ORS 138.530(2), as petitioner urges us to do, as codifying a well-accepted practice of requiring that all new constitutional rules will be applied retroactively. Moreover, even if we were to conclude that, before 1959, the Oregon courts had applied\n    <em>\n     some\n    </em>\n    new constitutional rules retroactively in state habeas corpus, it does not follow that the 1959 legislature understood or intended that\n    <em>\n     all\n    </em>\n    new rules would be applied retroactively. After all, some new constitutional rules call for retroactive application in ways that others do not.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Mishkin, 79 Harv. L. Rev. at 77-86 (noting that point).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Contrary to petitioner's argument, ORS 138.530(2) does not reflect a legislative choice to require that all new constitutional rules be applied retroactively in state post-conviction proceedings. We also note that, even if we looked to the practice in federal habeas cases, as petitioner argues we should, to interpret the meaning of ORS 138.530(2), the retroactive application of new federal rulings in federal habeas cases before 1963 was \"rare.\"\n    <em>\n     Desist\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170591\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/244/#p263\">\n     394 U.S. at 261\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170591\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/244/#p263\">\n     89 S.Ct. 1030\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Harlan, J., dissenting). More importantly, as noted above, the Court had applied only one new federal constitutional rule retroactively before the Oregon legislature enacted our post-conviction statute in 1959. It follows that\n    we cannot find in either the text of ORS 138.530(2) or the context of that statute a mandate that we apply every new constitutional rule retroactively. Because ORS 138.530(2) does not support the conclusion that petitioner urges us to draw from it, we turn to ORS 138.530(1)(a), the other subsection on which petitioner relies.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    2.\n    <em>\n     ORS 138.530(1)(a)\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    ORS 138.530(1) provides that \"[p]ost-conviction relief pursuant to [the 1959 act] shall be granted by the court when one or more of the following grounds is established by the petitioner\": (a) \"[a] substantial denial in the proceedings\n    resulting in petitioner's conviction\" of the petitioner's state or federal constitutional rights which \"rendered the conviction void\"; (b) a lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter or the person; (c) an unconstitutional or an unauthorized sentence; and (d) a conviction based on a statute that is substantively unconstitutional.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    Focusing on ORS 138.530(1)(a), petitioner interprets that subsection as requiring that all new constitutional rules be applied retroactively. Petitioner does not explain why he interprets ORS 138.530(1)(a) that way, and we note two textual problems with his interpretation. Petitioner appears to read the word \"when\" in the phrase \"when one or more of the following grounds is established by the petitioner\" as \"whenever.\" To be sure, \"when\" is broad enough to permit his reading. But his conclusion that ORS 138.530(1)(a) mandates retroactive application of all new constitutional rules would follow more naturally from the text if the legislature had used a different word.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Beyond that, petitioner never explains why the phrase \"substantial denial\" of his constitutional rights that \"rendered the conviction void\" is not a problem for his reading of the subsection. Textually, ORS 138.530(1)(a) does not require that post-conviction relief \"shall be granted\" when any denial of a constitutional right is established. Rather, it provides that relief shall be granted only when a \"substantial denial\" of a constitutional right rendered the conviction \"void.\" At a minimum, the text of the statute is difficult to square with petitioner's argument that ORS 138.530(1)(a) requires that every new constitutional rule be applied retroactively. In our view, the interpretation of ORS 138.530 (1)(a) that petitioner urges us to adopt does not fit comfort-ably with the text of that subsection.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Another interpretation is textually permissible. ORS 138.530(1) might not be intended to address retroactivity at all. Rather, it could merely identify four grounds for relief for which post-conviction relief shall be granted. Moreover, the phrase \"when one or more of the following grounds is established by the petitioner\" could have a more modest meaning than the one petitioner attributes to it. It could simply make clear that the burden is on the petitioner to establish the\n    existence of one of the four grounds for which relief shall be granted. Providing that post-conviction relief shall be granted if and when one of those four grounds for relief is established does not necessarily say anything about whether some or all new constitutional rules that come within those four grounds will apply retroactively.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    We also consider a statute's context in determining what the text means. Context includes \"the preexisting common law and the statutory framework within which the law was enacted.\"\n    <em>\n     Klamath Irrigation District v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671591\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/348/15/#p23\">\n     348 Or. 15\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 23,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671591\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/348/15/#p23\">\n     227 P.3d 1145\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). As explained above, retroactive application of new constitutional rules in state habeas proceedings was not an issue when the legislature enacted the post-conviction act in 1959. Moreover, it was not a substantial issue in federal habeas either. Because of procedural limitations on federal habeas corpus, the retroactive application of new federal rulings in federal habeas cases before 1963 was \"rare.\"\n    <em>\n     Desist\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170591\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/244/#p263\">\n     394 U.S. at 261\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6170591\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/394/244/#p263\">\n     89 S.Ct. 1030\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Harlan, J., dissenting).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    To be sure, one pair of federal decisions had raised the issue before 1959.
