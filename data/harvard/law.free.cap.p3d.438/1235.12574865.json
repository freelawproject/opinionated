Oregon\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   to mandatory LFOs, (3) the Clark County Court Clerk's office took enforcement action against her without conducting an inquiry into her ability to pay under\n   <em>\n    State v.

Conway requests that we vacate the superior court's orders and remand for entry of an order striking the victim penalty assessment fee and the criminal filing fee. We reject all of her arguments and affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b62 In March 2007, Conway pleaded guilty in the Clark County Superior Court to one count of maintaining a dwelling for controlled substances. The superior court sentenced her and ordered her to pay various LFOs, including two mandatory LFOs: a $ 500 victim penalty assessment fee (VPA) under former RCW 7.68.035 (2000) and a $ 200 criminal filing fee under former RCW 9.94A.505 (2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Conway, who was receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) due to a disability, made some, but not all, of the ordered payments toward the judgment and sentence. The Clark County Superior Court's Collections Unit periodically sent Conway notices to appear for a payment review and either make a payment or explain why she could not do so. These notices stated that if she failed to pay or appear, she could be placed in custody. At one point, the clerk's office e-mailed Conway, explaining that she would be required to provide an annual letter to verify her SSI status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 In 2016, Conway filed a motion to remit all LFOs except the VPA fee and the criminal filing fee based on her indigency and SSI status. The superior court conducted a hearing and entered written findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court found that Conway was indigent and had been on SSI for 27 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 In its order, the superior court remitted the balance of interest owing, the criminal fine, the court appointed attorney fee, the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fee (which was discretionary at the time), the crime lab fee, the drug fund fee, and the balance of collection fees. As to the two remaining mandatory LFOs, the VPA fee and the criminal filing fee, the court ruled that Conway owed a balance of $ 493.55 for the VPA fee and $ 197.41 for the criminal filing fee, but it ordered that \"the court cannot require her to pay on the remaining mandatory LFOs at this time.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 378.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 Conway filed a motion to reconsider in December 2016, arguing for the first time that the imposition of the two mandatory LFOs violated her equal protection and substantive due process rights. The superior court denied the motion and entered the following additional relevant findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1. ... [T]he Clark County Clerk's office did not unlawfully collect statutorily authorized\n   collection fees and that the [c]ourt has no authority to direct the [c]ounty [c]lerk as to application of payments received from Ms. Conway.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5. ... [T]his [c]ourt can conceive of circumstances wherein Ms. Conway may be able to pay the fees and assessments in the future.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   6. ... The [c]ourt finds that there has never been enforcement in Ms. Conway's case. Ms. Conway has never been brought to court on a [m]otion for nonpayment. Sanctions have never been sought or imposed against her for nonpayment. The [c]ourt declines to find, as requested by Ms. Conway, that the State/Clark County Clerk's office was on notice and therefore required to conduct an inquiry regarding payment of LFO's when Ms. Conway was brought to court on probation violations unrelated to LFO's. Again, no enforcement sanctions were sought against Ms. Conway to trigger a\n   <em>\n    Blank\n   </em>\n   inquiry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   CP at 399-400.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b67 Conway appeals both orders; a commissioner of this court granted discretionary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   I.

STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO REMIT MANDATORY LFOS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b613 Conway argues that the superior court has discretion and broad statutory authority to remit the mandatory LFOs at issue and erred by refusing to do so. She cites former RCW 9.94A.6333 (2008), former RCW 9.94A.634 (2002)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and former RCW 10.01.180(4) (2010).

Former RCW 9.94A.6333 and former RCW 9.94A.634 are general statutes that apply when defendants fail to comply with conditions or requirements of their sentences but the violations are not willful and relate to community restitution obligations. Neither of these statutes authorize a court to remit the VPA fee and the criminal filing fee. Thus, neither former RCW 9.94A.6333 nor former RCW 9.94A.634 apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b619 Former RCW 10.01.180(4) applies if a defendant is in default, but not in contempt, for nonpayment of fines or costs and grants the court discretion to allow a defendant additional time to pay, reduce the amount of fines or costs, or revoke the fines or costs. The VPA fee and the criminal filing fee are not \"fines\" or \"costs\" as defined in RCW 10.01.180(4). Nor does Conway argue that they are fines or costs. Thus, former RCW 10.01.180(4) does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b620 We also note that Conway's original motion to remit was filed under former RCW 10.01.160(4) (2015), the statute in effect at the time applicable to discretionary costs. That statute authorizes a superior court to remit certain LFOs, \"[i]f it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount\n   due will impose manifest hardship on the defendant or the defendant's immediate family, the court may remit all or part of the amount due in costs, or modify the method of payment under RCW 10.01.170.\" Former RCW 10.01.160(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \u00b621 On appeal, Conway does not argue that former RCW 10.01.160(4) applies here. As discussed, she argues that other statutes apply to authorize the court to remit the mandatory LFOs at issue. Because we adhere to the statutory principle that a specific statute controls over a general statute, we hold that the more specific remittance statute, RCW 10.01.160(4), controls, but that it does not authorize the court to remit the mandatory LFOs at issue here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.
