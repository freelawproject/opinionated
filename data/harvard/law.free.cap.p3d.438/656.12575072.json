It argues that the Commission lacks authority to interfere with the internal management of a public service corporation, and therefore that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to issue the interim management order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 We accept jurisdiction but deny relief. Both the Commission's broad ratemaking power under Ariz. Const. art. 15, \u00a7 3, and its statutorily delegated power to determine a \"just\" remedy for \"inadequate\" public-utility equipment, facilities, or services under A.R.S. \u00a7 40-321(A), provide the Commission with sufficient authority to impose an interim manager under appropriate circumstances. It is for the superior court, however, to decide whether the circumstances in this case supported the Commission's authority to issue the interim management order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Johnson Utilities is a public service corporation that provides water and wastewater services in Pinal and Maricopa Counties. In March 2018, the Commission held a\n   14-day hearing regarding the adequacy of Johnson Utilities' operations and issued a decision finding several significant concerns with its billing practices and financial management, as well as with the condition of its equipment and facilities. Finding it \"just and reasonable and in the public interest,\" the Commission appointed EPCOR Water Arizona (another water utility provider in the area) to \"conduct the business and affairs\" of Johnson Utilities as an interim manager. The Commission further ordered that Johnson Utilities may apply for termination of the interim management appointment with EPCOR \"upon a showing that [Johnson Utilities'] services ... are in all respects just, reasonable, safe, proper, adequate, and sufficient and that terminating the [appointment] would not present an unreasonable risk of service.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Johnson Utilities filed several actions protesting the Commission's order, including three unsuccessful requests to enjoin its enforcement. Johnson Utilities also filed a \"Statutory Special Action\" with the Arizona Supreme Court, and that court issued an order declining jurisdiction \"without prejudice to refile in the court of appeals.\" Johnson Utilities now petitions this court for special action review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 We issued a brief order accepting jurisdiction and denying relief on September 21, 2018, noting that an opinion would follow. This is that opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 We accepted special action jurisdiction because Johnson Utilities' petition presents a purely legal issue of immediate statewide importance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ariz.

The ultimate question of whether the Commission's order was justified on the merits must be decided on a case-by-case basis. We will not engage in such a fact-intensive inquiry here. Instead, we address only the narrow legal issue presented by this special action-whether an order for an interim manager falls within the jurisdiction of the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b68 \"The Arizona Corporation Commission, unlike such bodies in most states, is not a creature of the legislature, but is a constitutional body which owes its existence to provisions in the organic law of this state.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

Section 40-422(A) requires the Commission to commence a proceeding in the superior court \"to have ... violations or threatened violations [of an order of the Commission] prevented, either by mandamus\n   or injunction.\" This statute provides the Commission a means to enforce its original order, but does not limit the scope of the original order or affect whether the Commission has constitutional or statutory authority to issue the order in the first instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b624 We accept jurisdiction but deny relief. Subject to the substantive limitations of the managerial interference doctrine, both Ariz. Const. art. 15, \u00a7 3, and A.R.S. \u00a7 40-321(A) provide the Commission jurisdiction to impose an interim manager for a public service corporation.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Both parties present novel arguments regarding jurisdiction. The Commission argues that under A.R.S. \u00a7 40-254(F), special action jurisdiction in this matter lies solely with the supreme court, and therefore this court does not have jurisdiction to review the petition. Johnson Utilities argues that \u00a7 40-254(F) creates a \"statutory special action\" under Ariz. R.P. Spec. Act. 1(b), which\n    <em>\n     mandates\n    </em>\n    that the petitioned court accept review. But because the supreme court explicitly permitted Johnson Utilities to refile its petition with this court, and because we accept jurisdiction based on the discretionary factors under Ariz. R.P. Spec. Act. 1(a), we need not address either argument here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    Notably, throughout the century of jurisprudence on Ariz. Const. art. 15, \u00a7 3, comparatively little focus has been placed on the force of the fourth clause, which gives the Commission broad authority to make and enforce orders affecting public welfare.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pac.
