The superior court granted the Respondents'\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion to\n   dismiss, ruling that the City did not have jurisdiction to assume State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA), ch. 43.21C RCW, lead agency status under WAC 197-11-948. The City argues that (1) it is an \"agency with jurisdiction\" under WAC 197-11-948 and (2) it may assume lead agency status following the issuance of a mitigated determination of nonsignificance (MDNS). The City also asserts that the superior court erred in considering a declaration that contained legal opinions and asks us not to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b62 We hold that under the plain meaning of the applicable regulations, (1) the City is an \"agency with jurisdiction\" that can assume lead agency status under WAC 197-11-948 and (2) as an \"agency with jurisdiction\" it may assume lead agency status following the issuance of an MDNS. In reaching our decision, we do not consider legal opinions contained in a declaration. Accordingly, we reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. KNUTSON PROJECT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 On November 26, 2014, Knutson Farms Inc. and Running Bear Development Partners LLC (collectively Applicants) applied to Pierce County for approval to develop a warehouse, distribution, and freight movement complex in what is farmland in unincorporated Pierce County. The Knutson Farms Industrial Park (hereinafter Knutson project) is a 162-acre site that is approximately 2.6 million square feet and includes construction of seven warehouses, as well as parking lots and ancillary facilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 The property borders the City's limits and is adjacent to the Puyallup River. No portion of the site is in the City limits, but the site is within the City's Growth Management Urban Growth Area. Clerk's Papers (CP) at 582 (Declaration of City Development Services Director) (\"the project site will by law ultimately become part of the City\"). The Knutson project site is within the City's sewer area, and a portion of the site is in the City's water service area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 The Knutson project will require approximately 5,600 more vehicles on the roads each weekday. The SEPA environmental checklist\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the project states that \"[n]ew on-site private roads will be constructed as part of the development as well as roadway improvements along 5th\n   <em>\n    Avenue S.E., 80th Street East\n   </em>\n   and the portion of 134th Avenue East which will not to [sic] be vacated.\" CP at 144. These are city roads. The SEPA checklist also lists that \"Sewer and Water Utility Permits by City of Puyallup and Valley Water Districts\" are \"anticipated for this project.\" CP at 131.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 Pierce County issued notices describing the project and received comments from many parties with concerns that the project was too close to the Puyallup River and in a flood prone area. These parties included the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife, the Muckleshoot and Puyallup tribes, and the County's Public Works and Surface Water Management Departments. The City and the City of Sumner shared these concerns as well as additional concerns that the project would generate increased traffic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 On June 22, 2016, the City offered to serve as a co-lead agency under WAC 197-11-944.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County's Planning Director declined the request for co-lead, but said, \"[T]he review process for this project will be robust and will provide ample opportunities for other jurisdictions and the public to comment.\" CP at 253. The City cautioned that it would, if necessary, assume SEPA lead agency status under WAC 197-11-948.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 As required by the Pierce County Code and the County's environmental review under SEPA, the Applicants obtained and submitted professionally prepared studies analyzing\n   the potential impacts and mitigation measures including a traffic impact analysis; a critical areas assessment report; flood surveys and studies including a flood boundary delineation survey, conceptual flood plain compensatory storage plan, compensatory flood plain volume table, and flood plain cross sections; a preliminary storm drainage report; and a geotechnical engineering report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. MITIGATED DETERMINATION OF NONSIGNIFICANCE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b69 On April 26, 2017, the County issued an MDNS. The MDNS stated that it was \"issued under WAC 197-11-340(2),\" CP at 280, and that the County \"has determined that the proposal will not have a probable significant impact on the environment, and an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) will not be required under RCW 43.21C.030(2)(c),\n   <em>\n    only if the following conditions are met\n   </em>\n   .\" CP at 278 (alteration in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 The conditions relating to city roadwork state,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    If not already constructed, the applicant will design and construct 5th Avenue SE to City of Puyallup roadway standards\n   </em>\n   between Shaw Road East and 33rd Street SE prior to final building inspection on the first building in the Knutson Farms Short Plat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The applicant will design and construct roadway improvements to 33rd Street SE (134th Avenue East) south of 5th Avenue SE to 80th Street East to City of Puyallup road standards\n   </em>\n   prior to final building inspection on the first building in the Knutson Farms Short Plat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    If not already constructed, the applicant will design and construct roadway improvements to 134th Avenue East north of 5th Avenue SE within the Puyallup City limits.\n   </em>\n   The applicant will design and construct the necessary road improvements to gain access to Shaw Road East, as well as the full street improvements along 134th Avenue East north of 5th Avenue SE consisting of 32 feet of pavement width (two 12-foot lanes with 4-foot paved shoulders), curb/gutter, and 6-foot wide sidewalks prior to the final building inspection on the first building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \u2022\n   <em>\n    The applicant will design and construct a traffic signal at the Shaw Road East/5th Avenue SE intersection\n   </em>\n   prior to occupancy of the first building.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   CP at 155, 279 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   III. NOTICE OF ASSUMPTION OF LEAD AGENCY STATUS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b611 On May 10, the City issued a \"Notice of Assumption of Lead Agency Status\" \"[p]ursuant to WAC 197-11-948 and 985.\" CP at 186. The same day, the City issued a \"Determination of Significance (DS) and a Request for Comments on Scope of EIS.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b612 On May 16, the county executive responded to the City's actions and said that the \"County clearly has jurisdiction and will not recognize the City's extrajudicial action.\" CP at 193, 289. On May 22, the County issued a \"Written Order\" to approve the application for the project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   IV. LAWSUIT PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b613 The Respondents appealed the City's assumption of lead agency status and the City's notice of its DS to the Puyallup Hearing Examiner. The City appealed the County's MDNS to the Pierce County Hearing Examiner. These appeals were stayed pending resolution of the City's lawsuit filed in superior court discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b614 On May 25, the City filed a complaint and petition in superior court against the Respondents to resolve the jurisdictional dispute. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment regarding the validity of the City's SEPA lead agency assumption. Respondents supported their summary judgment motion, in part, with a declaration from Richard Settle, an attorney. The City objected to the Settle declaration and asked the superior court not to consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b615 After hearing oral argument on the motions, the superior court denied the City's\n   summary judgment motion and granted the Respondents' motion. The superior court determined that under WAC 197-11-948, the City was not authorized to assume lead agency status over the proposal. Thus, it ruled that the City was not authorized to issue the notice of assumption of lead agency status and the DS. The superior court said that it considered the Settle declaration in reaching its decision. The City moved for reconsideration, which the superior court denied. The City appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   I. SEPA FRAMEWORK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b616 The legislature enacted SEPA in 1971 to \" 'promote the policy of fully informed decision making by government bodies when undertaking major actions significantly affecting the quality of the environment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Moss v.

SEPA lays out procedures for review of environmental impacts by a lead agency. WAC 197-11-050. For private projects that require licenses from more than one agency where one of the agencies is a county or city, \"the lead agency shall be that county/city within whose jurisdiction is located the greatest portion of the proposed project area, as measured in square feet.\" WAC 197-11-932. The lead agency must make a \"threshold determination\" ( RCW 43.21C.033(1) ) and determine if a proposal \"has any probable significant adverse environmental impacts.\" WAC 197-11-330(5), -310. An impact is \"significant\" if there is \"a reasonable likelihood of more than a moderate adverse impact on environmental quality.\" WAC 197-11-794(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b617 The lead agency conducts a preliminary investigation in order to make a threshold determination, which includes reviewing an environmental checklist that provides information about the proposal. WAC 197-11-315, - 960. If the responsible official\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the lead agency determines that the proposal \"may have a probable significant adverse environmental impact,\" then the lead agency will issue a threshold \"determination of significance (DS).\" WAC 197-11-360(1). A DS requires the preparation of an EIS. WAC 197-11-980. An EIS provides an impartial discussion of environmental impacts and alternatives to a proposal and informs decision makers and the public. WAC 197-11-400. The EIS process allows \"government agencies and interested citizens to review and comment on proposed government actions, including government approval of private projects and their environmental effects.\" WAC 197-11-400(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b618 If the responsible official concludes that the proposal will not have a probable significant adverse environmental impact, then the lead agency will issue a \"determination of nonsignificance (DNS).\" WAC 197-11-340(1). A DNS does not require an EIS. WAC 197-11-330 ; WAC 197-11-970.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b619 Under WAC 197-11-350, the lead agency may impose mitigation conditions on an applicant's proposal to reduce impacts. A DNS with mitigated conditions is called an MDNS. WAC 197-11-350, - 766. A formal EIS is not required with an MDNS.\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

MDNS AND SEPA CHECKLIST - ROADWORK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \u00b631 The City argues that based on the plain language of the regulations, it is an \"agency with jurisdiction\" over the Knutson\n   proposal because it has authority to \"approve ... parts of the proposal\" that require road improvements and construction. Br. of Appellant at 17;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   WAC 197-11-714(3), - 948. The City argues that these road improvements and construction meet the definition of a proposal, which includes \"both actions and regulatory decisions of agencies as well as any actions proposed by applicants.\" WAC 197-11-784. Respondents argue that the road improvements and construction are not part of the proposed Knutson project because they are imposed mitigation conditions and because the road construction will inevitably occur anyway. Therefore, the Respondents assert that the City is not an \"agency with jurisdiction.\" We agree with the City that it is an \"agency with jurisdiction\" because it has approval authority over the road improvements and construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b632 The Knutson proposal is dependent on altering and constructing city roads, intersections, and sidewalks. This is reflected in the County's MDNS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \u00b633 The MDNS is conditioned on the design and construction of a new city road, new city road improvements, and a new city traffic signal. For example, one condition in the MDNS for the Knutson proposal states, \"If not already constructed, the applicant will design and construct 5th Avenue SE to City of Puyallup roadway standards between Shaw Road East and 33rd Street SE.\" CP at 155. The City argues that it must issue permits or approvals for the new road construction and improvements under the Puyallup Municipal Code (PMC), and therefore it is an \"agency with jurisdiction\" over part of the proposal based on the plain meaning of the regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bellevue Farm Owners Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1362991\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/100/341/\">\n    100 Wash.

Respondents contend that an \"agency with jurisdiction\" does not include agencies merely impacted by a proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b636 The City responds by asserting that the regulations broadly define a \"proposal\" to include \"both actions and regulatory decisions of agencies as well as any actions proposed by applicants.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   WAC 197-11-784.

Reply Br. of Appellant at 7. The City notes that the initial SEPA checklist and transportation impact required alteration and construction of roads as part of the development plan.

WAC 197-11-714(3). The roads are \"part of [the] proposal.\" WAC 197-11-714(3). \"A proposal includes both actions and regulatory decisions of agencies as well as any actions proposed by applicants.\" WAC 197-11-784. \"A proposal exists ... when an agency is presented with an application, or has a goal and is actively preparing to make a decision on one or more alternative means of accomplishing that goal, and the environmental effects can be meaningfully evaluated.\" WAC 197-11-784.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b639 The Applicants submitted changes to and construction of the city streets as part of the proposal even before the County issued the MDNS. The initial SEPA checklist and transportation impact required alteration and construction of roads as part of the development plan. This part of the proposal was an action proposed by the Applicants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WAC 197-11-784. Additionally, the County, as lead agency, required road improvements in its MDNS. This is an \"action[ ] and regulatory decision[ ]\" of the agency. WAC 197-11-784. As a result, we hold that based on the plain meaning of the regulation, the road improvements are part of the proposal and the City is an \"agency with jurisdiction\" because it has authority to approve part of the proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   b. ALREADY COMPLETED ROADWORK\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \u00b640 Furthermore, the Respondents argue that most of the road improvements contemplated for the Knutson project will already be completed as part of another proposed project, the Schnitzer West project, and therefore they are not part of the Knutson project proposal. The MDNS for the Schnitzer West project requires construction of 5th Avenue SE as a fully functioning two-way road from Shaw Road to 33rd Street SE, including the Shaw Road intersection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   \u00b641 Respondents cite to the traffic analysis submitted by Applicants, which says that street improvements will occur \" 'if [the Knutson Project] develops prior to the Van Lierop industrial project [aka Schnitzer West].' \" Joint Br. of Resp'ts at 26 (underlining omitted) (last alteration in original). They also cite to the MDNS, which says, \" '\n   <em>\n    If not already constructed\n   </em>\n   , the applicant will design and construct 5th Avenue SE to City of Puyallup roadway standards between Shaw Road East and 33rd Street SE.' \" Joint Br. of Resp'ts at 27 (emphasis added). They contend, \"Knutson's participation in road construction is more akin to participation in traffic impact fees.\" Joint Br. of Resp'ts at 27. They state that the impacts to the City are already being addressed through the County's SEPA process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   \u00b642 In reply, the City argues that even if some of these road improvements are part of the Schnitzer West development, that development does not negate the City's permitting authority over the roads and does not negate the need for SEPA review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \u00b643 We agree with the City because the City's permits are necessary for the roadwork the Knutson project requires. Further, nothing in the record supports the Respondent's argument that most of the roadwork will already be completed as part of another project.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Respondents' arguments that the roadwork will already be completed are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   \u00b644 In conclusion, we hold that based on the plain meaning of WAC 197-11-948, the City is an \"agency with jurisdiction\" over the Knutson proposal because it has authority to\n   approve the required roadwork that is part of the proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   2. CITY'S APPROVAL AUTHORITY OVER WATER AND SEWER SERVICES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   a. THE CITY IS AN AGENCY WITH JURISDICTION BASED ON SEWER AND WATER SERVICE APPROVALS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   \u00b645 The City argues that it is also an \"agency with jurisdiction\" because it has authority to \"approve, veto, or finance sewer and water service for the Knutson proposal.\" Br. of Appellant at 18. Respondents argue that the City is acting as a \"service provider[ ]\" and in a \"proprietary capacity,\" which does not make it an \"agency with jurisdiction.\" Joint Br. of Resp'ts at 29.

CITY ACTING AS A SERVICE PROVIDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   \u00b651 Respondents argue that the City is a \"service provider\" and, therefore, the City is not an \"agency with jurisdiction.\" We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   \u00b652 To support their argument that the City is a service provider, Respondents note that \"Puyallup is providing water for the Knutson proposal at its own insistence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Joint Br. of Resp'ts at 28. Respondents agree that the Knutson project is partially within the City's water service area and partially within the Valley Water District, but Respondents argue that the City was not willing to modify its service area to allow for a single provider for water. Respondents also contend that other service providers for the proposal include Puget Sound Energy, CenturyLink, Comcast, and DM Disposal and that the City is no different from these providers. Respondents make the policy argument that the City's position would allow any service provider to assume control of the SEPA review process, which would foster delay and disrupt the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   \u00b653 Respondents do not cite to any case law or authority that say that an agency that has approval authority over permits and also serves as a service provider cannot be an \"agency with jurisdiction\" under WAC 197-11-948.

PRINCIPLES OF LAW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   \u00b661 WAC 197-11-948 sets forth the conditions for an agency to issue a notice of assumption of lead agency status. WAC 197-11-948(1) provides that \"[a]n agency with jurisdiction over a proposal,\n   <em>\n    upon review of a DNS ( WAC 197-11-340 )\n   </em>\n   may transmit to the initial lead agency a completed 'Notice of assumption of lead agency status.' \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b662 Our Supreme Court has explained this provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   SEPA Rules allow an agency which is \"dissatisfied\" with a lead agency's DNS to assume lead agency status and make its own threshold determination. WAC 197-11-600(3)(a) ; WAC 197-11-948. Under the SEPA Rules, therefore, non-lead agencies are not constrained to accept a lead agency DNS but instead may make an independent determination as to whether they are \"dissatisfied\" with the lead agency's decision. Boundary review boards and other agencies subject to SEPA requirements should use this authority to ensure proper compliance with SEPA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <em>\n    King County v.

The City claims that \"[i]nstead the citation recognizes that the process that triggers the fourteen-day period for assuming lead agency status-'review of a DNS'-occurs under WAC 197-11-340, which encompasses MDNSs.\" Br. of Appellant at 31-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   \u00b672 Respondents argue that WAC 197-11-948 's reference to WAC 197-11-340(2)(a) does not extend the scope of the assumption regulation's authorization to include an MDNS. Respondents argue that WAC 197-11-340(2) establishes procedural requirements, which also apply to an MDNS. They argue that since \"it is purely procedural; it provides no mechanism to issue an MDNS.\" Joint Br. of Resp'ts at 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   \u00b673 The City replies that neither WAC 197-11-340 nor WAC 197-11-350 defines a DNS or an MDNS; instead, they are two procedural provisions that work together. The City emphasizes that the procedural nature of WAC 197-11-350 is reflected in how an MDNS is defined as a \"DNS that includes mitigation measures and is issued as a result of the process in WAC 197-11-350.\" WAC 197-11-766.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   \u00b674 We agree with the City that neither WAC 197-11-340 nor WAC 197-11-350 define an MDNS, but instead they are two procedural provisions.

WAC 197-11-508 AND WAC 197-11-970\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   \u00b675 In support of its position, the City argues that WAC 197-11-508 and WAC 197-11-970 do not distinguish between MDNSs and DNSs. The City argues that even though these regulations do not specifically say MDNS or cite to the MDNS regulation WAC 197-11-350, there is still a notice and comment period for an MDNS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   WAC 197-11-340(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   \u00b676 WAC 197-11-508(1)(a) requires a SEPA register for \"notice of all environmental documents\" and refers to only \"DNSs under WAC 197-11-340(2).\" WAC 197-11-970 states that when a \"DNS is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2),\" the notice and comment period is 14 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   \u00b677 The City is correct in that WAC 197-11-508 and WAC 197-11-970 do not distinguish between a DNS and an MDNS. Instead, they refer to DNSs under WAC 197-11-340(2). As explained above WAC 197-11-340(2)(iv) refers to \"[a] DNS under WAC 197-11-350 [the MDNS regulation].\" This support's the City's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   d. County's MDNS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   \u00b678 The City also notes that the County issued its April 26, 2017 MDNS under WAC 197-11-340. This WAC does not refer to WAC 197-11-350 (the regulation for the MDNS process). The County's MDNS states that it is issued under WAC 197-11-340(2), which is the same regulation the Respondents associate with a DNS eligible for assumption ( WAC 197-11-340 ). Thus, it appears that the County acknowledged at least in its issuance of its MDNS that an MDNS is a type of DNS. We agree with the City that this supports the City's argument that MDNS is \"a DNS ( WAC 197-11-340 ).\" WAC 197-11-948(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   e. COURT AND BOARD DECISIONS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b679 Furthermore, the City also says that courts have never suggested that a distinction exists between DNSs and MDNSs for purposes of lead agency assumption.
