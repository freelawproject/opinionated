Miller is the owner of Tract 241 of the Rainbow Subdivision of Bozeman Hot Springs, which she purchased and has lived on since 1989. Miller bought and owned the tract jointly with her husband, William, until his death in 2008. Kleppens are the owners of Tract 242 of the Subdivision, which they purchased pursuant to a contract for deed and obtained record title to in 2000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b63 In July 1999, Kleppens initiated an action against Millers in Gallatin County Justice Court, alleging Millers had erected improvements to their tract that extended onto Kleppens' tract. In November 1999, after participating in mediation through the Justice Court, the parties entered into a settlement, first memorialized by a hand-written agreement and diagram, wherein they agreed to a boundary realignment of their common boundary line between Tracts 241 and 242 by exchanging equal amounts of property. The diagram depicted the intended boundary realignment and notes about the property. As the District Court found, the handwritten agreement contemplated a formal Stipulation, which was typed and then signed by the parties on December 1, 1999. The Stipulation provided the following description of the revised property line intended by the parties, referring to the handwritten diagram:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   From Point A, as set forth on the agreed upon diagram, the new property line will head southernly to a distance eight feet to the direct south of the furthest southernly point of Miller mobile home, hence west to a point directly north of Point B, hence directly north to Point B. The area encompassed by the new property line as it traverses Kleppen's Lot will be computed. The new property line will then traverse Miller's lot by beginning at Point A, heading northernly for a distance, hence easternly a distance until it intersects the easternly boundary line of Miller's Lot. The amount the new property line will traverse Miller's Lot will be determined by adjusting the lines so that the same amount of acreage taken from the Kleppen Lot will be taken from the\n   Miller Lot.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 To accomplish the boundary realignment, the Stipulation provided that the parties would: (1) obtain a mutually acceptable surveyor to complete a property line readjustment to be filed with the Gallatin County Clerk and Recorder, with costs to be split equally between the parties; (2) construct a fence along the new boundary realignment on or before June 15, 2000, with costs to be split equally between the parties and \"Miller\" performing the labor at no cost to Kleppens; (3) remove Millers' basketball hoop from Kleppens' property, to be completed by Millers; and (4) address bushes currently on the property line. The Stipulation provided that \"[w]hen the fence construction is complete the attorneys for both parties will file a motion with this Court for an Order of Dismissal with prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 Following execution of the Stipulation, Millers removed the basketball hoop as required by the Stipulation. Over the years thereafter, Kleppens watered, mowed, and fertilized the property they were to gain under the Stipulation, and Millers mowed, sprayed weeds, and trimmed the trees on the portion they were to gain under the Stipulation. However, neither party retained a surveyor to complete the boundary realignment or purchased materials to complete the construction of the fence, and therefore, the boundary realignment was never recorded in Gallatin County, and the fence was not built.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b66 The District Court found that, \"[f]rom December 1, 1999 through May 7, 2016, neither party expressed or acted in a manner contrary to the ownership and boundary realignment terms of the Stipulation,\" and that \"[n]either party acted in a manner that suggest[ed] they did not intend to complete the terms of the Stipulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b67 On May 8, 2016, Kleppen approached Shannon Miller and asked her to remove her power pole, gas meter, pump house, and two trees from \"his property\"-property that was to be transferred to Miller under the Stipulation. Kleppens placed stakes and a string-line in the ground to mark the original boundary line, and cut down two trees in the area that was to be transferred to Miller. The District Court found these actions were \"the first notification to Miller that the Kleppens no longer intended to abide by the terms of the Stipulation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b68 In June 2016, Miller filed this action in the Gallatin County District Court, seeking specific performance of the Stipulation. Kleppens counterclaimed in trespass, and sought removal of Miller's property improvements. The District Court conducted a bench trial and held in favor of Miller, reasoning that Kleppens did not challenge the validity of the Stipulation, and did not assert any defenses that would support rescinding the Stipulation; that both parties partially\n   performed their agreement; that the statute of limitations for breach of contract did not begin to run until Miller first learned of Kleppens' intention to not comply with the Stipulation, on May 8, 2016, and that Miller could not have learned of the breach prior to that time. The District Court ruled Miller was entitled to specific performance and dismissed Kleppens' trespass claim. The District Court ordered the parties to complete a survey of the property within 90 days of the order, and to construct a fence within 90 days of completion of the survey.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b69 Kleppens appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b610 \"In an action tried without a jury, we review the district court's findings of fact under the clearly erroneous standard.

Kleppens pose that Miller knew by June 15, 2000-the date provided in the Stipulation for completion of the fence upon the realigned boundary line-that the contract had not been completed, and, therefore, that a breach of contract had occurred.

They argue \"no evidence\" was presented that the parties embraced the new property allocations made by the Stipulation, \"other than by supposedly mowing, watering, fertilizing and weeding,\" and that the \"only act\" carried out by the parties in furtherance of the Stipulation was removal of the basketball hoop by the Millers, which they characterize as \"of little consequence.\" Therefore, they contend that \"[f]or 16 \u00bd years the Kleppens believed that the Millers had no intention of moving forward with the stipulation[,]\" and thus the eight-year period of limitation for a breach of contract action expired in 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b615 Kleppens' factual argument offered to support accrual of the breach of contract claim in 2000 is a broad substitution of their view of the evidence for the District Court's. In direct contrast, the District Court found there had been a 16-year period of acquiescence by the parties, in which they acted only in ways consistent with the terms of the Stipulation, including removal of the basketball hoop and maintenance of the properties they respectively were to gain, and thus partially performed the Stipulation. Even after the June 5, 2000, deadline passed, the parties continued to act in partial execution of the Stipulation. Moreover, the District Court found that neither party had acted in a manner that suggested they did not intend to complete what the District Court determined were the \"mutual obligations\" of the parties under the Stipulation, until Kleppens' actions on May 8, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wicklund v.

This language, along with the diagram itself, provided a very clear description of the small portions of property\n   the parties were trading, as well as the new boundary line.

Again, Kleppens base this contention upon their view of the evidence, asserting the Millers \"resisted removal of [their] encroachments until they finally got Tim Kleppen to agree to a boundary relocation so that the encroachments could remain.\" However, there is no finding by the District Court or evidentiary support for the idea that Millers secured the Stipulation for the purpose of remaining unlawfully on Kleppens' property. To the contrary, because there is a valid contract between the parties, and a record of partial performance and acquiescence, Miller retained the right under the Stipulation to remain on the Kleppen property pending completion of the Stipulation. Thus, the District Court did not err by dismissing the trespass claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \u00b625 Affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We concur:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   MIKE McGRATH, C.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   LAURIE McKINNON, J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   DIRK M.
