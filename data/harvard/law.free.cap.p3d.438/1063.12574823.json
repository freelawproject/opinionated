He appeals his convictions and sentences on multiple grounds. For the reasons given below, we affirm all of his convictions. As further discussed below, a majority of this court also rejects Schierman's challenges to his death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 However, I would hold that two critical, erroneous evidentiary rulings during Schierman's penalty phase proceedings require reversal of that death sentence. That would ordinarily require a remand for a resentencing hearing. I therefore go on to conduct our court's statutorily required proportionality review. I conclude that imposition of the death penalty on Schierman violates our state statutory guaranty against disproportionate capital sentencing. For the reasons given in this opinion, I would reverse Schierman's death sentences and remand for imposition of the only statutorily permissible penalty: four consecutive sentences of life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 On the morning of July 17, 2006, officials responded to a fire at the home of Leonid and Olga Milkin, a married couple. When firefighters eventually extinguished the flames, they found the bodies of Olga, Olga's sister Lyuba, and Leonid and Olga's two young sons, Andrew and Justin. The women's bodies appeared to have been undressed or\n   partially undressed at the time of the fire. At the time of the fire, Leonid\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was stationed overseas. An investigation revealed that someone had used accelerants to set the fire, and autopsies revealed that each victim had been stabbed to death before the fire began.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 On the morning of the fire, witnesses observed someone who looked like the defendant, Conner Schierman, carrying a gas can in front of the Milkin home. Police contacted Schierman and observed that he had scratches and cuts on his face, head, and neck. Schierman told them that he had intervened in a domestic dispute in the early morning hours of July 17 and had been hurt in the process. Police subsequently discovered a videotape of Schierman filling a gas can at a nearby AMPM on the morning of the fire. Eventually, Schierman agreed to come to the police station, where he made three taped statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 In his third statement, Schierman admitted to being in the Milkin home. He said that he woke up on the morning of July 17 covered in blood, lying in an upstairs bedroom in the Milkins' home and unable to remember how he had gotten there. He stated that he walked around the house, discovered the four bodies, showered and changed his clothes, and decided to bum down the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b66 That statement to police was largely consistent with a later statement that Schierman made to defense expert Dr. Andrew Saxon. Schierman told Dr. Saxon that he started drinking in the early evening of July 16, continued drinking all evening, and went into an alcoholic blackout some time during that night. He said that he woke up bloody on a strange bed some time during the morning of July 17, and discovered a woman's body in a pool of blood. But Schierman also told Dr. Saxon that he moved the woman's body and continued to drink while he stayed in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b67 Eventually, forensic investigators discovered Schierman's DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) in the Milkin home. Investigators\n   also found a pair of gloves in the home, which a witness identified as belonging to Schierman. When Leonid was permitted to return to his house, he found a fire-damaged knife, which he did not recognize, in the remaining debris. Police discovered that Schierman had purchased an identical knife several months earlier. Leonid also discovered a pair of men's shoes, recovered from an undamaged section of the basement. Schierman had purchased an identical pair the previous November. Finally, police also found three empty vodka bottles in a backpack in Schierman's bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b68 The State charged Schierman with four counts of aggravated murder in the first degree and one count of arson in the first degree. Jury selection began on November 13, 2009, and the jury panel was seated two months later, on January 12, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \u00b69 The guilt phase of the trial lasted another three months. The defense conceded that Schierman committed arson, but argued that he panicked and set fire to the house to avoid being accused of murders that he did not commit. Schierman was convicted as charged. The penalty phase lasted almost one month; the jury voted to impose the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b610 The facts relevant to each of Schierman's assignments of error are summarized in the appropriate section below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   GUILT PHASE ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I. Some of the Trial Court's Juror Eligibility Determinations Violated Schierman's Right To Presence (under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments and Article I, Sections 3 and 22); Any Error, However, Was Harmless\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b611 Schierman argues that two separate phases of juror selection violated his right to presence. The first phase to which he assigns error lasted from late September 2009 to\n   mid-November 2009. During that time, counsel met with King County's jury services manager to review, and sometimes agree to, potential jurors' preliminary hardship excusal requests. Schierman was not present during these meetings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b612 The second phase of juror selection to which Schierman assigns error took place on January 12, 2010, the last day of voir dire. During this phase, counsel met with the trial judge in chambers, where counsel argued, and the judge ruled on, several for-cause juror challenges. Schierman was not present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 Schierman argues that excluding him from both phases violated his right to presence under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and article I, sections 3 and 22 of the Washington State Constitution. We conclude that he had no right to presence when his attorneys reviewed juror declarations in the nonadversarial setting of the jury administrator's office. We conclude that he did have a right' to presence during the hearing on for-cause challenges, but that the error does not require reversal. Because the facts concerning these proceedings are relevant to both the presence claim (discussed here) and the courtroom closure claim (discussed below), we describe those facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    1. Preliminary Excusals for Hardship (Late September to Mid-November 2009)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b614 The documents in the record on this appeal show that in late September 2009, jury summonses were issued to 3,000 people, directing them to report for service on November 13, 2009. A summons recipient could respond by confirming that he or she would appear or by submitting a declaration that he or she was unqualified or unable to serve. The recipients were told that their responses were made under penalty of perjury. Judge Gregory Canova\n   directed the jury services manager for King County, Gregory Wheeler, to review declarations of hardship with the prosecutor and defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b615 Per King County Superior Court's general policy, potential jurors could get hardship excusals for disability, age, a severe financial burden, or prior jury service, or because the potential juror was a single parent with young children not attending day care. Due to the anticipated length of Schierman's trial, it was also contemplated that jurors might be excused for reasons that normally warrant only a deferral, e.g., travel plans, employment, or school. Wheeler conducted a preliminary review of the potential\n   juror responses and created two stacks of excusal requests: one for \"those that were clearly meant to be excused per court policy\" and one for \"requests noting a hardship of a less-than-obvious nature.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 21347-48. He then met separately with the prosecution and defense regarding both categories of hardship request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b616 If everyone agreed that a declaration stated a \"hardship\" as defined by official court policy, Wheeler excused the potential juror without further review by the court. If the parties disagreed, Wheeler saved the disputed hardship request so that Judge Canova could review it at a hearing. This process went on between October 19 and November 6, 2009.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b617 The particular proceedings from which Schierman claims he was excluded were the times when his lawyers, without the State's lawyers,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   went to an administrative office in the courthouse to look at either hard copies of or a computer screen displaying summoned jurors' e-mailed hardship requests (for reasons not clear on this record, the screen could not be downloaded).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Schierman says that he\n   was never present at any of these early hardship excusal reviews or conferences. The State does not dispute that assertion. Schierman was present, however, at all the hearings over disputed hardship requests. Thus, there is no claim that Schierman was deprived of the right to presence at any court proceeding or at any noncourt adversarial proceeding. Instead, Schierman claims only that he was excluded from office visits where attorneys looked at a screen or papers for information. Appellant's Opening Br. at 17-18 (\"The judge made it clear that he would not review the individual hardship requests if the parties were in agreement.... Schierman was never present when the attorneys\n   <em>\n    dealt with\n   </em>\n   these hardship requests.\" (emphasis added)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b618 Following this preliminary procedure, the venire was sworn, on the record, on November 13, 2009. On that day, prospective jurors completed the questionnaire \"designed to let [them] tell the court and the lawyers about [themselves] and about [their] views on a variety of issues.\" Verbatim Report of Proceedings (VRP) (Nov. 13, 2009) at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    2. For-Cause Challenges in Chambers (January 12, 2010)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \u00b619 The record tells us quite a bit more about the challenges for cause conducted in chambers-with both sets of attorneys, the judge, and the court reporter, but without Schierman-than it tells us about what occurred during the preliminary hardship excusal reviews. The facts of the in-chambers challenges are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \u00b620 On January 11, 2010, the last day scheduled for voir dire, 70 potential jurors remained in the pool. At the end of that day, Schierman challenged six jurors for cause: Jurors 25, 44, 58, 76, 104, and 171. The court heard argument from both parties on those challenges, but deferred ruling so that\n   the parties could further question the six jurors on the following day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b621 On the following day, the State questioned Jurors 25 and 58. When that questioning was over, Judge Canova stated, in open court, that he would rule \"back in[ ] chambers\" on a number of hardship and for-cause challenges to potential jurors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   The next thing is that counsel and I are going to go with the court reporter briefly back into chambers, I'm going to rule on a number of requests for hardship that have been received by the court, I'm also going to rule on a number of challenges for cause that are before the court, that is, requests to excuse jurors for different reasons from counsel. That will take less than ten minutes, and at the conclusion of that I will advise all of you who have been excused, if anyone, and we will then proceed to have counsel exercise their peremptory challenges,\n   that is the selection of the jury will follow.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   VRP (Jan. 12, 2010) at 15-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b622 The minute entry for that same day confirms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Defendant and respective counsel present\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   Voir dire continues\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Court and counsel meet in chambers re hardship and challenges\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Court excuses\n   <em>\n    #\n   </em>\n   424, 356, 265, 218, 172, 168, 130, 104, 79, 25 (and 208 separately)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   As counsel exercise written peremptory challenges, the Court preliminarily instructs and admonishes the potential jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   CP at 10402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b623 Following the judge's statement and the docket notation about meeting with \"counsel\" in chambers regarding challenges for cause, counsel from both sides went into chambers with the judge and the court reporter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In chambers,\n   the judge asked the State's position on jurors 25 and 58. The State opposed a for-cause challenge to both jurors. The judge nevertheless dismissed jurors 25 and 58 for cause because they indicated that they would hold it against Schierman if he did not testify. The defense also challenged jurors 76, 171, 104, and 44 for cause based on statements that they would not \"consider alcohol as contributing to mental state or lesser mental state.\" VRP (Jan. 12, 2010) at 20. Judge Canova denied all four challenges because he did not think the jurors' statements indicated an inability to be \"fair and impartial\" jurors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-22. He also granted hardship requests to Jurors 49, 79, 130, 172, 265, 356, and 424. He denied hardship requests to Jurors 104, 168, 218, 267, and 285. The judge, lawyers, and court reporter then went back out to the open courtroom, and the judge explained what had just occurred in chambers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   The following jurors have been excused: Juror number 424, juror number 356, juror number 265, juror number 218, juror number 172, juror number 168, juror number 130, juror number 104, juror number 79, juror number 58, juror number 49, juror number 25.

Irby,\n   </em>\n   which recognized a defendant's right to presence at\n   <em>\n    for-cause\n   </em>\n   eligibility determinations made\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   jurors submitted written answers to juror questionnaires.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013239\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/170/874/#p884\">\n    170 Wash.2d 874\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 884,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=246%20P.3d%20796\">\n    246 P.3d 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).

The temptation created by that approach, to excuse procedural violations as harmless after the fact, leads predictably to the result that procedural rights become entirely unenforceable.

The policy implications of such a rule are troubling: it creates an incentive for appellate courts to find more and more proceedings exempt from Sixth Amendment and article I, section 10 protections altogether.

But in this case, the 10-minute meeting in chambers, which was contemporaneously memorialized and publicly announced immediately afterward, and occurred without testimony and without objection, cannot be said to have meaningfully undermined public confidence or participation in the judicial system. Indeed, it is more realistic to say that reversing four convictions for aggravated murder resulting from a months-long trial on the basis of a 10-minute in-chambers discussion-which the parties apparently agreed to and which resulted in no testimony, no evidence, and no secrets-would be more likely to diminish public confidence in the judiciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   \u00b662 For these reasons, we adopt a limited de minimis exception to our rule of automatic reversal for all violations of the public trial right.

Wheeler believed that the paralegal was an attorney from defense counsel's office, although the paralegal did not actually state that she was an attorney. Wheeler told the paralegal that the State did not object to granting hardship requests for approximately 100 individuals.

In this case, the trial court established a hardship determination procedure that afforded both parties an opportunity to object. One of the steps in that procedure was that the lawyers could view juror\n   hardship determinations-some of which came in online and some of which came in on paper-in the jury administrators' office. The State and the defense did go to that office, but they went separately. They looked at declarations there, just as they might look at declarations in the privacy of their own offices. Then, based on their record review, they informed the administrator and the judge about whether a hearing was necessary. Every time a party requested a hearing, the request was granted.

The defense objected that it would be prejudiced if the State were permitted to amend the information.

The amended information is identical to the original information except that it alleges the full aggravating circumstance listed in RCW 10.95.020(10) : \"There was more than one victim\n   <em>\n    and the murders were part of a common scheme or plan or the result of a single act of the person\n   </em>\n   .\" CP at 6766-68 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   \u00b682 The State filed a new death penalty notice on the same day (November 3, 2009).

Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   \u00b683 Schierman argues that the original information did not properly charge him with aggravated first degree murder, that the original notice of special sentencing proceeding was therefore invalid, and that the subsequent notice of special sentencing proceeding was therefore untimely.

Schierman does not point to any defect in the content or timing of the original notice of special sentencing proceeding. He identifies instead a defect in the information, i.e., that it failed to specifically allege that the murders were \"part of a common scheme or plan or the result of a single act of the person.\" CP at 6764-68. That is not a defect in the death notice. And, in fact, the information did contain the \"common scheme or plan\" language-just not in the usual place. Its failure to include the \"single act of the person\" language is not a defect in the content, filing, or service of the death notice. RCW 10.95.020(10).

The Trial Court Did Not Violate Due Process Protections by Permitting the State To Argue That There Was Circumstantial Evidence of Sexual Motivation\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   \u00b6116 Schierman argues that the trial court violated due process protections by permitting the State to argue that there was circumstantial evidence of a sexual motivation for the murders. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   A. Facts :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   \u00b6117 On December 30, 2009, the State served the defense with a \"Supplemental Memorandum And Materials In Support Of Admission Of Crime Scene And Autopsy Photographs That Include Images Of The Victims.\" CP at 7200 (italics omitted). The memorandum contained a list of photographs and corresponding expert witness \"Declaration[s]\" interpreting the images therein. CP at 7231. According to the defense, some of the interpretations suggested\n   the State's intent to \"assert[ ] some type of sexual motivation.\" CP at 7201-02. Of particular concern was medical examiner Dr. Richard Harruff's description of photograph 2548, which read as follows: \"Shows the victims' legs are spread apart, in all likelihood not a result of the fire but probably reflects positioning prior to the fire; this photo also shows a flashlight in the debris.\" CP at 7232. The defense believed this description contradicted statements Dr. Harruff made in a 2007 defense interview to the effect that he found nothing unusual about the posing of the victims' bodies and attributed their positioning to the \"thermal effect\" of the house fire. CP at\n   7203-04 (boldface omitted). It also argued that any attempt by the prosecution to present a sexual motivation theory directly conflicted with the State's earlier stipulation that \"there is no physical evidence of sexual assault of any of [the] victims.\" CP at 7202 (underline omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   \u00b6118 The defense moved the court to sanction the prosecution, strike the jury pool, and continue the trial, arguing that it needed time to respond to what it deemed a completely new theory by the prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court set arguments on the issue for January 19, 2010, one week after jury selection was scheduled to begin. When defense counsel argued that the motions should be decided before jury selection began, the trial court ordered that \"there will be no evidence presented of sexual motivation or sexual assault, consistent with this Court's prior rulings and the prior representations of counsel for the State that that was not an issue in the case.\" VRP (Jan. 11, 2010) at 7. The court then stated that it would await the State's briefing and the defense reply before addressing the matter further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   \u00b6119 When the State filed its motion in response, it asserted that it had never agreed not to pursue a sexual motivation theory. Instead, it said it had agreed only that \"\n   <em>\n    there is no physical evidence of sexual assault\n   </em>\n   .\" CP at 7347 (boldface omitted). It also argued that the defense had known \"for literally years\" about the circumstantial evidence of a sexual motive, and that there was no legitimate reason for defense counsel to suddenly express concern over the State's intent to pursue this line of argumentation. The State cited\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   the defendant's sexual comments, on the night of the murder, about one of the women across the street; the defendant's sexual banter in his email communications late into the night of July 16, 2006; the condition of Olga's body, which was found naked, on her back and with her legs spread; the condition of [Lyuba]'s body, which was found virtually naked, with the one article of remaining clothing, her tank top, pushed above her breasts; and the presence of a probable fire trailer consisting of women's underwear in Alla Botvina's\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   bedroom in the basement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   CP at 7348 (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   \u00b6120 The trial court denied the defense motion for sanctions, for a continuance, and to strike the jury pool. It rejected defense counsel's argument that voir dire would have been conducted differently if the defense had known about the sexual motivation theory. The trial court instead agreed with the State that the defense had received ample notice that there was \"circumstantial evidence of a sexual motive.\" VRP (Jan. 19, 2010) at 147. This evidence was, according to the trial court, crime scene photos showing that Olga's and Botvina's bodies had been found nude or mostly nude, the presence at the crime scene of a \"probable fire trailer consisting of women's underwear,\" and allegations that the defendant made sexual comments about one\n   of the victims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 148-49. The trial court also ruled that the State had not offered, and would not be allowed to present, any expert testimony regarding such a motive. Finally, the trial court ruled that the defense could re-interview Dr. Harruff on the contradiction between his initial statements and subsequent declaration regarding the positioning of the victims' bodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   B. Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   \u00b6121 The State argues that it never misled the defense regarding its intent to argue sexual motivation, and that it stipulated that there was no evidence of sexual assault only to prevent the defense from independently testing vaginal swabs taken from the adult victims. The record supports that contention. CP at 4448-56 (\"State's\n   Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Independently Test Extracts from Vaginal Swabs (Y-STR Testing)\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   \u00b6122 Further, with the exception of Dr. Harruff's statement regarding the positioning of the victims' legs, Schierman does not allege that the State withheld any sexual-motivation-related evidence. The trial court permitted the defense to re-interview Dr. Harruff about his statement prior to trial, and Dr. Harruff ultimately offered no testimony that the victims' legs were positioned apart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   \u00b6123 As for the trial court's statement that the prosecution would not be allowed to argue a sexual motivation theory, we agree with the State that this was a \"passing comment ... based on a misunderstanding-later corrected.\" Br. of Resp't at 125. As the trial court explained when it ruled on this issue, the State never requested any \"special finding\" of a \"sexual motivation.\" VRP (Jan. 19, 2010) at 149-50. In that respect,\n   <em>\n    the fact\n   </em>\n   of sexual motivation was not at issue in the case, but this did not mean that the State agreed not to argue any sexual motivation\n   <em>\n    theory.\n   </em>\n   Schierman argues now that he \"reasonably understood\n   <em>\n    the prosecutor's stipulation\n   </em>\n   [regarding sexual assault] to mean that sexual motivation would not be an issue at trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Appellant's Reply Br. at 36 (emphasis added). But that is not a reasonable response to the State's stipulation regarding sexual assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   VIII. The Evidence Was Sufficient To Support the State's Sexual Motivation Argument\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   \u00b6124 Schierman argues that by presenting its sexual motivation theory, the State made prejudicial statements unsupported by the evidence. We disagree; the State's sexual motivation theory was supported by sufficient circumstantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   \u00b6125 Sean Winter, a man who shared a duplex with Schierman and another tenant, Isaac Way, at the time of the murders, testified that Schierman engaged in sexual conversation on various occasions. He stated that when Schierman moved into the house, he asked if there were \"any good-looking women\" in the neighborhood and then specifically asked about \"the blonde across the street.\" VRP (Feb. 9, 2010) at 85. Winter also said that Schierman engaged in \"locker room talk ... about girls\" on the night before the murders, and made a sexual comment in a Russian accent, referring to Olga.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90, 105. Winter testified that on the night before the murders, Schierman had a pornographic video and made a joke about giving a friend a \"blowup doll.\" VRP (Feb. 10, 2010) at 52-54, 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   \u00b6126 Todd Taylor, a computer forensic technician, testified that Schierman had a Myspace chat with someone on the night before the murders, in which he sent and received messages of a sexual nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   \u00b6127 Several witnesses also testified that women's undergarments were found strewn around a basement bedroom in the Milkin home. There was evidence of forced entry through the back basement door of the home. Dr. Harruff, the medical examiner, testified that Olga's and Lyuba's bodies had been found nude or mostly nude, and\n   Kim Duddy, a forensic scientist, testified that Lyuba's clothing had been removed after she was killed. That clothing was found stuffed into a microwave oven vent. Finally, there was evidence that Schierman had an injury on his neck that resembled a ligature mark, and testimony that a necklace identified as Schierman's had Olga's DNA on it. The forensic expert who testified about the DNA explained that he expected to find Schierman's DNA on the whole necklace, but any \"foreign biology ... only on a portion of the necklace,\" and that his test results bore these expectations out. VRP (Feb. 17, 2010) at 29-30, 41-42. He also explained that foreign DNA could occur on a portion of the necklace \"if the necklace was grabbed in some way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   \u00b6128 In the guilt phase closing argument, the prosecutor suggested that Schierman had destroyed evidence of a sexual nature: \"Why pour gasoline on the victims' bodies? What does he know about those bodies that he doesn't want discovered?\" VRP (Apr. 8, 2010) at 75. The prosecutor also referenced most of the evidence noted above:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-206\">\n   Well, we know what was going on Sunday evening. I talked about the comment he\n   knew about the women across the street, he knew about the locker room talk, the joke about the blow-up doll, the defendant bringing out the pornographic movie, Jenna Jamison movie, the e-mail at 9:37 at night, 10:00, a sex party, there's nothing wrong with that, people talk, that's not a condemnation, but taken together, what does it tell us?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-207\">\n   We know what's on the floor of Alla's bedroom, we know where the bodies were found and how they were found inside that room at the top of the stairs.

We know there was trace evidence found on the pajamas that were taken from the microwave, Lyuba's DNA and the defendant's DNA, and there was trace evidence recovered from underneath Lyuba's body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77-78. In addition, the prosecutor also suggested that the location of the ligature mark-high on Schierman's\n   neck-indicated that Schierman \"may have been prone on top of somebody else, and who might that person have been? Whose DNA is on this necklace? Conner Schierman and Olga Milkin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78-79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   \u00b6129 Finally, in the penalty phase, the prosecutor elicited testimony from Schierman's friend Christopher O'Brien that Schierman had referred to the \"hot chick\" across the street.

Schierman alleges that two factors, in combination,\n   rendered his trial inherently unfair: (1) Leonid's testimony that he was deployed in Iraq at the time of the murders and (2) the presence of uniformed military personnel in the courtroom audience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   \u00b6134 Leonid, Olga's husband and Andrew and Justin's father, was a United States soldier stationed in Iraq at the time of the murders. On October 28, 2009, the defense filed \"Defendant's Motion to Preclude Soldiers in Fatigues from\n   Attending Proceedings.\" CP at 6443. It stated that defense counsel expected that uniformed soldiers would attend the trial, and that this expectation was \"based on prior experience on this case, where the usual practice has been for soldiers in fatigues to sit in the courtroom, behind the prosecutor's table, close to and in full view [of] jurors who will not only decide whether Schierman committed the offense, but also whether he will live or die.\" CP at 6444. Defense counsel requested in the alternative that the court permit videotaping of the courtroom audience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   \u00b6135 The trial court heard oral arguments on the motion on November 5, 2009. At that hearing, defense counsel noted that Leonid had been appearing in uniform, acknowledged that \"he ha[d] every right to do so,\" and requested that the court instruct the prosecution not to tell the jury that Leonid had been deployed in Iraq when the murder took place. VRP (Nov. 5, 2009) at 9. The defense requested that the jury be told only that Leonid was out of the country at the time. The State opposed all of the defense motions related to military service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   \u00b6136 The trial court denied the motion to exclude soldiers in uniform from the courtroom. It reasoned that \"the limited presence of military personnel\" did not infringe on Schierman's constitutional rights because it was not a comment on guilt or innocence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20. It also denied defense counsel's alternative motion to permit videotaping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   \u00b6137 The trial court did, however, limit \"references to [Leonid]'s status as follows: That he was in the military, on active duty at that time, and stationed outside of the United States at the time of these crimes.\" VRP (Jan. 20, 2010) at 14. The trial court thus excluded evidence that he was stationed in Iraq.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   \u00b6138 That order was violated almost immediately. At trial, Leonid was the State's first witness. At first, he testified that he was a soldier stationed at Fort Lewis, but then later stated that when the murders occurred he \"came back on emergency leave from Iraq, from overseas.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100, 108. This violated the in limine ruling in Schierman's favor; defense counsel did not call further attention to it, though-he did not object when the violation occurred. Later, the State asked Leonid about his communications with his wife while he was stationed overseas. Leonid responded that \"[s]ometimes my base would be mortared, and that [would] knock out communications.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 167. The defense objected that the testimony was irrelevant. The trial court overruled the objection, and Leonid continued, \"[A]lso, whenever soldiers would get killed, a complete communication blackout would be imposed on our base.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   \u00b6139 After the jury was excused, defense counsel renewed its objection and referred to the in limine ruling, asserting that the State was \"back-dooring in the fact that [Leonid] was fighting overseas.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 170. The trial court asked the prosecutor to explain the relevance of questions about Leonid's communications with his wife. The prosecutor claimed these questions were relevant \"to establish what type of communication was available from inside the Milkin residence, were there land lines, were there cell phones?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 171. But the prosecutor also apologized to defense counsel and the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   \u00b6140 The court directed the prosecutor to have another discussion with Leonid regarding the limits on his testimony. It also told Leonid that if he made further references to his service in Iraq, the court would instruct the jury that he was in violation of a court order. The defense moved for a mistrial and, in the alternative, for a limiting instruction. The court denied the motion for a mistrial, finding that \"the nature of the restrictions is not such that a violation of them ... rises to the level of creating unfair prejudice to the defendant for violating his rights to a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   \u00b6141 The court did give a limiting instruction, though. The following day, Judge Canova admonished the jury to disregard all testimony \"regarding [Leonid] being stationed\n   in a combat zone in July of 2006.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   VRP (Jan. 21, 2010) at 12. Defense counsel stated for the record that \"there are three friends of [Leonid] in uniform in court, and he appeared yesterday in court in uniform.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   \u00b6142 About one month later, defense counsel renewed its objection to the presence of soldiers in uniform: \"Throughout this trial we've had two ordinarily uniformed military people not only sitting in court, but sitting outside ... as jurors come in. ... It happens every day, and ... they sit directly on a bench in front of the doors, as the jurors come in.\" VRP (Feb. 18, 2010) at 10. The court disagreed with that characterization: \"For the record, I have not noticed individuals sitting in front of the doors of the courtroom in military fatigues or otherwise in military uniform except on one or two occasions, including one day earlier this week.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.

Unlike the instructions given in\n   <em>\n    Condon,\n   </em>\n   the instructions given in Schierman's case called the jury's attention to this distinction-and to the defense theory that Schierman was in a state of alcoholic blackout when the murders occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-318\">\n   \u00b6190 This is because even though Schierman's jury was not instructed on manslaughter, it was instructed on voluntary intoxication. That instruction specifically called the jury's attention to Schierman's intoxication evidence, and it specifically told the jury that it could consider this evidence when deciding whether the defendant had premeditated or intended the murders. Having heard this instruction, the jury nevertheless found that Schierman premeditated the murders-that is, it found that he committed the murders with the most conscious and culpable mental state. On this record, and given these instructions, there is only one possible explanation for that verdict: the jury did not credit the theory that an alcoholic blackout diminished Schierman's capacity to premeditate. There is no possibility that a manslaughter instruction would have led the jury to a different conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-319\">\n   \u00b6191 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court erred when it refused to instruct the jury on manslaughter, but that this error was harmless. Having found only one instructional error and that this error is harmless, we also reject Schierman's argument that cumulative instructional error warrants reversal of his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-320\">\n   PENALTY PHASE ISSUES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-321\">\n   \u00b6192 Schierman raises several challenges to his death sentence. We hold that in most respects, the experienced trial court judge correctly applied a complicated set of\n   constitutional and evidentiary rules to a contentious and emotionally charged proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-322\">\n   \u00b6193 However, I disagree with the trial court's decisions to exclude important mitigating evidence proffered by defense expert witnesses. I conclude that those errors require reversal of the death sentences. And they would ordinarily require a remand to permit the State to proceed to a new sentencing phase. But this court is also required by statute to analyze whether imposing a sentence of death in each particular case is proportionate. I further conclude that the sentences of death violate Washington's prohibition on disproportionate capital sentencing. For that reason, I would reverse the sentences of death and remand with instructions to impose the only lawful sentence available for these crimes: four consecutive sentences of life in prison without possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   I. The Exclusion of Certain Mitigating Evidence Violated Schierman's Right to Due Process and Protection against Cruel Punishment under Article I, Sections 3 and 14 of the Washington State Constitution\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   A.

Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   \u00b6194 In opening statements during the penalty phase, the defense mentioned for the first time that it planned to call Dr. Mark Cunningham, a clinical and forensic psychologist, to testify regarding Schierman's lack of future dangerousness in prison. The State objected that the defense had never disclosed its intent to call Dr. Cunningham to testify on any topic other than the phenomenon of alcoholic blackout. The defense submitted an offer of proof later that evening. This offer summarized Dr. Cunningham's proposed testimony on future dangerousness and mentioned a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   \u00b6195 The next day, the trial court found that the defense had no \"possible ... legitimate basis ... for this incredibly untimely disclosure of an absolutely new and previously unrelated scope of expert testimony.\" VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 15-16. The trial court did not, however, penalize Schierman for his lawyers' lateness: it specifically denied a motion\n   to exclude Dr. Cunningham's testimony due to untimely disclosure. Instead, it postponed ruling on admissibility and directed the defense to provide the State with a copy of the proposed PowerPoint presentation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   \u00b6196 That presentation, \"Conner Schierman: Violence Risk Assessment March 2010,\" consisted of 42 slides summarizing and applying data culled from Dr. Cunningham's research on inmates incarcerated throughout the United States. CP at 8302. Many of the slides depicted rates of violence among various groups of inmates in different state and federal prisons. Overall, they conveyed the message that inmates sentenced to death or life without parole are less likely than other inmates to commit violent acts in prison. The presentation culminated in three slides titled \"Individualized Actuarial Likelihood of Conner Schierman Committing a Prison Assault,\" and several slides listing the \"Available Measures to Control Disruptive or Violent Inmates\" in Washington Department of Corrections (DOC) facilities.

The second two slides stated that 0 percent of inmates \"\n   <em>\n    matching\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Schierman\n   </em>\n   ]\" committed serious assaults. CP at 8308.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   \u00b6198 As discussed above, the State moved to exclude Dr. Cunningham's presentation and testimony due to late disclosure and lack of relevance. The trial court did not exclude this evidence for late disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   \u00b6199 The trial court instead excluded it for lack of relevance. It accepted the State's argument on this point, which rested on\n   <em>\n    Morva v.

In that case, the Supreme Court of Virginia held that the same Dr. Cunningham could not provide capital penalty phase testimony about the Virginia DOC's \"security interventions\" because they were not relevant to the defendant's \"character, history, and background.\"\n   <em>\n    Morva,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20329\">\n    278 Va. at 350-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20553\">\n    683 S.E.2d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court acknowledged that testimony on future dangerousness was \"clearly ... allowed\" since lack of future dangerousness is a \"statutorily listed mitigat[ing] circumstance.\" VRP (Apr. 29, 2010) at 22. But it concluded that the majority of the slides in Dr. Cunningham's presentation were \"generic\" and thus irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-332\">\n   \u00b6200 The trial court did not fully explain what it meant by calling the excluded slides \"generic.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. But when it limited Dr. Cunningham's testimony on this basis, the court cited the Virginia case,\n   <em>\n    Morva,\n   </em>\n   with approval:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-333\">\n   I quote from the decision in\n   <em>\n    Morva versus The Commonwealth of Virginia\n   </em>\n   , which is, again, found at page 11 of the State's brief....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-334\">\n   There the Court, while considering the scope of Dr. Cunningham's proffered testimony on this same issue, noted as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-335\">\n   \"To be admissible, evidence relating to a prison environment must connect the specific characteristics of the particular defendant to his future adaptability in the prison environment. It must be evidence peculiar to the defendant's character history and background in order to be relevant to the future dangerousness inquir[y].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-336\">\n   \"Conditions of the prison life and the security measures utilized in the maximum security facility are not relevant to\n   the future dangerousness inquiry, unless such evidence is specific to the defendant on trial and relevant to that specific defendant's ability to adjust in prison life.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-337\">\n   That is a quote taken from page 350 of the\n   <em>\n    Morva\n   </em>\n   opinion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-338\">\n   With that in mind, the court is appropriately limiting Dr. Cunningham's testimony on future dangerousness to those factors; that is, factors which are tailored to Mr. Schierman's situation, his background, everything that would relate to, in Dr. Cunninham's opinion, his ability to not present a risk of violence in the future, impose a\n   risk of danger to other[s], without possibility of parole or life in the Washington State [DOC].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-339\">\n   The vast majority of Dr. Cunninham's slides are generic.

These slides covered topics such as \"Why Conner Schierman is likely to make a positive\n   prison adjustment,\" CP at 8302 (italics omitted); Schierman's \"Employment in Community,\" CP at 8303; \"Constructive Activities in Confinement,\" \"Positive Adjustment to Custody,\" and \"Continuing Relationships with Family and Friends,\" CP at 8304; and rates of inmate assault and homicide in Washington DOC facilities. They also included a slide listing five personal characteristics that reduced Schierman's risk of violence and a slide explaining that \"[p]ast violence in the community is not strongly or consistently associated with prison violence.\" CP at 8306-07.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   \u00b6203 But the ruling excluded all the slides containing the data, culled from prisons throughout the United States that formed the factual basis for Dr. Cunningham's actuarial analysis and conclusion that Schierman posed a statistically low risk of committing violence in prison. Among the slides excluded were the three \"individualized ... actuarial\" likelihood slides comparing Schierman with the inmates from other jurisdictions and concluding that he was unlikely to commit any acts of violence in prison. VRP (Apr. 29, 2010) at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   \u00b6204 The day after the trial court excluded most of Dr. Cunningham's testimony and evidence on future dangerousness, the defense filed a declaration from Dr. Cunningham explaining actuarial methodology and asking the court to reconsider its ruling. The declaration explained that \"there is no\n   <em>\n    individualized\n   </em>\n   assessment of a particular person that does not rest on group data of one sort or another.\" CP at 8266. It explained the importance of the excluded factual data on which Dr. Cunningham's opinion rested by stating, among other things, that \"the statistical prevalence of a particular behavior over a set period of time ... is the fundamental group statistic in risk assessment and is considered to be the single most important piece of data necessary in making an accurate risk estimate.\" CP at 8267-68. It also explained that \"[w]ithout this anchor of a comparative reference point, individual risk\n   estimates at capital sentencing may be little more than speculation.\" CP at 8268. Finally, Dr. Cunningham's declaration also summarized his qualifications, including awards he had won for his scholarship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   \u00b6205 The trial court denied the motion to reconsider. It reasoned that \"Dr. Cunningham is still allowed to testify to the group rates, which he feels are necessary as a concept. The group rates, however, are limited to the group behavior as reflected from statistics for the [DOC] in the State of Washington, not the [DOCs] in the State of Florida, or Texas, or anywhere else.\" VRP (Apr. 30, 2010) at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   \u00b6206 After this ruling and another excluding a second PowerPoint presentation offered in support of Dr. Cunningham's testimony on\n   a different issue (discussed below), the defense decided not to call Dr. Cunningham. During closing argument, the State asserted that Schierman had a problem with authority and would have contact with other inmates in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Without that data, Dr. Cunningham's presentation would have appeared to be weak, unsupported opinion testimony. Given the importance of the excluded evidence, combined with the State's (unrebutted) suggestion to the jury in penalty phase closing argument that Schierman's dangerousness supported a death sentence, this exclusion constituted reversible error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-364\">\n   B.

CP at 8271-84. The first\n   three slides in the presentation juxtapose two columns of questions, one titled \"Criminal Responsibility\" and the other titled \"Moral Culpability.\" CP at 8288. In the \"Criminal Responsibility\" column, four questions appear: \"Could he control himself? Did he have a choice? Did he know right from wrong?

VRP (Apr. 30, 2010) at 9. It concluded that Dr. Cunningham could not testify that any \"adverse developmental factors\" had diminished Schierman's self-control because this would be tantamount to a diminished capacity defense and therefore inconsistent with the guilt phase verdict.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-371\">\n   \u00b6223 The court did rule that Dr. Cunningham could testify to \"the issues relating to moral culpability.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

As Schierman points out, a defendant can commit a murder with intent and premeditation while also being impaired-diminished-in his ability to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct or conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. Indeed, the legislature must have contemplated that exact scenario when it enacted RCW 10.95.070(6) -because that subsection allows the jury to consider that mitigating factor only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   finding that the defendant committed intentional, premeditated murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-385\">\n   \u00b6231 Because diminished self-control or decision-making is a relevant mitigating factor in a capital sentencing proceeding, the trial court erred in excluding Dr. Cunningham's testimony under\n   <em>\n    Guzek.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-386\">\n   c. The trial court's error in excluding Dr. Cunningham's presentation on diminished control requires reversal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-387\">\n   \u00b6232 Like Dr. Cunningham's presentation on lack of future dangerousness, Dr. Cunningham's presentation on diminished control was among the most persuasive mitigating evidence offered during the penalty phase. The vast majority of the other mitigation witnesses were friends or family as opposed to neutral experts. And Dr. Cunningham was the only expert who offered admissible evidence on\n   Schierman's limited capacity for self-control, something that our legislature has specifically identified as relevant in a capital sentencing proceeding. Given the significance of this potentially mitigating evidence, the trial court's error in excluding it requires reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-388\">\n   \u00b6233 The erroneous exclusion of Dr. Cunningham's evidence (on both lack of future dangerousness and diminished self-control) necessitates reversal of Schierman's death sentence. Since I am the only one who would reverse the death sentence, though, I address Schierman's additional penalty phase claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-389\">\n   C. The trial court erred by excluding Dr. Mark McClung's testimony regarding past brain injury\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   <em>\n    1. Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   \u00b6234 On April 27, 2010, the defense offered a letter by Dr. Mark McClung, a forensic psychiatrist, stating that past brain injury might have diminished Schierman's capacities for self-control and anger management. Dr. McClung based this opinion on an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging ) scan of Schierman's brain, conducted in July 2009; a review of that MRI by Dr. Wendy Cohen; neuropsychological testing conducted by Dr. Paul Connor in April of 2010; and Dr. McClung's personal interviews with Dr. Cohen and Dr. Connor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   \u00b6235 Along with Dr. McClung's letter, the defense filed three documents: (1) the MRI scan report, (2) an affidavit by Dr. Richard Adler stating that the MRI reflected a 1997 concussion and that this was \"not the first incidence of brain injury suffered by Conner Schierman,\" CP at 8249-50, and (3) a letter from Dr. Connor to Dr. Adler explaining that Schierman had probably suffered multiple head injuries during his life. Dr. Connor based this opinion on the fact that \"Schierman and his family have reported a number of incidents of domestic violence in which he was struck in the head by his biological father.\" CP at 8257.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   \u00b6236 The State objected to Dr. McClung's testimony on the grounds that it was offered too late and did not meet the\n   <em>\n    Frye\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   standard for scientific reliability. The transcript of the argument on this issue indicates that just as the penalty phase proceedings were beginning, Dr. Adler \"discovered what he considered to be significant information related to a prior brain trauma\" in Schierman's medical records, that defense counsel then marshalled several experts to investigate this discovery, and that the defense finally offered Dr. McClung's opinion about one week after the penalty phase proceedings began. VRP (Apr. 28, 2010) at 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-394\">\n   \u00b6237 Dr. McClung's letter addressed the issue of brain injury in the following, somewhat noncommittal terms:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-395\">\n   Mr. Schierman's brain injury may have had no impact on his subsequent emotions or behavior. However, it is possible that it had an impact on subsequent mood problems and intensity of substance abuse. When Mr. Schierman was intoxicated, the brain injury may have contributed to worsening any problems with loss of inhibitions, interpreting his surroundings, and controlling anger/aggression. Violent offending is correlated with increased incidence of brain injury in offender; however, specific cause-and-effect has not been established in all but a few specific cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   CP at 8260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-397\">\n   \u00b6238 As with Dr. Cunningham's testimony, the State objected to Dr. McClung's testimony on the ground that it was offered too late to permit any meaningful cross-examination. However, as with Dr. Cunningham's testimony, the court did not exclude Dr. McClung's testimony due to late disclosure. Instead, it excluded that testimony as speculative, \"based upon a faulty foundation,\" and not \"expressed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\" VRP (Apr. 29, 2010) at 20, 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-398\">\n   <em>\n    2. Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-399\">\n   \u00b6239 As noted above, the trial court provided two different reasons for excluding Dr. McClung's testimony. First, it concluded that the testimony lacked an adequate factual foundation. Second, it ruled that the testimony did not meet the threshold for admitting expert opinion since it was not expressed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-400\">\n   \u00b6240 With respect to the first conclusion-that Dr. McClung's testimony lacked an adequate factual foundation-I disagree. At the hearing on Dr. McClung's testimony, the trial court spent close to 13 minutes examining the \"chain of other experts and their evaluations\" that Dr. McClung relied on in forming his opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-20. This examination contains medical judgments that the court was not qualified to make. As noted above, Dr. McClung relied on Dr. Connor's neuropsychological testing report, which included Dr. Connor's opinion that Schierman had probably suffered multiple head injuries, at the hands of his biological father, prior to the\n   1997 concussion. According to Dr. Connor, the earlier injuries were significant because they likely worsened the effects of the 1997 concussion: \"It is well documented that multiple head injuries ha[ve] a cumulative effect such that in each subsequent injury, the negative impacts are often greater than would be expected from one head injury in isolation.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 8257. The trial court rejected this theory, ruling that there was no \"foundation\" for any expert's conclusion that Schierman had suffered multiple head injuries. VRP (Apr. 29, 2010) at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-401\">\n   \u00b6241 It is not entirely clear why the court reached that conclusion. Certain parts of the transcript indicate that the court believed the MRI conclusively proved that Schierman\n   had suffered only one brain injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   (According to the offer of proof, the MRI revealed that Schierman had suffered\n   <em>\n    at least\n   </em>\n   one, but not necessary\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   one, concussion.) But the majority of the court's comments on the issue indicate that it just didn't think that Schierman's father hit Schierman hard enough or often enough in the head to sustain any expert's conclusion that Schierman had suffered multiple head injuries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-402\">\n   \u00b6242 This medical conclusion exceeded the trial court's expertise. Both Schierman and his sister told Dr. Cunnningham about an incident in which their biological father picked Schierman up and slammed him face first into a brick hearth. This occurred when Schierman was 9 or 10 years old. Schierman also told Dr. Cunningham that his father often shook him so hard that his head flopped back and forth, and that his father threw him against walls and kicked him down stairs. Schierman's mother reported that Schierman's father slapped him so hard that it left marks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-403\">\n   \u00b6243 It is not clear whether Dr. McClung would have testified that these prior injuries likely worsened the effects of Schierman's documented 1997 concussion-his proposed testimony did not explicitly endorse that particular portion of Dr. Connor's report. But, as a forensic psychiatrist, he was qualified to offer such testimony. The trial court, by contrast, was not qualified to assess the probable medical consequences of Schierman's childhood abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-404\">\n   Therefore, it should not have excluded Dr. McClung's testimony for inadequate \"foundation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-405\">\n   \u00b6244 The trial court's second ruling-that Dr. McClung's opinion was inadmissible because it was not expressed to a reasonable degree of medical certainty-presents a more complicated legal question. Under normal (non-capital-sentencing phase) evidentiary standards, expert medical opinion testimony is inadmissible unless it is expressed to a \"reasonable[ ]medical certainty\" or \"reasonable medical probability.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson v. Akzo Nobel Coatings, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4017923\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/172/593/#p606\">\n    172 Wash.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 606-07,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=260%20P.3d%20857\">\n    260 P.3d 857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). Schierman-understandably-does not argue that Dr. McClung's proposed testimony met this standard. Instead, he argues that the \"reasonable medical certainty\" standard does not apply to mitigating expert testimony in a capital sentencing proceeding. Appellant's Opening Br. at 124.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is a question of first impression for this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-406\">\n   \u00b6245 The \"reasonable medical certainty\" or \"reasonable degree of probability\" requirement for expert opinion testimony is partly a matter of relevance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under ER 401, \"relevant evidence\" is evidence that tends to make the existence of a material fact more or less probable, and, in a\n   normal adjudication of criminal or civil liability, expert opinion does not satisfy this standard unless it is expressed to a reasonable degree of probability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the Eighth nor the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the exclusion of mitigation evidence on the ground that it is irrelevant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the question remains: What makes an expert opinion relevant to the ultimate determination that a jury must make under Washington's death penalty statute-the determination of whether the jury is \"convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency?\" RCW 10.95.060(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-407\">\n   \u00b6246 In this case, Dr. McClung offered to testify that Schierman's brain injury might, but might not, have impacted his behavior. CP at 8260. The State is correct that this testimony does not make the\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   of Schierman's diminished control more probable; it just establishes the\n   <em>\n    possibility\n   </em>\n   of that diminished control. Thus, in a normal adjudication of criminal or civil liability, Dr. McClung's testimony would be properly excluded as irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-408\">\n   \u00b6247 But, as the State argued in\n   <em>\n    State v. McEnroe,\n   </em>\n   the jury's determination under RCW 10.95.060(4) is not purely factual.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356039\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/181/375/#p383\">\n    181 Wash.2d 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 383-84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=333%20P.3d%20402\">\n    333 P.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). Instead, that determination involves considerations of \"mercy, leniency, and other\n   <em>\n    nonfactual\n   </em>\n   matters.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 386,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=333%20P.3d%20402\">\n    333 P.3d 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). In this respect, the jury's decision in a capital sentencing phase proceeding is fundamentally different from its decision in a normal civil or criminal case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-409\">\n   \u00b6248 In light of this difference, the \"reasonable medical certainty\" standard should not be applied to mitigating\n   expert testimony in a capital sentencing proceeding. When the jury is answering the question posed under RCW 10.95.060(4) -whether it is \"convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that there are not sufficient mitigating circumstances to merit leniency\"-the Eighth and Fourteenth amendments to the United States Constitution require that it be allowed to consider all evidence that \" '\n   <em>\n    might\n   </em>\n   serve \"as a basis for a sentence less than death.\" ' \"\n   <em>\n    Tennard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2524793\" index=\"427\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/274/#p287\">\n    542 U.S. at 288\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2524793\" index=\"428\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/274/#p287\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Skipper,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12814\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/1/#p4\">\n    476 U.S. at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12814\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/476/1/#p4\">\n    106 S.Ct. 1669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Lockett,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769215\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/586/\">\n    438 U.S. at 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769215\" index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/586/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   )). Thus, in Washington, a capital defendant must be allowed to present any penalty phase evidence that might create reasonable doubt about the conclusion that \"leniency\"-a sentence of life in prison without parole instead of death-is not warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-410\">\n   \u00b6249 Dr. McClung's testimony clearly satisfied that standard. While Dr. McClung did not testify that prior brain injury\n   <em>\n    probably\n   </em>\n   impaired Schierman's capacities, he did testify that it\n   <em>\n    possibly\n   </em>\n   impaired Schierman's capacities. Some jurors might consider that possibility to be a circumstance meriting leniency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-411\">\n   Thus, even if Dr. McClung's testimony did not establish a probability of diminished capacity, it still might serve as a basis to impose a sentence less than death. Dr. McClung's testimony is therefore relevant mitigating evidence in the penalty phase. The cumulative effect of excluding all of this science in the penalty phase was not harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-412\">\n   D.

Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   \u00b6250 Just before the penalty phase began, the defense submitted a new list of mitigation witnesses. It listed 79 people and summarized each one's proposed testimony. The summaries referred generally to Schierman's personal characteristics and/or emotional relationship with the witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-415\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State moved to exclude most of these witnesses as cumulative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-416\">\n   \u00b6251 The trial court ruled that the defense could select up to 12 of the listed family members and 2 teachers or school counselors to testify as to Schierman's character. It ruled that the defense could select up to 15 of the remaining lay witnesses to testify as to Schierman's character, but that these witnesses could testify about Schierman's history of alcohol blackouts only to the extent that the defense experts did not cover this subject. Finally, the court ruled that the defense could call just one treatment professional from the Lakeside-Milam Recovery Center (Lakeside-Milam).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-417\">\n   \u00b6252 The trial court also limited the scope of the lay witness testimony. It ruled that lay witnesses could testify to the facts that Schierman's parents divorced and Schierman's father was abusive, but could not offer opinions as to how these things affected Schierman. The court clarified that Schierman's mother could testify about \"[o]bserved behaviors ... that she may associate with [Schierman's father's] absence,\" but that lay witnesses generally were not qualified to opine on the psychological effects of divorce or abuse on a child. VRP (Apr. 13, 2010) at 29-30. The court also ruled that no witness could testify about the impact of Schierman's execution on other people.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-418\">\n   \u00b6253 The defense moved for reconsideration, submitted a more detailed offer of proof regarding the excluded witnesses, and requested the addition of two new categories of witness: \"family counselors\" and \"corrections officers.\" CP at 7899. In response, the court ruled that the defense could add seven new mitigation witnesses: the Reverend David\n   Tinney (a \"Friend\" on the first witness list, CP at 7934), Ed Morrison (a family counselor not on the first witness list), two additional family members from the first witness list, and three new witnesses from the department of \"adult juvenile detention\" (not on first witness list). VRP (Apr. 15, 2010) at 104. This meant that the trial court permitted Schierman to call, in total, 37 character witnesses out of 73 proposed character witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-419\">\n   \u00b6254 On April 19, the defense offered the testimony of Eldon Vail, the secretary of the Washington DOC, regarding the resources and programming available to offenders sentenced to life without parole in Washington. The court agreed that Vail's testimony was \"certainly relevant ... on the statutory mitigating circumstances of future dangerousness or lack thereof,\" but ruled that if Vail testified, another defense mitigation witness, James Aiken, could not. VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-420\">\n   \u00b6255 Aiken's testimony covered the same general topic and thus was just as relevant as Vail's. Aiken is a security consultant to numerous prison systems; the defense offered his testimony on \"an inmate's overall adjustment to confinement as well as current/future danger to society\" and \"Mr. Schierman's classification records from the King County Correctional Facility in Seattle.\" CP at 7920, 7943, 26422. Consistent with its limitation on Dr. Cunningham's evidence, the trial court ruled that Aiken could testify only as to his knowledge of prisons in Washington State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 22. But it also ruled that Vail was \"in a much better position to testify on that than is Mr. Aiken,\" and excluded Aiken's testimony as cumulative-\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   Vail were to testify.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1769215\" index=\"433\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/438/586/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   \u00b6256 On April 22, 2010, in response to the State's motion, the trial court excluded testimony by Kinsey Schierman \"regarding the effects of ... her father's anger or his unpredictable behavior on her.\" VRP (Apr. 22, 2010) at 15. It ruled, however, that Kinsey could testify regarding \"any observation she made of the impacts, not her interpretation\n   of the impact, but actual observations of impacts ...

Christensen would have testified that he was a former corrections officer, that he had observed Schierman \"reach[ing] out to his family ... from the correctional setting,\" and that he viewed this as a positive thing. VRP (Apr. 26, 2010) at 11.

The court also ruled that the defense could present only 12 pieces of Schierman's artwork,\n   either live or in photographs. The court denied defense counsel's request to present a single photograph showing more than 12 pieces of artwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-427\">\n   <em>\n    2.

We address each alleged error separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-429\">\n   a. Exclusion of mitigation character witness testimony as cumulative\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-430\">\n   \u00b6262 Schierman contends that it was error to exclude mitigation witnesses on the ground that their testimony was cumulative. He cites his cousin Erica Akingcoye's proposed testimony as an example of excluded evidence that \"would have gone to Schierman's ability to form strong social bonds with others, and to touch their lives in positive ways.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 129 (citing CP at 7893). Schierman argues that this type of testimony \"says something about the person [he] was when he was not drinking or taking drugs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130. He also argues that such testimony should not be excluded as cumulative because \"[t]o a large extent, the sheer number of witnesses was the very point: a person who has touched and enhanced the lives of many people will likely be seen as more deserving of leniency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-431\">\n   \u00b6263 We know of no case holding that a trial court erred by excluding mitigating character evidence as cumulative in a capital sentencing proceeding. But neither do we know of any case in which a trial court preemptively limited the number of mitigation character witnesses who could testify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-432\">\n   \u00b6264 We do not resolve this issue here. Schierman offered character testimony by 47 non-family-member witnesses,\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the trial court excluded 30 of these witnesses as cumulative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also offered the testimony of 26 family members, and the trial court excluded 12 of them. VRP (Apr. 13, 2010) at 32-33; VRP (Apr. 15, 2010) at 104. In all, therefore, the trial court deprived Schierman of mitigating character testimony by 42 individuals-more than half of all the penalty phase witnesses offered by the defense. And it did so not because these witnesses offered irrelevant or unreliable testimony, but because it determined that their testimony would delay the proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-433\">\n   \u00b6265 But Schierman then chose to forgo calling even the character witnesses he was permitted to call. We therefore conclude that he did not preserve this claimed error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-434\">\n   b. Exclusion of testimony about mitigation witnesses' lives and families\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-435\">\n   \u00b6266 Schierman asserts that the trial court prohibited mitigation witnesses from discussing their own lives and\n   families. He argues that this was error because those witnesses' \"loving ... [and] pro-social\" lives were relevant in assessing the value of their testimony on Schierman's behalf. Appellant's Opening Br. at 130-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-436\">\n   \u00b6267 The trial court, however, did not generally prohibit witnesses from \"discussing their own lives and family relationships,\" as Schierman suggests.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 130. Instead, the trial court stated once-apparently in response to testimony from certain mitigation character witnesses-that witnesses could not testify about how many grandchildren they had or what their children did for a living.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-437\">\n   \u00b6268 Moreover, Schierman fails to identify any particular testimony that he was unable to present as a result of this ruling. In fact, on April 27, the day after the court issued this ruling, a friend of Schierman's from the Lakeside-Milam testified that she had six grandchildren and that the eldest was being deployed to Afghanistan in July.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-438\">\n   \u00b6269 This issue does not entitle Schierman to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-439\">\n   c. Exclusion of lay opinion testimony about the effects of abuse and divorce\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-440\">\n   \u00b6270 Schierman argues that the trial court erred by excluding lay testimony regarding the way he was affected by domestic violence and divorce. Citing\n   <em>\n    State v. Claflin,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1791786\" index=\"434\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/38/847/#p854\">\n    38 Wash. App. 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 854,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=690%20P.2d%201186\">\n    690 P.2d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), he argues that such testimony is admissible under the Rules of Evidence. He implies that even if it weren't admissible under the Rules of Evidence, such testimony would still be admissible in the penalty phase of a capital case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-441\">\n   \u00b6271 The trial court, however, did not actually exclude testimony about Schierman's behavior following his parents' divorce or his father's abuse. Indeed, Schierman's mother, stepfather, and sister all testified about the\n   way abuse and divorce affected Schierman. VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 44, 70 (Dean Dubinsky testifying that Schierman's\n   childhood trauma led him to have emotional and substance abuse problems); VRP (Apr. 22, 2010) at 108-12 (Kinsey testifying about physical and emotional abuse; testifying that she \"noticed more of a change in [Schierman] just shortly after the separation\"); VRP (Apr. 27, 2010) at 83-88 (Wendy Dubinsky testifying about the effect that abuse and divorce had on Schierman).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-442\">\n   \u00b6272 Thus, regardless of some trial court comments seeming to exclude testimony on this topic, most of it was, in fact, admitted. Ultimately, Timothy Driver testified that when he coached Schierman in high school, he saw signs in Schierman's behavior that \"it was ... uncomfortable for him at home at that time.\" VRP (Apr. 22,2010) at 40. This is consistent with the summary provided in the defense's April 9, 2010, supplemental disclosure. And after the defense filed its motion for reconsideration, the court ruled that Morrison could testify. Although Morrison was ultimately unavailable, the defense substituted Phyllis Roderick, Schierman's junior high school counselor. Roderick testified that Schierman \"was a child who was angry at dad and mom over what was going on[,] ... who was slipping into what I was concerned might be a depression[,] ... [and who] struggl[ed] between wanting to be the kid that he was and that need to ... also be the caretaker for the family.\" VRP (Apr. 27, 2010) at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-443\">\n   \u00b6273 As for the other proffered witnesses, only Schierman's mother, Linda Schierman, testified. But she testified consistently with the summary in the supplemental disclosure, describing her family's legacy of alcoholism and the abuse that Schierman suffered at the hands of his biological father. Thus, it does not appear that the court's ruling on lay opinion actually had any limiting effect on Linda Schierman's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   \u00b6274 Finally, although Stephanie Overland and Joshua Parker did not testify, we cannot tell from the record why the defense did not call them. As explained above, the defense called only 12 of the 14 family member witnesses\n   that the trial court ultimately permitted. Both Overland and Parker were family members and thus could have testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-445\">\n   d. Forcing Schierman to choose between Eldon Vail and James Aiken\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   \u00b6275 Schierman argues that the trial court erred by forcing him to choose between Aiken and Vail. He contends that Aiken could have offered his perspective on prisons outside Washington State, to which Schierman might one day be transferred. The State argues that this error is unpreserved because Schierman failed to object to the court's April 19 ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-447\">\n   \u00b6276 The State is correct. And, in any event, Aiken's testimony would have been entirely cumulative of Vail's. The defense offered both Aiken and Vail as experts on Schierman's probable conditions of confinement in the Washington State DOC. Vail had much more direct experience with Washington's prisons than Aiken did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-448\">\n   e. Exclusion of Kinsey Schierman's testimony regarding her own abuse\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-449\">\n   \u00b6277 Schierman argues that the trial court erred by prohibiting Kinsey Schierman from testifying about the way she was affected by her father's abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-450\">\n   \u00b6278 The State argues that the trial court acted within its discretion when it determined that Kinsey's experience was not relevant. It argues that the jury could not assume that their father's abuse affected Kinsey and Schierman in similar ways because \"Kinsey was four years younger than Schierman, testified that she suffered an alcohol addiction but was successful in recovery, and apparently was not violent toward others,\" and because her gender and personality were different from Schierman's. Br. of Resp't at 191 (citing VRP (Apr. 22, 2010) at 107, 115).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-451\">\n   \u00b6279 We agree with the State that this relevance determination was within the trial court's discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-452\">\n   f. Exclusion of Michael Christensen's testimony about his experience as a corrections officer\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-453\">\n   \u00b6280 Schierman argues that the trial court erred by limiting Christensen's testimony. Christensen is both Schierman's uncle and a\n   former corrections officer, and the defense offered his opinion testimony on Schierman's adjustment to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-454\">\n   \u00b6281 The court ruled that Christensen could testify about his relationship with Schierman, as a family member, but could not \"relat[e] his own employment to [Schierman's] situation and how he thinks that [Schierman] will ... do, or has done because of his own prior or current employment.\" VRP (Apr. 26, 2010) at 14. The court explained that that testimony \"is neither relevant [nor] probative of the issues present in the penalty [phase] of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-455\">\n   \u00b6282 The trial court erred here for the same reason it erred in excluding Dr. Cunningham's actuarial testimony regarding future dangerousness. The cumulative effect of exclusion of all this mitigating evidence also weighs in favor of reversal of the death sentences.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-456\">\n   g. Exclusion of testimony about the effect of an execution on family members\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-457\">\n   \u00b6283 Schierman argues that he should have been allowed to present testimony on the effect of his execution on his friends and family. But he failed to object to the court's ruling. Because there was no objection, there was no colloquy on this issue. Nor was there any relevant offer of proof, so the record does not indicate what evidence Schierman would have presented regarding the effect of his execution on his friends or family.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CP at 7889-900, 26422-33 (summarizing proposed mitigation witness testimony; omitting any reference to the impact of Schierman's execution on his friends or family).

Photographs\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-459\">\n   \u00b6284 In his opening brief, Schierman implies that the trial court admitted only 12 of his many offered photographs of his life. The State points out, correctly, that the court actually admitted 35 of Schierman's photographs. Schierman does not explain, in either his opening or his reply brief, how he was prejudiced by the 35-photograph limit. When the trial court excluded 42 of the photographs offered through Schierman's mother, it ruled that the photographs were \"not relevant or probative in that quantity\" because many of them depicted Schierman at the same life stages. VRP (Apr. 26, 2010) at 149. With respect to Schierman's artwork, the trial court ruled that Schierman could present 12 separate pieces. Schierman asked to display a single image of his artwork \"in such a way that it could be just observed en mass[e], as opposed to individual pieces,\" presumably because in that way he could present more than 12 individual pieces.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 151. The trial court denied this request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-460\">\n   \u00b6285 The trial court acted within its discretion in placing these minimal limits on Schierman's photographs and artwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-461\">\n   II. The Admission of Certain Victim Impact Testimony Did Not Violate Schierman's Rights to Due Process or Protection against Cruel Punishment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-462\">\n   \u00b6286 Schierman challenges the trial court's admission of two types of victim impact evidence: (1) a memorial service video tribute to the four victims and (2) testimony by several of the victims' family members regarding their immigration from the former Soviet Union and the importance\n   of Christianity to them and to the adult victims. He argues that the admission of this evidence violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and article I, sections 3 and 14 of the Washington State Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-463\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-464\">\n   <em>\n    1. Memorial service video\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-465\">\n   \u00b6287 On April 15, 2010, the State offered as penalty phase evidence \"a video that was prepared for purposes of a memorial service by the [victims'] family, which provides ... moving images of the four victims in this case ... [and is] about 15 minutes long.\" VRP (Apr. 15, 2010) at 110. The defense objected that the State should be limited to one \"in-life\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-466\">\n   photograph of each victim, arguing that \"memorial services are beyond the boundaries of evidence that should be otherwise admissible\" because they tend to \"inflame the passions of [the] jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 111.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-467\">\n   \u00b6288 The trial court noted that the State had listed the video in its discovery materials in December 2009, and asserted that it was \"a little late to be objecting to it now.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112. But once again, the court gave the defense more time; it allowed the defense until noon the following day to submit specific objections in writing. The defense then argued that the video was \"well crafted, and it ... make[s] it extremely difficult for [the defense] to put on mitigation.\" VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-468\">\n   \u00b6289 The State countered that the memorial video was admissible because its \"focus on family, the focus on faith, the focus on children, is exactly who these people were, in a way that ... is unusual for people perhaps in our society, and for that reason [the video] truly give[s] the most meaningful glimpse of who these people ... were.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. The State also suggested that if the court concluded that the video's music soundtrack was inflammatory, the video could be played without sound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-469\">\n   \u00b6290 The court ruled that the video was largely admissible under\n   <em>\n    State v.

The Trial Court Did Not Violate Schierman's Right to Due Process or Protection Against Cruel Punishment When It Permitted the State to Cross-Examine Schierman's Stepfather on the Contents of Schierman's Rehabilitation Treatment Journal\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-507\">\n   \u00b6313 Schierman challenges the trial court's ruling allowing the State to cross-examine his stepfather, Dean Dubinsky, about selected passages in a journal Schierman kept while undergoing treatment at the Lakeside-Milam. The trial court permitted this cross-examination as rebuttal to Dubinsky's testimony that he never worried about the possibility that Schierman might harm another person when he was intoxicated. Schierman argues that the treatment journal's prejudicial effect outweighed its rebuttal value, and that the cross-examination therefore violated the constitutional rules adopted in\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   I and II.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-509\">\n   \u00b6314 On April 19, 2010, the first day of the penalty phase, the defense asked the court to limit the State's cross-examination of mitigation witnesses as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-510\">\n   \"[W]e'd move to exclude cross-examination by the State with respect to ... other bad acts without foundation.... I can give an example.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-511\">\n   What I'm concerned about is a particular witness gets up, family or friend, indicates that their experience with [Schierman] has been a good one and they find him to have certain characteristics and background, and the State gets up and asks a series of questions like without foundation regarding other bad acts, for example if you knew\n   that he beat somebody up, would that change your opinion, or if he did this or that, would\n   that change your opinion. So I'm concerned about ... the, if you will, do you still beat your wife kind of questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-512\">\n   VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-513\">\n   \u00b6315 The State responded that it had \"an abundance of foundation\" to ask about prior bad acts, \"from the defendant's own writings and his descriptions to others of his past life.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 45. The defense disagreed, but only because the State could not \"establish foundation as to any\n   <em>\n    personal knowledge\n   </em>\n   by any of these witnesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-514\">\n   \u00b6316 The court rejected that argument on the ground that the State did not need to establish that any mitigation witness was personally aware of an alleged specific prior instance of bad or violent conduct. Instead, the court ruled, the State needed to establish only that it had a \"good faith basis\" to believe that the prior bad act in fact occurred: \"One is not required to assume or know in advance whether the witness is aware of the prior bad act, there simply has to be a good faith basis for asking about the act itself.\" VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 46-47.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-515\">\n   \u00b6317 The defense explained that it was particularly concerned about questioning based on a \"treatment journal\" that Schierman had kept while he was a patient at the Lakeside-Milam, a drug and alcohol addiction treatment facility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47. The court asked the defense, \"What's the basis for moving to exclude any references to the defendant's own version of events?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The defense repeated that the journal described incidents about which no mitigation witness had direct, personal knowledge. The court again rejected the argument that such knowledge was a necessary foundation for questioning witnesses about the contents of the journal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-516\">\n   \u00b6318 The following day, the defense called Schierman's stepfather, Dubinsky, as its first mitigation witness. Dubinsky testified that Schierman had emotional problems stemming from his childhood, and that this led him to use alcohol and drugs. He explained that \"[Schierman] and Kinsey[, Schierman's sister,] came from an alcoholic home,\" that Schierman was smart but had low self-esteem, and that Schierman had apparently attempted suicide before Dubinsky began dating Schierman's mother. VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 49-60. He also testified that Schierman was extremely protective of his mother and sister, a characteristic that Dubinsky attributed to \"the previous lives with their father.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-517\">\n   \u00b6319 Dubinsky described Schierman's last two years of high school as difficult, mainly because of Schierman's depression, which he also attributed to psychological abuse by Schierman's father. But he explained that Schierman's outlook improved when he entered an alternative high school. When asked to describe Schierman when he graduated from high school, Dubinsky said that \"he was full of promise.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-518\">\n   \u00b6320 Shortly after Schierman enrolled in college, however, his relationship with his mother and Dubinsky began to deteriorate and he moved out of their home. During this period, Schierman lived with his father briefly. By the time Schierman was 23, Dubinsky believed that he was drinking excessively on a daily basis. Finally, after Schierman showed up at his family's home carrying a gun and threatening suicide, he entered a 28-day inpatient treatment program at Lakeside-Milam.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-519\">\n   \u00b6321 Dubinsky testified that Schierman responded well to treatment. At the end of the 28 days, Schierman moved into a group home for recovering addicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-520\">\n   \u00b6322 Near the end of Dubinsky's direct examination, defense counsel asked him if he ever feared that Schierman\n   would harm another person while he was intoxicated. Dubinsky testified that he did not because although he had \"heard ... maybe one or two stories about [Schierman] being in a fight at a bar or something....\n   <em>\n    He didn't have the history of hurting people or hurting things, or doing things that were violent.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104 (emphasis added). Defense counsel then\n   prompted Dubinsky to address the treatment journal, which \"may or may not have described assaultive behavior.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105. Dubinsky stated that he had first learned of the journal \"the other day,\" and had asked defense counsel to show him a copy of it in preparation for his testimony.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dubinsky testified that Schierman had never been violent or assaultive toward anyone else in Dubinsky's presence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-521\">\n   \u00b6323 On cross-examination, the prosecutor handed Dubinsky a collection of photocopied papers, \"marked for identification as State's Exhibit Number 2,\" and asked if he recognized them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115. He said he did not. The prosecutor indicated that they were excerpts of the treatment journal and asked Dubinsky if he'd seen the journal. Dubinsky explained that he had \"asked the defense attorneys if I could have some information about the journal [and t]hey sent me some excerpts on line.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 115-16. He clarified that the excerpts were typed, whereas the photocopies he'd just been handed were handwritten.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-522\">\n   \u00b6324 The prosecutor then questioned Dubinsky about particular passages in the journal, referring him to specific numbered pages and asking whether they'd been included in the excerpts he'd seen online. In these excerpts, Schierman described \"stealing cigarettes and clothes and getting in fights,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 117-18; being \"a really good actor,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 118-19; \"mak[ing] short work of\"-as in beating up-his father,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 120; inadvertently exposing his pets to the residual cocaine and ecstasy in his sweat; and using hallucinogens and \"beating the shit out of a homeless person that [he] thought was an alligator,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 122-23. Dubinsky indicated that he had seen most of these excerpts\n   in the materials provided by defense counsel, but could not remember seeing the excerpt about stealing cigarettes and clothes, and had not been provided the excerpt about cocaine and ecstasy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-523\">\n   \u00b6325 The prosecutor asked Dubinsky whether he'd seen an excerpt in which Schierman described putting the back of his father's head through a wall and knocking him unconscious. In the excerpt, Schierman stated that he \"gave his [father's] right hand a good couple sto[m]ps till I hear bones break,\" and later told his father that he'd punched a hole in the wall in a drunken rage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124. Dubinsky acknowledged that this episode had been included in the journal excerpts provided to him. He then stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-524\">\n   [J]ust to be upfront with you, I don't recall [Schierman's father] ever having a broken hand and I don't remember-he never called to discuss with us about an assault like this that would have taken place.

Dubinsky said that the excerpt had been provided to him in the defense materials and did not match his experience with Schierman: \"I would imagine he would have ended up in jail or we would have gotten a phone call or there would be some sort of write-up by the police officer, but, no....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He made similar comments about two more excerpts in which Schierman described \"an ass whooping at the hands of a telescoping, steel baton ... [but] no arrest still,\" and a fight in which \"I sent one guy to the ER and just about broke another guy'[s] neck.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-527\">\n   B.

Preservation of error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-529\">\n   \u00b6327 Schierman acknowledges that the prosecution may rebut testimony by a capital defendant's mitigation witness, but he argues that the journal was inadmissible because it was more prejudicial than probative. First, he argues that the journal was not relevant rebuttal evidence because Dubinsky \"never made sweeping statements about Schierman's peacefulness.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 166. Second, Schierman argues that the journal was unreliable. The State argues that Schierman failed to preserve any such error because he did not cite\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   I and II or argue that the journal was more prejudicial than probative when challenging\n   its admission in the penalty phase proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-530\">\n   \u00b6328 The State is correct that Schierman neither cited\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   I and II nor objected to the journal's admission on the ground that the journal was irrelevant or more prejudicial than probative. Instead, he sought to exclude the journal on the ground that none of his mitigation witnesses had personal knowledge of the events (fictional or otherwise) recounted in the journal. Thus, defense counsel did not preserve the errors that Schierman now raises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-531\">\n   \u00b6329 Under RAP 2.5(a)(3), this court may decline review of an unpreserved error unless the error is both \"manifest\" and \"truly of constitutional dimension.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Hara,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004888\" index=\"545\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/167/91/#p99\">\n    167 Wash.2d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"546\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20P.3d%20756\">\n    217 P.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These are legal questions, which we can resolve-and the trial court could have addressed-by comparing the content of Dubinsky's testimony on direct examination with the content of the treatment journal the State sought to use on cross-examination.

Dubinsky's testimony on direct examination included evidence of Schierman's (the \"accused['s],\" per ER 404(a)(1)) character, specifically his character trait of nonviolence while drunk. It was admissible under\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   II (even if it had not been admissible under the Rules of Evidence). The State's inquiry into specific instances of Schierman's violence on cross-examination was permissible to impeach Dubinsky's testimony that Schierman was not violent when drinking-it tended\n   both to rebut this testimony and call into question Dubinsky's credibility. Thus, it was admissible under ER 405(a) and not barred by\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Lord\n   </em>\n   I,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1373913\" index=\"572\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/117/829/#p849\">\n    117 Wash.2d at 892-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"573\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=822%20P.2d%20177\">\n    822 P.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-552\">\n   \u00b6342 By contrast, introducing various \"positive aspects\" of the treatment journal-such as Schierman's apparent attempts to find employment-did not rebut or clarify anything the State elicited on cross-examination.

The Trial Court's Decision To Allow Broad and Irrelevant Cross-Examination of Christopher O'Brien Was Error, But the Error Was Harmless\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-554\">\n   \u00b6343 During the penalty phase, the defense called Schierman's friend Christopher O'Brien. He testified that Schierman was friendly, well liked, and serious about his addiction recovery. The court then permitted\n   the State to cross examine O'Brien about statements he made to detectives investigating the murders. The State asked O'Brien whether he relayed incriminating statements that a third party, Mark Nanna, made about Schierman. Schierman argues that this line of questioning violates the constitutional rules adopted in\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   I and II by introducing aggravating evidence that was both irrelevant and hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-555\">\n   A. Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-556\">\n   \u00b6344 Schierman called O'Brien as a mitigation witness. O'Brien testified that he met Schierman in late 2000 and\n   that the two became close friends. He testified that their relationship became more distant when Schierman began using drugs, but improved when Schierman completed treatment. He described Schierman as friendly, well liked, and energetic, and stated that Schierman took his treatment and recovery seriously and appeared to be doing well when O'Brien last saw him before the murders. O'Brien also testified that he still tried to visit Schierman regularly and that Schierman always appeared to be in good spirits and happy to see him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-557\">\n   \u00b6345 On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked O'Brien about the arguably contradictory statements he had made to detectives following the murders. These statements related to Schierman's drinking, the strain it had put on their friendship, and Schierman's tendency to be friendly and flirtatious when he drank, but they did not touch directly on Schierman's general friendliness, energy, or treatment progress. The prosecutor then asked O'Brien whether he remembered calling a detective at the Kirkland Police Station and \"telling him that you needed to get something off your chest?\" VRP (Apr. 21, 2010) at 82. O'Brien responded that he had told the detective he had \"some information that he might be able to use.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"576\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=325%20P.2d%20889\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He said that he was not \"trying to help either side, but if there was a possibility that it could help clear [Schierman's] name, if it would show that he was not in possession of anything, that's where I was headed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-558\">\n   \u00b6346 The prosecutor asked O'Brien whether he remembered telling the detective \"that there was somebody that we would want to talk [to] because the defendant had a bucketful of knives?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   O'Brien answered that he did not remember \"a bucketful of knives,\" but had told the detective that a person named Mark Galante (then Mark Nanna) had helped Schierman move and might be able to provide some information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-559\">\n   \u00b6347 The prosecutor asked O'Brien if he remembered telling the detectives about a comment Schierman made\n   \"about the quote, hot chick across the street, washing her car in a bikini?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 84. O'Brien answered that he had told the detectives that \"Mark had mentioned something along those lines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The prosecutor repeated the question two more times, and O'Brien stated that he could not remember his exact statement to the detectives. The prosecutor then read the following from a Kirkland Police Department detail marked as State's exhibit 4:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-560\">\n   Nanna told O'Brien that Schierman had a bucketful of knives and that he observed Schierman playing with a knife similar to the first knife found at the crime scene, and Nanna also said that Schierman made a comment about the quote, hot chick, unquote, across the street, washing her car in a bikini. O'Brien also provided me with contact numbers for each person on our list for the previous week, including Nanna.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-561\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 85-86. O'Brien acknowledged that the notes refreshed his memory of the statement he had given to the detectives. He said that they reflected \"what [Nanna] had told me.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-562\">\n   \u00b6348 After a brief redirect followed by a recess, the defense moved to strike the last question and answer in O'Brien's cross-examination, arguing that Nanna's statements were hearsay. The court denied the motion, concluding that the statements were not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, but instead to \"indicate that Mr. O'Brien had heard them from Mr. Nanna, allegedly statements made by the defendant, and that, in fact, those statements were then conveyed to the police.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89-90. The court found that this was an appropriate subject for cross-examination given that O'Brien was called as a character witness for the defense who had contacted police with information about Schierman after the murders and then \"tr[ied] to\n   be as vague as he could about his recall of [that contact]\" on the witness stand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 89.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-563\">\n   \u00b6349 The defense then requested a limiting instruction telling the jury that the statements were not offered as proof of the matter asserted. The court said that if it gave\n   such an instruction, it would also instruct the jury that the statements were offered \"to reflect the fact that this witness was testifying that these statements had been made by the defendant to this other individual and then conveyed to him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-564\">\n   \u00b6350 The defense objected to the last part of that proposed instruction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91. The court then stated that it would\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-565\">\n   advise the jury that the ... testimony Mr. O'Brien related to statements by Mr. Mark Nanna are not admitted for the truth of the matters asserted by Mr. Nanna to Mr. O'Brien, they are only admitted for the limited purpose of considering Chris O'Brien's testimony that [Nanna] had made these statements to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-566\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 92. The defense agreed to that instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-567\">\n   \u00b6351 On April 27, 2010, the defense filed a written motion to strike the portion of O'Brien's testimony that addressed Nanna's alleged statements. The motion included a transcript of the defense interview of the detective who interviewed Nanna about the statements. The transcript showed that Nanna had denied making any statements about a bucket of knives or a hot chick. The defense argued that the State lacked a good faith basis for asking about the statements, and that the statements were therefore irrelevant and prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-568\">\n   \u00b6352 The court heard argument on the motion the following day. The State argued that it had a good faith basis for asking O'Brien about Nanna's alleged statements, because it had determined that Nanna was trying to protect Schierman (and that his statements to detectives could therefore not be trusted).

At trial, defense counsel did not object that O'Brien's contacts with police were\n   <em>\n    irrelevant.\n   </em>\n   Instead, defense counsel objected only to the portion of that questioning in which the prosecutor actually read from the investigating officers' notes-the portion that quoted the statements attributed to Nanna-and did so only on the basis that these statements were\n   <em>\n    hearsay.\n   </em>\n   For this reason, we must consider whether to review Schierman's unpreserved claim that O'Brien's contacts with police were irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-574\">\n   \u00b6357 Schierman also argues, as did defense counsel in the trial court, that the statements attributed to Nanna were inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-575\">\n   \u00b6358 Because we reach the merits of Schierman's first argument-that O'Brien's\n   decision to contact police was not relevant to rebut O'Brien's mitigation testimony-and because we agree with Schierman on this issue, we do not decide whether Nanna's statements were inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-576\">\n   <em>\n    1.

This line of questioning implies the following evidentiary rule: when a witness offers mitigating character testimony in a capital sentencing proceeding, that witness's decision to furnish the police with information tending to show the defendant's guilt is inherently relevant in rebuttal. Defense counsel did not challenge that assumption in the trial court, but Schierman does now. He argues that it violates the constitutional rules adopted in\n   <em>\n    Bartholomew\n   </em>\n   I and II and\n   <em>\n    Lord\n   </em>\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-579\">\n   \u00b6360 An appellate court may decline to review an unpreserved error unless the error is both \"manifest\" and \"truly of constitutional dimension.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Hara,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4004888\" index=\"577\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/167/91/#p99\">\n    167 Wash.2d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"578\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=217%20P.3d%20756\">\n    217 P.3d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Instead, he claimed only that Schierman was well liked, took his addiction treatment seriously, and maintained a friendship with O'Brien even after his incarceration. For this reason, questioning O'Brien about his decision to contact the police was outside the scope of permissible cross-examination under\n   <em>\n    Lord\n   </em>\n   I and\n   <em>\n    Brett\n   </em>\n   (applying\n   ER 404 and 405 ). O'Brien's decision to contact police-arguably showing his suspicions about Schierman's guilt-does not rebut his testimony that Schierman was well liked, took treatment seriously, or maintained a friendship with O'Brien after being incarcerated, all of which is relevant to the penalty phase determination as opposed to the question of guilt. We therefore hold that the trial court erred by permitting the State to cross-examine O'Brien about his decision to contact\n   detectives.

The prosecutor did not just analogize the murders of the Milkin family to the Nazi murders of the victims of the Holocaust. Instead, the prosecutor quoted from a Holocaust museum plaque about the immorality of remaining a \"bystander.\" VRP (May 3, 2010) at 74. The message to the jurors was that they had a moral duty to take meaningful affirmative action in response to Schierman's holocaust, or else they would suffer the same moral guilt as those who stood silent and thereby effectively collaborated during the Nazi Holocaust.

This analysis suggests a statistical approach in which this court asks whether a death sentence has been imposed in some critical mass of cases possessing a certain characteristic (in\n   <em>\n    Rape,\n   </em>\n   the same set of aggravating circumstances).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-676\">\n   \u00b6394 But the rest of the\n   <em>\n    Rupe\n   </em>\n   analysis rejects a statistical approach. After evaluating Rupe's crime in terms of aggravating circumstances, the court considered Rupe's personal characteristics. It acknowledged that his respect in the community and lack of a criminal record made him unusual among death eligible defendants, most of whom had extensive criminal histories.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 770,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"667\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20P.2d%20210\">\n    743 P.2d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But it did not then undertake the kind of statistical analysis it had applied with respect to the aggravating factors. Instead, it held that \"[s]imply because the majority of those ' eligible for the death sentence under our statutes have criminal backgrounds, or backgrounds marred by other conditions, does not mean that one who has a background like Rupe's is thereby ineligible for\n   the death sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"668\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20P.2d%20210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After observing that Rupe had committed \"exceedingly cold-blooded, calculated murders,\" that \"nothing about Rupe or his background ... excuse[s] him from facing the consequences of his actions,\" and that Rupe had received a fair trial, the court affirmed the death sentence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"669\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20P.2d%20210\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-677\">\n   \u00b6395 A year later, in\n   <em>\n    Rice,\n   </em>\n   this court began its proportionality review by noting that \"[o]f all the comparison cases, only [Rupe's] case involved the same three aggravating factors\" as Rice's.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1182886\" index=\"670\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/110/577/#p603\">\n    110 Wash.2d at 625-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"671\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=757%20P.2d%20889\">\n    757 P.2d 889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Violation of this right has long been recognized as a structural error, generally requiring reversal of the conviction and a new trial. Here, the State recognizes a closure occurred when for-cause juror challenges were considered in chambers. And this court unanimously agrees that our precedent requires reversal of the conviction based on this structural constitutional error. Nonetheless, a majority of the court-comprised of the lead opinion and Justice Yu's concurrence-departs from precedent and disregards the error here as too \"trivial\" or \"de minimis\" to warrant any remedy. Recognizing that this court has consistently and repeatedly rejected this situational analysis in past cases, the new majority proclaims that reversing Schierman's conviction due to the violation of his public trial right is too high a price to pay for following precedent, and thus we must choose between precedent and justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   concurrence at 1154-55 (\"A majority of this court agrees that justice demands we affirm Schierman's convictions, but every member of the court unanimously agrees that our precedent\n   precludes us from doing so.

The apparent distinction is that a prejudice analysis considers the defendant's ultimate guilt or innocence, while a triviality analysis considers only whether the defendant was deprived of the protections conferred by the public trial right. Concurrence at 1153-54. This distinction is semantic at best. While it is true that the triviality doctrine does not invoke that aspect of harmless error review that considers trial error harmless in the face of overwhelming untainted evidence of guilt, that is not the sum total of harmlessness review. Fully understood, such review necessarily asks whether the defendant suffered a cognizable harm from deprivation of the constitutional right at issue. As one commentator has aptly observed, requiring defendants to demonstrate that a closure tangibly subverted the core values of the public trial right amounts to a harmless error review that is inconsistent with controlling Sixth Amendment precedent:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-731\">\n   The triviality doctrine also approaches harmless error analysis, requiring more of defendants than\n   <em>\n    Waller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Presley\n   </em>\n   allow.... Although these courts [that embrace the de minimis standard] have been careful to distinguish this standard from harmless error analysis, the test still demands much more of\n   defendants than the Supreme Court has deemed reasonable when dealing with the intangible benefits of structural error rights. A defendant in a triviality jurisdiction does not have to show a reasonable possibility that the outcome of the trial would have been different (i.e., prejudice), but he does have to show some kind of specific injury manifested through the undermining of one of four chosen Sixth Amendment values. If he cannot, then the closure was trivial-in other words, harmless. While these courts do not require a showing of prejudice, they do require that defendants show that the closure was\n   <em>\n    not harmless.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-732\">\n   Kristin Saetveit,\n   <em>\n    Close Calls: Defining Courtroom Closures Under the Sixth Amendment,\n   </em>\n   68 STAN.

The trial court did not err.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-793\">\n   \u00b6470 It must be recognized at the outset what trial court decision we are reviewing. Well before trial, Dr. Cunningham was properly disclosed as a potential mitigation witness. The disclosure indicated that his testimony would be \"concordant with his interviews of [Schierman] in so far as they relate to Alcoholic Blackout /Propensity/History.\" Clerk's Papers (CP) at 26403. At the completion of the guilt phase, the defense filed a supplemental disclosure, again specifying Dr. Cunningham's testimony would \"relate to alcoholic blackout.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26424. However, in opening statements for the penalty phase, defense counsel stated for the first time that Dr. Cunningham would \"testify with respect to what type of criminal behavior is predictive of an inmate's prison behavior\" and would include testimony related to future prison behavior. VRP (Apr. 19, 2010) at 86. The State objected to the expanded scope of Dr. Cunningham's proposed testimony on two grounds: violation of the court's discovery orders and relevance. The trial court denied the State's motion and allowed the proposed expansion of the testimony, subject to a relevancy determination. Schierman is thus seeking reversal based on a trial court ruling that was largely in his favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-794\">\n   \u00b6471 Worth noting is that the trial court would have been justified in excluding all of the expanded testimony based on defense counsel's \"blatant and intentional\" violation of the court's discovery orders. VRP (Apr. 20, 2010) at 16. Defense counsel never provided an adequate explanation for its failure to timely disclose the full intended scope of Dr. Cunningham's proposed testimony, and the court observed that the only apparent explanation for the defense's \"incredibly untimely disclosure,\"\n   <em>\n    id.,\n   </em>\n   was \"for tactical reasons,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. However, the trial court ultimately ruled that it would\n   <em>\n    allow\n   </em>\n   the expanded testimony from Dr. Cunningham regarding future dangerousness, including testimony and opinion about Schierman's development as a child and adolescent, his addictions, his alcohol treatment and recovery, and his institutional adjustment in jail, to the extent they were relevant.

The court concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-797\">\n   It is true that, in this case, unlike\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   [\n   <em>\n    v.

However, other testimony Dr. Cunningham proposed to give, and to rely upon in giving a prison risk assessment for Morva, such as potential security interventions that \"could be brought to bear\" upon Morva, and the rates of assaults in the Virginia Department of Corrections, is, by statute, not relevant to the determination the jury has to make concerning Morva's future dangerousness and therefore would not be admissible evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-798\">\n   <em>\n    Morva,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=278%20Va.%20329\">\n    278 Va. at 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=683%20S.E.2d%20553\">\n    683 S.E.2d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this holding, the argument that the trial court here applied\n   <em>\n    Morva\n   </em>\n   's analysis is not supportable. While the State cited\n   <em>\n    Morva\n   </em>\n   in support of its motion to exclude all of Dr. Cunningham's late-disclosed testimony, the trial court\n   <em>\n    denied\n   </em>\n   total exclusion, allowing Dr. Cunningham's relevant testimony that specifically related to Schierman, including the prison risk assessment pertaining specifically to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-799\">\n   \u00b6474 What Schierman takes issue with is the trial court decision excluding some of Dr. Cunningham's proposed testimony relating to other inmates incarcerated in other state prisons based on relevancy. That decision was not error. Our statute focuses the relevancy inquiry under RCW 10.95.070(8), where the jury is directed to consider \"[w]hether there is a likelihood that\n   <em>\n    the defendant\n   </em>\n   will pose a danger to others in the future.\" (Emphasis added.) The focus of the allowable evidence thus plainly centers on the defendant and his circumstances. Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution's jurisprudence similarly supports the trial court's decision to limit Dr. Cunningham's future dangerousness testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even recognizing a relaxed standard applicable in capital proceedings and allowing wide latitude for the admission of testimony, any proposed testimony or expert opinion must relate to the defendant and his or her circumstances to be relevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-800\">\n   \u00b6475 The trial court here reviewed each proposed, newly disclosed Microsoft PowerPoint slide and excluded some based on relevancy because some individual slides had nothing to do with Schierman personally and involved prison statistics from other states. Meanwhile, the trial court indicated it would allow Dr. Cunningham to testify that past violence in the community is not strongly associated with prison violence and that the severity of the crime is not a good predictor of prison adjustment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   CP at 8306 (contents of slide 26).

CP 8306-07; 109RP 24-25. The court also permitted testimony\n   as to slide 35, which states that nothing about Schierman increased his risk of serious violence in prison, and listed five specific factors that decreased his risk of serious violence.

Here, the factual foundation for Dr. McClung's proffered testimony was inadequate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-806\">\n   \u00b6478 Because Dr. McClung's proposed testimony was \"premised upon a chain of other experts and their evaluations,\" the trial court correctly considered the foundation of each link in that chain. VRP (Apr. 29, 2010) at 7. The first link in the chain was a report by Dr. Wendy Cohen, which concluded that the scan was \"suggestive of a prior insult which involved a compon[e]nt of hemorrhage.\" CP at 8252. Dr. Cohen did not opine that Schierman's brain scan indicated that he had suffered multiple traumatic head injuries, or even raise that possibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-807\">\n   \u00b6479 The next link in the chain of expert evaluations was a letter by Dr. Paul Connor, dated April 24, 2010. Dr. Connor concluded, based on Schierman's medical records, that the prior head injury Dr. Cohen found was consistent with a concussive head injury Schierman suffered while playing football in 1997.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8257. Dr. Connor then noted that \"Schierman and his family have reported a number of incidents of domestic violence in which he was struck in the head by his biological father.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From these reports, Dr. Connor concluded that \"it would appear that Mr. Schierman has experienced multiple head injuries in his life.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Connor did not elaborate on the extent of domestic violence, describe any particular incident, or suggest that any act of domestic violence by Schierman's father may have contributed to the hemorrhaging noted by Dr. Cohen. Nevertheless, Dr. Connor concluded \"that a history of multiple head trauma [s] is a more parsimonious etiology than that of [nonverbal learning disorder].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (boldface omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-808\">\n   \u00b6480 The next day, Dr. Richard Adler provided the final link in the chain of expert opinions that formed the basis for Dr. McClung's proposed testimony. Dr. Adler opined that Schierman suffered \" '[p]ost-concussion syndrome' \" after his 1997 football injury.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8249 (quoting Denise Garvey,\n   <em>\n    When Can Teens Return to Sports After a Head Injury ?,\n   </em>\n   4 PROCEEDINGS OF UCLA HEALTHCARE 47 (Winter 2000)).

At a time when he knew that Olga Milkin's husband was deployed overseas, Schierman entered her home and killed her along with her two sons, who were three and five years old, and her sister, who was a college student. Olga Milkin and her sister were stripped of their clothing and stabbed repeatedly in the head and neck. Both were stabbed in the neck from the front with such force that the knife actually damaged their spines, and there was evidence that they attempted to fight back, indicating that they endured significant conscious suffering before they died. One of the children was stabbed through the throat from one side to the other, and the other child's throat was cut so deeply that he was nearly decapitated. When Schierman woke up in the Milkins' home and found himself covered in blood with four dead bodies, he took a shower, changed his clothes, and attempted to bum the house down in order to destroy the evidence. The nature of these crimes is at least as brutal as others in which we have upheld a capital sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 349-51,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=290%20P.3d%2043\">\n    290 P.3d 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-820\">\n   \u00b6488 The only aggravating factor submitted to the jury was that \"[t]here was more than one victim and the murders were part of a common scheme or plan.\" RCW 10.95.020(10).

As applied to the particular facts presented, the nature of this aggravating circumstance goes beyond the minimal statutory requirements-Schierman's crimes ended the lives of a young mother and her two small children while their father was deployed overseas, as well as the children's aunt who was there to help while their father was gone.

But in light of the evidence showing Schierman planned these crimes for a time when the victims were particularly vulnerable because Mr. Milkin was deployed overseas, the ruthless nature of the murders themselves, and Schierman's subsequent efforts to destroy the evidence by burning the Milkins' house down, Schierman's sentence is not disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-822\">\n   \u00b6490 Schierman also contends that his sentence was brought about by passion and prejudice because the State's case \"emphasize[d] that the victims were so 'worthy' that Schierman deserved death regardless of the constraints of the law.\" Appellant's Opening Br. at 203.
