The District Court affirmed the Commission's final order, holding that the Commission properly considered competition in determining whether public convenience and necessity required the authorization of additional garbage collection service. McGree and Republic appeal. We affirm on each of the following restated issues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    1.

It has had a limited Class D certificate since 2007 to haul construction debris in Gallatin County and in those parts of Madison County within twenty miles of Big Sky, Montana. The Commission denied an application from L&amp;L in 2011 to expand its operation into general residential and commercial garbage hauling. L&amp;L filed another application for a full Class D certificate on May 20, 2015, to provide service throughout both Gallatin and Madison Counties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b63 The Commission published notice of L&amp;L's second application to expand into commercial and residential garbage hauling in July 2015. McGree and Republic filed protests\n   with the Commission against the application. McGree holds a Class D certificate to haul garbage within an eighty-mile radius of Whitehall, Montana. Republic hauls garbage in Gallatin and Madison Counties under a Class D certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b64 Before the hearing on the petition, the parties stipulated that L&amp;L is fit to provide the proposed service. The Commission held a three-day hearing in November 2015 to hear testimony regarding public convenience and necessity. L&amp;L presented eleven witnesses in support of its petition-nine of whom were \"shippers\" or customers. Republic presented nine witnesses in opposition. McGree presented no witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \u00b65 After post-hearing briefing, the Commission, on a 3-2 vote, approved L&amp;L's application for all of Gallatin County, but limited the permit for Madison County to places accessible from Highway 64 serving the Big Sky, Moonlight Basin, and Yellowstone Club areas. The Commission issued its final order in March 2016. McGree and Republic filed a timely Petition for Judicial Review with the District Court. Following briefing and oral argument on the petition, the District Court affirmed the Commission's final order in December 2017.

McGree and Republic maintain that the Commission may not consider competition until after it has determined that there is a public need for the proposed services. They argue that this is because the statute favors maintenance of the existing service providers to ensure stable service.

They argue that in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management Partners\n   </em>\n   , this Court endorsed as the \"correct standard\" a framework in which the Commission first determined that there was public need before considering competition.\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgmt.

McGree and Republic point out that in the 2011 denial of L&amp;L's prior application, the Commission itself stated that \"competition can only be considered after need has been established by the applicant.\"\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L&amp;L Site Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. T-10.36.PCN, Or. 7147, \u00b6 97, (Mont. Pub. Serv. Comm'n May 23, 2011). McGree and Republic argue that the Commission improperly relied on legislative history to reinterpret the statute contrary to this Court's conclusive interpretation in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management Partners\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00b612 The Commission and L&amp;L respond that the plain language of \u00a7 69-12-323(2)(b), MCA, does not mandate at what point the Commission may consider competition when determining whether public convenience and necessity require the granting of a Class D application. Rather, whether and when to consider competition is left to the sound discretion of the Commission, and the exercise of such discretion is dependent on the facts and circumstances of each application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b613 In its final order granting L&amp;L's application on appeal here, the Commission explained that it previously had declined to consider competition before determining public need for the additional service. \"Despite this,\" it continued, \"the Commission will consider competition in addressing public need in this case.\" Relying on the plain language of the statute, the Commission reasoned that \"[a]n interpretation that\n   precludes consideration of one component of determination of public convenience and necessity (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , need) does violence to the statute.\" It concluded that \"[i]n this case, competition and need are related concepts,\" noting that, based on the evidence presented to the Commission, \"a consideration of competition serves to establish need and lack of willingness of an incumbent to provide service absent the prospect or reality of competition.\" The Commission went on to explain that the legislative history of the statute also supported this interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 We first turn to the statute at issue. As we recognized in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management Partners\n   </em>\n   , \"the legislature has chosen to partially regulate the garbage industry in Montana.\"\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgmt.

The Commission regulates the garbage hauling industry in Montana primarily through its regulation of entry of new providers into the market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Title 69, chapter 12, MCA. Motor carriers are divided into five classes; Class D motor carriers are those operating motor vehicles transporting garbage. Section 69-12-301(5), MCA. A motor carrier may not haul garbage in Montana without first obtaining a Class D certificate from the Commission. Section 69-12-314, MCA. Section 69-12-323(2)(a), MCA, requires the Commission to issue a Class D certificate to an applicant if \"public convenience and necessity require the authorization of the service proposed or any part of the service proposed.\" In determining whether to issue a permit, the Commission must consider:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) the transportation service being furnished or that will be furnished by any railroad or other existing transportation agency;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (ii) the likelihood of the proposed service being permanent and continuous throughout 12 months of the year; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (iii) the effect that the proposed transportation service may have on other forms of transportation service that are essential and indispensable to the communities to be affected by the proposed transportation service or that might be affected by the proposed transportation service.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Section 69-12-323(2)(a), MCA. The statute does not define public convenience or necessity, but provides three factors the Commission must consider. We have explained previously that an agency need not \"adopt rigid rules defining\" public convenience and necessity, \"[b]ecause the determination of public convenience and necessity involves such a fact-intensive inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramage v.

That framework asks: (1) \"whether the new operation or service will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need\"; (2) whether existing carriers \"can and will\" serve that public purpose without the new operation or service; and (3) whether the new operation or service can serve that useful public purpose \"without endangering or impairing the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgmt.

That section provides: \"For the purposes of issuing a certificate of public convenience and necessity to a Class D motor carrier, a determination of public convenience and necessity may include a consideration of competition.\" Section 69-12-323(2)(b), MCA.

The plain language of \u00a7 69-12-323(2)(b), MCA, puts no limitation on when the Commission may consider competition. It states simply that \"a determination of public convenience and necessity may include a consideration of competition.\" Section 69-12-323(2)(b), MCA. Read together, subsection 2(a) lists three statutory factors that the Commission must consider in determining public convenience and necessity, and subsection 2(b) allows the Commission to consider the benefits of competition in its determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b617 The parties stipulated that L&amp;L was fit to provide the proposed services under the second statutory factor, \u00a7 69-12-323(2)(a)(ii), MCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Pan-American Bus Lines\n   </em>\n   framework the Commission uses provides a structure for the Commission to determine the factors set forth in \u00a7 69-12-323(2)(a)(i) and (iii), MCA.

First, Appellants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Baker\n   </em>\n   to argue that competition may be considered only as part of the factors going to \"convenience,\" but not to \"necessity,\" is belied by the language of \u00a7 69-12-323(2)(b), MCA, which states that \"a determination of public convenience\n   <em>\n    and necessity\n   </em>\n   may include a consideration of competition.\" (Emphasis added). McGree and Republic argue that this Court nonetheless approved the consideration of competition only after an applicant has established that there is public need for additional service.

Whether substantial evidence supports the Commission's decision to grant a Class D permit to L&amp;L.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \u00b623 McGree and Republic next argue that the Commission lacked substantial evidence to support its determination that there was public need for additional service. This argument has two parts. First, McGree and Republic maintain that some of the Commission's findings were in clear error, because the Commission misapprehended the effect of the evidence before it. Second, they maintain that L&amp;L failed to present sufficient evidence that showed public need for additional service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   \u00b624 Regarding their first argument, McGree and Republic insist that the Commission failed to recognize or properly consider the existing competition in most of the relevant areas between Republic, McGree, and the City of Bozeman. They argue further that the Commission misapprehended the testimony from Republic's witnesses Jason Vietch\n   and Kristin Mitchell to conclude that Republic's target operating margin for the Bozeman area far exceeds a reasonable rate of return. In addition to the Commission's misapprehension of the evidence that was presented, McGree and Republic maintain that L&amp;L failed to present sufficient evidence to support its application. They contend that L&amp;L did not perform an analysis of the market, but only speculated about growth in the area. Of L&amp;L's nine shipper witnesses, they contend that only one testified he currently could not receive garbage hauling services from existing carriers. They maintain that none of the complaints from the other shipper witnesses were as egregious\n   as those before the Commission in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management Services\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   \u00b625 This Court has recognized that public need is not simply unmet demand, but also includes a need for reasonable pricing and better customer service.\n   <em>\n    Waste Mgmt. Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130390\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/284/245/\">\n    284 Mont. at 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"130390\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/284/245/\">\n    944 P.2d at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the Commission properly granted an application for additional service when \"competition in this case will promote the public interest in improving services and perhaps rates, and filling consumer needs that [the existing carrier] failed to meet\"). In its decision on L&amp;L's application, the Commission determined from the evidence it heard that there was a public need for fair pricing and better customer service, as well as an inability to receive services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \u00b626 In regard to inability to receive services, the Commission relied on the testimony from Charles Immenschuh, who was unable to get services for his outfitting business after contacting Republic on four separate occasions. Immenschuh testified that he had to self-haul because he had no other options for service. The Commission also found based on evidence from both L&amp;L and Republic that there is considerable growth occurring in the Bozeman and Big Sky areas and that the \"raw number of new customers is substantially larger than what existed during L&amp;L's last application.\" In regard to a need for better customer service, the Commission relied on testimony from shipper witnesses and a current Republic driver. The Commission noted service complaints from several shipper witnesses. It highlighted the testimony of Rocky Nelson, the senior director of facilities at the Yellowstone Club. Nelson testified that customer service to the Yellowstone Club improved after Nelson signed an affidavit in support of L&amp;L's application. The Commission concluded that these customer service improvements would not have occurred \"so expediently or efficiently\" without the threat of competition. The Commission acknowledged Republic's arguments that these are isolated incidents and not pervasive or systemic issues. The Commission found, however,\n   that the testimony from one of Republic's own drivers demonstrated that the customer service issues were systemic. Robert Webb testified and provided photographs to support L&amp;L's claim that Republic provided substandard service, such as skipped pickups, containers not being emptied, containers not placed back in the proper place or placed in an unsafe manner, and drivers failing to heed the requests of customers. The Commission explained that \"[t]his testimony depicts a company failing to control or incentivize its employees to meet the requests of its customers suggesting a need for better customer service than what is currently being provided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \u00b627 In finding that there was a need for more reasonable rates, the Commission explained that \"Republic's profit margin serves as an example of need for more reasonable rates,\" relying on the testimonies from Vietch and Mitchell. McGree and Republic argue that the Commission misapprehended the effect of Vietch's and Mitchell's testimonies. Upon questioning from Vice Chair Travis Kavulla, Vietch, Republic's operations manager for the Bozeman area, testified that 22 percent of Republic's revenue is net income. Vice Chair Kavulla later questioned Republic's expert Mitchell, the executive director of the Oregon Refuse and Recycling Association, about the operating margins typically allowed by localities in the rate-setting process in Oregon. Mitchell testified that she had seen \"ranges that go 8 to 12\" percent. But she qualified her answer, saying that because the numbers are \"based on allowable costs\" in each area, the margins were \"difficult to compare. It's not apples to apples.\" We agree with McGree and Republic that the Commission misapprehended the effect of this testimony. Without further information about what was included in those figures, the Commission could not compare the rates cited by Mitchell with those cited by Vietch. The Commission's reliance on this misapprehension to determine there was a need for more reasonable rates was clear error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \u00b628 The misapprehension of this evidence alone, however, does not require reversal. We examine whether the remaining \"reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record\" supports the Commission's finding of public need in its determination of public convenience and necessity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Section 2-4-704(2)(a)(v), MCA. \"Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Peretti v.

Rather, they assert that L&amp;L did not present enough evidence and that the Commission failed to consider evidence of existing competition. Montana law grants the Commission authority to decide whether a new carrier may enter the garbage-hauling market in a particular area. Section 69-12-314, MCA. As the fact-finding body, the Commission is entitled to evaluate the strength of the evidence on the statutory factors. Evidence is substantial, \"despite the fact that there was evidence that may have supported a different result.\"\n   <em>\n    Peretti\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. McGree and Republic's complaints in essence ask this Court to reweigh the evidence before the Commission-something we will not do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2-4-704(2), MCA. The Commission relied on testimony from the hearing to find that there was unmet need for services and need for better customer service that would not be met without additional competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \u00b630 Granted, the evidence was not as strong as that presented before the Commission in\n   <em>\n    Waste Management Services\n   </em>\n   . But that is not the standard. Rather, we review the record to determine whether the Commission's findings are based on substantial evidence, even if the evidence also could have supported a contrary conclusion.\n   <em>\n    Peretti\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18. L&amp;L presented witnesses who testified that there was a need for better customer service. The Commission relied on testimony from one of Republic's own drivers that customer service issues were systemic and from a customer that service improved after he expressed support for L&amp;L's application. Although the Commission could have weighed the evidence differently and reached a different conclusion, its finding that public convenience and necessity required the granting of a Class D certificate to L&amp;L was not in clear error. We conclude that the Commission relied on substantial evidence to support its determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \u00b631\n   <em>\n    3.

It explained, however, that the plain language of the statute did not require this approach and that \"[i]n this case, competition and need are related concepts,\" citing the need for better customer service and lack of willingness to provide better customer service \"absent the prospect or reality of competition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b634 Resolution of this issue depends on the difference between an agency's rulemaking and adjudication powers.

Section 69-12-323(2)(b), MCA, granted the Commission discretion to consider competition when determining public convenience and necessity.
