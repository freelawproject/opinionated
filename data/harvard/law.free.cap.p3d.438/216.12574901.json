Trooper Jason Jurca located a vehicle driven by Mr. Dixon that matched the description. After Trooper Jurca observed Mr. Dixon commit further infractions, he initiated a traffic stop and approached the vehicle on the passenger side. He requested Mr. Dixon's driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance, and commented about the vehicle's condition, including its cracked windshield and the hanging front plate. Mr. Dixon responded that his wife was in an accident and hit a curb. When asked about his travel plans, Mr. Dixon stated he was headed to Jackson Hole to visit a friend for the weekend. Trooper Jurca returned to his patrol vehicle after he confirmed the rear and front license plates matched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [\u00b64] Trooper Jurca processed Mr. Dixon's information and prepared a written warning for the loose license plate and cracked windshield. He re-approached Mr. Dixon's vehicle and explained the reasons for the written warning. As he handed Mr. Dixon the documents through the passenger window, Trooper Jurca \"smelled the very distinct odor of marijuana.\" He told Mr. Dixon to \"wait\" and instructed him to roll up his driver's side window, after which Trooper Jurca leaned into the vehicle and smelled marijuana again. Trooper Jurca also picked up \"a little green bud of marijuana\" on the passenger seat and asked Mr. Dixon if he had drugs in the vehicle. Mr. Dixon initially denied having drugs, but later said he thought his wife might have her \"stash\" in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b65] Trooper Jurca placed Mr. Dixon in the patrol car, requested backup, and searched Mr. Dixon's vehicle for drugs. He discovered two small sandwich bags containing marijuana and several partially smoked marijuana joints in the console area. He also found marijuana concealed in the back of the minivan contained in five vacuum-sealed bags each weighing about one pound. Trooper Jurca placed Mr. Dixon under arrest and transported him to the Carbon County Detention Center. While at the jail, Mr. Dixon informed Trooper Jurca that he was delivering the drugs to someone at a gas station in Libby, Montana, in exchange for payment. He explained that this was his first time doing anything like that, but he needed the money because he was \"doing poor financially\" and in jeopardy of losing his home and business after a 500-year flood damaged his mining company in Chile. A detention deputy overheard Mr. Dixon's statements to Trooper Jurca about the planned drug transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b66] The State charged Mr. Dixon with two felonies: possession of a controlled substance, and possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver. Mr. Dixon pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prior to trial, he moved to suppress evidence, alleging the warrantless search of his vehicle violated both the state and federal constitutions because\n   Trooper Jurca unlawfully placed his head into the passenger window to conduct a sniff search without consent or probable cause. The district court denied the motion after an evidentiary hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b67] A two-day jury trial commenced on November 14, 2017. The State called several witnesses in its case in chief including: Jeremy Williams, the person who reported Mr. Dixon's erratic driving; Deputy Terrill, the detention deputy who overheard Mr. Dixon's statements to Trooper Jurca; and Rachel Chavez, a forensic specialist with the Wyoming State Crime Lab. The State also called Trooper Jurca and, through his testimony, admitted video clips of the traffic stop and search. Defense counsel did not cross examine the State's witnesses and the State rested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b68] The defense called Mr. Dixon as its sole witness. Unbeknownst to the State, Mr. Dixon's trial strategy required recanting his jailhouse admissions. At trial, he claimed the marijuana belonged to his wife and that he had no knowledge she had marijuana in the vehicle. Mr. Dixon first told the jury that he and his wife were separated, but she allowed him to borrow her minivan for his trip because his truck was in the shop. Although he noticed the minivan smelled like marijuana, it did not raise a \"red flag\" because medical marijuana is legal in Colorado where they reside. Mr. Dixon testified that his wife is a nurse and a medical marijuana caregiver, and often transports marijuana for her patients. He explained his understanding that Colorado law permits a caregiver to have up to five cancer patients and each patient may possess up to 16 ounces of marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   [\u00b69] Mr. Dixon next testified that he did not know about the marijuana in the minivan. In addressing the video footage showing his demeanor during the search, Mr. Dixon acknowledged that he was nervous while Trooper Jurca searched the vehicle, but testified his demeanor was largely out of concern his dog would jump out and run into the interstate;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   it was not due to concealed drugs. He further acknowledged he became nervous when Trooper Jurca started searching the large bag containing the marijuana, but only because he had never seen the bag before, he did not place the bag in the minivan, and he knew his wife transported bulk marijuana as a caregiver and smoked marijuana recreationally, too.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b610] Mr. Dixon then recanted his admission about the planned drug transaction. He testified he falsely told Trooper Jurca about knowingly transporting the marijuana to Montana because he thought if he \"took the rap\" for his wife and made sure her nursing license was \"safe,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   it might \"sweeten the deal\" with her in their divorce proceedings pertaining to custody.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\u00b611] Mr. Dixon's trial strategy caught the State by surprise. On cross-examination, the State worked to reinforce that Mr. Dixon knowingly possessed the marijuana despite his recanted admissions. The State played clips of the footage taken inside the patrol car, which shows Mr. Dixon becoming nervous, swearing, and putting his hands on his face each time Trooper Jurca neared the bag containing marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Dixon admitted he showed \"signs of anxiety\" and placed his hands over his eyes when Trooper Jurca neared the bag even though he could not see it, because he \"knew there was going to be a lot of marijuana in that bag.\" The State also questioned Mr. Dixon's veracity and probed the weaknesses with his defense theory. Mr.\n   Dixon admitted he lied to Trooper Jurca when he denied driving erratically on the night of the traffic stop. He admitted he lied to Trooper Jurca about trafficking marijuana in order to protect his wife even though he knew he had the right to remain silent and no one suspected the five pounds of marijuana might belong to her. He admitted that he owns a mining company in Chile but made up the story about having financial problems in order to take attention away from his wife. Mr. Dixon admitted he lied on multiple occasions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Q. ... You tell the truth and sometimes you lie; isn't that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Q. It's not just on one occasion, though, is it? You do it multiple times?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   [\u00b612] After being caught off guard by the defense's trial strategy, the State obtained a fifteen-minute break to prepare Trooper Jurca as its rebuttal witness. On rebuttal, Trooper Jurca explained his familiarity with marijuana trafficking. He opined that the marijuana found in Mr. Dixon's vehicle was more consistent with trafficking than with medicinal marijuana because it was double vacuum-packed, tied shut in a black trash bag, and concealed in a large bag, which is typically done by people trying to hide illegal substances. The State provided Trooper Jurca with State's Exhibit 13-a copy of the Colorado Constitution pertaining to medical marijuana. Trooper Jurca read portions of the exhibit to the jury. He summarized that Colorado law permits caregivers to have up to two ounces of usable marijuana and \"six marijuana plants, with three or fewer being mature, flowering plants that are producing a usable form of marijuana[,]\" and opined Mr. Dixon's testimony about the amount of marijuana a caregiver may legally possess was inconsistent with Colorado law. The district court admitted the exhibit into evidence at the conclusion of Trooper Jurca's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   [\u00b613] On cross-examination, Trooper Jurca testified he had never purchased marijuana from a dispensary or grower and had never been a caregiver. He stated that he lived in Colorado for two years as a student but was never a law enforcement officer there. Concerning Colorado medical marijuana law, Trooper Jurca admitted he had no idea how many times the law may have been amended, whether State's Exhibit 13 was the current and entire law on the subject, or whether a doctor can permissibly prescribe more than the amounts described in the exhibit. The State did not call any further witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b614] The district court instructed the jury and the parties presented closing arguments. The jury found Mr. Dixon guilty on both charges. The district court merged the charges for sentencing purposes and sentenced Mr. Dixon to four to six years of imprisonment, with credit for 111 days of presentence confinement. Mr. Dixon timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. The District Court Properly Denied Mr. Dixon's Motion to Suppress\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   [\u00b615] Mr. Dixon filed a pre-trial motion to suppress evidence. He argued the warrantless search of the minivan was unreasonable and violated his rights under both the federal and state constitutions because Trooper Jurca continually leaned his head into the passenger window throughout the stop without consent or probable cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   [\u00b616] At the suppression hearing, Trooper Jurca testified he \"smelled the very distinct odor of marijuana\" as the wind blew across his face while issuing a written warning to Mr. Dixon. He told Mr. Dixon to \"wait\" and instructed him to close his driver's side window, after which Trooper Jurca stuck his head into the vehicle and \"smelled the odor of marijuana distinctly again.\" In its written order denying the suppression motion, the district court made the following findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (4) As Trooper [Jurca] is handing back Mr. Dixon's paperwork and warning, indicating the end of the stop, Trooper [Jurca] paused and smelled marijuana emanating from the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (5) Trooper Jurca then directs Mr. Dixon to roll up [the] driver side window to confirm that the smell is coming from the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (6) Trooper Jurca leaned his head into [the] vehicle, and while leaned in to confirm the smell, [he] saw and retrieved the bud of marijuana on the passenger seat.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (7) Trooper Jurca has sufficient training and experience to recognize the smell of, and the physical appearance of marijuana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (8) Trooper Jurca's presence at the vehicle included reaching inside to exchange paperwork with Mr. Dixon, including the return of license, paperwork, and to issue a warning was both reasonable and lawful.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The district court concluded that \"Trooper Jurca possessed probable cause to believe that marijuana was present in Mr. Dixon's vehicle at the moment he smelled marijuana while returning [Mr. Dixon's] paperwork\" and, thus, Trooper Jurca did not violate Mr. Dixon's federal or state constitutional rights. On appeal, Mr. Dixon contests the district court's findings and requests we reverse the district court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   [\u00b617] When reviewing a denial of a motion to suppress evidence, we adopt the district court's factual findings unless those findings are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Rather, Mr. Dixon asserts the outcome is the same under both constitutions and turns on whether Trooper Jurca's actions were reasonable.

Thus, resolution of this issue hinges on whether Trooper Jurca detected the odor of marijuana before he leaned into the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   [\u00b623] The district court generally found Trooper Jurca's testimony credible and supportive of a finding that he initially smelled marijuana before he crossed the threshold of the door. Specifically, the district court determined that Trooper Jurca smelled marijuana emanating from the vehicle while handing Mr. Dixon paperwork. Mr. Dixon argues these findings are inconsistent with Trooper Jurca's actions depicted in the traffic stop video. He claims the video shows that, as Trooper Jurca explained the written warning, he leaned further inside the passenger window, ordered Mr. Dixon to close the driver's side window and \"said something to the effect that [I] 'thought I caught a whiff here, hold on,' and stuck his head and upper body fully into the open window.\" Mr. Dixon argues that when Trooper Jurca's suppression hearing testimony and the video are considered together, \"at best, [Trooper Jurca] smelled the odor of marijuana on the wind\" and was uncertain where the odor originated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   [\u00b624] As stated above, we must uphold the district court's findings unless we conclude they are clearly erroneous.\n   <em>\n    Kunselman\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8186049\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/188/567/\">\n    188 P.3d at 569\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    King v.

Although the video evidence is less than conclusive, our review of the record as a whole does not convince us that the district court made a mistake in its findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   [\u00b625] Trooper Jurca unequivocally testified that he smelled marijuana before he crossed the threshold of the passenger door. The video provides a limited view of the passenger side of the vehicle, making it difficult to tell where Trooper Jurca's head was when he first smelled marijuana. The footage does not patently contradict Trooper Jurca's testimony and the district court's findings, as Mr. Dixon suggests. Instead, the video shows that, as Trooper Jurca was lawfully issuing Mr. Dixon a warning through the passenger window, Trooper Jurca stood at the passenger door, appeared to react to something (as evidenced by his body movements), and told Mr. Dixon to \"wait.\" The video also shows Trooper Jurca's body position markedly changed between the time he testified he initially smelled marijuana to when he admitted he crossed the threshold of the passenger door and smelled marijuana again. With respect to the latter, Trooper Jurca's upper body clearly is extended forward and he is on his tip toes. Given Trooper Jurca's body position when he initially smelled marijuana, the marijuana odor undoubtedly came from the vehicle.

However, the State contends that the district court did not transgress a clear and unequivocal evidentiary rule when it admitted the challenged rebuttal evidence because Trooper Jurca had personal knowledge of the content of State's Exhibit 13 and he did not provide a specialized opinion about Colorado law. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   [\u00b629] State's Exhibit 13 and Trooper Jurca's related testimony were admitted as evidence for the jury to consider; the parties therefore briefed this issue as a question of that evidence's admissibility under the Wyoming Rules of Evidence. The parties failed, however, to address the more fundamental problem. If Colorado law was material, determining the law of that state was a legal ruling for the court to make, not the jury.

W.R.Cr.P. 30(a). Here, the State gave no notice of its intent to use Colorado medical marijuana law, the district court made no ruling, and the court did not instruct the jury on Colorado law. Instead, by admitting State's Exhibit 13 and Trooper Jurca's testimony, the State and the court left the jury to determine the veracity of the exhibit and the requirements of Colorado law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   [\u00b630] Had the State followed W.R.Cr.P. 26.1 and offered the exhibit and Trooper Jurca's testimony to advise the district court in determining Colorado medical marijuana law, admissibility under the Wyoming Rules of Evidence would be irrelevant. W.R.Cr.P. 26.1. Nevertheless, the State offered the exhibit and testimony as rebuttal evidence that had to comport with the Wyoming Rules of Evidence. It did not. Trooper Jurca clearly lacked personal knowledge of Colorado medical marijuana law and could not opine, based on his brief review and recitation of an excerpt from the Colorado Constitution, whether Mr. Dixon's statements were inconsistent with Colorado law. Accordingly, Trooper Jurca's rebuttal testimony was admitted in violation of W.R.E. 602 (he did not establish personal knowledge on a matter of law by reading an excerpt from the Colorado Constitution minutes before testifying),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and W.R.E. 701 (he provided no clarification of his prior testimony or assistance in the determination of a fact in issue; rather, he offered an uninformed opinion on a matter of law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   [\u00b631] The district court also erred by admitting State's Exhibit 13. The record offers no explanation why the district court declined to admit the exhibit when the State first offered it, but then reversed course after the State offered it again without providing further foundation. Trooper Jurca never identified State's Exhibit 13 and could not say whether it was, in fact, the current law in Colorado on medical marijuana, as required by W.R.E. 602 and 901 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   3 Wharton's Criminal Evidence \u00a7 14:2 (15th ed. 2018) (explaining that authenticity is established when a witness with personal knowledge testifies that an exhibit accurately portrays what it depicts). Rather, Trooper Jurca testified that during the break he had read what was on the paper the prosecutor was holding, and then, on the State's request, he recited portions of the text contained in State's Exhibit 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State did not otherwise\n   lay foundation for Exhibit 13 or demonstrate its relevance as required by W.R.E. 402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   [\u00b632] Though the State failed to comply with W.R.Cr.P. 26.1 and the district court erred by admitting Trooper Jurca's testimony and State's Exhibit 13, those errors did not materially prejudice Mr. Dixon. In assessing material prejudice, we may consider several factors including: \"(1) whether the evidence furnished important corroboration of other testimony; (2) whether it related to a material, consequential fact; (3) whether counsel relied on the evidence in argument; (4) whether the evidence was cumulative; and (5) the effect of any instructions given to the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Hathaway\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 33,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12343329\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/399/625/\">\n    399 P.3d at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).

The record makes clear that the State used Trooper Jurca's rebuttal testimony as an attack on Mr. Dixon's credibility, which was at issue all along.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense counsel mitigated possible prejudice when he effectively cross-examined Trooper Jurca about his lack of personal knowledge on Colorado law, and elicited Trooper Jurca's admissions that (1) he had never purchased marijuana from a dispensary or grower and had never been a caregiver, (2) he was never a law enforcement officer in Colorado, (3) he had no idea how many times the Colorado law may have been amended or whether State's Exhibit 13 was the current and entire law on the subject, and (4) he had no idea whether a doctor can prescribe more than the amounts described in State's Exhibit 13. Trooper Jurca also admitted that State's Exhibit 13 indicated that Colorado permits possession of more than two ounces of marijuana if medically necessary. The district court instructed the jury that it was the \"sole judge of the credibility of the witnesses and of the weight to be given their testimony\"; that in judging credibility, the jury could consider the witnesses' means of knowledge of the facts and their interest in the outcome of the trial, and that the jury was not required to accept an opinion expressed by a witness. These mitigating factors are important, as is the strength of the State's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   [\u00b634] The State presented uncontroverted evidence that Trooper Jurca discovered over five pounds of marijuana in the back of Mr. Dixon's vehicle, which, based on his experience and training, was packaged consistent with drug trafficking and not medical or dispensary marijuana. The State also presented testimony from Trooper Jurca that Mr. Dixon admitted he knowingly possessed the marijuana and intended to deliver it to a gas station in Libby, Montana, in exchange for payment due to his financial problems. The detention deputy corroborated Trooper Jurca's testimony concerning Mr. Dixon's admission. And, Mr. Dixon testified he made those statements to Trooper Jurca, albeit falsely. In addition, the jury viewed the traffic stop video showing Mr. Dixon's emotional reaction, in the form of nervousness, swearing, and putting his hands on his face, as Trooper Jurca searched the back of the minivan and neared the large bag containing marijuana. The jury also heard Mr. Dixon's cross-examination testimony that he showed \"signs of anxiety\" and placed his hands over his eyes when Trooper Jurca neared the bag even though he could not see it, because he \"knew that there was going to be a lot of marijuana in that bag.\" In light of the State's evidence, and reviewing the entire record, we conclude there is no reasonable probability the verdict would have been more favorable if the State's improper rebuttal evidence had been excluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     III.

That amount of marijuana would be just fine for five patients.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    He never offered any statutory authority for that.

This is State's Exhibit number 13. It's Article XVIII, Section 14.

The testimony by Trooper Jurca is that medical marijuana isn't packaged in vacuum-sealed bags, kept in another garbage bag and placed in a bag that is used for transport, you know, a luggage bag. This is consistent with transportation of controlled substance for distribution. Do you remember that testimony?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Also, when you look at medical situations, and if that is medical marijuana, where is the prescription? Have you ever got a prescription that was just raw, without advice, without labeling, without barcodes? There was none on this.

It became that is her stash of marijuana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   It's not a consistent story that makes sense when we talk about the statement of the defendant's, which he said is now a lie, that he was going to transfer the marijuana to Libby, Montana, and give it to a party who he wouldn't give the name of at this time and place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   A lot of time for contemplation, a lot of time to develop a story that a person believes will hold weight.

He did not do that because he is not interested in the facts.

Not only in his own testimony said that is exactly what he is going to do, but also the condition of the evidence as Officer Jurca and the trooper that was assisting him found that evidence. That marijuana was not in possession for medical use; it was in possession for transportation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   You don't put medical marijuana in double-layered bags so that the smell won't permeate the area. You do it because you do not want to be detected. And that is what he was trying to do today. He wants to fabricate so you will believe something that is not based on the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   We will go back to the first instruction. The statements, as we look at them in our jury packet, have to be corroborated by good and convincing evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Take every statement that the defendant made. Other than his own testimony, where is it corroborated? There is no corroboration except in his next statement, which may or may not be true. He doesn't raise his hand when he's telling the truth. So we don't know if he's telling the truth or if it is an inconsistent statement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   He possessed marijuana, and he possessed it with the intent to deliver, and he should be convicted on both counts. Not because I say so, but because the evidence says so, because his statements at the scene say so, because in order -- you can look at what he has at stake. He has his very freedom at stake.

The prosecutor's argument, considered in context, shows that the prosecutor did not implore the jury to decide the case based on his word that \"[t]he State gave you the truth.\" Rather, the prosecutor was evaluating the evidence regarding how the marijuana was packaged and the evidence the State presented to rebut the defense's medical marijuana theory. Because the prosecutor did not assert the State's credibility as a basis for convicting Mr. Dixon, no plain error occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ii.

Defense counsel objected, noting that the defense had \"absolutely no burden to present anything to [the prosecutor] prior to trial\"; the district court responded by cautioning the prosecutor to avoid burden shifting. As the prosecutor neared the end of his rebuttal argument he asked, rhetorically, \"In this case, who gave you the truth?\" Defense counsel again objected, arguing the question posed to the jury constituted improper vouching. The court sustained the objection and instructed the jury to disregard the statement. We evaluate these portions of the prosecutor's closing argument for harmless error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   [\u00b652] The prosecutor's \"fair shake\" and \"bring home the bacon\" comments, read in context, did not improperly shift the burden of proof to the defense. As discussed above, Mr. Dixon testified about his understanding of Colorado medical marijuana law, recanted his prior admissions about the planned drug transaction, and provided an explanation as to why he made up the story about the planned drug transaction. The prosecutor's closing argument, considered in its entirety, was directed to the implausibility of Mr. Dixon's theory and the rebuttal of Mr. Dixon's testimony. The district court's warning notwithstanding, and for the reasons discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, the prosecutor's closing argument cannot fairly be characterized as shifting the burden of proof to Mr. Dixon or constituting conduct that otherwise affected Mr. Dixon's right to a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Proffit\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 31-32,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8201991\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/193/228/\">\n    193 P.3d at 240-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   [\u00b653] Nor did the prosecutor's rhetorical question, \"who gave you the truth?\" constitute harmful error. Putting this statement in context, the prosecutor asked the jury to look at all of the evidence, especially Mr. Dixon's inconsistent stories, and then answer the question, \"who gave you the truth?\" To avoid any possibility the jury might interpret the prosecutor's rhetorical question as vouching for the State's evidence, the district court sustained Mr. Dixon's objection and instructed the jury to disregard the statement.

Mr. Dixon acknowledges that pursuant to defense counsel's trial strategy, his counsel did not cross-examine the State's witnesses, but instead, challenged the State's case solely through Mr. Dixon's testimony. This strategy necessarily required the jury to believe that Mr. Dixon falsely told Trooper Jurca he intended to deliver and sell the drugs in Montana in order to avoid implicating his wife and jeopardizing her Colorado nursing license. Mr. Dixon therefore contends that his credibility was crucial to his defense, and that by failing to object to the improper rebuttal testimony and the prosecutor's closing arguments, defense counsel left Mr. Dixon's credibility open to attack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   [\u00b658] Though we agree that Mr. Dixon's credibility was crucial to his defense, we cannot say that defense counsel's failure to object to the State's rebuttal evidence or the prosecutor's evaluation of that evidence during closing arguments fell outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance. Defense counsel effectively cross-examined Trooper Jurca as to his lack of personal knowledge about Colorado medical marijuana law and thereby called Trooper Jurca's credibility into question. During closing arguments, defense counsel explained the State's rebuttal evidence was untrustworthy because State's Exhibit 13 was dated March 1, 1999, and there was no assurance it was still good law after 18 years. In this vein, defense counsel remarked to the jury: \"I can get a copy of the United States constitution that says slavery is still legal, women can't vote, and the president can serve more than two terms. Doesn't have any reflection on the reality that is today.\" When viewed in context of the circumstances surrounding the admission of the State's rebuttal evidence, these efforts reflect sound trial strategy and an exercise of reasonable judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brock\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 10,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6984513\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/272/933/\">\n    272 P.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   936 ;\n   <em>\n    Luftig\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6994741\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/228/857/\">\n    228 P.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   [\u00b659] Mr. Dixon has failed to overcome the presumption that his counsel rendered constitutionally adequate assistance.
