In that proceeding, Brittner sought joint legal decision-making and equal parenting time of his children. The family court appointed Dr. Daniel Christiano as a custody evaluator. Christiano recommended the family see a TI. The parties provided the family court with a stipulated agreement to appoint Lanzilotta, and the court appointed her. Pursuant to the order, Lanzilotta was appointed to rehabilitate relationships between Brittner and the minor children, establish \"rules for [the] exchange of [the] children in order to enhance safety and health in the family,\" make referrals for therapy as necessary, and facilitate conflict resolution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his amended complaint, Brittner acknowledged that Lanzilotta was appointed by court order and that the court relied on Lanzilotta's recommendations in issuing its final decree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Lanzilotta moved to dismiss the complaint under Arizona Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), arguing she was entitled to judicial immunity as a court-appointed TI. The court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Brittner timely appealed from the resulting final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ariz. R. Civ.

This court ultimately concluded that the therapist in\n   <em>\n    Paul E.\n   </em>\n   was not entitled to judicial immunity because the trial court expressly ordered that she continue in the role of a privately retained therapist, rather than an advisor to the court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56, \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567512\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/418/413/#p423\">\n    418 P.3d at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Brittner cites\n   <em>\n    Lavit\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that judicial immunity is not afforded to a nonjudicial officer who works exclusively for one party or who performs ministerial activities that are not part of the clinical and reporting function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lavit\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477717\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/173/96/#p99\">\n    173 Ariz. at 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1477717\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/173/96/#p99\">\n    839 P.2d at 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But we do not parcel out therapeutic service from evaluation and reporting to the court nor do we limit immunity only for services related to the judicial process. To do so is neither practical nor possible. Here, therapy sessions were not separate from the evaluation leading to an expert opinion; the sessions are the observation and information gathering that enable the expert to formulate her opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b611 Looking solely at the facts alleged in the amended complaint, Lanzilotta was appointed to provide therapeutic services and make recommendations to the court. Brittner did not allege that Lanzilotta worked exclusively for one party or that his causes of action against her were based on \"ministerial activities\" unrelated to the formulation of her expert opinion. Rather, he alleged that Lanzilotta's work \"in the Family Action\" was deficient: she caused harm to his family, she \"has a Duty of Care to both [him] and [his] minor children in the Family Action,\" she owes him and \"each one of his children in the Family Action\" a standard of care, and he and his children \"in the Family Action relied on that Standard of Care.\" The facts and causes of action alleged in the complaint are all derived from Lanzilotta's work as a court-appointed TI. Judicial immunity for a court-appointed therapist is appropriate. The therapist cannot serve two masters-her obligation is ultimately to the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b612 Lanzilotta acted as a nonjudicial officer when she performed a court ordered function by aiding the court in making its final custody order. Judicial immunity applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b613 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the superior court's grant of the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    Brittner did not include the entire family court order in his amended complaint; on appeal, Lanzilotta asks this court to take judicial notice of the remainder of the order.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     State v.
