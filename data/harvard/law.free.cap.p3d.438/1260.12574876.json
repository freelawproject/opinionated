They each had one child from prior relationships, and they had one child together who was born in 1989. In 2001, the Meiners separated, and in 2002 they executed a Child Custody and Property Settlement Agreement (Divorce Agreement). The Divorce Agreement gave Colleen Meiners primary custody of the couple's child and Theo Meiners reasonable visitation. Theo Meiners was to pay child support in the amount of $ 375.00 per month until the child reached the age of majority in April 2007. The agreement specified that Theo Meiners would be entitled to all his personal property being stored in the garage of the couple's residence and that he would remove that property by January 23, 2002. With respect to the couple's real property, which consisted only of their residence, the Divorce Agreement provided:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties['] real property located at 25 Aspen Drive will be sold to Wife under the following terms and conditions:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a. The purchase price shall be one half the fair market value as determined by an independent appraiser agreed to by the parties, which has been determined to be $ 285,000.00, less six percent (6%) sales commission, and less all outstanding taxes, mortgages and liens on the property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   b. Wife shall pay to Husband one half the net equity in the property as of August 30, 2001. Payment shall be due and payable when the property is sold or upon the emancipation of the parties' minor son, [AM].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   c. There shall be no monthly payments, however the purchase price shall accrue interest at the rate of six percent (6%) simple interest per annum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   d. Wife shall receive as a credit toward the purchase price the sum of $ 2,460.00 which represents back child support owed by Husband as of August 30, 2001.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   e. Husband shall execute all documents necessary to effect a transfer of title and ownership to Wife, as her sole and separate property, as may be required by any governmental entity, financial institution, or lender;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   f. Wife shall execute all documents necessary to protect Husband's security interest in the real property located at 25 Aspen Drive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   After executing the Divorce Agreement, the Meiners had second thoughts about divorcing and did not file the Divorce Agreement in district court, though a divorce complaint had already been filed with the court. Between 2001 and 2007, Theo Meiners resided part of the year in Alaska, where he had a heli-skiing business, and part of the year in Jackson with Colleen Meiners. In 2007, the district court notified the Meiners that their divorce complaint would be dismissed for lack of prosecution if no action was taken on the matter, and the Meiners then decided to proceed with their divorce. On July 20, 2007, the Divorce Agreement was filed with the court, and on that same day, the district court entered a Decree of Divorce.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   After the divorce decree was entered in 2007, the Meiners continued to have a good relationship and live as they had prior to their divorce, with Theo Meiners residing part of the year in Alaska and part of the year in Jackson with Colleen Meiners. In 2010, the Meiners refinanced the residence at 25 Aspen Drive, executing the necessary documents as husband and wife. Neither Theo Meiners nor Colleen Meiners followed the terms of the Divorce Agreement before or after their divorce.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   On September 20, 2012, Theo Meiners died, and on November 7, 2012, his daughter, Alexandra Meiners, was appointed as personal representative of his estate. On October 7, 2013, Alexandra Meiners, on behalf of the estate, filed a complaint against Colleen Meiners alleging claims of breach of contract, unjust enrichment, enforcement of divorce decree, and slander of title. The breach of contract claim sought enforcement of the Divorce Agreement and in particular the agreement's real property division requiring Colleen Meiners to pay Theo Meiners one-half the net equity in the property located at 25 Aspen Drive, plus interest, based on the property's 2001 appraised value.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 7, 2013, Colleen Meiners filed an answer and counterclaim. She alleged numerous affirmative defenses, including laches and waiver, and asserted a counterclaim for breach of contract by which she sought damages for Theo Meiners' breach of the Divorce Agreement. Specifically, Colleen Meiners alleged that Theo Meiners breached the Divorce Agreement by: failing to remove his personal items from the property located at 25 Aspen Drive; failing to pay child support; failing to pay any portion of the mortgage on the property located at 25 Aspen Drive; and failing to pay his portion of the couple's debt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00b6\u00b6 3-7,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786679\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/376/493/\">\n    376 P.3d at 494-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   [\u00b64] The parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Alexandra on her slander of title claim, although it did not determine any damages she had suffered on that claim.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   ., \u00b6 9,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6786679\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/376/493/\">\n    376 P.3d at 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although we dismissed the appeal, we did offer guidance for the district court on remand.

Before the trial began, the parties agreed the divorce agreement had merged with the divorce decree, leaving for determination at trial the amount Colleen owed the estate under the decree, whether the doctrine of laches applied to enforcement of the decree, and whether the estate was responsible for mortgage payments and storage fees. After receiving the evidence, the district court ordered post-trial briefing and closing arguments at a later date. Before closing arguments took place, this Court published its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Acton v. Acton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349351\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/1279/#p406\">\n    2017 WY 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349351\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/1279/#p406\">\n    406 P.3d 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Wyo. 2017). In\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   , we acknowledged the general rule regarding divorce agreements merging with divorce decrees, but also stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   However, this Court has long recognized that even a contract with an integration clause, for instance a divorce agreement, may be modified through oral agreement or by mutual conduct of the parties if certain conditions are met.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Big-D Signature Corp. v.

The district court acknowledged\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   but believed it conflicted with this Court's long-standing precedent and the admonition contained in the remand. The court concluded that, because the divorce agreement merged with the divorce decree, the parties could no longer avail themselves of contract remedies. Further, Wyoming Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) did not afford Colleen relief from the divorce decree. Based on the terms of the divorce agreement and decree, Colleen was obligated to pay the estate $ 125,055.35 for Theo's share of the real property. The court determined the doctrine of laches is an equitable remedy that cannot be applied when the action is to enforce a legal judgment such as a divorce decree. The court also found the divorce agreement was silent regarding mortgage contributions from Theo and, therefore, the court could not require those contributions when enforcing the decree. Finally, the court determined Colleen was not entitled to storage fees. As with the mortgage contributions, the divorce agreement did not contemplate storage fees. The court further concluded that even if awarding storage fees would be appropriate as a means of enforcing the divorce decree, Colleen did not provide an adequate evidentiary basis of an appropriate storage rate. Colleen filed a timely notice of appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   [\u00b68] We use the following standard of review when reviewing a district court's decision following a bench trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The factual findings of a judge are not entitled to the limited review afforded a jury verdict. While the findings are presumptively\n   correct, the appellate court may examine all of the properly admissible evidence in the record. Due regard is given to the opportunity of the trial judge to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and our review does not entail re-weighing disputed evidence. Findings of fact will not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous. A finding is clearly erroneous when, although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. In considering a trial court's factual findings, we assume that the evidence of the prevailing party below is true and give that party every reasonable inference that can fairly and reasonably be drawn from it. We do not substitute ourselves for the trial court as a finder of facts; instead, we defer to those findings unless they are unsupported by the record or erroneous as a matter of law.

Colleen submits the evidence at trial shows that she and Theo agreed that Theo would not require Colleen to pay him for his equity in the home and the two acted in conformity with that agreement. She maintains she would have proceeded differently had she known she would be responsible for the payment; specifically, she would have refinanced the house and paid Theo his share in 2007 when the house had an increased value instead of waiting until now and owing the estate interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   [\u00b611] The district court did not apply\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   for two reasons. First, this Court specifically instructed the district court to apply the general rule that it is presumed a divorce agreement merges in the divorce decree and that courts do not retain jurisdiction to modify property distributions. The parties stipulated that the divorce agreement merged with the decree. Second, the district court surmised the decision in\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   \"appears to be an erroneous statement of the law.\" The court recognized that the holding in\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   seemed to conflict with this Court's mandate, would constitute a \"sea change\" in the area of family law in Wyoming, and may alter the outcome of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [\u00b612] The facts from\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   can be distinguished to some extent from the facts here. While in both cases the parties' divorce agreement was incorporated into the divorce decree, the subsequent oral agreement in\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   did not modify who received what property, but instead simply extended the amount of time the husband had to remove his property from the former marital home.\n   <em>\n    Acton\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12349351\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/406/1279/#p406\">\n    406 P.3d at 1280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although this factual distinction could be considered significant, both cases implicate the general rule of finality in the property distribution terms of divorce decrees.

The district court denied Colleen's request for storage fees on two bases. First, it determined that, to the extent it could treat the divorce agreement as an independent contract before it merged into the divorce decree, the agreement did not include a provision for storage fees. The court then considered whether it could award storage fees as part of enforcing the divorce decree since Theo's belongings have been in the home long after the court ordered the items be removed via the divorce decree.

To find that Theo was a tenant in common and was required to contribute fifty percent of the mortgage payments would be contrary to the established rule discussed above that prohibits parties from orally modifying the terms of a divorce decree absent judicial intervention. The divorce agreement and decree did not provide that Theo was responsible for any of the mortgage payments, therefore, the district court properly declined Colleen's request for mortgage contributions from the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   [\u00b629] The district court correctly determined that a divorce agreement that has merged into a divorce decree cannot be modified by oral agreement of the parties, and we overrule our decision in\n   <em>\n    Acton v.
