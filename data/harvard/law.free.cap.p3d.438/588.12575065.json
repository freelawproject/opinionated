The defense may be\n   raised when a defendant demonstrates that they reasonably believed the commission of the crime was necessary to avoid or minimize a harm, the harm sought to be avoided was greater than the harm resulting from a violation of the law, the threatened harm was not brought about by the defendant, and no reasonable legal alternative existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b62 Kenneth Ward appeals his conviction for burglary in the second degree after he broke into a Kinder Morgan pipeline facility and turned off a valve, which stopped the flow of Canadian tar sands oil to refineries in Skagit and Whatcom Counties. Ward intended to protest the continued use of tar sands oil, which he contends significantly contributes to climate change, and the inaction by governments to meaningfully address the crisis of climate change. Ward argues that he was deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to present his only defense-necessity-after the trial court granted the State's motion in limine excluding all testimony and evidence of necessity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree and reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b63 Kinder Morgan transports tar sands oil from Canada into the United States by pipeline. On October 11, 2016, Kinder Morgan was notified by telephone that persons \"would be closing a valve, one of our main line valves in the Mount Vernon area within the next 15 minutes.\" Following the call, Ward cut off a padlock and entered the Kinder Morgan pipeline facility off of Peterson Road in Burlington. Ward then closed a valve on the Trans-Mountain pipeline and placed sunflowers on the valve. At the same time, other protesters closed similar valves in North Dakota, Montana, and Minnesota. Collectively, the protests temporarily stopped the flow of Canadian tar sands oil from entering into the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b64 Ward was arrested at the pipeline facility and charged with burglary in the second degree, criminal sabotage, and criminal trespass in the second degree. Ward admitted his conduct but argued that his actions were protected under a necessity defense. The trial court granted the State's pretrial motion in limine to preclude all witnesses and evidence offered in support of Ward's necessity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b65 Ward's first trial ended with a hung jury. The State then recharged Ward with burglary in the second degree and criminal sabotage. Ward moved for reconsideration of the trial court's order granting the State's motion in limine. In support of his motion, Ward offered argument, the curriculum vitae for eight proposed expert witnesses, and voluminous scientific evidence documenting the impacts of climate change, that climate change is primarily caused by greenhouse gas emissions resulting from human activity, and the contribution of burning tar sands oil. The trial court denied Ward's motion for reconsideration and excluded all testimony and evidence in support of Ward's necessity defense. A second jury found Ward guilty of burglary but were unable to return a verdict on criminal sabotage. Ward appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b66 Ward argues that the trial court denied his constitutional right to present a defense by granting the State's motion in limine striking all testimony and evidence of necessity.

In this light, we review Ward's offer of proof as to each element of the necessity defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b614 Ward presented sufficient evidence that he reasonably believed the crimes he committed were necessary to minimize the harms that he perceived. Ward's offer of proof included evidence of how past acts of civil disobedience have been successful, evidence of previous climate activism campaigns, and evidence of his own personal successes in effectuating change through civil disobedience. Specifically, Ward offered evidence that he has been working with environmental issues for more than 40 years but that the majority of his efforts failed to achieve effective results. Ward asserted that because of these failures he \"came to understand that the issue of climate change would require other than incremental change\" and that \"direct action was necessary to accomplish these goals.\" Ward offered three experts-Eric de Place, Bill McKibben, and Martin Gilens-who were prepared to testify as to the efficacy of civil disobedience and how such actions have become necessary in the climate movement. Ward argued that to decide whether his actions were \"reasonably calculated to be effective in averting the imminent harm of climate change requires [the] expert testimony and evidence\" that he was prepared to present to the jury, and that whether his beliefs were reasonable was a question for the jury, not the trial court, to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b615 The State argues that it was unreasonable for Ward to believe that the commission of this crime was necessary to avoid or minimize harm. The State asserts, first, that all Ward did was temporarily inconvenience Kinder Morgan's employees so it was unreasonable to think that his actions would actually avoid or minimize the broader harms associated with climate change. And second, that because Ward had legal alternatives available it was unreasonable for him to believe that his actions were necessary to avoid or minimize harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b616 Whether Ward's beliefs were reasonable was a question for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

And further, Ward did not have to prove that the harm he sought to avoid or minimize was actually avoided or minimized but instead that the reason he broke the law was in an attempt to avoid or minimize harm.\n   <em>\n    Gallegos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1748665\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/73/644/#p651\">\n    73 Wash.

Ward's past successes in effectuating change through civil disobedience in conjunction with the proposed expert witnesses and testimony about Ward's beliefs were sufficient evidence to persuade a fair minded, rational juror that Ward's beliefs were reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Ward also argues that the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury on a necessity defense. Because we conclude that the trial court violated Ward's constitutional right to present a defense, we reverse and remand for a new trial. Therefore, we do not address whether the trial court also erred in rejecting Ward's jury instruction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    This is in sharp contrast with the abuse of discretion standard for reviewing a trial court's refusal to give a jury instruction.

Ward asserted that the extent of the harm resulting from his actions were the loss of a few locks and the temporary inconvenience to Kinder Morgan's employees. Compared to this, Ward introduced \"voluminous scientific evidence of the harms of climate change.\" This evidence included information establishing climate change is real and detrimentally effecting Washington, and that tar sands oil poses a specifically acute threat to our environment. Further, Ward offered to present testimony from climate scientists, Drs. James Hansen, Richard Gammon, and Celia Bitz, supporting his defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    C.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    \u00b618 Whether the harms of global climate change was brought about by Ward was not an issue in this case.

Ward argued that the window for action on climate change has narrowed to the point that immediate, emergency action is necessary. Ward offered evidence of his more than 40 years being involved in various environmental movements, the numerous attempts he has made to address climate change, and how most of those efforts have failed. Ward additionally offered proposed testimony by pipeline industry expert Eric de Place, professor and climate campaigner Bill McKibben, and professor of political science Martin Gilens, to the effect that the fossil fuel industry's influence over political institutions renders traditional legal avenues unreasonable as a means of addressing the climate emergency.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \u00b620\n    <em>\n     State v.

Whether Ward's evidence was sufficient to establish that his history of failed attempts to address climate change revealed the futility of supposed reasonable alternatives was a question for the jury. Viewed in the light most favorable to Ward, and admitting the truth of his evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom, Ward's offer of proof created a question for the jury.\n    <em>\n     Cole\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"418565\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-app/74/571/#p578\">\n     74 Wash.

If here, for example, Ward's actions were purely symbolic-if they had no ability to actually avoid or minimize the harms he perceived-then his proffered evidence would have been aimed not at proving necessity but instead at inducing jury nullification. In such a situation, the trial court would not have erred in prohibiting\n    such evidence. If, however, Ward's actions were not purely symbolic-if they had some ability to actually avoid or minimize his perceived harms-then the evidence he offered would not have been aimed at inducing jury nullification and the trial court would have erred in prohibiting it. When civil disobedience and the necessity defense intersect, it is the intent of the protester, not the effectiveness of the protest, that is of the utmost relevance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    \u00b626 Here, in order to determine the intent behind Ward's actions, we must first determine what specific harm his protest was intended to avoid. If Ward was protesting global warming as a whole, then the impact of his action would be so infinitesimal that we would be unable to conclude anything other than that his actions were symbolic in nature. If, however, Ward was protesting more than climate change as a whole-if the harm he was attempting to alleviate was, for example, the danger of Canadian tar sands oil specifically or the danger that global warming poses to Washington-then we could conclude that his actions were actually intended to have an impact on the harm that he sought to avoid.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    \u00b627 Below, Ward phrased the harm that he sought to avoid as more than just global climate change. Ward asserted that the harm he was attempting to avoid was threefold: (1) global climate change, generally, has the potential to destroy our way of life, (2) Canadian tar sands oil is a uniquely potent contributor to climate change, and (3) the localized impacts of climate change on Washington has the potential to be debilitating.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    \u00b628 Ward argued that \"tar sands oil represent[s] an elevated level of risk to global climate[,]\" and that he felt he needed to act \"in order to stop the advance of global warming, encompassing both current and projected warming in Washington state, ocean acidification, and impacts on local ecosystems and residents.\" Further, Ward argued that his \"temporary shut-down of tar sands oil flowing through the Trans-Mountain Pipeline certainly minimized the harm flowing from that quantum's contribution to climate change ... and from the use of tar sands in particular.\" Ward also introduced exhibits about the danger that sea level rise poses to Washington.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    \u00b629 Based on the specific harms that Ward asserted he was trying to avoid, his actions were not merely symbolic. The protesters' intent was to physically stop the flow of Canadian tar sands oil into the United States. Because one of the specific harm Ward asserted was that Canadian tar sands oil is a particularly potent contributor to climate change, the protest was not a purely symbolic act. It was a direct way of preventing a uniquely potent contributor to climate change from entering the United States.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    \u00b630 Because the harms that Ward asserted he was trying to alleviate were more than just climate change, generally, but also included both the specific dangers of Canadian tar sands oil and the impacts of sea level rise on Washington, Ward's actions were not intended to be merely symbolic in nature. As such, the evidence he planned to introduce was not solely aimed at inducing jury nullification and the trial court erred in preventing Ward from introducing evidence in support of his necessity defense.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    V.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    \u00b631 The violation of a defendant's constitutional right is presumed to be prejudicial, but may be harmless \"if we are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that any reasonable jury would have reached the same result without the error.\"\n    <em>\n     Jones\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4007836\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/wash-2d/168/713/#p719\">\n     168 Wash.2d at 724\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=230%20P.3d%20576\">\n     230 P.3d 576\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . \"Such a determination is made from an examination of the record from which it must affirmatively appear the error is harmless.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

The State points to Ward's testimony\n    at trial concerning his legal alternatives.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    [Plaintiff's counsel]: What was your intent in shutting off that safety value on the 11th?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n    [Ward]: To stop the flow of tar sands oil running through that pipeline.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n    [Plaintiff's counsel]: Why were you attempting to do that?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n    [Ward]: I was attempting to take the most effective measure that I could think of to address this problem to avoid cataclysmic climate change.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    [Plaintiff's counsel]: Did you believe that there was anything left to do that may have been legal that could have addressed the issue?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n    ....\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n    [Ward]: I think that there are legal steps that can be taken, and I continue to take those.

The City of Portland has just announced a plan to shift to 100 percent renewable energy, and I supported that. I am engaged in general public education. And I am increasingly looking at ways to support candidates for office who endorse a significant plan of action on climate change.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    \u00b633 When viewed in its entirety, Ward's testimony indicates that Ward was addressing the ineffectiveness of his alternatives and was not admitting that he had reasonable legal alternatives available to him. Moreover, if the jury was allowed to hear Ward's testimony in conjunction with the excluded expert testimony, it could well have concluded that Ward's available legal alternatives were futile. The error was not harmless.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \u00b634 We reverse and remand.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    WE CONCUR:\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Smith, J.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Dwyer, J.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"3\">\n    <p id=\"p-70\">\n     And this type of action appears to be somewhat of Ward's forte.
