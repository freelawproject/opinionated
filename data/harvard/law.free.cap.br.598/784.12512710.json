For the reasons set forth below, the objection is overruled in part, and sustained in part. Specifically, while the Court overrules the objection insofar as Ms. Vidunas challenges the \"collective\" nature of the foreign proceeding at issue, the Court determines that the Foreign Representative has not met his burden of proving that the foreign proceeding is either a \"main\" proceeding or \"nonmain\" proceeding entitled to recognition under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At present, this case is not terribly complicated. Mr. O'Reilly is the former chairman and chief executive officer of the H.J. Heinz Company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vidunas v. O'Reilly\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CV-1746,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205177762\">\n    2015 WL 5177762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (W.D. Pa. Sept. 4, 2015). In 1995, Ms. Vidunas was hired to be Mr. O'Reilly's personal nurse and assistant. Around 2010 or 2011, the employment or independent contractor relationship, whatever it may have been, ended. Thereafter, in 2013 Ms. Vidunas filed a diversity action against Mr. O'Reilly in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania at Case No. 13-1746, asserting (by way of a\n   <em>\n    Second Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   ) a single cause of action sounding in breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   To date, the claim asserted in this federal lawsuit has not been liquidated; nor has it been reduced to judgment. In fact, after the commencement of this lawsuit, and in\n   June of 2015, Mr. O'Reilly filed a bankruptcy proceeding in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas-Supreme Court, Commercial Division at Docket No. 28-2015 (hereinafter, the \"\n   <em>\n    Bahamian Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Within the Bahamian Bankruptcy, and on or about July 8, 2016, the Honorable Justice Ian Winder issued a Certificate of Appointment, appointing Alastair Beveridge of AlixPartners Services, U.K., LLP (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bahamian Trustee\n   </em>\n   \") as the Trustee of Mr. O'Reilly's Bahamian Bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sometime after his appointment, the Bahamian Trustee was made aware of the litigation commenced by Ms. Vidunas against Mr. O'Reilly. Ms. Vidunas, or her counsel, was provided notice of the Bahamian Bankruptcy. But for reasons that have not been articulated or disclosed, Ms. Vidunas has been unwilling to participate as a creditor in the Bahamian Bankruptcy, has elected to not file a proof of claim or debt in the Bahamian Bankruptcy, and desires to proceed with her lawsuit against Mr. O'Reilly in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Consequently, the Bahamian Trustee commenced the instant case under Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n   \") by filing a petition for foreign recognition on November 26, 2018. Not long after the filing of the petition, the Bahamian Trustee filed his Motion for Recognition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"Recognition\" of a \"foreign proceeding\" under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code provides certain mandatory relief, and in some circumstances discretionary relief, from the bankruptcy court. The extent and scope of such relief depends upon whether the \"foreign proceeding\" is a foreign \"main proceeding\" or a foreign \"nonmain proceeding\" entitled to recognition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   By way of example, Section 1520 of the Bankruptcy Code provides that upon \"recognition\" of a foreign \"main proceeding,\" the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   applies with respect to both the debtor and property of the debtor that is within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201520\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Section 1520 also provides additional relief upon recognition of a foreign main proceeding, including authorizing the \"foreign representative\" to operate the debtor's business and affording him or her with the powers of a bankruptcy trustee to the extent provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20363\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 552.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201520\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).

Specifically, while Ms. Vidunas does not contest the status of the Bahamian Trustee as a \"foreign representative,\" Ms. Vidunas contends that the Bahamian Bankruptcy does not constitute a \"foreign proceeding\" as the term is defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23). As such, she contends that recognition of the Bahamian Bankruptcy is not appropriate since the recognition provisions of Chapter 15 apply only to \"foreign proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201515\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Vidunas also argues, in the alternative, that if the Bahamian Bankruptcy is a \"foreign proceeding,\" it is merely a \"nonmain\" proceeding and not a \"main\" proceeding. As Ms. Vidunas points out, this distinction is material because if the Bahamian Bankruptcy is a \"nonmain\" proceeding, the automatic stay of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is not triggered by the mere recognition of the foreign proceeding. Rather, according to Ms. Vidunas, the foreign representative is legally required to demonstrate why this Court should exercise its discretion and impose an injunction against Ms. Vidunas. In this regard, Ms. Vidunas has contended that the Bahamian Trustee has not set forth in his papers a claim for discretionary injunctive relief, let alone proven that such relief should be granted. Each of the objections of Ms. Vidunas are examined more fully below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Bahamian Bankruptcy is a \"Foreign Proceeding\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201515\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) plainly states that a foreign representative has standing to apply for recognition of a \"foreign proceeding\" under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201517\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   further sets forth what the foreign representative must prove in order to have a \"foreign proceeding\" recognized by the United States Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   What is clear by these provisions is that a bankruptcy court may recognize only those insolvency matters that fall within the statutory definition of \"foreign proceeding\" for purposes of Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code. If a foreign insolvency case fails to qualify as a \"foreign proceeding,\" no recognition is to be given.\n   <em>\n    In re Betcorp Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3319409\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/400/266/#p275\">\n    400 B.R. 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 275 (Bankr. D. Nev. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The term \"foreign proceeding\" is defined in Section 101(23) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The term \"foreign proceeding\" means a collective judicial or administrative proceeding in a foreign country, including an interim proceeding, under a law relating to insolvency or adjustment of debt in which proceeding the assets and affairs of the debtor are subject to control or supervision by a foreign court, for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23). Given this definition, the concept of a \"foreign proceeding\" can be broken down into seven components: (1) a proceeding, (2) that is either judicial or administrative, (3) that is collective in nature, (4) that is in a foreign country, (5) that is authorized or conducted under a law related to insolvency or adjustment of debts, (6) in which the debtor's assets and affairs are subject to the control or supervision of a foreign court, and (7) which proceeding is for the purpose of reorganization or liquidation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re ABC Learning Ctrs.

That is, the parties appear to agree that the Bahamian Bankruptcy is a proceeding, that it is judicial or administrative in nature, that the proceeding is pending in a foreign country, that the proceeding is authorized or conducted under a law related to insolvency or adjustment of debts, that the proceeding is under the control or supervision of a foreign court, and that the Bahamian Bankruptcy is for the purpose of liquidating Mr. O'Reilly's assets for the benefit of creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   While six of the components are not disputed, a seventh component is contested by Ms. Vidunas. Specifically, Ms. Vidunas' objection focuses on the \"collective in nature\" requirement. The gist of her objection is that the Bahamian Bankruptcy is allegedly antiquated and different from the bankruptcy process in the United States. According to Ms. Vidunas, these differences should translate to a finding that the Bahamian Bankruptcy is not \"collective in nature\" and is therefore not a \"foreign proceeding\" subject to recognition under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ms. Vidunas also offers a laundry list of other reasons why the Bahamian Bankruptcy is not \"collective\" in nature. This list includes the following reasons, which are referred to herein as the \"\n   <em>\n    Participation Objections\n   </em>\n   \": (1) Ms. Vidunas allegedly has not been afforded notice and opportunity to participate in the Bahamian Bankruptcy, (2) Ms. Vidunas allegedly does not have a remedy in the Bahamas to challenge improper notice, (3) Ms. Vidunas is allegedly disenfranchised from participating in a trustee election in the Bahamian Bankruptcy because her claims against Mr. O'Reilly are unliquidated, (4) creditors are precluded from pursuing direct claims against Mr. O'Reilly or participating in discovery as such powers are allegedly reposed solely in the Bahamian Trustee, and (5) there is little oversight regarding the Bahamian Trustee's determinations as to allowance of claims and elections to arbitrate (or not arbitrate) disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Participation Objections are germane to the matter\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   because all creditors must receive notice and have the ability to protect and assert their rights in order for a foreign proceeding to be classified as \"collective\" in nature.\n   <em>\n    In re ABC Learning Ctrs.

The gist of the Participation Objections is that Ms. Vidunas alleges that she has been deprived of a meaningful ability to participate and represent her interests in the Bahamian Bankruptcy and that there is very little judicial oversight of the Bahamian Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court has duly considered all of the objections interposed by Ms. Vidunas. These objections are not convincing to the Court for a number of reasons which are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    The Fact that the Bahamian Bankruptcy Law is Different than the United States Bankruptcy Code is not a\n    <em>\n     Per Se\n    </em>\n    Bar to Recognition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that bankruptcy in the United States is substantially different from bankruptcy relief in the Bahamas, it is this Court's opinion that the mere difference does not translate to a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that the foreign bankruptcy cannot be a \"foreign proceeding\" subject to recognition under Chapter 15. Nor does the fact that the foreign bankruptcy proceeding differs from a bankruptcy case under the Bankruptcy Code automatically translate to a conclusion that the foreign bankruptcy is not a proceeding that is \"collective in nature.\" The Court reaches these conclusions because nothing in the text of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23) requires that a \"foreign proceeding\" mirror a case under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The focus of the \"collective in nature\" component of a \"foreign proceeding\" is not the substantive terms of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Rather, the answer to this question turns on whether the legal proceeding before the foreign tribunal considers the rights and obligations of all creditors.\n   <em>\n    In re ABC Learning Ctrs.

In the course of rejecting this basis for challenging the abstention request, the bankruptcy court held that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   The fact that the Bahamian law does not contemplate or allow a reorganization process comparable to our Chapter 11 is no reason to deny abstention. In determining whether to defer to a Bahamian liquidation, the issue is not whether a reorganization is possible under Bahamian law.

A closer examination of her Participation Objections reveals that they are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Beginning with notice and an opportunity to participate, Ms. Vidunas claims that she was not provided with due process in the Bahamian Bankruptcy with respect to asserting her claims or otherwise participating at the meeting of creditors where the Bahamian Trustee was appointed. The undisputed record, however, reflects that Ms. Vidunas was afforded notice and an opportunity to participate, but intentionally chose not to file a claim or otherwise appear at the first meeting of creditors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In fact, Ms. Vidunas was repeatedly provided notice through her litigation counsel, and was invited over an approximate two year time period to file a claim in the Bahamian Bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exhibit B\n   </em>\n   to the\n   <em>\n    Response to Respondent Sabina Vidunas' Objection,\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13.

The record reflects that the notice was issued on May 13, 2016, and the meeting was scheduled for May 26, 2016.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525173\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/715/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525173\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/715/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The documents of record further reflect that Ms. Vidunas' litigation counsel received the notice of the meeting and, by May 17, 2016 at the latest, forwarded it to Ms. Vidunas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525173\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/715/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525173\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/715/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   These documents also reflect that while the notice of the first meeting of creditors was tight, creditors were nonetheless invited to participate at the first meeting of creditors by telephone or video conference thereby minimizing any prejudice occasioned by the short notice and/or geographical distance occasioned by the proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525173\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/715/\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6525173\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/161/715/\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Notwithstanding these facts, Ms. Vidunas chose to not participate remotely or otherwise seek an adjournment of the meeting. Instead, she sat idly by for a period of over two years and has done nothing to date in the Bahamian Bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   A liberal construction of Ms. Vidunas' objection to the Motion for Recognition is that Ms. Vidunas would like this Court to infer that Ms. Vidunas was somehow precluded from seeking an adjournment of the first meeting of creditors due to allegedly antiquated process employed by the Bahamian court. The Bahamian\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Act of 1870\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bahamian Bankruptcy\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Act\n   </em>\n   \" or \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Act\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, contemplates that meetings of creditors may be adjourned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 17 of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act (providing that the debtor may be examined at the first meeting of creditors \"and subject to such adjourned public examination as the court may direct\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Section 66 of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act (\"The Registrar may adjourn the first meeting of creditors from time to time and from place to place, subject to the directions of the court\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Section 64 of the Bankruptcy Act also states that \"[n]o proceedings in the bankruptcy shall be invalidated by any formal defect or by any irregularity unless the court before which an objection is made to such proceedings is of the opinion that substantial injustice has been caused by such defect or irregularity, and that such injustice cannot be remedied by any order of such court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Certainly these provisions of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act afforded Ms. Vidunas with ample opportunity to seek an adjournment of the first meeting of creditors and an opportunity to have meaningful opportunity to participate in the same. But again, she did not avail herself of these remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Ms. Vidunas also complains that she has been disenfranchised from the election of the Bahamian Trustee and/or \"committee of inspection.\" The Court is puzzled by this objection because Ms. Vidunas admittedly holds an unliquidated claim and has no basis to vote in either election. Indeed, Section 14(3) of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act states unequivocally that: \"a creditor shall not vote at the said meeting in respect of any unliquidated or contingent debt, or any debt the value of which is not ascertained[.]\" Parenthetically, this Court notes that this provision of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act is consistent with Section 702(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code, which provides that only creditors who hold unsecured claims that are allowable, undisputed, fixed, and liquidated may vote for a trustee in bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lastly, Ms. Vidunas also alleges that she does not have a remedy to challenge any act or inaction of the Bahamian Trustee that Ms. Vidunas may claim is improper. For example, by way of conjecture, she complains that she has no redress in instances where the Bahamian Trustee may refuse to allow or arbitrate her yet-to-be filed claim. She complains that she has no redress as to discovery of assets and liabilities of Mr. O'Reilly as only the Bahamian Trustee allegedly has discovery rights. Ms. Vidunas also contends that she has no appellate rights whatsoever.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   These allegations of lack of remedies to Ms. Vidunas are perplexing to the Court because the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act affords Ms. Vidunas with multiple avenues to challenge the procedures utilized in the Bahamian Bankruptcy. The Bahamian Bankruptcy Act also enables Ms. Vidunas with the ability to challenge the determinations made by the Bahamian Trustee or the Bahamian Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   By way of example, Section 12(1) of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act provides that a \"committee of inspection\" supervises the work of the Bahamian Trustee and that \"unless the court, for some just cause, orders otherwise,\" the trustee must follow the directions of the committee of inspection. The plain language of this statute\n   appears to afford Ms. Vidunas with the ability to petition the Bahamian court for relief if she disagrees with the instructions provided by the committee of inspection to the Bahamian Trustee or any response to the same made by the Bahamian Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Section 18 of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act further provides that the Bahamian Trustee is accountable to both the creditors generally and the court. As to the former (the creditors), the statute provides that the trustee is accountable in that a resolution of the creditors overrides any direction given to the Bahamian Trustee by the committee of inspection. Section 18 further affords a dissenting or aggrieved creditor redress with respect to trustee actions or inactions, and states that \"any creditor ... or other person aggrieved by any act of the trustee may apply to the court, and the court may confirm, reverse or modify the act complained of, and make such order in the premises as it thinks just.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Section 59 of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act provides the Bahamas Supreme Court (which is the trial court in the Bahamas) with the power \"of doing complete justice.\" The Court is not aware of anything in the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act which would preclude Ms. Vidunas from petitioning the court for relief, to the extent such request is appropriate and just under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   It is accurate in that Section 59 of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act also states that \"nor shall any appeal lie from its [the Supreme Court's] decisions, except in a manner directed by this Act.\" Presumably Ms. Vidunas relies on this provision to contend that she has no appellate rights. Her legal position is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In their papers, the parties have not briefed the impact of the\n   <em>\n    Court of Appeal Act\n   </em>\n   on bankruptcy cases in the Bahamas under the Bankruptcy Act. The Bahamian\n   <em>\n    Court of Appeal Act\n   </em>\n   was initially enacted in 1964 (and later amended multiple times), well after the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act was adopted. Section 10 of the\n   <em>\n    Court of Appeal Act\n   </em>\n   provides that appeals may be taken to the Court of Appeal from interlocutory and final orders in civil cases. Section 11 of the\n   <em>\n    Court of Appeal Rules\n   </em>\n   states that the notice of appeal as to interlocutory orders should be filed within fourteen days of an interlocutory order. As to final orders, the time period to file the notice of appeal is six weeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addressing the impact of the conflict between the appellate provisions of the\n   <em>\n    Court of Appeal Act\n   </em>\n   and Section 59 of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act, the Privy Council in\n   <em>\n    Stubbs v. Gonzalez\n   </em>\n   noted that the first level appellate court in the Bahamas-the Court of Appeal-did not come into existence until well after the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act was adopted.\n   <em>\n    Stubbs v.

The inference of the Privy Council is that with there being no Court of Appeal in 1870, this fact explains the \"no appeal\" provisions of Section 59 of the Bahamian Bankruptcy Act.

In determining whether a particular foreign action is collective ... it is appropriate to consider both the law governing the foreign action and the parameters of the particular proceeding as defined in, for example, orders of a foreign tribunal overseeing the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   \"A collective proceeding is designed to provide equitable treatment to creditors, by treating similarly situated creditors in the same way, and to maximize the value of the debtor's assets for the benefit of all creditors....\" Indeed, among Chapter 15's objectives is the \"fair and efficient administration of cross-border insolvencies that protects the interests of all creditors.\" Further, UNCITRAL's Guide to Enactment \"suggests that a foreign proceeding must contemplate the 'involvement of creditors collectively.' \" However, to be for the general benefit of creditors, a proceeding need not ensure that all creditors receive a share of the distribution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Other characteristics of a collective proceeding include: adequate notice to creditors under applicable foreign law, provisions for the distribution of assets according to statutory priorities, and a statutory mechanism for creditors to seek court review of the proceeding.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   However, the standard for notice is not a demanding one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    In re Ashapura Minechem Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4155289\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/480/129/#p140\">\n    480 B.R. at 136-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As to the notice issues and ability of creditors to seek redress, this aspect of \"collectivity\" has been discussed in Part II(B) of this Memorandum Opinion.

Upon closer inspection of the facts of\n   <em>\n    Treco\n   </em>\n   , it appears that the statute which caused the court concern in that case does not apply in the instant matter. That is, the Bahamian proceeding in\n   <em>\n    Treco\n   </em>\n   was a proceeding under the\n   <em>\n    Bahamian Companies Act of 1992.\n   </em>\n   Mr. O'Reilly's bankruptcy liquidation is a case under the Bahamas\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Act of 1870,\n   </em>\n   and this statute does not have the provision that was criticized in\n   <em>\n    Treco\n   </em>\n   . For this reason,\n   <em>\n    Treco\n   </em>\n   has no application herein and does not affect this Court's conclusion that the Bahamian Bankruptcy is \"collective\" in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Insufficient Pleading and/or Proof that the Foreign Proceeding is a \"Main\" and \"Nonmain\" Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Section 1517(a) of the United States Bankruptcy Code sets forth what a petitioner must show before an order for recognition can be entered. Specifically, this statute states, in pertinent part, that an order recognizing a foreign proceeding shall be entered if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (1) such foreign proceeding for which recognition is sought is a foreign main proceeding or foreign nonmain proceeding within the meaning of section 1502;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (2) the foreign representative applying for recognition is a person or body; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (3) the petition meets the requirements of section 1515 [which sets forth what must accompany a petition for recognition].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201517\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1517\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   It is uncontested that the latter two of the three requirements are present. What is disputed is whether the Bahamian Bankruptcy is a foreign \"main\" proceeding or a foreign \"nonmain\" proceeding. If the foreign proceeding is neither a \"main\" or \"nonmain\" proceeding, then recognition cannot be provided. If the proceeding is either a \"main\" or \"nonmain\" proceeding, such a determination can affect whether automatic relief may be entered by this Court without further litigation by the Bahamian Trustee. As set forth above, the classification of a matter as a \"main\" proceeding triggers relief that is automatic. Classification of a matter as a \"nonmain\" proceeding does not translate to automatic relief. Rather, such relief is discretionary upon proper application and cause shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Time Period to Determine Whether the Proceeding is \"Main\" or \"Nonmain\" is the Date the Chapter 15 Petition is Filed\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Hesoid was a Greek poet, philosopher, and economist.

One such reason is that utilizing the Chapter 15 petition date creates a criteria that is both objective and ascertainable by third parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Fairfield Sentry, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5868908,4175933\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/714/127/\">\n    714 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   136-37 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Ran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3683401,3818206\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/1017/\">\n    607 F.3d at 1025-26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   This Court would add another prudential reason for the presumption that the Chapter 15 petition date is the moment in time where the debtor's eligibility for recognition is determined for purposes of Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code. That prudential reason is encouragement of swift prosecution and/or resolution of cross-border insolvency cases. This Court makes this prudential point because circumstances involving a debtor (whether in a reorganization case or liquidation case) change. Having a presumption that utilizes the Chapter 15 petition date as the focal point for determining whether recognition should be granted encourages litigants to act sooner, as opposed to later. Prompt action thereby avoids the \"Never Never Land\" problem which can be occasioned by the shifting sands of where a debtor's domicile, principal place of business, and/or assets and liabilities are primarily located in the ensuing years subsequent to the commencement of a foreign insolvency proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   For all of these reasons, this Court finds the opinions of the Second Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Fairfield Sentry\n   </em>\n   and Fifth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Ran\n   </em>\n   to be convincing and concludes that the presumptive date from which the Court is to ascertain the debtor's center of main interests and/or establishment is the date the Chapter 15 petition was filed with this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Foreign Main-COMI Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The fairly recent case of\n   <em>\n    In re Pirogova\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12512339\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/593/402/\">\n    593 B.R. 402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.
