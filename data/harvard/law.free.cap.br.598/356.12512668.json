Ross as the trustee of Carvalho's estate (the \"Removal Request\"), and sought leave to sue Ross (the \"Leave to Sue Request\").\n  <em>\n   See generally\n  </em>\n  Unified Motion to Dismiss Bankruptcy Case for Bad Faith[,] Motion to Remove Estate Trustee[,] Motion for Leave to Sue the Estate Trustee (\"Unified Motion\"),\n  <em>\n   In re Carvalho\n  </em>\n  , Ch. 7 Case No. 15-646 (Bankr.

Finally, the Court concludes that Ross did not make false representations in his filings to the Court and therefore the imposition of sanctions is not justified. Accordingly, the Court grants in part and denies in part Ross's motion to dismiss this appeal, orders Ross to file his brief in reply to Simu's Appeal Brief addressing whether the Bankruptcy Court erred in denying Simu's Leave to Sue Request, and denies Simu's motion for sanctions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this 27th day of March, 2019.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Mootness in bankruptcy appeals arises in two forms: constitutional mootness and equitable mootness.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re AOV\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6123896,3608249,1583327\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/792/1140/\">\n     792 F.2d at 1147\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
