(\"\n   <strong>\n    TMV Condo\n   </strong>\n   \"), another Texas limited partnership. John Chong is the managing member of TMV GP, LLC, the general partner of both entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Debtor owns contiguous parcels of real estate: 1146 W. Trinity Mills Road, Carrollton, Texas (\"\n   <strong>\n    TM Village\n   </strong>\n   \") and 1220 W. Trinity Mills Road, Carrollton, Texas (\"\n   <strong>\n    TM Place\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   TM Village is raw land on which the Debtor planned to construct an apartment building.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   TM Place is the site of a single building divided into commercial office suites (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Office Suites\n   </strong>\n   \") and residential condominiums (the \"\n   <strong>\n    Condominiums\n   </strong>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, as relevant here:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Construction of the TM Place Office Suites and Condominiums\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The record reflects that the Debtor's record keeping was disorganized: indeed, Mr. Chong often was unaware the specific entity that owned a given asset. According to Ms. Benham,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   although the Debtor purchased both parcels of real estate, Mr. Chong intended that (1) TMV Condo own the TM Place land (where the Office Suites and Condominiums were built), and (2) the Debtor own the TM Village land (where the apartment building was to be built). However, the Debtor never transferred the TM Place land to TMV Condo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Chong and his entities, oblivious to the Debtor's failure to transfer the land, constructed the building assuming that TMV Condo owned the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result, TMV Condo, and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   the Debtor, entered into the Contracts\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   that are the subject of the motion. Mr. Chong was not the only inattentive player: Ms. Benham, whom Chong had tasked with administering the various projects, also did not realize the mistake until nearly all the Contracts had been signed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chong had planned to correct the mistake at the closing of each Condominium sale, by having TMV Condo assign each Contract to the Debtor and then having the Debtor proceed to closing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   He instead opted to make the assignment sooner given the prospect of the Debtor's bankruptcy filing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus,\n   on August 3, 2018, TMV Condo and the Debtor executed an Assignment of Contract of Sale,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   assigning the forty-three Contracts to the Debtor. The Debtor filed chapter 11 on August 22, 2018, before it and the Condo Owners could close on the respective Condominium sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Assumption of the forty-three Contracts would yield approximately $ 550,000 in sale proceeds for the Debtor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   After deducting unpaid real estate taxes, broker commissions, title insurance and other closing costs, the senior lienholders would receive about $ 183,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Legal Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The objections to the Motion to Assume are that:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) TMV Condo is the party to the Contracts and no evidence supports a finding that the Contracts were validly assigned to the Debtor;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) creditors cannot make an informed decision on the Motion to Assume without copies of the Contracts or evidence of TMV Condo's use of the sale proceeds;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) the Motion to Assume impermissibly seeks to assume forty-three Contracts without complying with Bankruptcy Rule 6006(f)'s omnibus procedures;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) the Contracts are not executory and so cannot be rejected because the Debtor has no remaining material obligations; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (5) assumption of the Contracts is not an exercise of sound business judgment because the Debtor could reject the Contracts and resell the Condominiums at higher prices.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   These objections are addressed in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. TMV Condo Assigned the Contracts to the Debtor Through the August 3, 2018 Assignment of Contract of Sale.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Assignment of Contract of Sale entered into evidence at the hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   plainly shows that TMV Condo assigned the forty-three Contracts to the Debtor effective August 3, 2018. Although several objectors complained that the Debtor received nothing in exchange for assuming the Contracts (arguably making the assignment a fraud on its creditors), the evidence established that TMV Condo used nearly $ 7.75 million it received as the Condo Owners' prepaid purchase price to build the Office Suites and Condominiums on the Debtor's land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The objectors also argue that the entry into the assignment shortly before the bankruptcy filing is a fraudulent conveyance; however, no party in interest has filed a complaint asserting a chapter 5 cause of action. Too, absent the assignment\n   the Debtor would have paid nothing for the building that now sits on its land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, this objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Record Contains Sufficient Information to Support an Informed Decision on the Motion to Assume.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Contracts were admitted into evidence at the hearing without objection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Together with them, the record comprises sufficient evidence concerning the circumstances surrounding formation of the Contracts and construction of the Office Suites and Condominiums to permit the court to make a fully informed decision regarding the Motion to Assume. Thus, this objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to Comply Strictly with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6006(f) is Not Prejudicial to the Debtor's Motion.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The objectors argue that the Motion to Assume must be denied as procedurally improper because it fails to meet the requirements for omnibus objections set forth in Fed. R. Bankr. P. 6006(f). Under Rule 6006(f) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (f) Omnibus Motions. A motion to reject or, if permitted under subdivision (e), a motion to assume or assign multiple executory contracts or unexpired leases that are not between the same parties shall:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (1) state in a conspicuous place that parties receiving the omnibus motion should locate their names and their contracts or leases listed in the motion;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (2) list parties alphabetically and identify the corresponding contract or lease;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (3) specify the terms, including the curing of defaults, for each requested assumption or assignment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (4) specify the terms, including the identity of each assignee and the adequate assurance of future performance by each assignee, for each requested assignment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (5) be numbered consecutively with other omnibus motions to assume, assign, or reject executory contracts or unexpired leases; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (6) be limited to no more than 100 executory contracts or unexpired leases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The rule was amended in December 2007 to \"ensure that the nondebtor parties to the contracts and leases receive effective notice of the motion.\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 6006 (2007 Advisory Committee Notes).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Nothing in the record suggests that the Debtor's less than scrupulous compliance disserved the objectives of the amended rule. First, the motion involves one type of executory contract, all identified on Exhibit A by unit number and a purchaser's name. Second, the motion is straightforward: it is only five pages long (six pages with Exhibit A) and does not seek a ruling on a myriad of complex agreements contained in an extensive and convoluted motion. On these facts it is doubtful that a Condo Owner was unable to locate its Contract on the exhibit or an objecting party was confused about the objective of the motion. Finally, no party has claimed any confusion regarding the relief the Debtor sought or the Contracts to which the motion referred. Indeed, none of the Condo Owners, the proposed purchasers of forty-two\n   of the forty-three Condominiums, object to assumption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On this record, strict compliance with Rule 6006(f) is not required and this objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Contracts Are Executory and May be Assumed or Rejected.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 365(a) permits the Debtor, subject to court approval, to assume or reject executory contracts or unexpired leases to which it is a party.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Bankruptcy Code does not define the term\n   <em>\n    executory\n   </em>\n   but the Fifth Circuit holds that a contract is executory if \"performance remains due to some extent on both sides\" and if \"at the time of the bankruptcy filing, the failure of either party to complete performance would constitute a material breach of the contract, thereby excusing the performance of the other party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issues are whether the Debtor and each Condo Owner owed additional performance under the Contracts on the petition date; and whether one party's failure to perform would constitute a material breach, excusing the counterparty's performance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although the Contracts each include unique terms, such as unit number, purchaser name and purchase price, they are largely identical and may be analyzed as a group. The main substantive difference between the Contracts is that some Condo Owners fully prepaid for their Condominiums prepetition, while others did not. Because none of the purchases had closed prepetition, the analysis of treatment of the prepaid and the non-prepaid Contracts differs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contracts Where the Purchase Price was Not Fully Prepaid as of the Petition Date are Executory Contracts that May be Assumed or Rejected.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Contracts where the proposed purchaser had not fully prepaid the purchase price are clearly executory because there are material obligations yet to be performed by each party-namely, the purchaser must pay the remainder of the purchase price, as well as other closing costs allocated to it in the Contract, and the Debtor must deliver title and perform its other closing-related obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   SKR attempts to avoid this ruling by arguing in its brief that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Out of the 43 Contracts, twenty-five (25) [Condo Owners] do not owe any additional sums, one (1) Investor [Condo Owner] owes $ 50.00, one (1) Investor owes $ 733.65, ten (10) Investors owe less than $ 20,000, one (1) Investor owes $ 23,000, one (1) Investor owes $ 46,000, one (1) owes $ 70,000 and one (1) another owes $ 130,000.... Thus, other than a select few, there is nothing for the Investors to do and there is nothing for the Debtor to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   SKR's Post-Hearing Brief [ECF No. 118] \u00b6 15. The fact that varying amounts are\n   owed does not change the analysis: a contract remains executory if performance remains due to some extent on both sides and if, at the time of the bankruptcy filing, the failure of either party to complete performance would constitute a material breach of the contract, thereby excusing the performance of the other party. Remaining obligations include the Condo Owner's duty to pay the full purchase price; the Debtor's obligation to deliver a general warranty deed conveying title to the property to the Condo Owner; and for both parties to proceed to closing and pay their respective closing costs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   These unperformed obligations render the Contracts executory when the Condo Owners had not prepaid them in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Contracts Where the Purchase Price was Fully Prepaid as of the Petition Date are Executory Contracts that May be Assumed or Rejected.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The analysis is not as straightforward for Contracts where the Condo Owner had paid in full for the Condominium before the bankruptcy commenced. Although the Debtor's obligation to execute and deliver a general warranty deed conveying title to the property is plainly material, whether the Condo Owners who prepaid the purchase price have any unperformed material obligations - thus, rendering the contracts executory, considering the Debtor's unperformed obligation - is disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The objecting parties have two principal objections. First, they allege that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is inapplicable because the Contracts are between two non-debtor parties, the Condo Owners and TMV Condo. But for the reasons set forth above, the Assignment of Contract of Sale operated to assign the Contracts from TMV Condo to the Debtor effective August 3, 2018. Thus, this objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, the objectors argue that because the buyers paid the purchase price in full prepetition, they have no remaining material obligations and so the Contracts cannot be executory. In support of this argument, SKR relies on several opinions for the unremarkable proposition that \"[i]f the payment of money is the only remaining obligation, such a contract is not executory.\" SKR's Post-Hearing Brief [ECF No. 118 ] \u00a7 16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A review of the Contracts shows that, even if the purchase price for a Condominium has been prepaid, the buyer must still:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \u2022 Pay for the title policy that will be obtained by the Debtor from Reliant Title.

In light of those findings, the court held that the purchasers were not \"in possession\" as required by \u00a7 365(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Balco\n   </em>\n   , another opinion on which\n   <em>\n    Chicago Hudson\n   </em>\n   rested, also involved a contract to purchase raw land. There the purchaser argued it should be considered \"in possession\" because it maintained insurance on the property and also had the right, among other things, to enter the property and often did so for surveys, tests, inspections and studies. The court relied on\n   <em>\n    Summit Land\n   </em>\n   to hold that the purchaser was not \"in possession,\" given the absence of evidence of the purchaser's actions of physical possession, including improvements on the land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Here, the evidence established that Mr. Chong on the Debtor's behalf consented to the Condo Owners' occupying the Condominiums once the City of Garland issued the Certificate of Occupancy on March 1, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon taking possession, every Condo Owner was given a unique security code to access to its Condominium (along with instructions on changing the code); and utility service for the Condominium was transferred to the Condo Owner, who then became liable for payment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plainly, this case does not involve a purchaser with only intermittent or shared access to a property or a trespasser occupying a premises either secretly or in defiance of the landlord's wishes.

In the case of assumption, both parties would be required to perform under the Contracts and proceed to closing. The Debtor would receive approximately $ 550,000 in sale proceeds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   After paying closing costs, taxes and similar expenses, the senior lienholders would receive approximately $ 183,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In contrast, rejection of the Contracts would entitle each Condo Owner in possession to exercise its rights under \u00a7 365(i), including remaining in its unit and paying any outstanding purchase price. The Debtor would be obligated to deliver title to the purchaser in accordance with the Contract and would be relieved from all other obligations to perform in accordance with \u00a7 365(i)(2)(B). A comparison of the two outcomes shows little material difference to the estate between assumption and rejection of the Contracts involving Condo Owners in possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Neither the Estate Nor its Creditors Would Materially Benefit from a Rejection of the Contracts for Condominiums Not Currently Occupied by Condo Owners.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   A Condo Owner not in possession of a unit (or one in possession who chooses to treat its Contract as rejected) still would be entitled to the protections of \u00a7 365(j). That subsection gives the Condo Owner \"a lien on the interest of the debtor in such property for the recovery of any portion of the purchase price that such purchaser or party has paid.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts construing this provision hold that because the lien granted under \u00a7 365(j) attaches to \"the interest of the debtor in such property,\" the lien is subordinate to pre-existing secured creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Condo Owners not in possession also would be entitled to claims for rejection damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Tamamoi and SKR prefer that the Debtor reject the Contracts and the subject Condominiums be resold and the proceeds used to pay them as senior lienholders. In that event, each Condo Owner not in possession under \u00a7 365(j) would receive a lien subordinated to Tamamoi and SKR's mortgages. The objectors claim this would benefit the estate because the Condominiums have appreciated \"maybe ten, fifteen percent,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   in Mr. Chong's opinion. But Tamamoi and SKR's arguments assume that the Condominiums could not only be resold for a higher price, but that real estate taxes, broker fees, closing costs, attorneys' fees and similar expenses (including litigation the Condo Owners likely would initiate) would not consume the assumed increase in value. Nothing in the record, however, supports this argument. Instead, the record reflects that the Debtor had to choose between assuming or rejecting the Contracts and reasonably believed that each choice resulted in a similar outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The business judgment standard is highly deferential to the decisions of a debtor in possession, and the record is far from clear that rejection actually would result in an overall benefit to the estate. The possibility that an alternative course of action may result in higher sale proceeds alone will not support a finding that the Debtor's decision to assume was made in bad faith or a gross abuse of its business discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, assumption of the Contracts is an exercise of the Debtor's sound business judgment and the Motion to Assume should be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this Memorandum Opinion addressees only the Motion to Assume, a separate Memorandum Opinion will set forth the basis for the court's ruling on the Debtor's request to sell the forty-three Condominiums to the Condo Owners free and clear of liens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Debtor's counsel is directed to prepare a form of order, circulate it to opposing counsel for review, and upload it within 14 days of entry of this Memorandum Opinion.
