Duncan, Chief US Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This matter is before the Court on motions for summary judgment filed by the plaintiff, Michelle L. Vieira, and the defendant, Anthony Whitfield. Both motions were filed on December 18, 2018. Both parties filed objections to the opposing party's motion on January 2, 2019. A hearing was held on the motions on February 5, 2019. For the reasons set forth below, the Court now grants the plaintiff's motion and denies the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     UNDISPUTED FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   1. At the time of his chapter 7 bankruptcy filing, Michael T. Shiver, the debtor, was the owner of real property located at 727 Bradburn Drive, Mount Pleasant, SC (the \"Property\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Property is\n   property of the bankruptcy estate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   2. Permacoat of Charleston, SC (\"Permacoat\") filed a state court action to foreclose a mechanic's lien against the defendant in November 2006 in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   3. The defendant counterclaimed against Permacoat in the state court litigation, and obtained a judgment against Permacoat in June 2014 (the \"2014 Judgment\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   4. In late 2014, the defendant commenced supplemental proceedings against Permacoat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   5. On August 11, 2017, the defendant filed a lis pendens against the Property (the \"Lis Pendens\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   6. On August 24, 2017, the Master in Equity for Charleston County issued a Decree of Foreclosure and Order of Sale, ordering that the Property be sold to satisfy the judgment lien obtained by the defendant against Permacoat in June 2014 (the \"Foreclosure Decree\"). The Foreclosure Decree stated, \"Plaintiff Permacoat of Charleston S.C. is an unincorporated association, to which Michael T. Shiver and James Russell Shiver are owners and co-partners (per their own admittance) and therefore are personally liable for the June 25, 2014 $ 127,866.54 judgment in favor of Anthony M. Whitfield pursuant to S.C. Code \u00a7 15-35-170.\" The Foreclosure Decree further stated, \"Anthony M. Whitfield's judgment in the original amount of $ 127,866.54 constitutes a fifth (5th) lien on the subject real property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   7. Although the Foreclosure Decree stated that the debtor is personally liable for the 2014 Judgment, no judgment was recorded and indexed against the debtor personally prior to the filing of the bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   8. The debtor filed his chapter 7 bankruptcy case on October 26, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   9. The plaintiff commenced this adversary proceeding on March 30, 2018. The plaintiff's initial complaint asserted causes of action for avoidance of the Foreclosure Decree pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and preservation of the avoided transfer pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   10. The defendant filed an answer and counterclaims to the initial complaint on April 30, 2018. The defendant's counterclaims requested a declaratory judgment regarding the extent, validity and priority of his lien. The plaintiff filed a reply to the counterclaim on May 7, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   11. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on May 10, 2018. The amended complaint asserted causes of action for avoidance of the Foreclosure Decree under \u00a7 547, avoidance of the Foreclosure Decree and the 2014 Judgment pursuant to \u00a7 544(a), and preservation of the avoided transfer pursuant to \u00a7 551.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   12. The defendant filed an answer and counterclaims to the amended complaint on May 22, 2018, again requesting a declaratory judgment regarding his lien, and the plaintiff filed a reply to the counterclaims on May 23, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   13. After obtaining leave from the Court, the plaintiff filed a second amended complaint on September 17, 2018. The second amended complaint asserted causes of action for avoidance of the Lis Pendens\n   and the Foreclosure Decree pursuant to \u00a7 547, avoidance of the 2014 Judgment and the Foreclosure Decree pursuant to \u00a7 544(a), and preservation of the avoided transfers pursuant to \u00a7 551.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   14. The defendant filed an answer and counterclaims to the second amended complaint on October 3, 2018. Again, the defendant's counterclaims sought a declaratory judgment regarding his lien. Due to the previous withdrawal of his counsel, the answer and counterclaims were filed pro se. The defendant again obtained counsel on October 8, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   15. The plaintiff filed a reply to the counterclaims on October 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The plaintiff argues that she is entitled to avoid the Lis Pendens because it constitutes a preferential transfer under \u00a7 547. The plaintiff argues that under South Carolina law, the Lis Pendens placed a cloud on the title to the Property, preventing the debtor from freely conveying the Property to a subsequent purchaser. At the hearing on the motions, the plaintiff compared the filing of a lis pendens to the recording of a mortgage and asserted that the effect of both actions was the same. The plaintiff argues that the Foreclosure Decree is also a preferential transfer. Finally, the plaintiff argues that the 2014 Judgment can be avoided under \u00a7 544 because it was never recorded in the name of the debtor. Therefore, it never became a lien on the Property under South Carolina law and the plaintiff did not have notice of the 2014 Judgment. The plaintiff asserts that the Lis Pendens does not provide notice that defeats her status as a bona fide purchaser because she can avoid it as a preference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant argues that the Lis Pendens is not a preferential transfer avoidable by the plaintiff because it does not constitute a transfer of an interest in property. The defendant argues that under South Carolina law a lis pendens merely provides notice of pending litigation. At the hearing, the defendant argued that a lis pendens does not actually affect a debtor's ability to convey title, it merely affects third party purchasers' rights in the property. The defendant also asserted at the hearing that there is a difference between an actual transfer and the perfection of a transfer under \u00a7 547(e). The defendant asserted that here, the Lis Pendens constituted perfection but not a transfer that can be avoided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The defendant also argues that the Foreclosure Decree does not constitute a transfer because it merely recognized that the defendant already possessed an enforceable judgment against the debtor. Finally, the defendant argues that the plaintiff cannot avoid the 2014 Judgment under \u00a7 544 because the Lis Pendens provided notice of the 2014 Judgment, defeating the plaintiff's status as a bona fide purchaser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate when the \"depositions, documents, electronically stored information, affidavits or declarations, stipulations (including those made for purposes of the motion only), admissions, interrogatory answers, or other materials ... show [ ] that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The chapter 13 trustee filed counterclaims, one of which was to avoid the lis pendens as a preferential transfer pursuant to \u00a7 547(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The court concluded that the lis pendens was avoidable under \u00a7 547(b)\"under several theories.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344158\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/88/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344158\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/88/\">\n    at 94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . First, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [U]nder the theory that property rights are similar to a bundle of sticks, the\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   is a preferential transfer of the debtor's interest in property to the extent that it perfected or created any additional rights to the Property. The recording of the\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   affects possession and interests in the Property, in that it prevents subsequent purchasers from acquiring superior rights in the Property. Thus, upon recording the\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   , [the creditor] had a superior interest over any prospective purchaser because the [sic] it had obtained \"some of the sticks in the bundle.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344158\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/88/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344158\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/539/88/\">\n    at 94-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, the court considered \u00a7 547(e), which provides that a transfer is perfected \"when a bona fide purchaser of such property from the debtor against whom applicable law permits such transfer to be perfected cannot acquire an interest that is superior to the interest of the transferee.\" The court stated that because the creditor obtained an interest in the property superior to that of a bona fide purchaser when it filed the lis pendens, the lis pendens constituted a transfer under \u00a7 547.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the court pointed out that if the creditor was successful in its reformation action, the lien would relate back to the time of filing of the lis pendens. As a result, the lien would be obtained within 90 days of the petition date and therefore avoidable as a preferential transfer. The court therefore ruled in the trustee's favor, finding that the lis pendens could be avoided as a preferential transfer under \u00a7 547.

The court, however, ultimately found that the filing of the lis pendens did not constitute a transfer of property of the debtor because the interest at issue was not property of the estate unless brought into the estate by \u00a7 544(a)(3). Further, the transfer was not on account of an antecedent debt.\n   <em>\n    Gurs\n   </em>\n   did\n   not squarely decide the issue presently before this Court and therefore is distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Indeed, in a later case, the Ninth Circuit found that the recording of a lis pendens does constitute a transfer.\n   <em>\n    Hurst Concrete Prods., Inc. v.

In that case, after the filing of a lis pendens and the entry of a judgment in the state court action, the debtors filed a chapter 11 case.

The bankruptcy court found that the claim of the state court plaintiff was secured because the recording of the judgment related back to the filing of the lis pendens; however, the Bankruptcy Appellate Panel reversed. The Ninth Circuit reversed and found that the filing of a lis pendens is a transfer under the Bankruptcy Code and that the recording of the judgment did relate back to the filing of the lis pendens. As discussed above, the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Ute Mesa\n   </em>\n   found that the Ninth Circuit did not reach the question of whether a lis pendens constitutes a transfer.
