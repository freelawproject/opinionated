In that case, the district court determined that the bankruptcy court properly decided that it lacked jurisdiction over a creditor's attorney's motion for a charging lien against a settlement recovered for his client in a bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re W. 57th St. Concrete Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20706931\">\n    1996 WL 706931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2. There, the appellant-attorney represented a creditor in a bankruptcy proceeding that was settled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. After the settlement was approved, appellant moved to seek enforcement of a charging lien against the settlement proceeds obtained by his client.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The bankruptcy court determined that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the motion, and the district court affirmed, finding that \"[t]he Bankruptcy Court was correct in deciding it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear Appellant's claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1-2. The district court reasoned that there was no \"related to\" jurisdiction because the matter was solely a dispute between the creditor of the debtor and a third party, it would not affect the other creditors, and, most notably, would have no effect on the debtor.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

Similar to the fee dispute in\n   <em>\n    In re W. 57th St. Concrete Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the instant case is solely a dispute between a creditor of the debtor and a third party that will not affect the debtor or the debtor's estate. Specifically, because the relevant bankruptcy case has been settled and confirmed and because ASI has already received the proceeds it was owed under the Consensual Joint Plan, the charging lien requested here, if valid, cannot have a conceivable effect on the debtor's estate, the debtor, or the debtor's other creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lemco Gypsum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121634,10538709\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/784/\">\n    910 F.2d at 788\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, it would follow that this Court, like the bankruptcy court in\n   <em>\n    In re W. 57th St. Concrete Corp.\n   </em>\n   , does not have \"related to\" jurisdiction over the instant case. However, the Court recognizes that some bankruptcy courts have found that bankruptcy jurisdiction exists when a creditor's attorney seeks to enforce a charging lien against his client for unpaid legal fees from a bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Court finds\n   <em>\n    In re W. 57th St. Concrete Corp.\n   </em>\n   to be more persuasive than these bankruptcy court cases, it also finds that additional considerations justify remand in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   First, the fact that this dispute arises in the post-confirmation context, where courts have found section 1334(b) jurisdiction to be more limited, weighs in favor of remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Pegasus Gold Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9042622,9171959\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/394/1189/\">\n    394 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1194 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Resorts Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9199658,9230675\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/154/\">\n    372 F.3d at 164-65, 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it is unnecessary to apply the more restrictive \"close nexus\" test adopted in other circuits, because the Court finds that there is no \"related to\" jurisdiction under the\n   <em>\n    Pacor\n   </em>\n   test\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   , the Court agrees that jurisdiction should be more limited in the post-confirmation context. Accordingly, the fact that the instant action arises in the post-confirmation context, after the GA Bankruptcy Proceeding was settled and the Consensual Joint Plan was confirmed, is an additional factor that weighs in favor of remand. Additionally, the instant action is concerned with the recovery of unpaid legal fees from the State Abreu Lawsuit\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the GA Bankruptcy Proceeding. Thus, the relationship between the instant action and the GA Bankruptcy Proceeding seems to be even more attenuated than the relationship between the charging lien and the bankruptcy proceeding in\n   <em>\n    In re W. 57th St. Concrete Corp.\n   </em>\n   , because this case is not merely concerned with unpaid legal fees from the bankruptcy proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, because this case has been removed, Defendants have the burden of establishing the existence of jurisdiction under section 1334(b), and uncertainties must be resolved in favor of remand.\n   <em>\n    Burns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531716\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/31/1092/#p1095\">\n    31 F.3d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that Defendants have failed to meet their burden to establish federal jurisdiction under section 1334(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court does not find Defendants' remaining arguments persuasive. Defendants first argue that the Bankruptcy Court has jurisdiction to hear the instant action\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   because, under Florida law, KAG was required to bring the charging lien in the court that presided over the action \"that produced the funds over which [KAG] asserts a charging lien\" (i.e., the Bankruptcy Court). ECF No. 19 at 6. Florida courts have noted that the preferred method for enforcing a charging lien is in a summary proceeding in the original action.\n   <em>\n    Daniel Mones, P.A. v.

However, such a preference, established under state law, is not sufficient, in and of itself, to confer subject matter jurisdiction in federal court. Furthermore, the propriety of the requested charging lien is of no moment to this Court's jurisdictional analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Next, Defendants argue there is jurisdiction because the instant action is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(K).\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em https:=\"\" index=\"54\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Although under\n   section 157(b)(2)(K), an action that involves \"determinations of the validity, extent, or priority of liens\" constitutes a core proceeding, the Court disagrees with Defendants' argument that the charging lien requested here falls under the category of liens referenced in section 157(b)(2)(K). As discussed above, for there to be jurisdiction under section 1334(b) the action must be, at a minimum, \"related to\" the bankruptcy proceeding,\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    In re Toledo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11592391,11636655\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/170/1340/\">\n    170 F.3d at 1345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and an action cannot be \"related to\" a bankruptcy proceeding if it will not have any conceivable effect on the debtor's estate.\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Lemco Gypsum\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121634,10538709\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/910/784/\">\n    910 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   788 ;\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    Celotex Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1340034\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/514/300/\">\n    514 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   308 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6119138,1340034\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/1493/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting \"that bankruptcy courts have no jurisdiction over proceedings that have no effect on the estate of the debtor.\").

ECF No. 19 at *2-3. Again, the Court disagrees. Retention of jurisdiction provisions can assist bankruptcy courts in retaining jurisdiction over certain matters post-confirmation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alderwoods Grp., Inc. v.

Therefore, to the extent Defendants are attempting to argue that the retention of jurisdiction provisions in the Consensual Joint Plan operate as an independent basis for jurisdiction, their argument is without merit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re W. 57th St. Concrete Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%20706931\">\n    1996 WL 706931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-2 (concluding that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to hear a creditor's attorney's motion for a charging lien even when there were retention of jurisdiction provisions in the bankruptcy court's order of settlement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This is not to say that section 1334 jurisdiction would be lacking in every case in which a creditor's attorney seeks a charging lien over his client's funds that were received as proceeds in a bankruptcy proceeding.
