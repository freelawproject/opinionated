ECF No. 1. After entering judgment in favor of the Debtor in its adversary proceeding for breach of contract against a purchaser under a real estate contract with respect to property owned by the Debtor (Adversary Proceeding No. 15-01348 (\"Adv. Pro.\"), Dkt. No. 38), the Court confirmed the Debtor's Plan of Reorganization. ECF No. 128. One week later, as contemplated by the Plan, the Lender filed a Motion to Allow Payment of Default Interest and Legal Fees, pursuant to Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Motion\") [ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   No. 130].\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In opposition to the Motion, the Debtor filed a Memorandum of Law (the \"Debtor's Memo\") [ECF No. 142] and the manager of the Debtor filed a declaration attaching exhibits (the \"Ambalu Decl.\") [ECF No. 141]. In response, the Lender filed a Reply Memorandum of Law (the \"Lender's Reply\") [ECF No. 143] and counsel to the Lender filed a declaration [ECF No. 144].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court subsequently entered an Order Authorizing Depositions and Directing Production of Documents [ECF No. 149], allowing the Debtor to obtain discovery from those representatives of the Lender who had submitted declarations in support of the Motion on the limited issue of whether the Debtor's bankruptcy filing had adverse consequences for the Lender and participating banks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 147. Thereafter, the Debtor filed a Supplemental Memorandum of Law (\"Debtor's Supp. Memo\") [ECF No. 155] addressing the evidence adduced during the limited discovery. In response, the Lender filed a further Reply Memorandum of Law (\"Lender's Supp. Reply\") [ECF No. 160].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following oral argument on the Lender's Motion (the \"Hearing\"), the Court issued an order (a) ruling that the Lender is entitled to payment of legal fees and expenses pursuant to the Loan Documents in an amount to be determined and ordering Lender's counsel to submit an amended application that better detailed the reasonableness of the requested fees and (b) reserving decision on the default interest issue. ECF No. 162. After considering the merits of each party's argument, the Court concludes that the Lender is entitled to payment of default interest. The portion of the Lender's Motion previously taken under submission is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    The Pre-Petition Loan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 30, 2014, the Debtor and Lender executed the Loan Documents, including the Mortgage Agreement [ECF No. 130, Exh.

ECF No. 1. Thereafter, the Debtor continued in possession of the Property and the management of its business as a debtor-in-possession under Section 1107 of the Bankruptcy Code. Pursuant to Section 13(o) of the Mortgage, the Debtor's voluntary petition constituted an event of default. At no point did the Lender issue a written notice of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   After this case was filed, the Debtor and the Lender negotiated a stipulation with respect to the use of cash collateral, which was subsequently approved by the Court and entered as an Order (A) Authorizing Debtor's Use of Cash Collateral, (B) Providing Adequate Protection, (C) Scheduling Final Hearing, and (D) Granting Related Relief (the \"Cash Collateral Stipulation\") [ECF No. 17]. Pursuant to the So-Ordered Stipulation, the Debtor agreed to,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , pay Lender's reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses as provided for in the Loan Documents,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, and to remit monthly mortgage payments to the Lender at the non-default rate of interest, while preserving the Lender's right to seek payment of default interest later.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. The parties stipulated that the Debtor was current with the payments due under the Note as of the Petition Date, and that the Debtor intended to remain current with payments due under the Note following the Petition Date.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Additionally, the So-Ordered Stipulation specifically stated that it did \"not constitute a waiver of, expressly or implicitly ... the allowance and payment pursuant to Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 506(b) of default interest on [Lender's] Claim\" and that \"[t]he Debtor reserves the right to object to the payment of default interest....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    The Adversary Proceeding Against Defaulted Purchaser\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Prior to the Petition Date, the Debtor had entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the \"Sale Agreement\") with Myrtle Property Holdings LLC (\"MPH\"), under which the Debtor agreed to sell the Property to MPH for $ 20.5 million. In connection with the Sale Agreement, MPH paid a $ 7.5 million deposit (the \"Deposit\"). A time is of the essence closing was later scheduled. However, on the morning of the closing, MPH commenced a state court action against the Debtor and also filed a\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on the Property. The filing of a\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   on the Property constituted an event of default under Section 13(v) of the Mortgage. ECF No 130, Exh. C at 32-33;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Debtor's Rule 1007 Affidavit) at \u00b6 27. The Lender did not issue a notice of default in response to the\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   . MPH's state court action and\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   precipitated the filing of this bankruptcy case. ECF No. 1 (1007 Affidavit) at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   After filing for bankruptcy, the Debtor commenced an adversary proceeding against MPH for breach of the Sale Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adv. Pro., Dkt. No. 1. In its complaint, the Debtor sought to retain the\n   Deposit as liquidated damages pursuant to the terms of the Sales Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After a two-day trial on the Debtor's claim, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order finding in favor of the Debtor [Adv. Pro., Dkt. No. 38] holding that MPH was in default of its obligations under the Sales Agreement and, as a result, the Debtor was entitled to retain the $ 7,500,000 deposit as liquidated damages. Judgment was entered in favor of the Debtor [Adv. Pro., Dkt. No. 40] and the District Court subsequently affirmed the judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Case No. 17-cv-8198 (AT), Dkt.

No. 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Plan Confirmation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After the Debtor's adversary proceeding was resolved, the Court entered an Order Confirming Debtor's Plan of Reorganization. ECF No. 128. Pursuant to the Plan, the loan was paid in full, together with interest calculated at the Non-Default Rate. Unsecured creditors received a cash dividend equal to 100% of their allowed claims totaling approximately $ 60,000. Equity holders retained their interest in the reorganized Debtor (including the Property valued at over $ 20 million) and received excess cash\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   . The Plan specifically ordered that the Debtor escrow funds in anticipation of litigation regarding the default interest issue, which had been preserved in the Plan in accordance with the Cash Collateral Stipulation and Order. ECF No. 128 at \u00b6 3. One week after the Plan was confirmed, the Lender brought this Motion for Payment of Default Interest and Legal Fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   By this Motion, as contemplated in the Debtor's Chapter 11 Plan, the Lender seeks payment of default interest in the amount of $ 1,099,547.23, representing the accrual of post-petition interest on the Note at the Default Rate of 7% above the Non-Default Rate. Pursuant to the Plan, interest at the Non-Default Rate was previously paid to the Lender, together with the principal balance of $ 6,283,544.55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a general rule, under equitable principles of insolvency law, interest ceases to accrue once a bankruptcy filing occurs.\n   <em>\n    Vanston Bondholders Protective Comm. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Vanston\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court articulated three overarching reasons for this rule: (1) in order to preserve and protect the estate for the benefit of all interests, the rule treats post-petition interest as a penalty imposed for a delay of payment; (2) the rule avoids the administrative inconvenience of continuously recomputing claims; and (3) the rule avoids the gain or loss as between creditors whose obligations bear different interest rates or who receive payment at different times.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156932\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/329/156/#p163\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156932\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/329/156/#p163\">\n    at 163-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6156932\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/329/156/#p163\">\n    67 S.Ct. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Contract Allows for Payment of Default Interest in the Absence of Any Notice of Default\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In its Motion, the Lender argues that there were two events that each independently triggered the Default Rate: the\n   <em>\n    lis pendens\n   </em>\n   and the Chapter 11 filing. According to the Lender, the Loan Documents provide that either would be a sufficient cause for the Lender to recover interest at the Default Rate. Hence, the Lender insists, there is a rebuttable presumption that it is entitled to post-petition interest at the Default Rate pursuant to Section 506(b) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In response, the Debtor argues that the Lender's analysis glosses over a threshold issue in that the Lender failed to issue a notice of default, which the Debtor contends is required by the Grace Period Provision within Section 13 of the Mortgage. That provision mandates written notice and a \"Grace Period\" for default events that are (1) not assigned a specific cure period otherwise identified in Section 13 of the Mortgage and (2) are non-monetary defaults. ECF No. 130, Exh. C at 34. Without the written notice, the Debtor asserts, it was never \"placed in default\" or given the opportunity to cure, and therefore, the Lender's contractual entitlement\n   to the Default Rate was not triggered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   As an initial matter, the plain language of the Note contains no notice requirement and, by its terms, entitles the Lender to default interest if the borrower is in default under the Note or any other document securing the Note (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the mortgage). The Debtor urges that the Court read a notice condition into the Note by incorporating into the Note the notice requirements from the Mortgage Grace Period Provision. Such an interpretation is unwarranted. \"Courts may not by construction add or excise terms, nor distort the meaning of those used and thereby make a new contract for the parties under the guise of interpreting the writing.\"\n   <em>\n    Vermont Teddy Bear Co. v. 538 Madison Realty Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1249321\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/1/470/#p475\">\n    1 N.Y.3d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 475,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1249321\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/1/470/#p475\">\n    807 N.E.2d 876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 879,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1249321\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/1/470/#p475\">\n    775 N.Y.S.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Section 13 of the Mortgage, which enumerates events of default and contains the Grace Period Provision, is most reasonably read to require the Lender to provide notice of default and opportunity to cure only before making use of the Remedies of Mortgagee described in Section 14 of the Mortgage, namely, the acceleration of debts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Taddeo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6556593,525593\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/685/24/\">\n    685 F.2d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26 (2d Cir. 1982) (\"When Congress empowered ... debtors to 'cure defaults,' we think Congress intended to allow mortgagors to 'de-accelerate' their mortgage and reinstate its original payment schedule.\").

ECF No. 17. The Cash Collateral Stipulation contained a provision titled \"Rights Preserved\" that stated that the Stipulation \"is without prejudice to, and does not constitute a waiver of ... any rights of the Lender ... including, without limitation ... the right to ... the allowance and payment pursuant to Bankruptcy Code \u00a7 506(b) of default interest on its claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.

Default Interest was allowed as a threshold matter because the Lender was oversecured; indeed, at all times the Debtor's equity in the Property exceeded the amount of the mortgage by a ratio of more than a 3:1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ambalu Decl. \u00b6 7; Debtor's Memo at 9. Pursuant to the Debtor's Chapter 11 Plan, the Debtor was able to pay off the entire mortgage and now owns the Property free and clear of any liens. In fact, this is a rare case where the Plan provided for distributions to equity holders of the Debtor. The Debtor's undiminished solvency, coupled with distributions to equity, weighs against reducing the contracted Default Rate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    785 Partners\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3955845\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/470/126/#p134\">\n    470 B.R. at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Reducing the contract interest payable by a solvent debtor would unfairly grant a windfall to its equity.\");\n   <em>\n    Gen.

In the Debtor's filings, it insinuates that the Lender's pursuit of default interest, in itself, constitutes some form of misconduct. For example, the Debtor asserts that the Lender \"exaggerated the consequences of the Debtor's bankruptcy,\" Debtor's Memo at 13, and its \"focus on post-petition default rate interest underscores that the perceived hardship now being claimed is self-created, and filters into the Debtor's view that the Lender was an opportunist looking for windfall profits on a fully performing Loan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10. The Court concludes that the Lender\n   is fully within its rights in seeking to enforce the bargained-for interest rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In its supplemental briefing, which cites to depositions of representatives of the Lender, the Debtor essentially contends that the alleged \"misconduct\" amounts to general overstatements regarding the true extent of injuries sustained by the Lender as a result of the bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Supp. Memo at 2 (\"In their testimony, each bank representatives [sic] could not cite any aspect of the Chapter 11 case triggering actual risk of nonpayment or erosion of collateral.\"). This argument is not persuasive. The fact that the bankruptcy may not have caused the Lender pecuniary injury, even if true, is irrelevant. What is relevant - and dispositive, unless the Debtor rebuts the presumption - is that the risk which the default interest protected against came to pass. The Debtor fails to cite to any cases where a court found that that a lender's enforcement of a contractual remedy in the absence of financial injury was demonstrative of lender misconduct. Indeed, at the Hearing, counsel for the Debtor conceded that the Lender's actions in pursuing default interest fall into the category of strategy rather than misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In sum, the Court concludes that the contractual 7% Default Rate is not so egregious or inequitable that the Court must rewrite the Debtor and Lender's contract and apply a lower default rate of interest. The creditors have been repaid in full, equity retained cash, and the retained Property is worth more than $ 20 million. Indeed, the Court finds that the equities fully support enforcement of the parties' bargain and, as such, the Lender is entitled to receive interest at the contracted default rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Lender is entitled to payment of additional post-petition interest at the contractual Default Rate of 7% above the Non-Default Rate, in the total amount of $ 1,099,547.23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    The Chapter 11 Plan explicitly provided that the \"Debtor shall escrow sufficient funds to satisfy any award of default interest to the Lender based upon a 7% default rate above the contract rate ...\" and further specified that the \"Lender shall serve and file a motion seeking the allowance of post-petition default interest and attorney's fees and expenses.\" ECF No. 128 at \u00b6 3, 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    This matter is a core proceeding under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(2)(B) (allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate).

Both courts ruled that while a debtor may utilize bankruptcy to cure a pre-petition default in order to de-accelerate the loan, a debtor is not entitled to \"cure\" the imposition of default interest following the default. The decisions underscore the notion that default interest functions parallel to other remedies of default.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    <em>\n     In re Sheba Realty Corp\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%201373094\">\n     2014 WL 1373094\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr.

According to the Lender, the bankruptcy triggered, albeit not automatically, a hike in the risk rating of the Loan [\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 3-7], forced the Lender to dedicate additional resources to monitoring the Loan [\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 10-12], and caused the Lender to increase capital reserves for the Loan [\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 13]. The Court, however, need not address the merits or weight of these facts because it finds that the default interest provision is intended to compensate for prospective risks associated with default and does not depend on any actual incurred costs resulting from default.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
