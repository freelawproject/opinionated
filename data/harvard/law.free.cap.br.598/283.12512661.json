Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On August 31, 2018 (the \"Petition Date\"), Verity Health Systems of California (\"VHS\") and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Debtors\") filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. On August 31, 2018, the Court entered an order granting the Debtors' motion for joint administration of the Debtors' Chapter 11 cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On October 31, 2018, the Court entered an order establishing auction procedures for the sale of the Hospitals (the \"Bidding Procedures Order,\" and the motion for entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, the \"Bidding Procedures Motion\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the \"APA\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   dated October 1, 2018, Santa Clara was designated as the stalking horse bidder (the \"Stalking Horse Bidder\"). The Bidding Procedures Order set a hearing on December 19, 2018 to consider the Debtors' motion for entry of an order (the \"Sale Order\") approving the sale of the Hospitals (the \"Sale Motion,\" and the hearing on the Sale Motion, the \"Sale Hearing\"). The Debtors expect that the sale will close no earlier than February 28, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Hospitals were vigorously marketed by the Debtors' investment banker, Cain Brothers, a division of KeyBank Capital Markets, Inc. (\"Cain\"). Twenty-five parties executed non-disclosure agreements and were granted access to a data room containing information about the Hospitals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cain sent a direct e-mail communication to over 170 interested potential purchasers\n   which contained key information about the Hospitals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cain actively followed up with two serious potential purchasers, assisting those parties with due diligence and making itself available to answer questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding these thorough marketing efforts, no party emerged willing to place a bid for the Hospitals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 2015, the Debtors' predecessor, Daughters of Charity Ministry Services Corporation (\"Daughters\"), sought authorization from the Attorney General, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205914\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 5914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2018), to implement a\n   <em>\n    System Restructuring and Support Agreement\n   </em>\n   (the \"Restructuring Agreement\"). The Attorney General approved the Restructuring Agreement, subject to various conditions (each, a \"Condition,\" and collectively, the \"Conditions\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   O'Connor was subject to 21 Conditions; St. Louise was subject to 22 Conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Among other things, the Conditions require the Hospitals to maintain specified levels of emergency services, intensive care services, cardiac services, and various other services. The Conditions purport to be binding upon \"any and all current and future owners\" of the Hospitals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On October 10, 2018, the Attorney General filed an objection to the Bidding Procedures Motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Attorney General objected to the Debtors' proposal to sell the Hospitals free and clear of the Conditions, contending that the Conditions remained binding upon any purchaser of the Hospitals. The Court did not address the Attorney General's objection when adjudicating the Bidding Procedures Motion, finding the objection to be premature. The Bidding Procedures Order provided that the Attorney General's objection was \"preserved for the Sale Hearing and may be raised at that time.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On November 2, 2018, Santa Clara asked the Attorney General to provide clarification regarding his position as to the applicability of certain of the Conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Santa Clara asserted that its status as a government entity made it impossible to comply with certain Conditions without violating its obligations under California law and the California Constitution. On November 9, 2018, the Attorney General responded, advising that five of the Conditions would not be enforced against Santa Clara.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Attorney General waived enforcement of Conditions requiring the Hospitals to furnish specified amounts of charity care and community benefits, Conditions pertaining to pension\n   obligations, and Conditions pertaining to the composition of the Board of Trustees of each Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 14, 2018, the Attorney General filed a response to the Debtors' memorandum in support of the Sale Motion (the \"Response\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Response provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   The California Attorney General does not object to the sale to the County of Santa Clara, in light of the conditions as clarified in the Attorney General's November 9, 2018 letter to the County of Santa Clara and as may be subsequently further clarified or modified by the Attorney General. The Attorney General and the County are presently engaged in further discussions about the Conditions not addressed by the Attorney General's November 9, 2018 letter, and as such, the Attorney General will continue to consider any further requests for clarification or modification presented by the County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The APA provides that Santa Clara is not required to accept a Sale Order that does not provide for the sale of the Hospitals free and clear of all liens, claims, and interests (including the Conditions).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Attorney General's Response did not state that the Attorney General objected to sale of the Hospitals free and clear of the Conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   At the Sale Hearing, the Attorney General stated that the Response was \"inartfully drafted,\" and that the Attorney General did in fact object to sale of the Hospitals free and clear of the Conditions. The Debtors and Santa Clara asked the Court to approve the sale free and clear of the Conditions, asserting that the Attorney General had waived its objections and/or was estopped from asserting such objections. Santa Clara's counsel explained that in order for the County to be able to proceed with the closing-anticipated to occur at the end of February 2019-it was necessary for any uncertainty regarding the applicability of the Conditions to be immediately resolved. Santa Clara stated that if an order providing for a sale free and clear of the Conditions was not entered by the January 2, 2019 deadline set forth in the APA, it would be Santa Clara's position that a breach of the APA had occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Findings and Conclusions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. The Attorney General Has Waived His Ability to Contest a Sale Free and Clear of the Conditions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Waiver is the voluntary relinquishment of a known right or conduct such as to warrant an inference to that effect. It implies knowledge of all material facts and of one's rights, together with a willingness to refrain from enforcing those rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Hauk v. JP Morgan Chase Bank USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4013560\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/552/1114/#p1119\">\n    552 F.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1119 (9th Cir. 2009). Waiver also occurs when a \"party's acts are so inconsistent with an intent to enforce the right as to induce a reasonable belief that such right has been relinquished.\"\n   <em>\n    Salyers v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266126\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/934/#p938\">\n    871 F.3d 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 938 (9th Cir. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Response filed by the Attorney General on December 14, 2018 waived the Attorney General's right to object to a sale free and clear of the Conditions. The Response provided: \"The California Attorney General\n   <em>\n    does not object\n   </em>\n   to the sale to the County of Santa Clara ....\" (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   It contained no reservation of the\n   Attorney General's right to object in the event that the contemplated \"further requests for clarification or modification presented by the County\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not yield results acceptable to the Attorney General. The Attorney General knew that the Debtors were seeking approval of a sale free and clear of the Conditions, because the APA contained unequivocal language to that effect. By filing the Response, the Attorney General voluntary relinquished his right to object to a sale free and clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, the filing of the Response was so inconsistent with an intent to continue to enforce the Conditions against Santa Clara as to induce Santa Clara to reasonably believe that the Attorney General had abandoned his position as to the enforceability of the Conditions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salyers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266126\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/871/934/#p938\">\n    871 F.3d at 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In support of his contention that the Response did not waive his objections, the Attorney General points to conversations between the Attorney General's counsel and Santa Clara's counsel that took place contemporaneously with the filing of the Response. Angela Sierra, Chief Assistant Attorney General of the Public Rights Division at the California Department of Justice, testifies that she had a short conversation with Douglas M. Press, Santa Clara's Assistant County Counsel, on December 14, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Ms. Sierra:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Shortly before the Attorney General Office's filing of the AG Response, my Office had proposed incorporating our previously lodged objections into [the] AG Response by way of a footnote. After further consideration of an issue raised by the County, I determined that such incorporation was not necessary, given that we had not withdrawn our objections. Approximately ten minutes before the noon filing deadline on December 14, 2018, I had a short conversation with Assistant County Counsel Doug Press, during which I explained that the language that my Office was poised to file meant that we did not object to the sale as long as the conditions as currently or subsequently clarified remained in place. Doug Press stated that he disagreed with that interpretation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   I participated in several discussions with Assistant County Counsel Doug Press regarding the AG Conditions following the filing of the AG Response on December 14, 2018. These discussions continued through December 18, 2018. At no time during those discussions did our Office communicate that we had waived the applicability of the AG Conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Mr. Press disputes Ms. Sierra's characterization of the December 14, 2018 conversation. Mr. Press' account of the conversation is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   On ... December 14, 2018, the California Attorney General's Office proposed language to be inserted in a response that day that would have asserted that its approval of the sale was conditional, but we agreed to remove that conditional language. Instead, we agreed to the unconditional language that appears in the Attorney General's response ... that ... \"[t]he California Attorney General does not object to the sale to the County of Santa Clara,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     in light of\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the conditions as clarified in the Attorney General's November 9, 2018 letter to the County of Santa Clara and as may be subsequently further clarified or modified\n   by the Attorney General.\" [Emphasis Added.] The unconditional \"in light of\" language was meant, as the County understood it, to reflect that the California Attorney General would no longer object to the sale, although we also agreed to continue to discuss, post-sale, how to address the other conditions under a variety of approaches. But the message to the Court and the community was meant to be clear, that the California Attorney General, in its Response, ... was expressing that it was not opposed to the sale even though ongoing discussions with the County about the other conditions were contemplated outside the Court process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court declines to consider the testimony of Ms. Sierra and Mr. Press in determining whether the filing of the Response effected a waiver of the Attorney General's objections. When litigating with a sophisticated party such as the Attorney General, the Debtors, Santa Clara, and other interested parties are entitled to presume that representations made by the Attorney General in papers filed with the Court accurately reflect his position. Allowing the Attorney General, or any other party, to qualify statements made in papers through the subsequent introduction of parol evidence would unduly hamper the Court's ability to adjudicate matters arising in this case. More than 63 separate papers have been filed in connection with the Bidding Procedures Motion and Sale Motion. The papers raise multiple discrete and complicated issues, including whether the sale could be free and clear of obligations imposed in connection with various collective bargaining agreements; whether the Debtors sufficiently marketed the Hospitals; whether the bidding procedures proposed by the Debtors would yield the maximum price for the estate; whether the Debtors had articulated sufficient business justification for the sale; whether the sales price is fair and reasonable; whether the APA was negotiated in good faith and at arms-length; whether the Debtors' Medicare and Medi-Cal Provider Agreements are properly characterized as an executory contract or a statutory entitlement; and whether the Debtors are entitled to assume and assign various unexpired leases and executory contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even if only a fraction of the parties who have filed papers were allowed to introduce supplemental evidence establishing what their papers really meant, the adjudicative process would grind to a halt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Pursuant to FRE 403, the Court may exclude evidence if consideration thereof would result in undue delay. Exclusion of the declarations of Ms. Sierra and Mr. Press is warranted under FRE 403, particularly where, as here, the consideration of such evidence would require the Court to consider similar evidence submitted by other parties dissatisfied by the Court's rulings. In addition, the Court has the inherent power to \"manage [its] own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition\" of matters coming before it.\n   <em>\n    Chambers v. NASCO, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p43\">\n    501 U.S. 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p43\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2132,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1107845\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/32/#p43\">\n    115 L.Ed.2d 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991).

The Attorney General knew that the Debtors and Santa Clara would rely upon the Response's representation that he had no objection to the sale. The Debtors and Santa Clara had no way of knowing that when the Attorney General stated that he did \"not object to the sale to the County of Santa Clara,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   what he really meant was that he did not object except to the extent that he did object. The Debtors and Santa Clara relied upon the Attorney General's representation to their detriment. Had they been aware of the Attorney General's true position, the Debtors and Santa Clara would have more vigorously contested the Attorney General's arguments regarding the binding effect of the Conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Relying upon\n   <em>\n    Jordan v.

The Attorney General's reliance upon\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205926\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 5926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in support of this position is unavailing. Section 5926 provides only that the Attorney General may enforce the Conditions to the fullest extent provided by law. However, the Attorney General has not identified the specific provisions of California law that permit the continued enforcement of the Conditions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   This omission is particularly glaring in view of the Attorney General's lack of authority to review the sale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, the Court finds it significant that the Attorney General has failed to identify the statutory basis for its position even after being afforded an opportunity to respond to the Court's Preliminary Findings. The Preliminary Findings advised the Attorney General that because he had failed to identify the statutory authority for continued enforcement of the Conditions, the Court intended to authorize the Debtors to sell the Hospitals free and clear of the Conditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   In response to the Preliminary Findings, the Attorney General cited to provisions in the Conditions that purport to make the Conditions legally binding upon any entity acquiring the Hospitals. Notably, the Attorney General did not cite to any provision of California law entitling him to enforce successorship liability under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Attorney General's reliance upon provisions purporting to make the Conditions binding upon all successors, regardless of the circumstances under which such successors acquire the Hospitals, is an impermissible attempt to expand his regulatory authority over the Hospitals. Provisions within the Conditions are enforceable only to the extent that they are supported by California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Furthermore, the Attorney General's contention that the Conditions remain binding upon Santa Clara is inconsistent with the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%205914\">\n    Cal. Corp. Code \u00a7 5914\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and its legislative history. The concern motivating enactment of the statute was to prevent charitable assets from falling into the hands of for-profit entities who would not continue to use those assets for charitable purposes. The concern has no applicability where the assets are transferred to a public entity, which has independent statutory obligations to maintain the assets' charitable character, as discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Because the Attorney General has no authority to review the sale of the Hospitals to Santa Clara, and because the Attorney General has identified no statutory provision permitting his continued enforcement of the Conditions under the circumstances, the Court finds that the Debtors may sell the Hospitals free and clear of the Conditions under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     D. The Attorney General's Request for a 14-day Stay of the Sale Order is Denied\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Bankruptcy Rule 6004(h) provides that an \"order authorizing the ... sale ... of property ... is stayed until the expiration of 14 days after entry of the order, unless the court orders otherwise.\" The Attorney General requests that the stay imposed by Bankruptcy Rule 6004(h) remain in effect. According to the Attorney General, a 14-day stay is necessary because the \"proposed sale will have a significant impact on the health and safety of the surrounding communities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Debtors assert that the 14-day stay should not apply so that the sale may close as expeditiously as possible. The sale is currently projected to close at the end of February 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The 1999 Advisory Committee Note to Bankruptcy Rule 6004 states that the rule is intended \"to provide sufficient time for a party to request a stay pending appeal of an order authorizing the ... sale ... of property under \u00a7 363(b) of the Code before the order is implemented.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   To enable the sale to close expeditiously, the Sale Order shall be effective immediately upon entry, notwithstanding Bankruptcy Rule 6004(h). Because the sale will not close until the end of February 2019, in the Court's view, the Attorney General's appeal of the Sale Order will not likely be rendered moot by the Court's waiver of the 14-day stay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Attorney General will suffer no prejudice from waiver of the stay. On the other hand, waiving the stay will benefit the Debtors, Santa Clara, and the estate by enabling the parties to immediately begin performing\n   the significant work that is a prerequisite to the closing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
