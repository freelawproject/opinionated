(\"AAA Bronze\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   commenced this Adversary Proceeding on March 22, 2017 by filing the original Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On July 6, 2017, after obtaining authorization from the Court, Plaintiff filed the three-count Amended Complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Count I of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that the bankruptcy estate of AAA Bronze, and not the Defendant, is the owner of approximately $ 900,000.00 in proceeds from the settlement of a claim due to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (\"BP claim\"). In Count II, Plaintiff seeks a declaratory judgment that Defendant is the alter ego of AAA Bronze. In Count III, Plaintiff seeks to substantively consolidate AAA Bronze and the Defendant, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the two are actually one and the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant's Motion seeks dismissal of Counts II and III.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to Count II, Defendant claims that Plaintiff lacks standing to bring an alter ego action. As to Count III, Defendant asserts that the Bankruptcy Code does not authorize substantive consolidation of a debtor in bankruptcy, here AAA Bronze, with a party that is not a debtor before this Court (\"non-debtor\"), here the Defendant. Based on the Motion and response, as well as the applicable case law, the Motion is due to be denied for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Count II: Plaintiff has Standing to Bring an Alter Ego Action.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant argues that only a creditor may pursue an alter ego claim such as Plaintiff has asserted in Count II.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff replies that he has standing to bring this alter ego action because: 1) the claim would benefit all creditors of the estate of AAA Bronze; and 2) bankruptcy courts have routinely found that under Florida law, a bankruptcy trustee has standing to bring an alter ego action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals has adopted a two-prong test, commonly known as the \"\n   <em>\n    Icarus\n   </em>\n   Test,\" to determine whether a bankruptcy trustee has standing to bring an alter ego claim: is the claim 1) a general claim that is common to all creditors; and 2) allowed by state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Florida bankruptcy courts have analyzed and applied the\n   <em>\n    Icarus\n   </em>\n   Test. This Court has held that a bankruptcy trustee has exclusive standing to bring an alter ego action \"if the injury alleged ... is an injury to the corporation and thus suffered generally by all creditors and is not an injury inflicted directly on any one creditor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has also held that an alter ego cause of action is allowed under Florida law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Richard Haisfield and Audrey L.

Christoph,\n   </em>\n   Defendant argues that Florida law does not allow Plaintiff to pursue an alter ego cause of action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Seminole Boatyard,\n   </em>\n   a corporation filed Chapter 7 and a trustee was appointed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bankruptcy trustee asserted claims against the debtor's principal, who then offered to purchase the bankruptcy estate's claims against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the bankruptcy court approved that purchase, the debtor's landlord filed suit against the debtor's principal in state court, alleging he was the alter ego of the debtor and thus liable for the unpaid rent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtor's principal defended on the basis that because he purchased claims from the bankruptcy trustee, the landlord was barred from bringing such an action against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue, as framed by the court in\n   <em>\n    Seminole Boatyard,\n   </em>\n   was whether a bankruptcy trustee \"may assert an alter ego action against the president of the debtor corporation on behalf of a creditor\n   ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Holding that the alter ego cause of action belonged to the landlord and not to the debtor initially, the court held that the bankruptcy trustee did not have standing to bring that action, so the trustee's sale of claims against and general release of debtor's principal had no effect on the landlord's right to sue the principal on an alter ego theory in state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ruling was, and remains, consistent with Eleventh Circuit case law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bankruptcy courts in Florida have generally found\n   <em>\n    Seminole Boatyard\n   </em>\n   to be a narrow ruling, rather than a universal holding that a bankruptcy trustee never has standing to pursue an alter ego claim in Florida.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further,\n   <em>\n    Seminole Boatyard\n   </em>\n   is readily distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Seminole Boatyard\n   </em>\n   , the alter ego action belonged to and would have benefitted only one creditor: the landlord. Here, Plaintiff asserts alter ego in order to bring settlement proceeds into the bankruptcy estate for the benefit of all creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Count II satisfies both prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Icarus\n   </em>\n   Test: Plaintiff seeks recovery of an asset for the benefit of all creditors, and an alter ego action is allowed under Florida law. The Motion as to Count II is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Count III: Bankruptcy Courts have Authority to Substantively Consolidate Debtors with Non-Debtors.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In Count III of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiff seeks substantive consolidation of Defendant, a non-debtor, with the Debtor, AAA Bronze. Plaintiff argues that substantive consolidation is appropriate because there is no separate identity between AAA Bronze and Defendant, and the benefit of substantive consolidation to the creditors of the estate would outweigh any prejudice to Defendant. Defendant maintains that bankruptcy courts do not have authority to substantively consolidate a debtor with a non-debtor, that such consolidation is in contravention of specific sections of the Bankruptcy Code, and that the Court's equitable powers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   do not extend to substantive consolidation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Substantive consolidation is an equitable remedy that should be \"used sparingly,\" but is allowed by courts \"to insure the equitable treatment of all creditors.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    In re S &amp; G Financial Services of South Florida, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   a case this Court finds persuasive. In\n   <em>\n    S &amp; G Financial Services\n   </em>\n   , the bankruptcy trustee\n   filed suit to consolidate the debtor with two of its non-debtor affiliates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The non-debtor defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that substantive consolidation of non-debtors with debtors was not allowed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to determining that the trustee had pled a sufficient cause of action for substantive consolidation to survive a motion to dismiss, the court found that it had requisite authority to consolidate a debtor with non-debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The bankruptcy court for the Southern District of Florida looked first to a case in which the U.S. Supreme Court held \"[t]he power of the bankruptcy court to ... adjudicate equities arising out of the relationship between the several creditors is complete.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    S &amp; G Financial Services\n   </em>\n   court then noted that no Circuit Court of Appeals, including the Eleventh Circuit, has rejected the concept that substantive consolidation of a non-debtor with a debtor is authorized.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court pointed out that Florida and Georgia bankruptcy courts have expressly allowed substantive consolidation of a debtor and non-debtor in limited circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ultimately determined that substantive consolidation of a debtor and non-debtor depends on whether \"the outcome of the proceeding could conceivably have an effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court ruled that \"it is well within this Court's equitable powers to allow substantive consolidation of entities under appropriate circumstances, whether or not all of those entities are debtors in bankruptcy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Eastgroup Properties v.
