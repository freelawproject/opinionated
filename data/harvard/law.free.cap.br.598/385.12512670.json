(\"Motion,\" ECF Doc. # 18.) The Debtor is a franchisee of Little Caesar Enterprises. It operates five Little Caesars Pizza restaurants. As a franchisee, the Debtor is required to prepare its financial reports using four-week reporting intervals, rather than monthly reporting intervals, meaning that the Debtor prepares 13 reports annually instead of the typical 12 reports. The Debtor's financial reporting computer software is geared to this four-week reporting cycle. The U.S. Trustee Guidelines, however, require debtors to prepare monthly operating reports using Official Form 425C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Debtor's Motion argues that utilizing Official Form 425C would be unreasonably burdensome. The Court disagrees; nonetheless, as explained below, the Court will permit the Debtor to report based on its four-week reporting intervals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Small business debtors have unique reporting obligations in chapter 11 cases under the Bankruptcy Code and Rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20308\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and FED.

In addition, the UST Guidelines for Region 2 require the debtor to file \"an original monthly operating report with the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court, and serve a paper copy upon the United States Trustee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The UST Guidelines state that the monthly operating report must be prepared using its form-namely, Official Form 425C.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Debtor is a small business debtor as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (51D). (ECF Doc. # 1 \u00b6 8.) Therefore, it must comply with Rule 2015(a)(6) and file Official Form 425C either monthly or on the intervals approved by the Court until \"the effective date of the plan, or conversion or dismissal of the case.\" FED. R. BANKR. P. 2015(a)(6). While the default rule is monthly reporting, the Court may alter the reporting intervals for good cause shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   While courts in prior cases in this District have applied section 105 of the Bankruptcy Code to excuse compliance with various requirements in the UST Guidelines, no cases cited to the Court have excused a small business debtor from using Official Form 425C. Unless the U.S. Trustee agrees otherwise, standardization of reporting, particularly in small business cases, is important in simplifying the U.S. Trustee's monitoring responsibilities in the large number of small business cases filed in this Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Debtor alleges that filing the Form 425C report will have a negative impact on the Debtor's reorganization efforts. The Court does not believe that requiring the use of Official Form 425C imposes an unreasonable burden on this Debtor. The Debtor states that requiring it to use Official Form 425C would require it to \"change its Business Forms.\" (Motion \u00b6 12.) But the Debtor can use the information in its existing business forms to complete Official Form 425C. The Debtor explains that its financial reporting-required by the franchisor-is based on four-week reporting intervals, rather than monthly reporting intervals. (Motion \u00b6 9.) While Official Form 425C generally calls for monthly financial reporting, as already explained, Rule 2015(a)(6) specifically authorizes the Court to adjust the reporting intervals. Here, the Debtor has established good cause to adjust the reporting intervals from monthly to every four weeks. This will allow the Debtor to avoid having to modify its financial reporting software for use in preparing reports on Official Form 425C. The burden of filing additional reports is not substantial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Official Form 425C requires the Debtor to provide additional information that is not contained in the Debtor's existing business forms. For example, Official Form 425C asks whether a debtor has timely (i) paid all of its bills, (ii) paid its employees on time, (iii) filed and paid tax returns, and (iv) paid its insurance premiums While not all of this information is readily identifiable in the Debtor's existing business forms, this required information is essential for the U.S. Trustee to carry out its important monitoring role in small business cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Official Form 425C also requires the Debtor to attach documents, such as bank statements and financial reports, including income statements (profit &amp; loss) and balance sheets. The Debtor's business forms include a balance sheet and income statement. These documents must be attached to Official Form 425C; they supplement the information provided in Official Form 425C rather than replace the Form. Lastly, while Rule 2015(a)(6) expressly permits the Court to adjust the reporting intervals for cause, it does not authorize the Court to excuse a debtor from using Official Form 425C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Debtor's Motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . The Debtor must use Official Form 425C in its reports, but it may utilize four-week intervals in\n   completing the reports. rather than monthly intervals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    United States Department of Justice, Office of the United States Trustee, Region 2 - New York, Connecticut and Vermont,\n    <em>\n     Operating Guidelines and Reporting Requirements for Debtors In Possession and Trustees\n    </em>\n    1, 4, https://www.justice.gov/ust-regions-r02/file/region_2_operating_guidelines.pdf/download.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"The monthly operating reports must be prepared using the forms provided herein.
