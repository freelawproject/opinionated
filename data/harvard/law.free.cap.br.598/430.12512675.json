Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff D.A.N. Joint Venture III, L.P. (\"DJV\" or \"Plaintiff\") contends that Nicholas S. Gouletas (\"Gouletas\" or the \"Debtor\") engaged in a complicated scheme to hide, transfer, and otherwise shield his assets from the claims of certain of his judgment creditors by transferring more than $ 2,000,000 in cash and other assets to his friends, relatives, and a select group of creditors. [11, at \u00b6 1.] Plaintiff brings state-law claims of (i) avoidance of fraudulent transfers pursuant to 740 ILCS 160/5(a)(1) ; (ii) avoidance of fraudulent\n   transfers pursuant to 740 ILCS 160/6(a) ; (iii) civil conspiracy to commit fraud; (iv) aiding and abetting fraud; (v) tortious interference with expectancy of collection upon judgments; and (vi) reimbursement of funds owed to Gouletas prior to the time that he filed for bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Gouletas is the owner and control person of a large group of companies generally referred to as \"American Invsco\" that were involved in condominium conversions and various other real estate developments in more than 40 cities throughout the United States. [11, at \u00b6 7.] On December 19, 2013, citations to discover assets were issued against Gouletas in connection with two lawsuits against him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.] As of late December 2013, Gouletas was prohibited from transferring his assets by virtue of the citations issued against him. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In another citation to discover assets dated June 5, 2014, Gouletas was instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   YOU ARE PROHIBITED from making or allowing any transfer or other disposition of * * * any property not exempt from execution * * * belonging to the judgment debtor [Gouletas]\n   <em>\n    or to which the judgment debtor may be entitled\n   </em>\n   or which may be acquired by or become due to the judgment debtor * * *, until further order of Court or termination of the proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18.] Plaintiff challenges numerous actions Gouletas allegedly took to improperly transfer assets after these citations were issued against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Transfers to Touris Checking Accounts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2015, Gouletas requested that his close friend of over 40 years Defendant Dorothea Touris deposit funds belonging to Gouletas into her checking accounts for the payment of Gouletas's expenses. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6.1, 20-22.] Pursuant to Gouletas's plan, Touris would take the funds that he had provided to her, put the money into her checking accounts, and then pay Gouletas's bills out of her checking accounts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22.] The funds that Gouletas deposited into Touris's checking accounts belonged to Gouletas. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In late January of 2015, Touris met with Gouletas at his office in Chicago with Gouletas's attorney Howard Teplinsky, an attorney at Beermann Pritikin Mirabelli Swerdlove LLP (\"BPMS\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23.] At that meeting, Gouletas presented Touris with a check in the amount of $ 396,218.84. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Gouletas told Touris to deposit the check into her account and to pay $ 195,000 to Steven Gouletas (Gouletas's son) and $ 50,000 to George Spanos (Gouletas's friend), with the balance of $ 150,000 to be kept by Touris as compensation in the form of a purported reimbursement on a Gouletas investment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] On February 6, 2015, Touris paid $ 195,000 to Gouletas's son and $ 50,000 to George Spanos, as directed by Gouletas. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 24.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On February 17, 2015, Gouletas wire-transferred $ 15,730 into Touris's checking account at Chase Bank. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 25.] The $ 15,730 was money that belonged to Gouletas. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] However, Gouletas claimed to have \"no idea\" from where the $ 15,730 came. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In March of 2015, Gouletas told Touris that a check for $ 415,000 was coming to her, which she was to deposit into her account for the payment of Gouletas's expenses. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.] Touris deposited the $ 415,000 check into her checking account\n   at Chase Bank. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] According to Touris, Gouletas asked her to deposit the check into her account to pay his bills. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Although Gouletas claimed that the $ 415,000 was a \"loan\" to him from Defendant Dr. Paul Jones, at some point he admitted that the $ 415,000 was his money. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] In total, Gouletas deposited more than $ 431,145 into Touris's checking account at Chase. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] As Exhibit 12 to the amended complaint, Plaintiff includes account summaries showing financial transactions that Touris admits that she handled for Gouletas with his own money. [11-1, at 38-46; 11, at \u00b6 27.] All of the transactions were done at the direction of Gouletas. [11, at \u00b6 27.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Garvey Court Project Transfers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Gouletas was involved in a real estate development project referred to as \"Garvey Court\" (the \"Garvey Court Project\") that involved the construction of a high-rise retail/office/condominium building on properties that Gouletas owned (through entities that he owned and controlled). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.] Gouletas \"gifted\" his 25% interest in the Garvey Court Project to family members through two newly formed LLCs, SEG Garvey LLC and NKM Garvey LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.] Plaintiff estimates that the value of Gouletas's interest in the Garvey Court Project at the time of these transfers exceeded $ 3,600,000. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Stock Transfers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 9, 2014, Gouletas discovered that he had acquired a number of shares of stock in CIB Marine BankShares (the \"CIB Stock\"), which he held through a stock brokerage account at TD Ameritrade (the \"TDA Account\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 34.] Gouletas sold his CIB Stock through his TDA Account for just over $ 51,000 and wire-transferred $ 51,323.29 from that stock sale into a checking account held in the name of his wife, Defendant Natel Matschulat. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35.] Gouletas then proceeded to have his wife sign checks from that account for the payment of Gouletas's expenses. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    D. HBI-Parking Lot Mortgage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant 800 South Wells Phase II, LLC (\"800 SWP\") owned a 1.77 acre, 126-space parking lot at 800 South Wells Street in Chicago (the \"Parking Lot\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37.] Gouletas was the manager, sole member, and control person of 800 SWP. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] As of November 1, 2009, there was only one mortgage against the Parking Lot, which was in favor of River City Investors, LLC (\"RCI\") in the original principal amount of $ 2,000,000.00 (the \"RCI Mortgage\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38.] In November 2009, Gouletas had another entity he controlled-Defendant Home By Invsco, Inc. (\"HBI\")-place a false mortgage against the Parking Lot in the amount of $ 2,177,700 (the \"HBI Second Mortgage\"). [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] HBI was owned and controlled by Gouletas. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] While Gouletas signed the HBI Second Mortgage on November 1, 2009, the internal financial documents of Gouletas's enterprise-American Invsco, which included 800 SWP and HBI-did not reflect any indebtedness supposedly owed to HBI on the HBI Second Mortgage. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In late 2014, a third party offered to purchase the Parking Lot for $ 7,750,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 41.] With the RCI Mortgage and other expenses of the sale totaling approximately $ 5,711,000, Gouletas (with the assistance of one or more Doe Defendants 1-10) came up with a plan to shield approximately $ 2,038,000 in profits from Gouletas's disfavored creditors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The plan involved the false claim that the HBI Second Mortgage was legitimate, which allowed Gouletas to distribute the approximately $ 2,038,000 in profits from the sale of the Parking Lot (that otherwise would have been paid to Gouletas) to certain preferred creditors and other friends and relatives of Gouletas, with those friends and relatives then funneling a portion of the profits from the sale of the Parking Lot back to Gouletas through Touris's checking accounts. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The closing on the sale of the Parking Lot occurred on December 29, 2014. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43.] The closing statement shows that from the $ 7,750,000 in sale proceeds, $ 2,038,703.84 was the balance due to the Seller 800 SWP. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Elizabeth Friedgut, the transactional attorney who was handling the sale of the Parking Lot for Gouletas, signed the settlement statement for and on behalf of 800 SWP. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The balance due to 800 SWP (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , $ 2,038,703.84) was transferred into a trust account at BPMS to facilitate the payment of the proceeds as Gouletas directed. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 44.] On January 6, 2015, Gouletas had an additional $ 137,535 wire-transferred into the trust account at BPMS. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In January 2015, Mr. Teplinsky (for and on behalf of BPMS) directed how the $ 1,271,218.84 from the BPMS escrow account was to be distributed, which included $ 396,218.84 paid to Touris and $ 690,000 distributed to Defendant Jones. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 45.] As discussed above, of the $ 396,218.84 paid to Touris, Gouletas had Touris distribute $ 195,000 to his son Steven Gouletas and $ 50,000 to his friend Mr. Spanos. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Of the $ 690,000 distributed to Jones, $ 415,000 was deposited into Touris's checking account so Gouletas could continue to pay his expenses without those funds being subject to execution by Gouletas's judgment creditors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] On January 13, 2015, Mr. Teplinsky also directed that $ 30,020 of the profits from the sale of the Parking Lot be distributed to BPMS, purportedly for the payment of HBI's legal bills. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 46.] On January 22, 2015, an additional $ 25,000 of the profits from the sale of the Parking Lot were distributed to BPMS as a \"finalize entity flat fee charge,\" again for work purportedly done for and on behalf of HBI. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiff alleges-on information and belief-that the fees paid to BPMS reflected legal work that was done primarily on behalf of Gouletas or that otherwise constituted excessive legal fees charged to HBI. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Bankruptcy Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On January 17, 2016, Gouletas filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in the Northern District of Illinois. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 50.] The relevant citations remained in effect until the date that Gouletas filed for bankruptcy. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] The Bankruptcy Trustee attempted to obtain counsel to prosecute avoidance and fraudulent transfer claims for and on behalf of the bankruptcy estate on a contingent fee basis, but, despite his diligent efforts, was unable to do so. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 51.] On July 23, 2017, the Bankruptcy Trustee received an offer from Plaintiff to purchase the litigation claims and alter-ego claims for $ 15,000. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ] On July 24, 2017, the Bankruptcy Trustee filed in the bankruptcy court the Trustee's Motion for Approval of Sale of Interests in Personal Property and for Related Relief [11-1, at 78-87], which specifically included fraudulent transfer, alter-ego, and common law tort claims of the nature set forth in the amended complaint. No party offered a\n   higher bid for those claims. [11, at \u00b6 51.] Neither the Debtor (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Gouletas) nor any creditor, objected to the Bankruptcy Trustee's motion or the proposed sale. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After notice to all interested parties and after hearing before the bankruptcy court, the bankruptcy court entered its Order Authorizing Sale of Personal Property on August 18, 2017. [11, at \u00b6 52; 11-1, at 88-90.] Again, neither the Debtor nor any creditor objected to the order of sale or appealed the order of sale. [11, at \u00b6 52.] On September 13, 2017, the Bankruptcy Trustee and a representative of Plaintiff executed the Assignment of Claims and Causes of Action, thereby purporting to transfer the Bankruptcy Trustee's litigation claims and alter-ego claims to Plaintiff. [11-1, at 91-94.] All conditions precedent to recovery by Plaintiff have been performed or have occurred. [11, at \u00b6 53.]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff claims to have standing to bring these claims under Section 544(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code as the assignee of the Bankruptcy Trustee. Defendants respond that the Bankruptcy Trustee lacked authority to assign his rights and powers to avoid and recover alleged fraudulent transfers under that Section of the Bankruptcy Code. Section 544(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \"\n   <em>\n    the trustee\n   </em>\n   may avoid any transfer of interest of the debtor in property or any obligation incurred by the debtor that is voidable under applicable law by a creditor holding an unsecured claim that is allowable under section 502 of this title or that is not allowable only under section 502(e) of this title.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added). According to Defendants, the plain language of Section 544 establishes that a bankruptcy trustee cannot assign his rights and powers to avoid and recover alleged fraudulent transfers because the statute specifically grants the power to \"the trustee.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has not addressed the issue, on which courts are split. Some courts have held that fraudulent transfer claims are property of the estate and therefore can be sold pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. See,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3818472,3688277\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/608/253/\">\n    608 F.3d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (5th Cir. 2010). Other courts-persuaded by the plain language argument advanced by Defendants here-have held that a bankruptcy trustee cannot assign avoidance actions brought under the Bankruptcy Code.

N.D. Ga. 2000). Defendants rely on the latter category of cases to argue that Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue the state-law actions that it seeks to bring in this case. These courts reason that because the Bankruptcy Code confers authority to avoid transfers on the bankruptcy trustee alone, there is no statutory authority for allowing assignees to bring avoidance actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court takes no position on this split of authority at this time, as Defendants have not established that the Court has jurisdiction collaterally to review the bankruptcy court's order approving the assignment of Plaintiff's claims as\n   a sale under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Court. The bankruptcy court already approved the assignment of the fraudulent transfer claims at issue pursuant to Section 363. [11-1.] An \"order approving a bankruptcy sale is a judicial order and can be attacked collaterally only within the tight limits that Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) imposes on collateral attacks on civil judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    FutureSource LLC v.

Defendants have not identified any authority for this Court to collaterally review the order of the bankruptcy court. If Defendants believe the Court has such authority in this case or Defendants contend that the Court can reach the issue without collaterally reviewing the bankruptcy court sale order, they may again move for dismissal. However, given the case law limiting the ability to collaterally attack a bankruptcy sale order, the Court denies Defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

[32, at 2; 62, at 3-5.] Plaintiff challenges the transfers to Defendants Paul and Jones under Section 5(a)(1) of the IUFTA, which is the \"fraud in fact\" provision. \" 'Fraud in fact' occurs when a debtor makes a transfer 'with the intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Spatz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356192\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/222/157/#p160\">\n    222 B.R. 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160 (N.D.

Although Paul raised this argument for the first time in his reply, Plaintiff preemptively addressed the argument in his response brief. The Court therefore will address the argument now. The Court agrees that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that Gouletas acted with fraudulent intent in relation to the transfer to Paul. As noted by Defendants, allegations of fraud must be plead with particularity. The only allegations in the amended complaint relating\n   to Paul or any transfer to Paul are (1) that Paul is a citizen of the State of California who engaged in the wrongful conduct within the State of Illinois [11, at \u00b6 6.7]; and (2) that he is liable to Plaintiff for a $ 110,000 transfer on January 21, 2015 [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 60(e), 83(d) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff argues that he has alleged each badge of fraud. However, he does not do so with respect to Paul and the challenged transfer to Paul. For example, although Plaintiff alleges that there were a number of transfers to insiders, Plaintiff does not allege that Paul was an insider. By way of another example, although Plaintiff alleges that Gouletas maintained possession and control over the money in Touris's checking accounts, Plaintiff does not allege that Gouletas maintained possession and control over the money transferred to Paul. Although Plaintiff alleges that Gouletas had been sued before the subject transfers to Paul and that Gouletas was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made, the specific factual allegations relating to Defendant Paul do not indicate that the main or only purpose of the transfer was to prevent a lawful creditor from collecting a debt. Accordingly, the Court grants Defendant Paul's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's fraudulent transfer claim (Count I) against him without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    ii.

Gouletas concealed that the money transferred to Jones was his by funneling the money through 800 SWP.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Gouletas represented that the transfer to Jones was for a previous debt, Plaintiff alleges that was not true. And Gouletas had been sued before the transfer to Jones. Finally, as discussed below, Gouletas was insolvent at the time of the alleged transfer. Although Plaintiff has not alleged all of the relevant badges of fraud, making all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff has alleged enough badges of fraud to establish that Gouletas acted with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors with respect to his transfers to Jones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    iii. Touris\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiff also sufficiently alleges that Gouletas acted with fraudulent intent in relation to the challenged transfers to Touris. The parties dispute whether Touris was an insider.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, Plaintiff sufficiently\n   has alleged enough other badges of fraud irrespective of the insider factor to establish that Gouletas acted with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors in relation to the challenged transfers to Touris. As with the property transferred to Jones, Gouletas retained control over the property transferred to Touris and was able to direct how Touris used the transferred property (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , to pay Gouletas's expenses, to pay Gouletas's son, etc.). Gouletas concealed that the money transferred to Touris was his bye funneling the money through other parties (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 800 SWP and Jones). Gouletas had been sued before the transfers to Touris. And Gouletas was insolvent at the time of the alleged transfers. Although Plaintiff has not alleged all of the relevant badges of fraud, making all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff has alleged enough badges of fraud to establish that Gouletas acted with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors with respect to his transfers to Touris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

The IUFTA further provides that \"[a] debtor who is generally not paying his debts as they become due is presumed to be insolvent.\" 740 ILCS 160/3(b). Jones concedes that Plaintiff sufficiently has alleged the third element, but argues that Plaintiff fails sufficiently to allege the first and second elements of its Section 6(a) claim.

[11, at \u00b6 6.5.] Plaintiff further alleges that Gouletas was able to divert funds from 800 SWP ultimately to be used by Gouletas. Although Plaintiff does not allege that Gouletas himself transferred funds to Jones, the IUFTA does not require a direct transfer. The IUFTA defines \"transfer\" as meaning \"every mode,\n   <em>\n    direct or indirect\n   </em>\n   , absolute or conditional, voluntary or involuntary, of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset, and includes payment of money, release, lease, and creation of a lien or other encumbrance.\" 740 Ill.

Although Plaintiff alleges that \"Gouletas made the Cash Transfers without receiving a reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the transfers[,]\" [11 at \u00b6 79], such conclusory allegations are insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. \"The Seventh Circuit has held that, in order to evaluate whether a transfer is fraudulent under the IUFTA, a court should 'determine the value of what was transferred and * * * compare it to what was received.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11976212\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/966/746/#p750\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Creditor's Comm. of Jumer's Castle Lodge, Inc. v.

Without more factual allegations from Plaintiff, the Court is unable to engage in such an analysis. To the extent that Plaintiff contends that the challenged transfers were provided in exchange for nothing, Plaintiff should so allege. Because Plaintiff has not done so, however, the Court grants Defendant Jones's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Section 6(a) claim against him without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   That leaves Defendant Touris's argument that Plaintiff fails sufficiently to allege that Gouletas was insolvent at the time of the transfers to her or that he became insolvent as a result of the transfers to her. Under the IUFTA, \"[a] debtor is insolvent if the sum of the debtor's debts is greater than all of the debtor's assets at a fair valuation.\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 160/3(a). Furthermore, under the IUFTA, \"[a] debtor who is generally not paying his debts as they become due is presumed to be insolvent.\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 160/3(b). Generally, insolvency is a fact-intensive intensive not properly resolved on a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    In re BMT-NW Acquisition, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12421552\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/846/#p858\">\n    582 B.R. 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 858 (Bankr. D. Del. 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that-before the challenged transfers were made-\"Gouletas had been sued and threatened with further suits, numerous judgments had been entered against him, and [he] was insolvent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   [11, at \u00b6 23.] Furthermore, attached to Plaintiff's amended complaint is a balance sheet purporting to represent the Gouletas's net worth as of February 28, 2014, indicating that Gouletas had a negative net worth of $ (12,132,646).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   [11-1, at 54-55.] Touris argues that the Court should not consider the exhibit because it is cited in the amended complaint in reference to Gouletas's representation regarding the value of the Parking Lot and any related indebtedness. However, under Rule 10(c), \"[a] copy of a written instrument that is an exhibit to a pleading is a part of the pleading for all purposes.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 10(c). Accordingly, the Court can consider the exhibit in ruling on Touris's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Touris also challenges the import of the February 28, 2014 balance sheet. Specifically, Touris argues that the fact that Gouletas was insolvent on February 28, 2014 does not mean that Gouletas was insolvent when he made the challenged transfers to Touris in 2015. Although the Court recognizes that possibility, drawing all reasonable inferences in Plaintiff's favor, Plaintiff sufficiently has alleged that Gouletas was insolvent at the time he made the challenged transfers to Touris. Plaintiff alleges that Gouletas became insolvent before the challenged transfers. [11, at \u00b6 23.] The February 28, 2014 balance sheet indicating that Gouletas had a negative net worth of $ (12,132,646) supports that assertion. [11-1, at 54-55.] Although it is possible that Gouletas was able to again become solvent by 2015, the Court finds that unlikely given his January 16, 2017 bankruptcy filing. In light of these facts-and Plaintiff's allegations that Gouletas was hiding assets through the alleged schemes through the time he filed for bankruptcy-it is reasonable to infer that Gouletas remained insolvent from February 28, 2014 until he filed for bankruptcy. And because insolvency is a fact-intensive issue not properly resolved on a motion to dismiss, the Court concludes that Plaintiff sufficiently has alleged that Gouletas was insolvent at the time of the challenged transfers. The Court therefore denies Touris's motion to dismiss Plaintiff's Section 6(a) claim for failure sufficiently to allege insolvency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

Touris argues that Plaintiff fails sufficiently to allege that Touris acted with the requisite knowledge and intent. The Court disagrees. Plaintiff alleges that Touris (and 800 SWP, HBI, and Does 1-10) \"were aware of their roles in\" Gouletas's scheme. Although this allegation recites the second element of Plaintiff's aiding and abetting claim, as discussed above, \"[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of a person's mind\" can be alleged generally. Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b). Furthermore, Plaintiff alleges that Touris allowed hundreds of thousands of dollars to be deposited into her checking accounts for payment of a friend's expenses. It is unclear how such conduct is consistent with lawful conduct on the part of Gouletas. Under such circumstances, it is reasonable to infer that Touris knew of her role in Gouletas's scheme when she provided the assistance.

For example, Plaintiff cites to\n    <em>\n     Mamacita, Inc. v. Colborne Acquisition Co., LLC\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20881654\">\n     2011 WL 881654\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7 (N.D.

Because\n    <em>\n     General Electric\n    </em>\n    preceded\n    <em>\n     Twombly\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Iqbal\n    </em>\n    , its discussion of the relevant pleading standard is of limited persuasiveness. Regardless,\n    <em>\n     General Electric\n    </em>\n    actually did apply Rule 9(b) to a claim brought under the IUFTA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Plaintiff also has identified additional factual allegations regarding the transfers to Defendant Jones that Plaintiff contends he could add to any second amended complaint. If Plaintiff elects to file a second amended complaint, Plaintiff may do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Jones also argues that Plaintiff fails sufficiently to allege that Gouletas was the one who made the transfer to him, citing to his argument that Plaintiff's Section 6(a) claim should be dismissed for failure sufficiently to allege alter ego liability. However, as discussed below, Jones has not met his burden-as the party moving for dismissal-of proving that no alter ego claim has been stated. Jones is free to raise this argument again in any future dispositive motion. However, if Jones chooses to do so, he should cite to the relevant legal standard for establishing alter ego liability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that Touris is a \"close and personal friend of Gouletas\" for over 40 years who \"acted as a 'managing agent' of Gouletas for the handling, use and distribution of his funds[.]\" [11, at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 57.] Touris argues that these allegations are insufficient to establish that she was an \"insider\" as defined in the IUFTA. The IUFTA defines \"insider\" to include \"a managing agent of the debtor.\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 160/2(g)(5). Touris argues that such a relationship only can exist in the formal corporate or partnership context. However, Touris does not cite to any cases discussing what it means to be an \"insider\" under the IUFTA. The definition of the term \"insider\" under the IUFTA does include categories of parties that qualify as insiders depending on whether the debtor is \"an individual,\" \"a corporation,\" or \"a partnership.\" 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 160/2(g)(1), (2), (3). But there is no indication that \"a managing agent\" only can be an insider for one of those types of debtors. The Court need not decide the issue, however, as Plaintiff has alleged other badges of fraud sufficient to establish that Gouletas acted with the actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud the creditors with respect to his transfers to Touris.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Jones faults Plaintiff for not adequately responding to his argument that Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged alter ego liability.

Robert Bosch Tool Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201576696\">\n     2004 WL 1576696\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *1 (N.D. Ill. July 13, 2004).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Indeed, it is notable that Touris does not cite to any cases granting a motion to dismiss for failure sufficiently to allege insolvency under the IUFTA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Touris argues that the February 28, 2014 balance sheet cannot trump inconsistent facts in the amended complaint. Specifically, Touris argues that the negative net worth of $ (12,132,646) reflected on the February 28, 2014 balance sheet is inconsistent with Plaintiff's allegation that Gouletas had a positive net worth of $ 25,287,560 as of March 31, 2013, as reflected on a balance sheet signed by Gouletas. However, Plaintiff explains part of that substantial decrease in net worth-the over $ 12,000,000 judgments against Gouletas. Regardless, there are numerous explanations as to why Gouletas's net worth decreased. For example, the amended complaint references anticipated real estate deals. Perhaps a substantial real estate deal fell through, causing a substantial decrease in Gouletas's net worth. Touris further can explore this issue through discovery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Plaintiff also alleges that, \"from October of 2008 to the present, Gouletas was generally not paying all of his debts as they became due, forcing his unfavored creditors to either abandon their claims, or seek collection of those debts through the judicial system.\" [\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at \u00b6 9.] Plaintiff argues that this allegation is sufficient to invoke the presumption that a debtor is insolvent found in 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann. 160/3(b). Although that provision provides that \"[a] debtor who is generally not paying his debts as they become due is presumed to be insolvent,\" it is not clear to the Court that the presumption still would apply even though the amended complaint also alleges that the debtor \"had a substantial net worth\" during the same time period. [11, at \u00b6 9.] Still, Plaintiff otherwise has alleged that Gouletas was insolvent at the time of the challenged transfers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Count VII of the amended complaint is titled \"Tortious Interference With Expectancy of Collection Upon Judgments Against Gouletas.\" [11, at 33.] Touris characterized Plaintiff's claim as a claim for tortious interference with a prospective economic advantage. Defendant does not contest this characterization.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    It is unclear to the Court whether Touris contends that Rule 9(b)'s heightened pleading standard applies to Plaintiff's tortious interference claim. Regardless, Plaintiff has not even alleged sufficient facts to satisfy Rule 8's notice pleading requirements.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
