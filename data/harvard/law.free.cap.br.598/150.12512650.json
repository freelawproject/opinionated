Miller, in his capacity as Chapter 7 trustee (the \"Plaintiff\" or \"Trustee\"), brought this adversary proceeding against former managers, officers and members of debtors W.J. Bradley Company Merchant Partners 2003-SEED (\"WJB SEED\"), W.J. Bradley Mortgage Capital, LLC (\"WJB Mortgage Capital\"), W.J. Bradley Corporate Services, LLC (\"WJB Corporate Services\"), W.J. Bradley Financial Services, LLC (\"WJB Financial Services\"), and WJB Mortgage Services, LLC (\"WJB Mortgage Services,\" and collectively, the \"Debtors\"). The management of the Debtors included William J. Bradley (\"Bradley\"), Joseph A. Cambi (\"Cambi\"), Arthur S. Demoulas (\"Demoulas\"), Gerard Levins (\"Levins\"), Audrey Kirdar (\"Kirdar\"), Daniel Baruch (\"Baruch\"), Howard Michalski (\"Michalski\"), and Peter Picknelly (\"Picknelly\"). The Trustee additionally brought this action against several entities affiliated with certain of the former managers and officers, including ASD Merchant Partners, LLC (\"ASD\"), Springfield Capital, LLC (\"Springfield\"), Arthur S. Demoulas Continuation Trust (\"ASD Continuation Trust\"), and Arthur S. Demoulas 2012 Trust (\"ASD 2012 Trust,\" and collectively with all the non-Debtor parties, the \"Defendants\"). The Trustee claims that through various fraudulent and preferential transfers, the Defendants exhausted the Debtors' assets and drove the company into insolvency for their own benefit and in breach of their fiduciary duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the nine-count complaint (the \"Complaint\") pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable by Bankruptcy Rule 7012 (the \"Motion\" or \"Motions\"). There are four Motions on behalf of the Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1334.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 8, 21. In 2007 and 2008, as a result of the housing crisis, the Debtors entered a restructuring process, during which ASD, which Defendant Demoulas owned, acquired a 65% controlling interest in the Debtors. Compl. \u00b6 21. After ASD's acquisition, Bradley, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Debtors and a member of the Debtors' Board of Managers (the \"Board\"), and Cambi, the Chairman of the Board, shared control of the Debtors with Demoulas, a member of the Board and the Manager of ASD. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-11, 21. Bradley and Cambi regretted losing control of the Debtors and entering into a partnership with Demoulas. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Redemption Transaction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2014, Demoulas decided to sell his interest in the Debtors. Compl. \u00b6 26. The Board proposed a transaction in which Demoulas would sell his interest to the Blackstone Group (\"Blackstone\"). Compl. \u00b6 27. Blackstone rejected the deal in January 2015, expressing concerns with the Debtors' high costs, limited growth capabilities and ownership. Compl. \u00b6 28. The collapse of the Blackstone deal was of great concern to Bradley and Cambi. Compl. \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Around February 2015, Bradley and Cambi discussed the possibility of Bradley, Cambi or the Debtors buying Demoulas's interest. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-32. Demoulas agreed to sell his interest to Cambi for $ 25 million. Compl. \u00b6 32. Bradley, Cambi, and Demoulas initially structured the transaction so that Springfield, a limited liability company (\"LLC\") controlled by Cambi, would purchase ASD's 65% interest in the Debtors for $ 25 million. Compl. \u00b6 37. On April 2, 2015, Springfield, ASD, and the Debtors entered into the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement (\"MIPA\"), which detailed the transaction's terms. Compl. \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the course of negotiating the MIPA, the Board received legal advice and a presentation from Houlihan Lokey regarding the value of the Debtors. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-42. In March 2015, Houlihan Lokey valued the Debtors at about $ 26.6 million. Compl. \u00b6 41. Based on this valuation, ASD's 65% interest was worth just over $ 17 million. Compl. \u00b6 41. Bradley wrote an email to the Debtors' attorneys on September 3, 2015, which discussed the Debtors' ability to redeem ASD's 65% interest if Springfield failed to secure funding for the transaction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-23\">\n   I don't believe that the ASD stock is worth more than $ 17.55M. [Cambi] agreed to offer $ 25M because he believed [Demoulas] wouldn't take less. There is no way that this [B]oard, based on [Houlihan Lokey's valuation], should approve the [Debtors] signing up for liability on [the] transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 42. Bradley shared a similarly worded email with Cambi and his attorneys on September 6, 2015:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   In no case could the company's balance sheet support a financing for $ 25M.... If Springfield felt it could come over the top with it's [sic] own contribution ... that is certainly it's [sic] right .... But for the company to represent it could achieve a price that far over market ... is ... an obnoxious proposition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Compl. \u00b6 46. The parties negotiated the deal between Springfield and ASD for eight months, but the deal never closed. Compl. \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the Springfield-ASD deal collapsed in September 2015, the Debtors decided to redeem ASD's entire membership interest (the \"Redemption Transaction\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-46. Despite ongoing negotiations between Bradley, Cambi, and Demoulas, the price for the Redemption Transaction remained set at the $ 25 million purchase price proposed for the Springfield-ASD transaction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, 55. Bradley provided updates on the negotiations to all the Board members through email. Compl. \u00b6 50. Levins and Kirdar, who ASD appointed to the Board, did not question the redemption price. Compl. \u00b6 73. Yet, Cambi remarked on November 10, 2015, that the Debtors were \"putting every penny on the line getting ASD\" the $ 25 million. Compl. \u00b6 48. Baruch and Michalski, the Chief Operating Officer and Executive Managing Director of the Debtors, respectively, did not intervene in the negotiations. Compl. \u00b6 70. The Board approved the Redemption Transaction, which closed on December 9, 2015. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 51, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Pursuant to the Redemption Transaction, WJB SEED transferred a total of $ 25 million in five separate transactions to Demoulas, the ASD Continuation Trust, and the ASD 2012 Trust on December 9, 2015. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 55-56. WJB SEED funded the Redemption Transaction by using $ 16 million of the Debtors' capital and a $ 9 million \"capital contribution\" from Springfield.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n to Defs.' Mots. 25; Bradley/Baruch/Michalski Br. 20-21. The Redemption Transaction also included a Waiver and Mutual Release, which released various claims in connection with the Redemption Transaction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 57-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Shortly after the Redemption Transaction closed, the Debtors' financial condition rapidly and severely deteriorated. Compl. \u00b6 61. The Debtors were thinly capitalized prior to the Redemption Transaction, and the use of corporate assets to fund the redemption left the Debtors with limited cash to operate. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 61. On December 29, 2015, less than one month after the Redemption Transaction, Cambi and Bradley started discussing methods to conceal the Debtors' cash problems. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. By January 2016, the Debtors had \"virtually no cash flow\" and were \"in the midst of collapsing.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Thus, the Debtors filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy on April 28, 2016 (the \"Petition Date\"). The filing was for liquidation, not restructuring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Other Transactions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Several transfers, in addition to the transfers associated with the Redemption Transaction, occurred prior to the Petition Date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Board Fees to Demoulas and Cambi\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Debtors paid board fees to Demoulas and Cambi in the two years prior to the Petition Date. Compl. Ex. B-C. On October 1, 2012, the Board raised the annual board fees of Demoulas and Cambi from $ 60,000 to $ 250,000. Compl. \u00b6 80. Then in 2013, Demoulas and Cambi received an additional annual board fee increase from $ 250,000 to $ 750,000. Compl. \u00b6 81. Thus, from June 2014 to October 2015, the Debtors paid Demoulas and Cambi $ 187,500 in quarterly fees, for a total of $ 1,312,500 each (the \"Board Fees\"). Compl. Ex. B-C. Cambi said the Board Fees were \"absolutely essential\" for him \"to live the lifestyle he wished to live.\" Compl. \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Bonuses Provided to Levins and Kirdar\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On October 1, 2015, the Debtors paid Kirdar and Levins each a bonus of $ 86,250 for their work on the Redemption Transaction (the \"Kirdar Bonus\" and the \"Levins Bonus,\" respectively). Compl. \u00b6 88. As members of the Board, Levins and Kirdar received information about the negotiations involving the Redemption Transaction. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 85. However,\n   Levins and Kirdar never participated in the negotiations and did not question the $ 25 million redemption price. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 73, 85.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    The Trustee has demanded a trial by jury and does not consent to the Court's entry of a final judgment.

The Complaint alleges that Defendants Bradley and Cambi breached their duty of loyalty because they were motivated to close the Redemption Transaction to remove Defendant Demoulas from the Board rather than to advance the Debtors' best interests; Defendant Cambi also approved and accepted Board Fees. The Complaint alleges that Defendants Levins and Kirdar breached their duty of loyalty by abdicating their managerial responsibilities by rubberstamping the Redemption Transaction and accepting their bonuses. The Complaint also alleges that Defendant Baruch and Michalski breached their duty of loyalty by failing to take affirmative action ensuring that the Redemption Transaction was in the Debtors' best interests. The Complaint asserts that the Defendants breached the duty of care through their gross negligence in negotiating and approving the Redemption Transaction. Indeed, the very facts alleged give rise to the highly plausible claim that Defendants breached their duties of care.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    The Redemption Transaction closed on December 9, 2015. Within a month, the Debtors lacked sufficient cash flow and were \"in the midst of collapsing.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. Less than five months later, the Debtors filed for relief under Chapter 7.

Compl. \u00b6 41. The Trustee further alleges\n    that on September 6, 2015, Defendant Bradley sent an email to Defendant Cambi and their attorneys writing\n    <em>\n     inter alia\n    </em>\n    that \"[i]n no case could the company's balance sheet support a financing for $ 25M....

The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties. As an officer or manager of a LLC, the Defendants' fiduciary duties are governed by the Operating Agreement. Thus, a director's, officer's or manager's fiduciary duties may be contained in the Operating Agreement and so the Operating Agreement should be the point of departure for a Trustee claiming breaches of fiduciary duties. If no exculpatory clauses exist, the Trustee should then look to the traditional triad duties. In drafting the Complaint, the Trustee knew the Debtors were LLCs.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 8 (\"Each of the [five] WJB entities [were] a Delaware Limited Liability Company.\"). It would be judicially uneconomic for the Court to consider the Trustee's breach of fiduciary duty claims without considering the Operating Agreement. Where the LLC Operating Agreement explicitly limits or bars the defendants' liability for certain breaches, but the document was not attached to the complaint, the Court would be required to deny the motion to dismiss. The parties then would engage in discovery and the Court would consider the same issue on a motion for summary judgment with discovery yielding no new necessary facts. In this case the Trustee is on notice of the Operating Agreement. The Trustee not only cites to the Operating Agreement but specifically alleges that the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by being grossly negligent and/or committing willful misconduct.

Taking all of the allegations in the Complaint as true, the Trustee has alleged sufficient facts to support a claim for the breach of fiduciary duties because the Operating Agreement does not permit the exact breaches of which the Trustee complains. The Defendants are only protected from any liability other than gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Complaint sufficiently alleges that the Defendants' actions may have constituted liability outside the scope of the exculpatory provisions.

If this is true, then the Defendants' authorization of the Redemption Transaction did not constitute corporate waste. They paid $ 16 million for ASD's 65% interest worth about $ 17 million. However, the Trustee makes a sound point in his opposition: \"[e]ven accepting Defendants' contention that Springfield made a $ 9 million contribution\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      in return for capital in the company\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n    , those funds still constitute property of the Debtors.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18. This insider fact gives rise to a reasonable inference that the Redemption Transaction may have been grossly amiss when considering the totality of the allegations. Second, the Complaint adequately shows that the entire $ 25 million was transferred by WJB SEED for ASD's 65% interest. As it stands, the Trustee sufficiently pled facts showing corporate waste given that a Debtor entity paid $ 25 million for an interest worth $ 17 million and the Debtors became cashflow insolvent within a month of the transaction's closing. However, further discovery into the Redemption Transaction, and specifically further inquiry into the source of the $ 25 million that the Debtor WJB SEED paid, is warranted.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The Trustee sufficiently alleges facts showing that Defendant Cambi's Board Fees may constitute waste.

The Trustee alleges that Defendants Levins and Kirdar were paid a one-time bonus of $ 86,250 on October 1, 2015 in connection with their role (or lack thereof) in the Redemption Transaction.

Moreover, a plaintiff's request for leave to amend a complaint is improper without indicating the particular grounds on which amendment is sought.\n    <em>\n     Mackereth v.

Furthermore, had the Trustee attached a draft amended complaint to his response, the propriety of his movement to amend would have been strengthened, though not dispositive.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3698218,6052871\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/728/228/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-168\">\n    Furthermore, the Trustee had the opportunity to amend his Complaint within 21 days when he received service of the Defendants' Rule 12(b) Motions. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(1)(B). The Trustee was on notice of the possibly deficient Complaint but opted to oppose the Motions instead of amend. The Court will deny the Trustee's request for leave to amend based on procedural infirmities. The Court is not making a finding of undue delay, bad faith, a dilatory motive, prejudice or futility. Rather, the Court finds that a request for leave to amend a complaint that is merely embedded in a footnote of an omnibus opposition memorandum to motions to dismiss is improper.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-169\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants in part and denies in part the Defendants' Motions to Dismiss without prejudice.
