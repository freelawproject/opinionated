INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   This adversary proceeding was commenced by the filing of a Notice of Removal by Prudential Savings Bank (\"Prudential\"). Through the Notice, Prudential removed to this court an action pending in the Court of Common Pleas, Philadelphia County (\"the C.P. Court\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The removed action consists primarily of \"lender liability\" claims asserted by Island View Crossing II, L.P., the debtor in this chapter 11 case (\"the Debtor\"), but also includes certain claims against Prudential asserted by two non-debtors, Renato J. Gualtieri and Francesco Gualtieri and Prudential's counterclaims against those nondebtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In this Memorandum, I will refer to the state court action, prior to its removal, as \"the Lender Liability Lawsuit\" and, after its removal to this court, as \"the AP.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Presently before the court in the AP is the court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   consideration of the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction in this adversary proceeding and the potential remand to the C.P. Court of the claims between the non-debtor parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (authorizing the remand of removed claims).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The parties were given both notice of the court's jurisdictional concerns by order dated November 13, 2018 and the opportunity to brief and argue the issue. The parties' last memorandum was filed on January 10, 2019.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   For the reasons stated below, I will:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1. remand all claims filed by non-debtor parties against other non-debtors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2. dismiss without prejudice certain removed claims filed by and against the Debtor as duplicative of matters already asserted in this adversary proceeding or as more properly determined through the claims allowance process;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3. deny the request for a stay of the remand order;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   4. deny, without prejudice, the requests for a stay of pending state court proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   To understand the jurisdictional issues presented, it is necessary to review the somewhat complicated procedural history that preceded the removal of the Lender Liability Lawsuit to the bankruptcy court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The underlying litigation arises out of the pre-bankruptcy breakdown in the lender-borrower relationship between Prudential and the Debtor, an entity involved in real estate development. The parties' respective positions are conventional: Prudential asserts that the Debtor breached its repayment obligation as well as other duties under the loan documents, while the Debtor asserts that Prudential breached the implied duty of good faith or other contractual obligations, giving rise to \"lender liability\" claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   For present purposes, it is sufficient to observe that the parties' dispute resulted in two (2) separate lawsuits in the C.P. Court that preceded the Debtor's bankruptcy filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Lava Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The first of the two (2) relevant lawsuits was commenced by a different lender, Lava Funding, LLC (\"Lava\"), against the Debtor, the Debtor's principal Renato J. Gualtieri (\"Renato\"), Renato's father, Francesco Gualtieri (\"Francesco\"), and Prudential.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   I will refer to this action as \"the Lava Lawsuit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Lava Lawsuit seeks collection of a loan that Lava made to the Debtor. The loan was guaranteed by Renato and Francesco. Lava named Prudential as one of the defendants based on the theory that Lava made its loan to the Debtor in reliance on Prudential's promise to refinance the loan. Lava alleged that Prudential breached that promise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In the Lava Lawsuit, the Debtor, Renato, and Francesco filed a cross-claim against Prudential, also asserting that Prudential reneged on its agreement to refinance the Lava loan. In response, Prudential filed a cross-claim against the Debtor, Renato, and Francesco. I will refer to the cross-claim of Renato and Francesco against Prudential and Prudential's cross-claim against Renato and Francesco collectively as \"the Non-Debtor Cross-claims.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In June 2016, Lava filed a praecipe to discontinue the Lava Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   By an order entered in April 2017 (apparently\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   ), the C.P. Court \"re-opened\" the Lava Lawsuit, but only as to Prudential's cross-claim (with no mention of the cross-claim that the Debtor, Renato, and Francesco filed against Prudential). Then, in June 2017, the C.P. Court entered an order consolidating the Lava Lawsuit (consisting at that point, presumably, only of Prudential's cross-claim against the Debtor, Renato, and Francesco) with a second lawsuit, the Lender Liability Lawsuit (that was later removed to this court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Lender Liability Lawsuit\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Debtor and Renato commenced the Lender Liability Lawsuit against Prudential in March 2016. In this lawsuit, in response to the lender liability claims asserted by the plaintiffs, Prudential filed nine (9) counterclaims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   some against both the Debtor and Renato and some against Renato only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On July 18, 2017, eighteen (18) days after the commencement of the Debtor's bankruptcy case, Prudential removed the Lender Liability Lawsuit (which had been consolidated with what remained of the Lava Lawsuit) to this court, initiating the present AP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After the removal, the AP was dormant for some time. Initially, the Debtor and Prudential focused their efforts on litigating their competing motions in the main bankruptcy case: the Debtor's Motion for Post-Petition Financing and Prudential's Motion to Convert Case or Appoint a Trustee. That litigation resulted in the denial of the Debtor's request for debtor-in-possession financing and the grant of Prudential's motion for appointment of a chapter 11 trustee by order dated December 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Pursuant to the December 18, 2017 order, and after an election, on January 30, 2018, the U.S. Trustee appointed Kevin O'Halloran (\"the Trustee\") as the chapter 11 trustee in this case. After the appointment of the Trustee, all parties tacitly agreed that they would defer litigation in the adversary proceeding while the Trustee and interested parties focused on other, more pressing matters of case administration. Also, the special counsel retained by the Trustee to handle the AP needed time to review the already lengthy record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On November 13, 2018, I entered an order requesting that the parties in the AP submit their respective suggestions for a pretrial management order. The order also alerted the parties to the jurisdictional issue presently before the court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Renato's Claim Against Prudential Asserted in the Lender Liability Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The first jurisdictional issue involves Renato's claim against Prudential, filed in the Lender Liability Lawsuit. Under the\n   <em>\n    Pacor\n   </em>\n   test, the question is whether the determination of Renato's claim against Prudential could have any effect on bankruptcy administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Trustee (alone among the parties) argues that this court has jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims of Renato against Prudential. As the party invoking the jurisdiction of the court, the Trustee has the burden of establishing the existence of jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Nuveen Mun.

Moreover, adjudication of Gualtieri's claims in a forum other than the Bankruptcy Court could conceivably have a collateral estoppel effect on the claims and rights of the Debtor in this action, as well as on the administration of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   (Trustee's Memorandum at 2) (footnote omitted) (Adv. No. 17-202, Doc. # 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Respectfully, I disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Initially, I fail to see how Renato's status as a guarantor of the Prudential loans matters when evaluating Renato's claims against Prudential. In the AP, Renato asserts an\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     affirmative claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   against Prudential for whatever damages he can prove that he personally suffered as a result Prudential's alleged misconduct. If he succeeds in the litigation, he may recover money from Prudential or, perhaps, reduce his liability as guarantor of Prudential's claim against the bankruptcy estate. Either way, the rights of the bankruptcy estate against Prudential are unaffected by the outcome of Renato's dispute with Prudential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Even if the Renato-Prudential portion of the litigation merely resulted in a reduction of Renato's liability as a guarantor and was then followed by Renato's payment to Prudential in partial or total satisfaction of the remaining liability, the impact on the bankruptcy estate would likely be\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As my former colleague Judge Fox observed, if a guarantor pays on a guarantee of a claim held by a creditor against the bankruptcy estate, the payment will reduce the creditor's claim against the estate; however, the guarantor typically is subrogated to the rights of the creditor. The net effect on the claims against the estate is therefore neutral; the only change is the substitution of one (1) creditor for another.\n   <em>\n    New Era\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6439965\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/201/382/#p391\">\n    201 B.R. at 394-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   That said, I recognize that\n   <em>\n    New Era\n   </em>\n   was a chapter 7 case in which the identity of the claimants may be less relevant than in a chapter 11 case in which the goal of the trustee (or debtor-in-possession) is to obtain confirmation of a plan based on the\n   acceptance of impaired classes entitled to vote. In the chapter 11 context, the identity of the creditor may matter in connection with plan voting. Thus, there may be chapter 11 cases in which the creditor's identity matters enough to justify the exercise of \"related to\" jurisdiction with regard to an action between a creditor and guarantor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   At first blush, one might think that the substitution of Renato (the principal of the Debtor who, following the appointment of the chapter 11 trustee, lost control of the Debtor) as creditor in lieu of Prudential (the \"hostile\" creditor who pressed for the appointment of a trustee) might better facilitate confirmation of a chapter 11 plan. However, as counterintuitive as it may be, in the circumstances presented here, I doubt that the substitution of Renato for Prudential would be material. Even though Prudential is a defendant in the AP, it nonetheless is working cooperatively with the Trustee to develop the Debtor's real estate project; the success of that project is in the in the interest of all parties. I fail to see, and the Trustee has not articulated, how the substitution of Renato for Prudential as a creditor would likely impact case administration in any tangible way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Trustee's concerns about the potential application of collateral estoppel have more force. But, in the end, this argument, too, is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Presumably, the Trustee foresees the following (from his perspective, nightmare) scenario: the bankruptcy court remands Renato's claim against Prudential; Renato litigates his claims in state court more quickly than the Trustee litigates his claims against Prudential in this court;\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Renato loses in state court; Prudential then asserts in this court that the state court's factual findings or mixed fact-law determinations, (which, in this hypothetical, were adverse to Renato and favorable to Prudential), preclude the Trustee from litigating those matters in the bankruptcy court on behalf of the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    Pacor\n   </em>\n   , the seminal case on \"related to\" jurisdiction, discussed this very issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Pacor\n   </em>\n   , an asbestos defendant (Pacor) removed an action to federal court on the ground that it was related to the pending Johns-Manville bankruptcy case. Pacor theorized that if the asbestos plaintiff prevailed, Pacor could assert an indemnity claim against the Johns-Manville estate. The Third Circuit rejected this argument, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Our examination of the Higgins-Pacor-Manville controversy leads us to conclude that the primary action between Higgins and Pacor would have no effect on the Manville bankruptcy estate, and therefore is not \"related to\" [the Manville] bankruptcy within the meaning of section 1471(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   At best, it is a mere precursor to the potential third party claim for indemnification by Pacor against Manville. Yet the outcome of the Higgins-Pacor action would in no way bind Manville, in that it could not determine any rights, liabilities, or course of action of the debtor.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Since Manville is not a party to the Higgins-Pacor action, it could not be bound by res judicata or collateral estoppel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Pacor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6560377,607691\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/743/984/\">\n    743 F.2d at 995\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   This passage in\n   <em>\n    Pacor\n   </em>\n   states the limitation on the application of collateral estoppel in absolute terms and is probably overbroad.

While it is true that the interests of Renato and the Trustee are aligned, insofar as they agree that Prudential should be held liable for lender misconduct, that, by itself, is insufficient to raise a meaningful specter of prejudice to the bankruptcy estate. \"The Supreme Court has cautioned that an alignment of interests, by itself, is not enough to warrant the application of collateral estoppel to a nonparty to the prior litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Irwin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4187099\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/457/413/#p423\">\n    457 B.R. 413\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423 (Bankr.

Thus, Prudential's view is that both Renato and the Debtor are liable on these debts. If Renato is held liable on any of these guarantees and makes a payment to Prudential, the payment likely will give rise to a subrogation claim in Renato's favor against the bankruptcy estate. This is similar to the situation discussed in Part IV.A.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; while the identity of the creditor changes, the end result regarding the liability of the bankruptcy estate does not. For the reasons expressed earlier, I conclude that the parties have not met their burden of establishing that Prudential's collection efforts against Renato as a co-obligor of the bankruptcy estate may sufficiently impact this bankruptcy case as to support the exercise of bankruptcy jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Consequently, all of the Prudential counterclaims in the Lender Liability Lawsuit will be remanded to the C.P.

The third category appears to authorize the filing of a cross-claim that is not dependent on the existence of liability to the plaintiff, as long as the defendant's claim against the cross-claim-defendant arises out of the same transaction or occurrence as the plaintiff's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stokes v.

Prudential's cross-claim against Renato and Francesco will be remanded to the C.P. Court for lack of jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In the Lava Lawsuit, Prudential named Renato, Francesco, and the Debtor as cross-claim defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   In substance, Prudential's cross-claim against Renato and Francesco falls into the first and second categories of cross-claims described above in Part IV.C.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Essentially, Prudential asserts that\n   Renato and Francesco are solely liable to Lava and that, if Prudential were found liable to Lava, Renato and Francesco were liable over to Prudential.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Before the Lender Liability Lawsuit was removed to this court, this cross-claim apparently was : (a) terminated by the discontinuance of the Lava Lawsuit; (b) revived by the C.P. Court, after it \"reopened\" the discontinued Lava Lawsuit as to Prudential's cross-claim; and (c) consolidated with the Lender Liability Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   I will assume that the representation made by Renato and Francesco in their submission to the court is correct: that Lava discontinued the Lava Lawsuit based on a settlement it reached with Prudential.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   I will further assume that Prudential paid Lava a sum of money as part of the settlement. Thus, through the cross-claim, Prudential seeks repayment from the Debtor, Renato, and Francesco of the money it paid to Lava.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Presently, Prudential has not filed a claim against the bankruptcy estate for any amount that it paid to Lava.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The deadline for filing claims expired on October 11, 2017. However, even if Prudential somehow is able to look to the bankruptcy estate for recompense, its effort to collect from Renato and Francesco will have no effect on the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Once again, I find the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    New Era\n   </em>\n   applicable. If Prudential establishes the bankruptcy estate's, Renato's and Francesco's liability for the money Prudential paid Lava and, more importantly, if Prudential successfully collects from Renato and/or Francesco, the bankruptcy estate's liability to Prudential will be reduced. But given the distinct possibility that Renato and/or Francesco would substitute in for Prudential as a creditor of the bankruptcy estate to the extent of the payment made to Prudential, there may be no net effect on the bankruptcy estate, other than a change in the identity of a creditor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part IV.A.1,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   As the party invoking the jurisdiction of the court with respect to this claim, Prudential has the burden of demonstrating why its claims against Renato and Francesco could affect the bankruptcy estate. That burden has not been met. Therefore, the court lacks jurisdiction over Prudential's cross-claim against Renato and Francesco, requiring remand of those claims to the C.P. Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Renato's and Francesco's cross-claim against Prudential will be remanded to the C.P. Court for lack of jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In the Lava Lawsuit, Renato and Francesco were not just cross-claim defendants,\n   but also cross-claim plaintiffs (along with the Debtor). They asserted a cross-claim against Prudential as part of their joint Answer, New Matter and Cross-Claim, filed in response to Lava's Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Like Prudential's cross-claim, this cross-claim is based on only the first two (2) categories of permissible cross-claims: Renato and Francesco assert that Prudential is solely liable to Lava, jointly liable with them to Lava or liable over to them with respect to Lava's claim. Again, nothing in this cross-claim references an affirmative claim against Prudential arising out of the Lava loan transaction (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , what I have labeled as the third category of cross-claims).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As stated earlier, it is unclear how the C.P. Court's orders affected Renato and Francesco's cross-claim. Perhaps the claim was dismissed when Lava discontinued the Lava Lawsuit and was not revived when that action was re-opened only with regard to Prudential's cross-claim. But, none of this is certain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Renato and Francesco express concern about the limbo status of their Lava Lawsuit cross-claim against Prudential. If both the cross-claims were dismissed through the \"closing\" of the Lava Lawsuit after Lava discontinued its action, on the strength of\n   <em>\n    Ross v. Tomlin\n   </em>\n   , Renato and Francesco assert that the dismissal was erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In any event, neither Renato, Francesco, nor Prudential asserts that the bankruptcy court has jurisdiction over their cross-claim against Prudential. As the party that removed the Lender Liability Lawsuit to this court, Prudential has the burden of demonstrating that this court has jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the resolution of those cross-claims could have some impact on the bankruptcy estate. Prudential does not assert that such jurisdiction exists. Renato and Francesco have not even attempted to show that their cross-claim may affect the bankruptcy estate. Thus, the disposition of the Renato and Francesco cross-claim can be made on the simple basis that no party has presented grounds for the exercise of bankruptcy court jurisdiction, thus requiring that the cross-claim, to the extent that it remains viable, be remanded to the C.P. Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Requests for Stays of the Remanded Matters Are Denied Without Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In his submission to the court, the Trustee asserts that if this court remands\n   non-debtor claims against Prudential, the court should stay the remanded proceedings until conclusion of the AP, in order to make sure that the Trustee suffers no prejudice through the application of collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   For different reasons, Renato and Francesco also request that the court stay all remanded claims. Renato and Francesco point out that there are two (2) related lawsuits pending in the C.P. Court, other than the Lender Liability Lawsuit. They refer to two (2) mortgage foreclosure actions that Prudential filed against Francesco, in which Francesco asserts a counterclaim that is comparable to the cross-claim Francesco asserted in the Lava Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Renato and Francesco request the stay in order to prevent what they characterize as duplicative and costly litigation, with the potential for inconsistent determinations by different courts adjudicating the same set of operative facts. (It is not clear whether a stay of Prudential's foreclosure action against Francesco is part of this request).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In effect, the Trustee, Renato, and Francesco request a third party injunction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20105\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the bankruptcy court enjoins a non-debtor from prosecuting a claim against another non-debtor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McCartney v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Because Prudential and the Trustee have failed to make a colorable argument that the non-debtor state cross-claims and counterclaims in the Lender Liability Lawsuit and the Lava Lawsuit have a plausible effect on the bankruptcy case, I find that there is no \"related to\" jurisdiction and these matters must be remanded to the state court. Cross-claims by and against the Debtor in the Lava Lawsuit are duplicative of litigation pending here and will therefore be dismissed. I also decline to grant the additional stay and injunctive relief sought by the Trustee and Prudential.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   An order consistent with this Memorandum will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) authorizes the removal of actions to the district court.

The imposition of liability against the Debtor has an obvious effect on the bankruptcy estate. This cross-claim, however, suffers from a different, non-jurisdictional, defect.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    Generally, the assertion of a claim in an adversary proceeding is procedurally improper because it bypasses the claims allowance process. Claims against the bankruptcy estate are made by filing a proof of claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-206\">\n    If Prudential files a proof of claim based on the liability asserted in its cross-claim against the Debtor,\n    <em>\n     but see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b)(9), an objection to Prudential's claims could be consolidated with trial of this adversary proceeding, if the claim is not disallowed as untimely.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-207\">\n    In short, there is no reason for this cross-claim to be litigated outside the claims allowance process. Therefore, I will dismiss the cross-claim without prejudice to Prudential's right to file a proof of claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"24\">\n   <p id=\"p-208\">\n    The Trustee, as successor to the Debtor's interest in the matter, expresses no concern regarding the ambiguous fate of the Debtor's cross-claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-209\">\n    The Trustee's lack of interest is not surprising. The Trustee is already prosecuting two (2) separate adversary proceedings against Prudential. The Debtor's complaint in the Lender Liability Lawsuit (now the instant AP controlled by the Trustee) includes claims regarding Prudential's alleged misconduct with respect to the Lava loan transaction. Thus, if the C.P. Court effectively dismissed the Debtor's cross-claim against Prudential in the Lava Lawsuit without reaching the merits, the Trustee appears confident that he can press those claims in the AP.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-210\">\n    For the sake of clarity, I will dismiss the Debtor's cross-claim in the Lava Lawsuit as duplicative of the claims already asserted in the complaint in the AP.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    Renato and Francesco urge this court to determine whether the removed Lender Liability Lawsuit includes the cross-claim of Renato and Francesco which was \"closed\" before the Lava Lawsuit was consolidated with the Lender Liability Lawsuit. I decline to do so because it does not matter. If the cross-claim never left the C.P. Court because it was dismissed before removal, the claim remains in the C.P. Court as dismissed (or \"closed\"). If the cross-claim migrated to the bankruptcy court in some inchoate fashion, it will be remanded by the order accompanying this memorandum. Either way, any further litigation regarding the status of the cross-claim must take place in the C.P. Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    I add one (1) other thought. It is hard to discern why Renato and Francesco are concerned about their cross-claim. The cross-claim raises no independent cause of action against Prudential arising out of the Lava loan transaction. The cross-claim asserts only that Prudential is solely liable or liable over to Renato and Francesco. Yet, Renato and Francesco have represented that Prudential made the payment to Lava that induced Lava to discontinue its lawsuit. I infer that neither Renato nor Francesco made any payment to Lava. If those are the facts, then the cross-claim against Prudential is moot because Lava is no longer prosecuting any pending action against Renato and Francesco that might cause them to pay Lava on account of a claim for which they believe Prudential is solely liable or liable over to them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-213\">\n    Alternatively, the Trustee suggests that the court could: (1) stay its remand order until the conclusion of the AP; or (2) declare that collateral estoppel will not be applied in the adjudication of this AP.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-214\">\n    While there may be circumstances in which a brief stay of a remand order due to the court's lack of jurisdiction may be appropriate, this is not such a case. Further, based on the pretrial management order requested by the parties and agreed to by the court, this AP is not likely to go to trial until some time in 2020. That is far too long for this court to retain control of claims over which it lacks jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-215\">\n    As for the collateral estoppel request, I consider that request to be either not ripe or a request for an advisory opinion. Either way, I decline to grant the relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
