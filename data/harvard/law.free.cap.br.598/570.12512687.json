For the reasons stated below, the judgment of the bankruptcy court is REVERSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case comes before the Court on appeal from two orders of the bankruptcy court regarding the parties' respective motions for summary judgment. Texas Association of Public Schools Property and Liability Fund (\"TAPS\") appeals the following orders of the Bankruptcy Court: (1) the order denying TAPS's Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 3 at 7); and (2) the order granting White Deer Independent School District's (\"White Deer\") Motion for Summary Judgment (docket no. 3 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case stems from TAPS' choice not to defend or indemnify White Deer in a state-court tax suit. In that tax suit,\n   <em>\n    Kelly Martin v. White Deer Independent School District\n   </em>\n   , Cause No. 11807, Judicial District Court for Carson County, Texas (\"Tax Suit\"), Kelly Martin sued White Deer, alleging that it improperly applied tax laws and charged her excessive taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Tax Suit turned on changes to Texas's homestead exemption for property taxes. Before 2015, the first $ 15,000 of a homestead's value was tax exempt under Texas law, and local governments could reduce this exemption using a Local Option Home Exemption (\"LOHE\"). On June 15, 2015, the governor signed S.B. 1, which raised the exemption to $ 25,000 and barred local governments from reducing or repealing any LOHE until 2019. This change required approval by constitutional amendment. On June 30, 2015, White Deer lowered its 2014 LOHE. Then, in November 2015, S.B. 1 was approved by constitutional amendment. Meanwhile, White Deer\n   collected Martin's taxes under the reduced LOHE (which was lawful when enacted), prompting Martin to bring the Tax Suit in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Martin sued White Deer, its board of trustees, its superintendent, and the county tax assessor. Docket no. 3 at 96. She alleged the defendants acted illegally in reducing the LOHE and then collecting higher taxes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103. She thus sought declaratory relief that these actions were\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and violated the Texas Constitution, a permanent injunction to reinstate White Deer's 2014 LOHE, and a \"refund of illegally collected taxes which [Martin] paid to the school district as a result of duress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 97. At summary judgment in that case, White Deer argued that Martin's requested declaratory relief was barred by its governmental immunity against suits for money damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 394. Martin denied that she sought money damages, contending that she demanded \"only a refund of illegally collected taxes paid under duress,\" which are not \" 'money damages' precluded by governmental or official immunity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 415.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 2018, the state court dismissed the individual defendants and granted summary judgment in Martin's favor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429. Martin was granted declaratory relief that S.B. 1 was constitutional and prohibited repealing or barring the LOHE between 2015 and 2019, that White Deer violated S.B. 1, and that White Deer's reduction of the LOHE was void.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 430. The state court ordered that White Deer \"disgorge and refund to [Martin] those property taxes that it collected for tax years 2015, 2016, and 2017 from [Martin], if any, that are subject to the [LOHE] that it adopted for the 2014 tax year.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 430-31. The pending appeal of the Tax Suit was filed May 7, 2018.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 432.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   TAPS is a self-funded risk program from which White Deer had previously purchased a policy; the section of this policy at issue here is titled \"Educators' Legal Liability Cover.\" In response to the Tax Suit, White Deer submitted a claim to TAPS under this policy for defense and indemnification of the Tax Suit. On October 7, 2016, TAPS denied coverage. White Deer then brought this suit in state court, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the duties to defend and indemnify and damages for breach of contract and violation of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act. TAPS removed to federal court and the case was transferred to bankruptcy court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   There, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment; the bankruptcy court granted White Deer's motion and denied TAPS' motion. TAPS then appealed these orders to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Appellant's Issues on Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   TAPS's issues on appeal are:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (1) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting White Deer's motion for summary judgment and denying TAPS's motion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (2) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment that TAPS owed White Deer a duty to defend the underlying suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (3) Whether any duty to indemnify White Deer is nonjusticiable because the issue is premature until the underlying judgment is final and the appeal is exhausted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (4) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment that TAPS owed White Deer a duty to indemnify Whiter Deer for any part of the judgment in the underlying suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (5) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in failing to grant summary judgment dismissing White Deer's claims for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, breach of contract, and attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (6) Whether TAPS may contest coverage only upon the grounds identified by its letter denying coverage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (7) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment that White Deer recover attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (8) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in failing to grant summary judgment dismissing White Deer's DTPA claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Docket no. 6 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although TAPS lists eight issues on appeal, the base issue is whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting White Deer's Motion for Summary Judgment and denying TAPS's Motion for Summary Judgment. Accounting for redundancy in the above issues, the Court must consider the following questions to decide this appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment that TAPS owed White Deer a duty to defend the underlying Tax Suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (2) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment that TAPS owed White Deer a duty to indemnify White Deer for any part of the judgment in the underlying suit.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (3) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in denying TAPS' no-evidence summary judgment motion on White Deer's DTPA claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (4) Whether the bankruptcy court erred in granting White Deer's summary judgment motion for attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The section at issue is titled \"EDUCATORS' LEGAL LIABILITY COVER.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 310. Under \"COVERAGE,\" the document states (1) \"[t]he Fund will pay, on behalf of the member, loss resulting from a claim for a wrongful act first made against the member during the coverage period ....\" and (2) \"[t]he Fund has the right and duty to investigate, defend and conduct settlement negotiations in any claim or suit, if such claim or suit alleges a wrongful act covered under this coverage part.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The relevant terms are defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   \u2022 \"Fund\" is defined as TAPS,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and no party disputes that White Deer is a \"member\" as defined in the policy,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 311.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   \u2022 The definition of \"claim\" relevant here is \"[a]ny judicial ... proceeding initiated against any members seeking to hold such member responsible for a wrongful act through monetary damages, other than attorney's fees or court costs alone, including any appeal therefrom.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   \u2022 \"Loss means damages and settlements; but does not include ... criminal or civil fines, penalties imposed by law, taxes, matters deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which the Coverage Document shall be construed, or compensation earned in the course of employment by an employee but not paid by the member entity ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \u2022 \"Wrongful act means ...

TAPS's Duty to Defend White Deer in the Underlying Tax Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   TAPS argues that it has no duty to defend White Deer in the Tax Suit for several reasons. The arguments determinative here are that Martin, the plaintiff in that suit, did not allege a \"claim\" under the policy, which must seek to hold White Deer responsible for \"monetary damages,\" and even if she did allege a claim she did not allege a \"wrongful act\" as that term is defined in the policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

Further, White Deer \"illegally assessed and collected taxes that are subject to this exemption.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651303\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/695/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Martin alleges these actions \"in repealing the exemption, refusing to grant [Martin] the exemption, and assessing and collecting taxes that are subject to the exemption were\n   <em>\n    ultra vires.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651303\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/695/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She alleges White Deer has \"taken and deprived [her] of a constitutionally protected right through [its] arbitrary and capricious use of power and failed to provide [Martin] constitutionally sufficient notice and hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7651303\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/695/#p701\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Martin further alleges that White Deer's actions \"caused [Martin] to suffer an actual, concrete, and particularized injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104. She alleges her homestead residence is within White Deer's boundaries and White Deer imposes ad valorem taxes on her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And although she was allegedly entitled under S.B. 1 to the 2014 LOHE, White Deer allegedly deprived Martin of her entitlement to the exemption and to her money and \"caus[ed] [Martin] to pay taxes under duress in order to avoid incurring penalties and interest imposed by the Texas Tax Code for nonpayment of such taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Martin alleges she lost the 2014 LOHE because of White Deer's misconduct, which \"has placed undue stress on [Martin's] personal ability to conserve or apply her financial resources as she so needs or desires.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As relief, she sought declarations that the change in Texas law was constitutional and that it prohibited school districts from repealing or reducing their 2014 LOHEs between 2015 and 2019.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 105. She also sought declarations that White Deer's actions were\n   <em>\n    ultra vires.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, and crucially for purposes of this order, she sought \"judgment awarding her a refund of the taxes collected by Defendants that were subject to the local option homestead exemption that Defendants wrongfully repealed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She again alleges she paid these taxes under duress and alleges they \"were illegally taken and collected by Defendants, thus entitling [Martin] to a refund.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. The Second Four Corners: The Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Now, the Court must decide whether the facts in Martin's pleadings, accepted as true, constitute a covered claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Relief Sought\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   TAPS argues that the relief Martin sought in her pleadings is not the sort of relief for which TAPS must defend policy holders, as the Tax Suit is not a \"claim\" or \"loss\" under the policy and it falls under the exclusion for non-pecuniary relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, a qualifying \"claim\" is one that seeks to hold a \"member responsible for a wrongful act\n   <strong>\n    through monetary damages, other than attorney's fees or court costs alone\n   </strong>\n   [.]\" Docket no. 3 at 311 (emphasis added). As a preliminary matter, no party disputes that the injunctive and declaratory relief Martin sought does not trigger a duty to defend, under this and other provisions in the policy. The inquiry must center on Martin's desired tax refund. If that refund is not \"monetary damages,\" then, Martin's Tax Suit is not a qualifying \"claim\" under the policy and TAPS has no duty to defend. A proper \"claim,\" as the policy defines it, is necessary whether White Deer seeks coverage under the first (\"The Fund will pay ... loss resulting from a claim for a wrongful act ...\") or second (\"The Fund has the ... duty to ... defend ... in any claim or suit, if such claim or suit alleges a wrongful act ...\") provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   docket no. 3 at 310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Second, a qualifying \"loss\" includes \"\n   <strong>\n    damages\n   </strong>\n   and settlements.\" Docket no. 3 at 311 (emphasis added). This definition also excludes particular types of damages and settlements, including, as argued by TAPS on appeal, \"taxes\" and \"matters deemed uninsurable under the law pursuant to which the Coverage Document shall be construed[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For these exceptions to the definition to be relevant, the desired tax refund must first be \"damages.\" The Court can find no guiding principle that would distinguish between \"damages\" and \"monetary damages\" in this instance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   TAPS argues the plain meaning of these terms in the insurance context is legal damages, not money awarded as restitution or disgorgement, which is equitable monetary relief. Docket no. 6 at 33. TAPS contends \"[t]he terms 'damages' and 'money damages' are not ambiguous; their plain meaning as used in the insurance context refers to legal damages and does not include equitable monetary relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Whether a tax refund is \"monetary damages\" (as required for a qualifying claim under the policy) and whether it is \"damages\" (as required for a qualifying loss) are separate arguments on the duty to defend, but in this case the answer will be the same. The cases TAPS cites-\n   <em>\n    Nortex Oil &amp; Gas Corp. v. Harbor Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10143245\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/456/489/#p493\">\n    456 S.W.2d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 493-94 (Tex. Civ.

Thus, if Martin's desired tax refund is not damages, TAPS will have no duty to defend because the Tax Suit is not a qualifying claim and because White Deer's refund of illegally acquired tax funds is not a qualifying loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Responding to TAPS's argument that a tax refund is not monetary damages, White Deer does not address TAPS's cited cases but instead argues that \"[t]he only limitation in the Policy with regard to monetary damages\" is that a qualifying claim must be for \"monetary damages,\n   <em>\n    other than attorney's fees or court costs alone.\n   </em>\n   \" Docket no. 7 at 17 (emphasis in original). Because the Tax Suit \"is not for attorney's fees and costs alone,\" then, White Deer argues it must be for qualifying monetary damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4220352,3798799\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/597/298/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This does not follow. If the tax refund constitutes monetary damages, then it would matter whether these damages went beyond attorney's fees and court costs (as they surely would). But if the tax refund is not monetary damages at all-as TAPS argues and the Court now considers-White Deer's argument\n   has no bearing.

Like the relief at issue in\n   <em>\n    TransTexas\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nortex\n   </em>\n   , Martin's desired tax refund is \"restoration of an ill-gotten gain,\" not damages under Texas law. Based on these authorities-and forced as the Court is, at this stage, to accept Martin's pleaded facts as true-the Court can only conclude that a refund of illegally acquired taxes is not \"damages\" or \"monetary damages,\" but is instead equitable relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Another case that arises from similar facts (indeed, the same change in Texas law that sparked Martin's suit) supports this conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kilgore Indep.

The\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   court considered whether the school district was immune to the plaintiffs' suit. The issue was whether the plaintiffs sought money damages, given that a \"party cannot circumvent governmental immunity by characterizing a suit for money damages as a claim for declaratory judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407764\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/535/21/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    City of Dallas v.

The petition indicated it\n   sought \"monetary relief in the amount of $ 100,000 or less.\" Although this, \"standing alone, could be construed to request money damages, [plaintiffs'] subsequent pleadings and arguments have clarified that request to be limited to a return of taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317084\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/368/#p378\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Reversing the court below, the\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   court concluded that \"the only money [plaintiff] seeks is the repayment of taxes allegedly paid under duress\" and \"such relief is equitable and not barred by immunity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As did the petition in\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   , Martin's petition indicates that she seeks \"monetary relief in the amount of $ 100,000 or less.\" The\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   court stated that, standing alone, this could indicate the plaintiff sought money damages, but in\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   further argument clarified that the plaintiff only sought a tax refund. TAPS points to Martin's arguments made in the course of litigation, noting that Martin's response to a summary judgment motion in the Tax Suit claims her desired tax refund is not money damages. Docket no. 6 at 19. TAPS then argues that Martin's analysis, as \"author of the alleged facts,\" should control here.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7317084\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/354/368/#p378\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But this argument violates the \"eight corners\" rule TAPS urges the Court to apply-in determining the duty to defend, Martin's pleadings matter, but her subsequent arguments made in litigation do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Still, the Court concludes that, even without further clarification, Martin's petition unambiguously seeks a tax refund only. Her reference to \"monetary relief in the amount of $ 100,000 or less and non-monetary relief\" merely fulfills a requirement of Texas pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 47(c). As did the\n   <em>\n    Kilgore\n   </em>\n   court, this Court concludes that this sort of tax refund is equitable relief, not money damages. The Tax Suit is thus not a qualifying claim under the policy at issue here, nor is restitution of this money a qualifying loss, and TAPS has no duty to defend. This may be artful pleading on Martin's part, as White Deer argues, since she presumably knows that sovereign immunity poses an obstacle to her claim, but White Deer cites no authority that indicates Texas has an artful pleading exception to the \"eight corners\" rule, and the Court is aware of no such exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Because of this conclusion, the Court need not consider TAPS's other arguments about the relief requested-namely, whether a tax refund is otherwise not a loss because it is \"taxes\" or a matter \"deemed uninsurable under the law,\" or alternatively whether the Tax Suit falls under the policy's non-pecuniary relief exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    2. \"Wrongful Act\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Even assuming for argument that Martin's desired tax refund was damages, making the Tax Suit a \"claim\" under the policy, TAPS still has no duty to defend because the Tax Suit does not allege a \"wrongful act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The policy defines \"wrongful act\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [a]n actual or alleged act, error, omission, misstatement, misleading statement, neglect or breach of duty by the member in the discharge of their duties, including but not limited to that injury to a person that results from any one or more of the following offenses: refusal to employ; termination of employment; demotion or failure to promote; negative evaluation; reassignment; discipline; defamation or humiliation based on discrimination directed at that person; coercing the person to commit an unlawful act or omission (within the scope of employment); work-related sexual harassment; or other work-related harassment because of race, color, national origin, religion, gender, marital status, age, sexual orientation, physical or mental condition\n   or any other protected class or characteristic.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Docket no. 3 at 311.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   TAPS argues that the policy limits \"wrongful act\" to employment practices, given that each of the nine laundry list items refers to an employment act or decision. Docket no. 6 at 23-24. Under the rule of\n   <em>\n    ejusdem generis\n   </em>\n   , \"when words of a general nature are used in connection with the designation of particular objects or classes of persons or things, the meaning of the general words will be restricted to the particular designation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hilco Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. Midlothian Butane Gas Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9099769\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/111/75/#p81\">\n    111 S.W.3d 75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 81 (Tex. 2003). Here, the laundry list includes only employment-related practices, and the generic terms preceding the list-such as \"act\" and \"error\"-are restricted accordingly. If this were a close question, the Court would decide it in White Deer's favor, given that Texas law liberally construes the duty to defend in the insured's favor. But whatever the exact scope of this \"wrongful act\" provision, White Deer's acts related to its tax-collecting duties clearly fall outside it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   White Deer argues that the \"wrongful act\" definition is not limited to employment-related acts because of the \"including but not limited to\" language and because the policy separately defines \"wrongful employment practice\" as a \"wrongful act arising out of the employment relationship.\" Docket no. 7 at 20. White Deer argues that a construction limiting \"wrongful act\" to employment practices renders the \"wrongful employment practice\" term redundant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On this point, however, TAPS has the better argument. This policy section excludes personal or advertising injury (except employment-related wrongful acts), docket no. 3 at 311, and any claim for which coverage is sought under the General Liability coverage part of the policy (which covers bodily injury, property damage, and personal and advertising injuries),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 312. As TAPS correctly argues, harmonizing these exclusions with the \"wrongful act\" definition leads to this conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   By applying the express terms, 'wrongful act' excludes claims for bodily injury, property damage, or personal injury, unless the claim falls within the definition of 'wrongful employment practice.' Between the two exclusions and the enumerated list of wrongful acts, the only sensible construction is that 'wrongful act' is limited to acts as an employer\n   <em>\n    vis a vis\n   </em>\n   employees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Docket no. 6 at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Although it is true that the policy does not limit \"wrongful act\" to the laundry list, it would stretch this term too far-given the focus of the policy section generally-to conclude that illegal tax collection is a \"wrongful act\" as the policy defines it. Construing the policy as a whole, the Court concludes that White Deer's alleged acts in collecting taxes are not contemplated by the \"Educators' Legal Liability Cover\" policy section at issue here. Thus, TAPS has no duty to defend. Given the Court's construction of \"claim\" and \"wrongful act,\" it need not consider TAPS's argument that the Tax Suit falls under the dishonest act exclusion. Accordingly, the Court concludes that the bankruptcy court erred in granting summary judgment in White Deer's favor on TAPS's duty to defend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    d. TAPS' Duty to Indemnify White Deer for Judgment in the Tax Suit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   TAPS also challenges the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment for White Deer on TAPS's duty to indemnify. Because the same reasons that negate the duty to defend also negate any possible\n   duty to indemnify, the Court reverses on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    i.

The duty to defend arises prior to the completion of litigation, and therefore insurers are required to meet their defense obligation before the scope of the insured's liability has been determined. In contrast, the duty to indemnify arises only once liability has been conclusively determined. In other words, because the duty to defend arises whenever an insurer ascertains facts that give rise to the possibility or the potential liability to indemnify, the duty to defend must be assessed at the very outset of a case, unlike the duty to indemnify, which arises only when the insured's underlying liability is established.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7299734\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/300/740/#p743\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Thus, a duty to indemnify is usually only justiciable after the underlying litigation has been resolved.\n   <em>\n    Farmers Texas Cty.
