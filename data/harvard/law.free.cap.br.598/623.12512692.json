The Court makes this memorandum decision based on all the files, records, and proceedings herein, and pursuant to Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7052, made applicable to this contested matter by Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9014(c). For the reasons set forth below, the debtor's request to avoid certain judicial liens is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The underlying facts of this contested matter are largely undisputed. Mr. Mus and Christine Mudge (formerly Mus) were married in Sunnyvale, California, on November 19, 1966. Until the parties separated on August 4, 2013, they lived in their homestead, located at 16659 Eldorado Street NW, Andover, Minnesota. Ultimately, they were divorced by virtue of a Judgment and Decree of Divorce entered on March 13, 2015, in the Tenth Judicial District Court, County of Anoka, Minnesota. The events that ensued thereafter in various state court proceedings are best characterized by the presiding state court judge as \"substantial and tortured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Mus filed for relief under chapter 7 on September 22, 2017. He was granted a\n   discharge on December 27, 2017. ECF No. 11. The case was ordered closed and the trustee discharged on January 11, 2018. It was a no asset case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, on January 30, 2018, Mr. Mus moved to reopen the case; an order was entered that same day granting that request. ECF Nos. 13, 14, respectively. He then moved to amend his Schedule C, claiming the Eldorado Street property as his homestead. No party in interest objected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mus is now asking that the following \"judicial liens,\" each entered in the Tenth Judicial District Court, Anoka County, Minnesota, be avoided under \u00a7 522(f)(1)(A) as impairing his homestead exemption:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

We have consistently construed these provisions liberally in favor of the debtor due to their constitutional roots and the strong social policy of securing the home against the uncertainties and misfortunes of life.\" (citation and footnotes omitted) ). As a general principle, liens that are consensual security interests and mortgages survive bankruptcy; however, the debtor should be protected, again, as part of the homestead exemption, from certain nonconsensual liens. To accomplish that objective, Congress enacted\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 522(f) provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (f)(1) Notwithstanding any waiver of exemptions but subject to paragraph (3), the debtor may avoid the fixing of a lien on an interest of the debtor in property to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption to which the debtor would have been entitled under subsection (b) of this section, if such lien is ---\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (A) A judicial lien, other than a judicial lien that secures a debt of a\n   kind that is specified in section 523(a)(5);\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   The concept of \"lien avoidance\" has been around since the enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978. Section 522(f) gives the debtor a tool to extinguish the judicial lien that a particular creditor may have in property that would otherwise be exempt but for the lien of the creditor's judgment. Under the original provisions of \u00a7 522(f), \"judicial liens could be avoided 'to the extent that such lien impairs an exemption,' but this phrase was not defined. Because of the disarray in the cases, Congress tried again in 1994 by adding \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A), which provides a formula to determine whether a lien 'impairs an exemption.' The gist of the formula is to add all of the liens, including the targeted judicial lien, plus the amount of the exemption. If this total exceeds the debtor's interest in the property, the assumption is that the excess value of the liens is due to the judicial lien, and consequently the judicial lien 'impairs the exemption' to this extent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Baxter Dunaway, \" Attachment is a Key to Understanding Protecting Homesteads by Avoiding Judicial Liens in Bankruptcy,\" 12 Journal of Bankruptcy Law and Practice 233, 235 (2003). (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Bankruptcy Law Manual explains the concept of \"lien avoidance\" in a very straightforward manner:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   One of the most significant powers of a debtor is the power to avoid a judicial lien on exempt property, whether real or personal, to the extent the lien impairs a debtor's exemption, a power which greatly enhances the debtor's fresh start. A judicial lien is a \"lien obtained by judgment, levy, sequestration, or other legal or equitable process or proceeding,\" and includes an attachment or execution. Consensual liens, such as mortgages and Article 9 security interests, and statutory liens, such as mechanics' liens or tax liens are not judicial liens and cannot be avoided under Code \u00a7 522(f). The sole exception to the power to avoid judicial liens which impair the debtor's exemption is that the debtor is precluded from avoiding a judicial lien securing a debt which is excepted from discharge because it is a domestic support obligation. To qualify for lien avoidance, three requirements must be met: the lien must have affixed to an interest in the debtor's property, the lien must impair an exemption to which the debtor would otherwise be entitled, and the lien must be a judicial lien, except for a lien securing a domestic support obligation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Feeney, Williamson, and Stepan, Bankruptcy Law Manual \u00a7 5:39 (5th ed. 2018). (footnotes omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The three monetary judgments against the debtor which are docketed in Anoka County, Minnesota, fit easily into the legal definition of \"judicial lien.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, each of the judgments is for a sum certain against the debtor. Second, under Minnesota law, each judgment attached to the debtor's property upon its recordation in Anoka County, Minnesota. MINN. STAT. \u00a7 548.09(1). Third, none of the three judgments is a domestic support obligation as defined by section 101(14A) of the Bankruptcy Code. Applying the \"formula\" supplied by the 1994 amendment to \u00a7 522(f)(2)(A) to these three judgment liens results in the following computation:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   $ 1,231,288.09 - Sum of the liens to be avoided [$ 84,032.70 + $ 1,057,588.39 + $ 89,667.00]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   + $ 671,315.92 - all other liens on the property [mortgage to JP Morgan Chase]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   + $ 23,675.00 - [amount of the exemption that debtor could claim if there were no liens]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Total $ 1,926,279.01\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Less $ 587,800.00 - [value of debtor's interest in the property in the absence of any liens]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Equals $ 1,338,497.01 - [amount by which all liens exceed debtor's interest in the property].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Therefore, the three money judgments against Mr. Mus are properly avoidable. These judicial liens impair the debtor's homestead exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The debtor's motion is granted to this extent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The relief Mr. Mus seeks in avoiding the state court \"judicial liens\" is more problematic. All of the four orders originating in the state court arise out of either the parties' divorce court proceedings or the eviction proceeding. Mr. Mus' petition concerning the state court orders raises several questions. For example, does the Rooker - Feldman doctrine\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   preclude the Court from ruling on the debtor's motion to avoid the liens? Do any of these state court orders meet the definition of \"judicial lien?\" Did the debtor have an interest in the property to which a lien from the state court orders fixed? All of these questions will be answered in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ROOKER-FELDMAN DOCTRINE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Ms. Mudge argues that the Rooker - Feldman doctrine prohibits the debtor's ability to \"avoid\" the four orders emanating from the state court divorce proceedings. The doctrine has been understood \"that with the exception of habeas corpus proceedings, the inferior federal courts lack subject-matter jurisdiction over 'cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cawley v.

The doctrine has always been interpreted as a \"narrow proposition,\" one applied so as to circumvent disgruntled state court litigants from collaterally attacking a state-court judgment in a federal court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Mudge's argument, however, is misplaced. The request from Mus to avoid the state court orders is being brought\n   under the provisions of section 522(f) of the Bankruptcy Code. It is not couched as \"an attack on the validity of the state court judgments.\" Specifically, the relief available to a debtor under the lien avoidance provisions of section 522(f) is a \"core\" proceeding by virtue of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B) (\"allowance or disallowance of claims against the estate or exemptions from property of the estate ...\") and (K)(\"determinations of the validity, extent, or priority of liens[.]\" As this is a \"core\" proceeding, the bankruptcy court is uniquely situated to entertain the form of relief being sought. Were it any other way would render useless the provisions of section 522(f).

District Court Judge Jonathon N. Jasper granted Mudge's motion and set aside the March 1, 2016 order and awarded the debtor \"sole and exclusive right to access to the [the property ...]\" but he was \"not awarded occupancy of the house, as occupancy of the house directly impedes the foreclosure proceedings.
