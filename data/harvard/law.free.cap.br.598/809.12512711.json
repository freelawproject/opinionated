HARNER, U.S. BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Business is often done based on the trust established between the contracting parties. The parties have worked together in the past and, satisfied with that relationship, agree to continue to work on projects in the future. When that trust is breached, the relationship and often at least one party's economic position suffer. That is the matter before the Court, and the Court must decide whether the breach that occurred gives rise to more than a mere breach of contract claim. If it does, the claim might garner protection against discharge in the Defendant's chapter 7 case under section 523 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   If it does not, the Defendant's liability on the claim will be discharged under section 727 of the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As further explained below, the Court finds that the Plaintiff's Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under section 523(a)(4) of the Code. The Court notes that the factual allegations contained in the Amended Complaint, while suggesting a breach of personal trust and of contract, do not establish a technical or express trust that results in the kind of fiduciary relationship required by section 523(a)(4). The Court recognizes the statutory trust language relied on by the Plaintiff but determines that the Maryland statute at issue does not give rise to an express or technical trust under section 523(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   That finding does not end the Court's consideration of the statutory trust language, however, as the statute does lend support to the Plaintiff's claim that the Defendant knowingly and intentionally disregarded the Plaintiff's rights in certain funds received by the Defendant for purposes of section 523(a)(6). The Court is sensitive to the Defendant's argument that casting a knowing decision to not pay a debt as an intentional injury to the creditor under section 523(a)(6) would severely undercut the effect of, and policy underlying, the bankruptcy discharge. Nevertheless, the statutory trust, the Plaintiff's rights thereunder, and the Defendant's conduct, as alleged in the Amended Complaint, amount to more than a mere payment default and adequately state a plausible claim for nondischargeability under section 523(a)(6) of the Code. The Court thus will dismiss Count I of the Amended Complaint under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and deny the pending Motion to Dismiss as to Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Relevant Background\n    </em>\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendant filed her chapter 7 case on February 20, 2018. Case No. 18-12138, ECF 1. The Defendant discloses her employment as being the \"President of construction company,\" and then identifies the company as \"Vito Construction, Inc.\" (\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Vito Construction\"). Case No. 18-12138, ECF 13, Schedule I. The Defendant lists Vito Construction as an unsecured creditor in her case but does not list the Plaintiff as a creditor or note any pending state court litigation between herself (in her individual capacity) and the Plaintiff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Case No. 18-12138, ECF 13, Schedule E/F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Plaintiff worked as a subcontractor for Vito Construction on several different construction projects prior to the petition date. According to the pleadings filed in this adversary proceeding, the Plaintiff and its principal developed a good working relationship with Vito Construction and the Defendant. That relationship began to deteriorate, however, at some point in 2016 when Vito Construction's payments to the Plaintiff slowed or ceased entirely, causing the Plaintiff to go unpaid for work it had performed. The Plaintiff further alleges that, on each of the projects, Vito Construction received full payment from the project owners but failed to remit appropriate amounts to the Plaintiff for its subcontracting work. At the time of the Defendant's bankruptcy filing, Vito Construction allegedly owed the Plaintiff approximately $ 150,575.99. ECF 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plaintiff commenced this adversary proceeding against the Defendant on May 22, 2018. The Plaintiff's initial Complaint sought a determination that its claims against the Defendant for amounts due under the Plaintiff's contracts with Vito Construction are nondischargeable in the Defendant's chapter 7 case under sections 523(a)(2), (a)(4), and (a)(6) of the Code. The Plaintiff generally alleges that it did not receive full payment due under the contracts and that the Defendant, as an officer or person in control of Vito Construction, is responsible for the Plaintiff's resulting monetary losses. The Defendant denies the Plaintiff's allegations against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Defendant filed her original motion to dismiss on July 9, 2018. ECF 12. After full briefing by the parties and a hearing before the Court, the Court granted the relief sought by that motion to dismiss with leave for the Plaintiff to amend its complaint. ECF 19. The Plaintiff filed its Amended Complaint on October 24, 2018. ECF 21. The Amended Complaint eliminated the Plaintiff's allegations under section 523(a)(2) of the Code and with respect to construction projects other than the Vital Records Project (as that term is defined in the Amended Complaint). It continues to assert claims against the Plaintiff under section 523(a)(4) of the Code in Count I, and section 523(a)(6) of the Code in Count II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By the pending Motion to Dismiss, the Defendant asserts that the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). ECF 22. The Defendant accordingly asks the Court to dismiss the Amended Complaint in its entirety. The Plaintiff disagrees and argues that it has pled more than adequate facts to meet the plausibility standard applicable to motions under Civil Rule 12(b)(6). ECF 23. It further states that relief based on those facts is warranted under applicable law interpreting sections 523(a)(4) and (a)(6) of the Code. The Court addresses below each of the two counts in the Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction and Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and Local Rule 402 of the\n   United States District Court for the District of Maryland.

The bankruptcy discharge is a hallmark of U.S. bankruptcy law. It provides a debtor with that coveted fresh start, and it is one of the primary policy objectives underlying the Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.

The Plaintiff cites the Trust Statute to support this position. MD. CODE ANN., REAL PROP. \u00a7 9-201, et seq. The Trust Statute provides, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (b)(1) Any money paid under a contract by an owner to a contractor, or by the owner or contractor to a subcontractor for work done or materials furnished, or both, for or about a building by any subcontractor, shall be held in trust by the contractor or subcontractor, as trustee, for those subcontractors who\n   did work or furnished materials, or both, for or about the building, for purposes of paying those subcontractors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) An officer, director, or managing agent of a contractor or subcontractor who has direction over or control of money held in trust by a contractor or subcontractor under paragraph (1) of this subsection is a trustee for the purpose of paying the money to the subcontractors who are entitled to it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   MD. CODE ANN., REAL PROP. \u00a7 9-201. The Trust Statute further provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Any officer, director, or managing agent of any contractor or subcontractor, who knowingly retains or uses the money held in trust under \u00a7 9-201 of this subtitle, or any part thereof, for any purpose other than to pay those subcontractors for whom the money is held in trust, shall be personally liable to any person damaged by the action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   MD.

The question thus becomes whether this statutory language evidences the core elements of an express or technical trust,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   which would create the kind of fiduciary relationship required by section 523(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Several courts have considered this question, but not all courts agree on the answer. Some of the variation in response appears attributable to differences in statutory language.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    In re Manelos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37718\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/409/#p415\">\n    337 B.R. 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 415 (Bankr. D.N.M. 2006) (comparing two different statutes under New Mexico law in the context of section 523(a)(4) ). Other variations are not so easily explained. The Court understands why courts might differ in their analysis in that most of these proceedings involve a breach of the movant's trust. The movant in a nondischargeability action invoking section 523(a)(4) often has relied on the debtor and perhaps the terms of the parties' contract or prior dealings; the movant may have even given the debtor the benefit of the doubt in extending payment terms based on past relations. Yet, once the bankruptcy case is filed, the movant is left only with an unsecured claim that likely will go unpaid. Unfortunately, this is the situation for most unsecured creditors in a chapter 7 bankruptcy case. Only an enumerated few unsecured debts garner different treatment. Because of the resulting inequality in creditor treatment, as well as the impact on the debtor's fresh start, courts scrutinize statutory trusts under section 523(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Some Maryland courts and courts considering Maryland law have determined that the Trust Statute fails to establish an express or technical trust for purposes of section 523(a)(4).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   This position is most\n   thoughtfully articulated by Judge Schneider in\n   <em>\n    In re Holmes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118113\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/117/848/\">\n    117 B.R. 848\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D. Md. 1990). Judge Schneider reviews Supreme Court precedent, the elements of an express or technical trust, and the policy underlying the bankruptcy discharge.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118113\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/117/848/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118113\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/117/848/\">\n    at 853-855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He examines decisions qualifying statutory trusts as express trusts under section 523(a)(4), and respectfully disagrees with those courts. In so doing, Judge Schneider undertakes an exhaustive review of the elements of an express or technical trust, which generally requires \"a formal fiduciary relationship whose creation is based upon the intentions of a settlor and/or a beneficiary.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118113\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/117/848/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118113\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/117/848/\">\n    at 852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Judge Schneider opines that a state legislature's intent cannot be substituted for that of the parties under the express trust doctrine. He explains quite pointedly why this distinction is important in the context of nondischargeability, noting\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The rationale for limiting nondischargeability to fraud and defalcations committed by a trustee in fact is that such\n   <em>\n    misconduct by one who voluntarily undertook specific fiduciary obligations\n   </em>\n   is more reprehensible and more worthy of disapprobation than the misconduct of one whose fiduciary duties are involuntarily imposed by operation of law. At the same time, it is obvious that a beneficiary of a trust in fact who reposes trust and confidence in a trustee and who is injured by his defalcation is more worthy of protection than an injured business associate who presumably dealt with the debtor at arm's length and on an equal basis.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118113\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/117/848/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6118113\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/117/848/\">\n    at 854-55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court agrees with Judge Schneider's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Holmes\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Court is not willing to rule out completely the potential for a statutory trust scheme to satisfy section 523(a)(4) of the Code,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the language and structure of the Trust Statute do not rise to the level of an express or technical trust. The Trust Statute imposes a trust on payments received by a contractor or subcontractor relating to a construction project, regardless of the intentions of the parties. No trust or fiduciary relationship exists between the parties at the outset of the contract or with respect to the parties' general working relationship. The trust-like obligation springs into existence only with respect to, and upon payment of, certain funds. MD. CODE ANN., REAL PROP. \u00a7 9-201(b). The statute likewise does not impose a duty to segregate or to separately account for the funds. MD. CODE ANN., REAL PROP. \u00a7 9-201(c) (\"Nothing contained in this subtitle shall be construed as requiring money held in trust by a contractor or subcontractor under subsection (b) of this section to be placed in a separate account.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Rather, the Trust Statute unilaterally alters the terms of a basic debtor-creditor relationship in the following way. A contractor or subcontractor comes into possession of money that might be owed, at least in part, to another subcontractor. The Trust Statute imposes an involuntary trust on that money, and the contractor's or subcontractor's failure to remit those funds then gives rise to the director's or officer's potential liability under the statute. The Trust Statute may create a trust, and identify an officer or director as a trustee, before the funds are misused, but providing a remedy for that particular (and anticipated) harm is the sole purpose of the trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Nail\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3962187,3881503\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/680/1036/\">\n    680 F.3d 1036\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1041 (8th Cir. 2012) (distinguishing a nominal trust created by statute prior to the alleged wrong from the establishment of a true express or technical trust).

Regardless of whether the Defendant promised payment, the Plaintiff was already owed those amounts under the parties' contract. As explained above, the Supreme Court and lower courts have determined that the fiduciary relationship for purposes of section 523(a)(4) must exist prior to, and without reference of, the alleged wrong.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929607\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/293/328/#p333\">\n    293 U.S. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3929492,3929607\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/55/151/\">\n    55 S.Ct. 151\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (fiduciary relationship must exist prior to \"act of wrongdoing\" and debt must be created \"by a person who was already a fiduciary\");\n   <em>\n    Ogbebor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%205376531\">\n    2013 WL 5376531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court observes that the Fourth Circuit has distinguished the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   in situations where the parties' agreement clearly delineates a fiduciary or trust relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Strack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3823828,3564949\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/524/493/\">\n    524 F.3d 493\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 499-500 (4th Cir. 2008).

They consist primarily of statements by the Defendant that she was aware of the amounts owing to the Plaintiff and would try to make payments on that debt once funds were available. The allegations in the Amended Complaint and the text exchanges attached at Exhibit 19 represent statements by a debtor who was out of funds but being pressured by a creditor for payment. They\n   do not suggest any agreement to segregate or earmark funds or otherwise hold funds in trust for the benefit of the creditor. Indeed, the Court cannot find any words, conduct, or circumstances that indicate an intent by the Defendant to create an express trust or fiduciary relationship. Accepting all the Plaintiff's factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, the Amended Complaint does not state a plausible claim under section 523(a)(4) of the Code.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <em>\n    In re Stephenson\n   </em>\n   , No. 12-00357-8-JRL,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%20593900\">\n    2013 WL 593900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (Bankr.

The Plaintiff's Amended Complaint, however, sets forth facts suggesting something more. The Amended Complaint grounds Count II in the Plaintiff's interest in certain funds under the Trust Statute and the Defendant's knowing and deliberate act to cause injury to the Plaintiff by withholding those funds.
