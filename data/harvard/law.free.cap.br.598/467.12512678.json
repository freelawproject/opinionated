Beginning in 2015, Debtor entered into a series of factoring agreements with Charter Asset Management Fund, LP (\"Creditor\"), a California company in the business of making loans to charter schools. Under these factoring agreements, Creditor would provide cash advances to Debtor in return for the right to receive Debtor's future payments from the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2016, Debtor filed a petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Afterward, Debtor pursued a preference action under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to \"claw back\" the $ 134,745.95 in payments that Creditor had received from the state during the 90-day period preceding the initiation of the bankruptcy proceedings. Following discovery, Debtor and Creditor filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The bankruptcy court, after holding oral argument and soliciting supplemental briefing from the parties, issued a detailed order granting summary judgment to Creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Debtor now seeks review of the bankruptcy court's order, arguing that the decision to grant summary judgment to Creditor was both procedurally improper and flawed on the merits. As explained below, the Court agrees with Debtor's procedural objections. The only party that sought summary judgment on the threshold issue of whether the $ 134,745.95 in payments were avoidable under \u00a7 547(b) was Debtor. Creditor, in contrast, limited its request for summary judgment to its affirmative defense, under \u00a7 547(c), that it was entitled to a $ 54,000 offset against any sum that was ultimately deemed avoidable. Under these circumstances, the bankruptcy court was not authorized to, in effect, grant summary judgment to Creditor on the \u00a7 547(b) issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court will, however, affirm the bankruptcy court's grant of summary judgment to Creditor on its \u00a7 547(c) affirmative defense. Debtor's sole objection to this ruling-that the \"new value\" defense is unavailable to a creditor acting in bad faith-finds no support in the case law or the text of the statute. Finally, the Court will decline to resolve Debtor's substantive objections to the bankruptcy court's analysis of its \u00a7 547(b) claim because this case is being remanded to the bankruptcy court for further analysis and fact-finding on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND ON SECTION 547\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under \u00a7 547(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor may \"avoid\" certain transfers\n   of its own property that were made during the 90-day period before the bankruptcy petition was filed. A transfer constitutes an avoidable preference if five elements are shown: (1) the transfer was made to or for the benefit of a creditor; (2) the transfer was made for or on account of an antecedent debt; (3) the transfer was made while the debtor was insolvent; (4) the transfer was made on or within 90 days before the date of the filing of the petition; and (5) the transfer enabled the creditor to receive more than it would have received in a Chapter 7 liquidation of the estate.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The purpose of avoidance is two-fold: (1) to \"facilitate the prime bankruptcy policy of equality of distribution among creditors of the debtor,\" by assuring that any \"creditor that received a greater payment than others of his class is required to disgorge so that all may share equally\"; and (2) to discourage creditors \"from racing to the courthouse to dismember the debtor during his slide into bankruptcy.\"\n   <em>\n    Union Bank v.

(Doc. 14-24 at 4 n.6.) This is known as the \"preference period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Between February 2015 and January 2016, Debtor agreed that state distributions for the months between August 2015 and May 2016 would be paid directly to Creditor. (Doc. 14-24 at 8.) In exchange, Creditor would loan Debtor funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) During that period, Creditor advanced to Debtor a total of $ 508,102.26 and collected a total of $ 397,061.93. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Thus, as of the start of the preference period, Debtor owed Creditor $ 111,040.33. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   During the preference period, Creditor collected a total of $ 134,745.95 directly from the state. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Additionally, Debtor's financial situation worsened during this period, so Creditor provided an additional $ 54,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Debtor, Creditor \"made it clear that Debtor\n   was only to spend funds received from [Creditor] on expenses that would keep it operational-like employee wages-instead of paying other debts, and chastised Debtor if it did otherwise.\" (Doc. 14 at 5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Court Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On August 18, 2016, Debtor filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. (Doc. 14-24 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 14, 2017, Debtor filed a complaint in bankruptcy court seeking to avoid pre-petition distributions made to Creditor. (Doc. 15-2 at 2-15.) In Count IV of the complaint, Debtor argued that the payments Creditor received from the state during the preference period \"are avoidable preferential transfers of funds under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 550.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) In its answer, Debtor asserted affirmative defenses under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) and (c)(4), among other provisions. (Doc. 15-3 at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 27, 2017, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. (Doc. 14-11 [Debtor]; Doc. 14-12 [Creditor].) Notably, although Debtor sought summary judgment on the issue whether the $ 134,745.95 in payments Creditor received during the preference period were avoidable under \u00a7 547(b) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 14-11 at 2), Creditor didn't seek summary judgment on this issue. Instead, as relevant here, Creditor only sought summary judgment on its affirmative defense, under \u00a7 547(c)(4), that it was entitled to a $ 54,000 offset under the \"new value\" doctrine against any sum that was ultimately deemed avoidable. (Doc. 14-12 at 2 [\"[Creditor] moves for partial summary judgment as to Count 4 of the Complaint based on its new value defense under Section 547(c)(4). [Creditor's] subsequent advances of new value during the Preference Period totaled $ 54,000.00, and limits [Creditor's] preference exposure accordingly.\"].)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, in its opposition to Debtor's summary judgment motion, Creditor argued that the bankruptcy court couldn't grant summary judgment as to whether the $ 134,745.95 in payments were avoidable under \u00a7 547(b) because \"there is a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the amounts [Creditor] would have received in a hypothetical Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.\" (Doc. 14-15 at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 13, 2017, the bankruptcy court held oral argument on the cross-motions for summary judgment. (Doc. 14-21.) The argument can be broken down as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u2022 During the first portion of the argument, the court addressed Creditor's motion\n   for summary judgment and held that several of Creditor's arguments (which aren't at issue in this appeal) lacked merit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 Next, the court addressed Debtor's motion for summary judgment. Debtor's counsel initially argued that \"we think that the Court could grant summary judgment based on our hypothetical liquidation ... because [Creditor] has not presented an alternative liquidation analysis and so the only evidence before the Court is what we've presented.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the court raised several concerns with Debtor's hypothetical liquidation analysis, and Debtor's counsel responded by stating that \"this argument wasn't made by [Creditor] so I think ... if the Court denied us summary judgment on this issue we'd like the opportunity to review and ... fully brief the issue.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Afterward, the court raised additional concerns with Debtor's hypothetical liquidation analysis, which related to the impact of an IRS lien. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Next, the court addressed Creditor's argument that it was entitled to summary judgment on its \"new value\" affirmative defense under \u00a7 547(c)(4). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Finally, after conferring with the parties and making clear that \"I don't want to make this into another motion for summary judgment\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36), the court ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefing on the following three issues: (1) \"more definition as to the issues [the Court] raised with respect to the hypothetical lien creditor analysis\"; (2) \"the application of new value after the reduction pursuant to the assignment\"; and (3) \"can the estate representative step into the shoes of the IRS and challenge [Creditor's] lien?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 5, 2018, Debtor filed a \"supplemental brief in support of Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\" (Doc. 14-22.) In the introductory paragraph of the brief, Debtor stated that, during oral argument, the court had rejected all but one of the arguments contained in Creditor's motion for summary judgment (reserving judgment only as to the \"new value\" affirmative defense) and had solicited \"additional briefing on a few discrete issues before ruling on whether Debtor is entitled to summary judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) Debtor then defended the sufficiency of its hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation analysis, which suggested that \"the entire $ 134,745.97 is a preference\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-12), emphasized that Creditor \"never submitted any evidence as to the hypothetical chapter 7 liquidation\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 n.3), addressed Creditor's \"new value\" argument (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13), and requested the entry of summary judgment in its favor (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14). Debtor also requested an evidentiary hearing if the Court had any concerns regarding its hypothetical liquidation analysis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 n.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On January 19, 2018, Creditor filed its supplemental brief. (Doc. 14-23.) In it, Creditor argued that \"Debtor's hypothetical Chapter 7 analysis is riddled with flaws\" and that \"the ultimate preference exposure to [Creditor] after application of its new value defense depends on the Court's ruling as to [Creditor's] preference exposure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Creditor also acknowledged that its \"new value\" affirmative defense-even if accepted by the court-wouldn't entitle it to complete relief under Debtor's hypothetical liquidation\n   scenarios. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12 [\"Debtor's potential recovery must be reduced, at a minimum, ... to $ 74,246.50. When combined with [Creditor's] new value defense, [Creditor's] preference liability is further reduced by the amount of the new value of $ 54,000, leaving $ 20,246.50.\"].) Thus, Creditor concluded that \"the Court should enter an order denying summary judgment, or grant summary judgment in favor of Debtor only to the limited extent that [Creditor] is held liable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Bankruptcy Court's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On March 21, 2018, the bankruptcy court issued an order denying Debtor's motion for summary judgment, granting Creditor's motion for summary judgment, and dismissing Debtor's complaint. (Doc. 14-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   After determining that Creditor was undersecured because its claim was subordinate to the IRS's previously-perfected claim (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-15), the court addressed whether Creditor had collected more than the value of its secured claim. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-17.) As part of this analysis, the court applied the \"add-back method\" to calculate the value of the liquidation estate. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Specifically, the court added the stipulated value of Debtor's personal property to the amount of distributions made during the preference to conclude the total estate was worth $ 143,422.93. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, the court also concluded this figure needed to be reduced by $ 38,861.55-to $ 104,581.38-to account for a first-priority lien held by the IRS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Because this figure was smaller than the amount Creditor actually collected during the preference period ($ 134,745.97), the court concluded that Creditor \"collected $ 30,164.59 in excess of its secured claim during the Preference Period.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the court considered Creditor's \"new value\" defense and its effect on Creditor's preference liability. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court concluded that Debtor provided \"no legal support for its argument that the new value must be extended in 'good faith' \" and thus concluded that Creditor advanced $ 54,000 of new value to Debtor during the preference period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, the court addressed how Creditor would have fared in a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) When doing so, the Court rejected the approach set forth in the declaration submitted by Debtor and conducted its own analysis. The court concluded that (1) Creditor only had $ 80,745.97 in preference liability, because the actual distributions it received ($ 134,745.97) should be reduced by its in new value credit ($ 54,000); (2) the value of its collateral was $ 104,581.38 (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the value of the estate minus the IRS lien); and (3) because Creditor's collateral exceeded its preference liability, Debtor's claim necessarily failed and Creditor was entitled to summary judgment.

(Doc. 14 at 10-11.) Specifically, Debtor argues that, because it was the only party to submit affirmative evidence addressing how a hypothetical chapter 7 liquidation analysis would have proceeded, the bankruptcy court's disagreement with that analysis authorized the court, at most, to deny Debtor's summary judgment motion-the court couldn't go further and grant Creditor's cross-motion, particularly where Creditor admitted in its papers that the case involved a \"genuine issue of material fact\" as to how the hypothetical analysis would turn out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In its response, Creditor argues that it wasn't required to submit a competing liquidation analysis in order to obtain summary judgment, that Debtor wasn't unfairly surprised by the court's liquidation analysis because the court set forth its rationale during the oral argument and then afforded Debtor the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing, and that the court's analysis was correct on the merits because the court was entitled to consider the record as a whole. (Doc. 15 at 6-9.) In its reply, Debtor repeats its position that \"[e]ven if the Bankruptcy Court disagreed with Debtor's evidence or found it unpersuasive, because [Creditor] submitted no evidence to the contrary, the Court's only permissible option was to set the chapter 7 liquidation analysis for trial.\" (Doc. 18 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court agrees with Debtor that the bankruptcy court shouldn't have granted summary judgment to Creditor under these circumstances. Debtor was the plaintiff in the underlying case and asserted a claim to recover over $ 134,000 from Creditor under the theory that the payments constituted preferential transfers under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20547\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). When it came time to file motions for summary judgment, Creditor could have filed a\n   <em>\n    Celotex\n   </em>\n   -style motion seeking summary judgment on this claim under the theory that Debtor, as the party bearing the burden of proof, couldn't meet its burden as to one of the elements of its claim (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the requirement, under \u00a7 547(b)(5), of showing that Creditor received more than it would have received in a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Simplexity, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268681\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/578/255/#p262\">\n    578 B.R. 255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (Bankr.

Instead, Creditor only sought summary judgment on its affirmative defense, under \u00a7 547(c)(4), that it was entitled to a $ 54,000 offset against any sum that was ultimately deemed avoidable under \u00a7 547(b). Creditor also asserted, in its opposition to Debtor's motion for summary judgment, that there were disputed issues of fact concerning how the hypothetical liquidation analysis would turn out. (Doc. 14-15 at 10.) Creditor didn't even request an across-the-board grant of summary judgment in its supplemental brief following oral argument-it merely asked the court to deny Debtor's motion for summary judgment and to rule in its favor on its \"new value\" affirmative defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   There are, to be sure, limited circumstances in which it might be permissible for a court to issue a\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   grant of summary judgment to a non-moving party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Those circumstances, however, aren't present here. The bankruptcy court told the parties at the conclusion of oral argument-when it was soliciting supplemental briefing-that it wasn't seeking to expand the issues raised by the parties. (Doc. 14-21 at 36.) Furthermore, both parties' supplemental briefs suggested they viewed the only remaining live issues as (1) whether Debtor was entitled to summary judgment on its claim that the entire $ 134,745.95 was avoidable under \u00a7 547(b) and (2) whether Creditor was entitled to summary judgment on its claim that it was entitled to a $ 54,000 offset based on its \u00a7 547(c) affirmative defense. Debtor also included a request in its supplemental brief for an evidentiary hearing should the court harbor any concerns with its hypothetical liquidation analysis, and Debtor identified-during the February 13, 2019 oral argument before this Court-some of the additional pieces of evidence it would have submitted had the bankruptcy court held such a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Moreover, it is unclear whether the bankruptcy court was entitled, for summary judgment purposes, to rule against Debtor on the merits of the \u00a7 547(b)(5) analysis (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the outcome of a hypothetical Chapter 7 liquidation) given that Debtor submitted evidence on this issue (the Creech affidavit) but Creditor did not.
