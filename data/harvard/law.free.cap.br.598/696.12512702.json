On February 21, 2018, Persio A. Nunez (\"Debtor\") and Margarita M. Ferriera (\"Ferriera\") filed a joint letter (the \"February 21 Letter\"), entitled \"Letter Requesting a Hearing,\" stating,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , that they retained Bradley C. Rosen, Esq. (\"Rosen\") in 2015 to represent them in this bankruptcy case and related matters. (Feb. 21 Ltr., ECF No. 60.) Annexed to the February 21 Letter is a document entitled \"STATUS REPORT FOR MARGARITA FERRIERA &amp; PERSIO NUNEZ,\" sent by Rosen to the Debtor and Ferriera, dated September 25, 2015 (the \"Status Report\") in which Rosen seeks payment of $ 50,000 pursuant to a purported fee agreement, dated August 4, 2015 (the \"Fee Agreement\") (Feb. 21 Ltr. at 3, ECF No. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rosen is not the attorney of record for the Debtor or Ferriera in this bankruptcy, nor in the associated adversary proceeding, and, prior to August 28, 2018, Rosen never disclosed his representation of the Debtor or the existence of the post-petition retainer agreements and payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 9, 2018, the Court entered an Order directing that Rosen show cause why the Court should not impose sanctions on Rosen for his failure to adequately represent the Debtor and why the Court should not order the return of fees paid in connection with this case and determine the Fee Agreement excessive pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 2017 (the \"First Rosen OSC\"). (First Rosen OSC, ECF No. 63.) Also on March 9, 2018, the Debtor filed a letter indicating that he had paid a total of $ 70,000 in legal fees to Rosen. (Mar. 9 Ltr., ECF No. 61.) On August 28, 2018, a hearing on the First Rosen OSC was held at which Rosen, the Debtor, and Ferriera, appeared.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 5, 2018, the Court entered an Order adjourning the hearing on the First Rosen OSC and (i) directing Rosen and the Debtor to submit copies of all retainer agreements entered into between the parties; (ii) directing the Debtor to submit proof of any payments, including payments made through an intermediary, made to Rosen with respect to this bankruptcy case; and (iii) directing Rosen to submit all time records that relate to his representation of the Debtor with respect to, or relating to, this bankruptcy case (the \"Second Rosen OSC\"). (Second Rosen OSC, ECF No. 84.) A hearing on the Second Rosen OSC was held on January 22, 2019, at which Rosen, the Debtor, and Ferriera, appeared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and the Eastern District of New York standing order of reference dated August 28, 1986, as amended by order dated December 5, 2012.

Nunez (\"Nunez\"),\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   , filed a voluntary petition\n   under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. (Pet., ECF No. 1.) Although, on July 8, 2014, Alejandro Gil, Esq. (\"Gil\") filed a letter indicating that the Debtor had retained him in this bankruptcy case (Ltr., ECF No. 14), by letter dated January 8, 2016, Gil stated that the Debtor had \"changed his mind the very same day [July 8, 2014] and he never tendered any retainer fees nor did he sign any retainer agreement.\" (Ltr., ECF No. 37.) According to the Debtor's petition, the primary assets of the Debtor's estate were two parcels of real property, a vacant lot located at 99-09 37th Avenue, Corona NY (the \"99-09 Property\"), and the Debtor's residence located at 99-11 37th Avenue, Corona NY (the \"99-11 Property\"). (Pet., ECF No. 1; Final Report, ECF No. 70.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On January 22, 2016, an Order was entered granting the motion of Emigrant Funding Corporation (\"Emigrant\") for relief from the automatic stay with respect to the 99-11 Property. (Lift Stay Order, ECF No. 38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 25, 2016, the Chapter 7 trustee (the \"Trustee\") commenced an adversary proceeding against Ferriera seeking to avoid, as a fraudulent conveyance, the January 6, 2010 transfer (the \"99-09 Transfer\") by the Debtor of the 99-09 Property to Ferriera (the \"Adversary Proceeding\") (Compl., 16-01034-cec, ECF No. 1.) The Debtor and Ferriera \"are not married but they've been together for over 35 years.\" (8/28 Tr. 28:10-12.) At the time the Trustee commenced the adversary proceeding, a foreclosure action by Nationstar Mortgage LLC (\"Nationstar\"), holder of note and mortgage on the 99-09 Property, was pending in state court. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   So-Ordered Stip., ECF No. 43.) In addition to Nationstar's mortgage, there was a judgment lien in favor of Angel Villavicencio (\"Villavicencio\") against the 99-09 Property in the amount of $ 492,568.27, as well as various Environmental Control Board violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On May 9, 2016, a default judgment was entered in favor of the Trustee and against Ferriera, setting aside the 99-09 Transfer. (Default J., 16-01034-cec, ECF No. 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After reaching an agreement with Nationstar and Villavicencio, the Trustee sold the 99-09 Property on May 25, 2017. (Final Report at 2, ECF No. 70.) The Debtor received a discharge in this bankruptcy case on July 7, 2017. (Discharge Order, ECF No. 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The February 21, 2018 Letter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although Rosen had communicated with the Office of the United States Trustee with regard to this bankruptcy, his involvement in this case was first revealed to the Court by the Debtor's February 21, 2018 Letter. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rosen Opp. at Ex. 7, ECF No. 78-7 (Ltr. to UST); Feb. 21 Ltr., ECF No. 60.) The February 21 Letter was filed almost two years after the default judgment was entered in the Adversary Proceeding, and approximately nine months after the 99-09 Property was sold. In the February 21 Letter, the Debtor claims that he and Ferriera were not served in the Adversary Proceeding, asserts that the 99-09 Transfer should not have been set aside as fraudulent, and states, in pertinent part,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Please note that in connection with this matter, I am supposed to have been represented by attorney Bradley C. Rosen of 189 Brookview Drive Rochester, New York with whom I signed a retainer and paid legal fees. See attached signed letter from Mr. Rosen dated September 22, 2015 in which he states that he \"appeared\" on behalf of both Margarita Ferriera and myself. Please note that Mr. Rosen's letter refers \"a portion of the Court docket\" which he reprinted and claims shows he acted on my behalf\n   on September 8, 2015. However, according to the enclosed printed court docket, there is no such entry and made no such appearance on my behalf. Unfortunately, to-date I have had no news concerning this matter from either the trustee or Mr. Rosen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   It is clear to me that the court was led to act without regard to my interests or those of Ms. Ferriera over whom the court had no jurisdiction. She and I therefore request a hearing before the court to determine whether the trustee and Mr. Rosen acted without notice or regard to my interests and to know what has happe[ned] to my case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Feb. 21 Ltr., ECF No. 60.) Additionally, in the Status Report attached to the February 21 Letter, that Rosen sent to the Debtor and Ferriera on September 25, 2015, Rosen states,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   I wanted you to know that after my first contact with the Office of The United States Trustee, everything, including the foreclose actions, has been halted....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The Trustee wanted to have your case thrown out of the Bankruptcy Court, basically handing you naked to the wolves. Since I've appeared, he stopped this attempt, keeping your case alive and in the Court. The result is that all of your assets are still protected. More importantly, this means that the foreclosures are now stopped, just as I told you they would be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   It's clear that I've spent a great deal of attorney time on your case. What you don't know is that I'm now dealing with the Department of Justice and other separate Federal agencies. This is very intricate and tricky work that, by its very nature, places me at personal risk. But this was something I knew might be part of the job when we signed the agreement on August 4, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In return, you promised in that same Agreement to pay me $ 50,000 (which was supposed to have been paid before I started). Despite all the work I have done, success I have had, and risk I have now taken, you have paid me only $ 3,000 of the promised $ 50,000. This is not acceptable. I need you to make good on your promise (which I acted upon in good faith) and wire at least a substantial portion of the remaining $ 47,000 to me by Friday the 25th. I have supplied my banking coordinates below for your convenience.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Feb. 21 Ltr. at 3, ECF No. 60.) The Debtor filed another letter on March 9, 2018, reciting the same requests made in the February 21 Letter and further stating, \"I also have had no communication from Mr. Rosen to whom Ms. Ferreira [sic] paid $ 70,000.00 on my behalf to represent us both in this matter. Mr. Alejandro Gil is not now and never has been my lawyer.\" (Mar. 9 Ltr., ECF No. 61.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although served with the First Rosen OSC on March 14, 2018, (Cert. of Notice, ECF No. 64), Rosen filed his opposition on August 28, 2018, the date of the hearing. (Rosen Opp., ECF No. 78.) As a result, the hearing was adjourned and the parties were directed to submit to the Court copies of all retainer agreements entered into between the parties; the Debtor was directed to submit proof of any payments made to Rosen; and Rosen was directed to submit his time records. (Second Rosen OSC, ECF No. 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    The Retainer Agreements\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Debtor and Ferriera entered into two legal services agreements with Rosen, both of which were after the Debtor filed\n   this bankruptcy case on April 10, 2014. The first agreement is dated May 15, 2015 (the \"May Retainer\") (Rosen Opp. at Ex. 16, ECF No. 78-16), and the second agreement is dated August 4, 2015 (the \"August Retainer\") (collectively the \"Retainer Agreements\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. 3, ECF No. 78-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The May Retainer\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The May Retainer is between Rosen and the Debtor and Ferriera. (Rosen Opp. at Ex. 16, ECF No. 78-16.) The May Retainer provides that the Debtor and Ferriera will pay \"a single, lump-sum fee of $ 20,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rosen stated that he believes that the $ 20,000 was \"paid entirely by Ferriera.\" (Rosen Opp. \u00b6 53, ECF No. 78.) The Debtor states that this fee was paid by Ferriera \"on his behalf.\" (Mar. 9 Ltr., ECF No. 61.) The May Retainer further provides that if the Debtor and Ferriera authorize Rosen to attempt to \"recover any seized property and/or compensation for any identifiable damages,\" and if Rosen is successful, then Rosen will collect an additional fee \"on a [one-third] contingency basis ... (meaning that Clients would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   pay\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   retainer or other fees, and Attorney only gets paid from anything recovered...).\" (Rosen Opp. at Ex. 16, ECF No. 78-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Pursuant to the May Retainer, \"Attorney shall provide Clients with legal services that pertain to the various issues and actions involving the property located at 99-11....\" (Rosen Opp. at Ex. 16, ECF No. 78-16.) The May Retainer provides examples of the work that Rosen will perform with regard to the 99-11 Property, including (a) defending the Debtor and Ferriera against Emigrant's attempts to foreclosure or otherwise enforce their mortgage; (b) investigating the mortgage and security agreement with Emigrant; and (c) investigating \"any other judgements [sic] that may have also been entered against Clients.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   8/28 Tr. 14:8-9 (stating that the May Retainer was \"[i]n regards to the property at 9911 ... because of the foreclosure proceeding...\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rosen contends that, on May 15, 2015, the date of the May Retainer, he was unaware that the Debtor was in bankruptcy, and, neither the Debtor nor Ferriera informed him of the bankruptcy. (Rosen Opp. \u00b6 51, ECF No. 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     The August Retainer\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Rosen, the Debtor, and Ferriera, entered into the August Retainer. (Rosen Opp. at Ex. 3, ECF No. 78-3.) Pursuant to the August Retainer, Rosen was to perform the following legal services:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   a. Regarding\n   <em>\n    In Re Persio A. Nunez\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 14-41746 (CEC) (the \"Bankruptcy\"). Attorney shall investigate, research and examine, in full depth and detail, the entirety of the Bankruptcy and any and all matters related, directly and/or indirectly, to it. The scope of Attorney's investigation shall include, but not be limited to, the propriety, legality and/or validity of: the manner in which the Bankruptcy Petition was created; the contents of the Bankruptcy Petition; all other filings made in the Bankruptcy; the conduct and actions of all parties who appeared in the Bankruptcy; the legitimacy of the basis of the claims of the Creditors; any other actions or proceeds related to any Creditor's claim (such as other lawsuits and/or liens and judgements [sic] obtained therein); and any transactions (such as loans) that are in any manner connected to any Creditor's claim. If Attorney discovers anything that he reasonably believes renders the Bankruptcy, or any Creditor claim filed therein,\n   invalid, Attorney shall take any and all reasonable and permissible action to have same dismissed, voided or otherwise nullified.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   b. CLIENTS UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ATTORNEY SHALL NOT APPEAR OR REPRESENT EITHER R BOTH OF THEM IN THE PENDING BANKRUPTCY [sic] ACTION, OR IN ANY OTHER BANKRUPTCY ACTION.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The August Retainer provides that the Debtor and Ferriera will pay \"a single, lump-sum fee of $ 50,000.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As with the May Retainer, the August Retainer provides for additional fees on a contingency basis, stating that, \"[i]f Clients want Attorney to pursue any recovery on their behalf, then Clients shall give Attorney written authorization to do so,\" and if successful, Rosen is entitled to one-third of the value of the recovery. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Rosen stated that he believes the $ 50,000 \"was paid entirely by a mutual colleague, Mr. Manny Heredia....\" (Rosen Opp. \u00b6 56, ECF No. 78; 8/28 Tr. 17:7-8 (\"I dispute that Mr. Nunez paid it. I do not dispute having received $ 70,000\"), 18:3-5 (\"And I did not at any time receive any payment directly from Mr. Nunez nor did I believe that any of the money that I was receiving was from Mr. Nunez.\").) The Debtor contends that Heredia was acting as an intermediary and Ferriera was the source of the funds. (8/28 Tr. 8:3-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   All parties agree that Rosen was paid a total of $ 70,000. It is undisputed that Rosen did not file any statement disclosing the May Retainer or the August Retainer or disclosing his receipt of legal fees in this case either prior to, or subsequent to, entering into the Retainer Agreements and receiving payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Rosen's Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rosen contends that because he was unaware of the bankruptcy when he entered into the May Retainer, he could not have made the required disclosures pursuant to \u00a7 329(a) and Bankruptcy Rule 2016(b). (1/22 Tr. 10:1-10.) He further contends that the May Retainer relates to a state court foreclosure proceeding with respect to the 99-11 Property, a matter that is not connected to this bankruptcy case. (8/28 Tr. 13:5-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   With regard to the August Retainer, Rosen contends that he did not represent the Debtor or Ferriera in this bankruptcy case, as evidenced by,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the statement contained in paragraph 2(b) of the August Retainer, and, as such, Rosen asserts that \"it is a tautology that I did not fail to give them adequate representation.\" (Rosen Opp. \u00b6 42, ECF No. 78.) Rosen states that the August Retainer was entered into when he learned of the bankruptcy and, notwithstanding the services delineated in the August Retainer, Rosen contends that he was not charging the Debtor for any work done in relation to this bankruptcy, and was only charging for worked performed in the state court. (8/28 Tr. 17:23-18:1; 1/22 Tr. 11:23-12:4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Alternatively, Rosen contends that, although both retainers provide for billing at a flat fee rate, rather than hourly, \"over the three year period in which I provided legal services to the [Debtor and Ferriera], I provided them with more than $ 70,000 worth of legal services.\" (Rosen Opp. \u00b6 60, ECF No. 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rosen states that he was unaware of the disclosure requirements set forth in the Bankruptcy Rule 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1/22 Tr. 29:20-23 (\"[I] didn't realize the full scope of the rules. I just knew in general that I couldn't appear in bankruptcy court which is exactly why I put in the retainer agreement\n   that I was not representing them in bankruptcy.\").) Rosen, however, argues that because (i) he did not represent the Debtor in this bankruptcy, at stated in the August Retainer; (ii) at the time both retainers were entered into, the Debtor had bankruptcy counsel; and (iii) he did not charge the Debtor for the work he performed in relation to the bankruptcy, he should not be sanctioned for his failure to disclose pursuant to \u00a7 329(a) and Bankruptcy Rule 2016(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

(Lift Stay Order, ECF No. 38.) Rosen's representation under the May Retainer was in connection with this bankruptcy in that it involved the Debtor's primary asset, it involved attempting to challenge the validity and enforcement of the mortgagee's claim, and it was entered into post-petition. Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Ostas\n   </em>\n   , it is difficult to see how the May Retainer was not made in connection with this bankruptcy, and therefore subject to the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 329(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Providing more than $ 70,000 in Legal Services\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Rosen argues that regardless of the services delineated in the August Retainer, he did not charge the Debtor for the work performed in connection with this bankruptcy, and the value of the services he performed in the state court exceed the amounts received.

Whether or not Rosen's fees are reasonable, \"the fact that the fee may or may not have been reasonable or have been earned does not justify a disregard for the rules of disclosure.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Stewart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511666\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/775/#p782\">\n    583 B.R. 775\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 782 (Bankr. W.D. Okla. 2018) (citations omitted). Moreover, the August Retainer does not provide for Rosen to charge the Debtor with respect to the foreclosure action in state court and only provides for work in connection to the bankruptcy case. If, as Rosen argues, he was not charging the Debtor for any work performed with respect to this bankruptcy, it is unclear what, if any, work was performed under the August Retainer. Further, the May Retainer was a flat fee, and only provided for additional fees to be incurred after pre-approval by the Debtor, based on a one-third fee on any recovery. Rosen concedes this did not occur. In any event, Rosen was required to disclose the\n   May Retainer and the payments he received for his work performed in the state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Source of Funds\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In Rosen's opposition, and at the hearings on August 28, 2018 and January 22, 2019, Rosen emphasized that the Debtor was not the source of the payments made under the Retainers.
