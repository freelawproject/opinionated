Section 1409(c) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a trustee in a case under title 11 may commence a proceeding arising in or related to such case as statutory successor to the debtor or\n   creditors under section 541 or 544(b) of title 11 in the district court for the district where the State or Federal court sits in which, under applicable nonbankruptcy venue provisions, the debtor or creditors, as the case may be, may have commenced an action on which such proceeding is based if the case under title 11 had not been commenced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Section 1409(c) provides an additional venue for pursuing proceedings specified therein, and is not a limitation on a trustee's authority to sue in the \"home court\" as provided by \u00a7 1409(a). Subsection (c) includes \"a proceeding arising in or related to such case ... under section 541 or 544(b) of title 11 ....\" A proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20544\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) clearly arises under title 11. Some courts reason that \u00a7 1409(c) would be inapplicable to any proceeding under \u00a7 544(b) unless \"arising in\" proceedings include \"arising under\" proceedings, and that, to avoid that result, \"arising in\" proceedings in \u00a7 1409(c) must be interpreted as including \"arising under\" proceedings. These courts extend that interpretation to apply to \"arising in\" proceedings in \u00a7 1409(b) as well.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raymond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%206498170\">\n    2009 WL 6498170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 ;\n   <em>\n    Little Lake Industries\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6518524\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/158/478/#p484\">\n    158 B.R. at 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nevertheless, the inclusion of \"arising under\" proceedings in \u00a7 1409(a) but not in the restrictions of \u00a7 1409(b) on venue under \u00a7 1409(a) requires treating \"arising under\" proceedings for which venue is proper under \u00a7 1409(a) as not subject to \u00a7 1409(b). That conclusion is not altered by the language of \u00a7 1409(c), which, unlike \u00a7 1409(b), is not an exception to \u00a7 1409(a). Moreover, \u00a7 1409(c) does not provide an exclusive venue for the claims it specifies, but instead was intended to provide an alternative venue for certain claims described in \u00a7 1409(a). The important focus for purposes of the issue this decision addresses is on a comparison of \u00a7 1409(a) and the exceptions thereto contained in \u00a7 1409(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   My analysis is not altered by the possibility that the language \"arising in\" in \u00a7 1409(c) might be viewed as including the \u00a7 544(b) proceedings it specifies (proceedings that \"arise under\" title 11). Correcting the oversight of not including \"arising under\" proceedings in allowing an alternative venue choice for \u00a7 544(b) proceedings hardly shows that the deliberate inclusion of \"arising under\" proceedings in \u00a7 1409(a) but not in \u00a7 1409(b) was not meant to have consequences. Whatever is the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1409(c), which is not the issue before the court in this adversary proceeding, will not alter the conclusion that \u00a7 1409(b) does not apply to avoidance proceedings such as this adversary proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    J &amp; J Chemical, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20183516\">\n    2019 WL 183516\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 1409(b) would produce odd results if it includes proceedings \"arising under title 11.\" Section 1409(b) only applies in three types of proceedings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (1) \"a proceeding ... to recover a money judgment of or property worth less than $ 1,300\";\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (2) \"a proceeding ... to recover ... a consumer debt of less than $ 19,250\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (3) \"a proceeding ... to recover ... a debt (excluding a consumer debt) against a noninsider of less than $ 12,850 ....\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Sometimes a trustee brings a proceeding only to avoid a transfer and not to recover a debt, money judgment, or property. For example, a trustee might bring a proceeding to avoid as preferential the prepetition grant of a security interest on tangible personal property that the trustee possesses. Once the lien is avoided, the trustee does not need to recover a monetary\n   amount, nor does the trustee need to recover the property (which the trustee already possesses). An avoidance proceeding is not, within the meaning of \u00a7 1409(b), a proceeding to recover a debt, money judgment, or property. It follows that a trustee can always sue in the \"home court\" of the case under \u00a7 1409(a) to avoid a transfer without running afoul of \u00a7 1409(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Byron C. Starcher,\n   <em>\n    Second Thoughts on \"Home Court Advantage\" for Small-Dollar Preference Defendants\n   </em>\n   , 25-MAR Am. Bankr. Inst. J. 10, 52 (2006) (stating that \"a court cannot plausibly extend \u00a7 1409(b) to avoidance actions under \u00a7 547(b).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   When a trustee is entitled to avoid a transfer and also is entitled to recover a judgment once the transfer is avoided, \u00a7 1409(b) does not bar the trustee's suing to avoid the transfer in the \"home court\" as the proper venue under \u00a7 1409(a). However, if the \"arising in\" language in \u00a7 1409(b) includes a proceeding \"arising under\" title 11 to recover a money judgment, then a trustee, upon avoiding a transfer in the \"home court\" as a proper venue under \u00a7 1409(a), could nevertheless be barred by \u00a7 1409(b) from using the \"home court\" as the proper venue for recovering a judgment for the amount of the avoided transfer. The avoidance of the transfer is usually the more difficult step a trustee must pursue in the two-step process of first avoiding a transfer and only then recovering a monetary judgment for the amount of the transfer. It would be odd if, as allowed by \u00a7 1409(a), a trustee is entitled to sue the transferee in the \"home court\" to avoid the transfer and put the transferee to the burden of defending in the \"home court\" against avoidance of the transfer, but \u00a7 1409(b) (if it is interpreted as being applicable to \"arising under\" proceedings) could require the trustee, upon avoiding the transfer, to sue the transferee elsewhere to recover a monetary judgment for the amount of the avoided transfer. That odd result makes it doubtful that Congress intended to have \"arising in\" proceedings to which \u00a7 1409(b) applies include \"arising under\" proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Another odd result is that if \u00a7 1409(b) is interpreted as applying to \"arising under\" proceedings, a trustee could be barred by \u00a7 1409(b) from suing in the \"home court\" to make a recovery,\n   <em>\n    pursuant to the trustee's recovery powers\n   </em>\n   , of an avoided transfer but \u00a7 1409(b) would not bar a debtor's suing in the \"home court\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) and (i) to avoid the same transfer and to recover,\n   <em>\n    pursuant to the trustee's recovery powers\n   </em>\n   , the amount of the transfer. When a trustee decides not to attempt to avoid an avoidable transfer, an individual debtor may be able to avoid the transfer under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) by invoking the trustee's power to avoid the transfer and then proceed under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (i) to recover a judgment for the amount of the avoided transfer by invoking the trustee's power to make such a recovery. Section 1409(b) applies only to proceedings brought by a trustee, and thus does not apply to proceedings brought by a debtor. Section 1409(b) plainly would never bar the debtor's suing under \u00a7 1409(a) in the \"home court\" both to avoid a transfer and to recover the amount of the transfer. It seems odd that \u00a7 1409(b) could be interpreted as barring a trustee from suing in the \"home court\" to recover the amount of an avoided transfer but if the trustee decides not to pursue avoidance of the transfer, \u00a7 1409(b) would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   bar the debtor from suing in the \"home court\" both to avoid the transfer under \u00a7 522(h), and,\n   <em>\n    pursuant to the trustee's recovery powers\n   </em>\n   , to recover the amount of the avoided transfer under \u00a7 522(i). That odd result is avoided when \u00a7 1409(b) is interpreted as being inapplicable to \"arising under\" proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   ORDERED that the motion to dismiss this adversary proceeding is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    In contrast,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201473\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1473\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d) included proceedings \"arising under title 11 ... based on claims arising after the commencement of the case from the operation of the business of the debtor\" as proceedings that had to be brought \"only in the bankruptcy court for the district where a State or Federal court sits in which, under applicable nonbankruptcy venue provisions, an action on such claim may have been brought.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In contrast, \u00a7 1473(a) and (e) had not included \"arising under\" proceedings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Congress did not add \"arising under\" proceedings to \u00a7 1409(c) (which remained identical to repealed \u00a7 1473(c) ), but as discussed later, \u00a7 1409(c) does not place restrictions on venue under \u00a7 1409(a) and was intended to provide an alternate venue for certain proceedings, with the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1409(c) having no impact on the proper interpretation of \u00a7 1409(b) as a restriction on venue under \u00a7 1409(a).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
