BRODERICK, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This bankruptcy appeal arises out of the third attempt by a group of former customers of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC (\"BLMIS\") to circumvent a permanent injunction entered by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, in connection with its approval of a $7.2 billion settlement between the Trustee of BLMIS and a number of parties affiliated with Jeffry M. Picower (the \"Picower Parties\" and, together with the Trustee, \"Appellees\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Appellants-former BLMIS customers and now creditors of the BLMIS estate-seek review in this Court after the Bankruptcy Court denied their application for a declaration that their proposed Third Amended Complaint (the\n   <em>\n    \"Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint\") against the Picower Parties asserted claims that were not barred by the\n   permanent injunction. Because I agree with the Bankruptcy Court's determination that the\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint asserts claims that are duplicative and derivative of claims previously brought by the Trustee, I conclude that the\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint violates the permanent injunction and I AFFIRM the decision of the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Madoff's Ponzi Scheme and BLMIS's Bankruptcy\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This appeal arises from the Ponzi scheme devised by Bernard L. Madoff (\"Madoff\"), the ensuing bankruptcy of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, and the resulting bankruptcy proceedings. A detailed discussion of Madoff's Ponzi scheme and the events giving rise to the bankruptcy can be found in several prior decisions issued by the Bankruptcy Court, but in brief, the scheme operated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Madoff claimed he was investing BLMIS's customers' funds in stocks and then hedging with option trades. In reality, Madoff never invested any of the funds. Instead, BLMIS generated fictitious account statements reflecting trades that were never actually completed and profits that were never actually generated. Because BLMIS was not actually generating profit, it paid customers who withdrew funds with the proceeds of other customers' investments. Eventually, BLMIS was unable to meet its customers' demands for withdrawals, and the scheme collapsed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    A &amp; G Goldman P'ship v.

Irving H. Picard (the \"Trustee\"), as Trustee for the liquidation of BLMIS, determined that each BLMIS customer's claims against the bankruptcy estate would be calculated based on the \"Net Investment Method,\" crediting the amount of cash the customer deposited into his BLMIS account, less any amounts withdrawn from it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bernard L. Madoff Inv. Sec.

Under the Net Investment Method, a customer's recovery was limited to the amount of his investment-that is, he could not recover the false profits that BLMIS had reported on his customer statements. Some customers, including Appellants in the current action, argued that the Trustee should also return their fictitious profits to them; however, the Bankruptcy Court upheld the Trustee's use of the Net Investment Method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Bernard L.

The Second Circuit, in turn, affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's decision, concluding that permitting customers to collect their false profits would \"have the absurd effect of treating fictitious and arbitrarily assigned paper profits as real and would give legal effect to Madoff's machinations.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Bernard L.

The Trustee's complaint alleged that the Picower Parties were aware of the Ponzi scheme, were \"complicit[ ] in [Madoff's] fraud,\" and actively participated in the scheme by directing BLMIS employees to create fictitious trading records in their accounts. (App'x 869; Bankr. Op.,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269103\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/203/#p205\">\n    568 B.R. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) To support the contention that Picower had knowledge of Madoff's fraud, the complaint cited Picower and Madoff's close relationship, Picower's understanding of BLMIS's operations, and the \"implausibly high rates of return\" that Picower received on his purported investments.\n   <em>\n    Goldman III App. Ct.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20F.%20App%27x%20679\">\n    739 F.

The Trustee and the Picower Parties (along with the Government) ultimately entered into a global settlement agreement, pursuant to which the Picower Parties agreed to forfeit $7.235 billion, to be distributed to BLMIS victims. (App'x 1125.) On January 13, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement and issued a permanent injunction, which defines the parties against whom it applies. The injunction provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   any BLMIS customer or creditor of the BLMIS estate who filed or could have filed a claim in the liquidation, anyone acting on their behalf or in concert or participation with them, or anyone whose claim in any way arises from or is related to BLMIS or the Madoff Ponzi scheme, is hereby permanently enjoined from asserting any claim against the Picower BLMIS Accounts or the Picower Releasees that is duplicative or derivative of the claims brought by the Trustee, or which could have been brought by the Trustee against the Picower BLMIS Accounts or the Picower Releasees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Bankr.

The Fox Parties and the Goldman Parties have now each submitted three versions of their respective complaints, which allege that Picower constituted a \"control person\" of BLMIS under \u00a7 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t, thereby rendering Picower jointly and severally liable for BLMIS's fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Courts,\n   however, have uniformly concluded that each successive version of the Fox and Goldman complaints merely assert claims that are duplicative or derivative of those claims brought by the Trustee on behalf of BLMIS. These complaints have resulted in a total of eleven decisions from the Bankruptcy Court, other courts within this district, and the Second Circuit, concluding that the permanent injunction bars the Goldman and Fox complaints.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   These decisions have identified two primary deficiencies in the Fox and Goldman complaints. First, the complaints rest on allegations of Picower's misconduct with respect to his own accounts. Picower's actions-specifically, the withdrawal of billions of dollars in customer funds from his BLMIS accounts-\"harmed every BLMIS investor (and BLMIS itself) in the same way\": \"the very essence of the allegations against the Picower defendants is that they paid themselves out of assets that comprised other customers' accounts, thereby diminishing the value of BLMIS.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox I Dist. Ct.\n   </em>\n   , 848 F.Supp.2d at 480. Second, claims that Picower controlled Madoff's or BLMIS's activities in any way were purely \"conclusory\" and insufficient to support a \u00a7 20(a) control person claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldman I Dist.

The Bankruptcy Court examined in detail the ways in which the\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint differs from prior iterations of the Fox complaint. First, the court analyzed two sets of allegations that are unique to the\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint: (1) that, when BLMIS was in need of liquidity, Picower made two loans to BLMIS totaling approximately $200 million (the \"propping-up allegations\"); and (2) that Picower permitted BLMIS to list his name in BLMIS's records as a counterparty for fictitious options trades, thereby lending credibility to BLMIS's fraudulent representations that it was engaging in a high volume of options trading (the \"counterparty allegations\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269103\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/203/#p205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269103\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/203/#p205\">\n    at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Bankruptcy Court determined, however, that the propping-up and counterparty allegations describe conduct that was \"incident to Picower's fraudulent withdrawals,\" and\n   that merely served to push BLMIS further into bankruptcy, thereby \"harm[ing] every BLMIS investor (and BLMIS itself) in the same way.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269103\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/568/203/#p205\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 212-13 (citing\n   <em>\n    Goldman III Dist.

Although Picower and the other investors had assured Madoff that they would indemnify him for any losses he suffered, they did not honor that commitment, forcing Madoff to look elsewhere to recoup his losses. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 47:8-48:18, 52:9-53:12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The only statement in the Madoff Deposition that directly implicates Picower is Madoff's testimony that Picower was \"complicit in the crime.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 108:4-17.) However, read in context, this statement clearly refers to Picower's complicity in tax fraud with respect to his own accounts. Indeed, Appellants acknowledge as much. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants' Br. 6 (\"In the deposition, ... Madoff explicitly identified Jeffry Picower (along with two others) as being complicit in his crimes 'because they had violated tax laws based upon what I discussed with them and other things that I knew that they were doing with people in my firm, bookkeepers, who are all now under investigation.' \" (citing\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. A 108) ).) And that allegation of tax fraud is not new-in the\n   <em>\n    Fox II\n   </em>\n   Complaint, Appellants asserted that \"Picower ... demanded that BLMIS manufacture fictitious losses for the Picower Parties ... in order to reduce their state and federal tax liabilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Fox II\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 47.) Courts have ruled that those allegations relate to the Picower Parties' manipulation of \"their\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   BLMIS accounts, and are thus duplicative of the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Fox II Dist.

Even assuming arguendo that Madoff had testified to Picower's \"complicity\" in defrauding other BLMIS customers-which he did not-courts in this district have concluded that \"even significant participation in a primary violator's scheme to defraud is not equivalent to directing the primary violator to engage in that scheme,\" and that such conduct is therefore insufficient to establish control person liability.\n   <em>\n    Floyd v.

The Madoff Declaration was prepared in connection with an unrelated application by a former BLMIS customer, and it addresses whether that customer had made withdrawals from his BLMIS account. In the declaration, Madoff takes the unequivocal position that stock brokers only send checks to customers when those customers specifically request a withdrawal, (Madoff Decl. \u00b6 2), and that any such request must be submitted in writing, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3). The Madoff Declaration then abruptly states, without offering any context, that \"[p]ost 1990, I was put under enormous financial pressure by Jeffry Picower, who created the fraud I perpetrated and who was, by far, the primary beneficiary of the fraud.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) Contrary to Appellants' assertions, this extraneous, cryptic comment that Picower \"created\" Madoff's fraud is the epitome of a \"bare, conclusory statement.\" (Appellants' Br. 26.) Such \"general, conclusory allegations that Picower controlled BLMIS,\" even coming from Madoff himself, do not supply the\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint with the particularity necessary to avoid the permanent injunction.\n   <em>\n    Goldman III App. Ct.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=739%20F.%20App%27x%20679\">\n    739 F.

Moreover, I agree with the Bankruptcy Court's assessment that Madoff's comment that Picower was the \"primary beneficiary of the fraud,\" (Madoff Decl. \u00b6 4), is \"just another way of saying that [ Picower] withdrew more fictitious profits from BLMIS than anyone else.\" Bankr.

The\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint also fails to identify any other legal theory under which Picower's alleged conduct directly injured Appellants. Specifically, the\n   <em>\n    Fox III\n   </em>\n   Complaint is devoid of any allegations that Picower made direct misrepresentations to BLMIS customers; in fact, Appellants appear to acknowledge that their claims result from their \"reliance upon misrepresentations made to [Appellants] by Madoff.\" (Appellants' Br. 5.) For this reason, the cases that Appellants invoke are of no avail. In\n   <em>\n    In re Seven Seas Petroleum, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , plaintiff bondholders alleged that defendant-a secured creditor-knowingly utilized material misrepresentations \"to induce potential investors and existing investors in the unsecured notes to either acquire interests in or to refrain from selling interests in the unsecured notes.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3808057,3760622\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/522/575/\">\n    522 F.3d 575\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 581 (5th Cir. 2008). In other words, the defendant had made direct misrepresentations to investors.

On August 19, 2016, the draft Madoff declaration was \"submitted confidentially\" to the Bankruptcy Court in the underlying bankruptcy proceeding,\n    <em>\n     Sec.

Appellants, however, did not make the draft Madoff declaration part of the record in this adversary proceeding, even though the document was in their possession more than six months prior to the Bankruptcy Court's issuance of the decision below. In any event, the draft declaration appears redundant of other documents-e.g., the Madoff Declaration,\n    <em>\n     see supra\n    </em>\n    n.9-that are part of the record below, so there is no need for me to consider it. For these reasons, Appellants' request to submit the draft Madoff declaration, and to do so under seal, (Doc. 25), is DENIED.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    \"Appellants' Br.\" refers to the Appellants' Brief, filed June 23, 2017, (Doc. 19).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Fox III\n    </em>\n    Complaint asserts the same six causes of action-including a \u00a7 20(a) control person claim-against the Picower Parties as earlier iterations of the Fox complaint.
