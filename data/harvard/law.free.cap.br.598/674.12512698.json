(Doc. 28).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to March of 2016, Debtor testified that in order to start the farm that she had always dreamed of, she took out a loan to purchase twenty acres in Monroe County, Alabama. At the time of the land purchase, she was in a relationship with her boyfriend, Joshua Sawyer. Joshua Sawyer lived on the Frye Road Property with her and is also the father of her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 16, 2016, Debtor executed a promissory note, designated Loan Number 1, promising to pay the United States of America, acting through the Farm Service Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, the principal sum of $ 44,000 plus interest at a rate of 2.625%. On March 16, 2016, she also executed a promissory note, designated Loan Number 2, promising to pay FSA the principal sum of $ 6,000 plus interest at a rate of 2.625%. (Together, these promissory notes on Loan Number 1 and Loan Number 2 are hereinafter referred to as the \"Notes\"). On March 16, 2016, Reid also executed a security agreement granting FSA a security interest in \"All farm equipment ... and inventory, now owned or hereafter acquired by the Debtor, together with all replacements, substitutions, additions, and accessions thereto, including but not limited to the following which are located in the State of Alabama.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, the security agreement specifically included the following items:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   7' x 16' utility trailer;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   16' gooseneck livestock trailer; New Holland tractor;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   New Holland loader;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   6 \u00bd? disc with 20? blades; Silver Edge 6' cutter;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   8' drag with \u00bd? tines; Skid Steer bale spear;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   100 gallon Rubbermaid tank;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   300 gallon Rubbermaid tank;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   CNC Headgate head catch;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Ten (10) beef breeding cows; and Nine (9) calves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Reid purchased the collateral with the loan proceeds and kept the collateral in her possession at the Frye Road property. Under the security agreement, Debtor was supposed to keep the cattle or return them to the FSA. She admitted that she was not permitted to sell or otherwise dispose of the cattle or the equipment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In June of 2016, Reid learned of a dispute regarding the twenty acres she purchased to run the farm. The dispute involved a restriction against having cattle on the property. She testified that when she purchased the land in early 2016, she was told by the sellers that there were no restrictions on the property and that she could have cattle on it and such was reflected in the paperwork of the land purchase. In August of 2016, she went to court regarding the dispute; however, before going to court on the dispute, she contacted the FSA to ask for help in defending her, and the FSA told her that FSA lawyers represent the interests of FSA only and not FSA borrowers. The case was resolved with a finding that the restriction against cattle was in place, and she was given thirty (30) days to vacate the property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   By this time, Reid noticed that the collateral, except for the New Holland tractor\n   and the cattle, gradually went missing. Debtor was also becoming aware that Sawyer had a drug problem, and she began to suspect that he was selling the property for drugs. Sometime during October of 2016, Debtor saw a man in her field with a trailer, loading cattle onto the trailer. Debtor testified that she and her two kids approached the man, who goes by the name of \"Rigsby,\" and heatedly told him he was not permitted to remove the cattle from her property. Rigsby told her to take that issue up with her boyfriend, Joshua Sawyer. Debtor continued to attempt to stop Rigsby from taking the cattle but was ultimately unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Despite her efforts to stop Rigsby from taking the cattle, Reid did not contact the police or report any of the missing collateral as stolen. Reid did not seek authorization from FSA to allow anyone to conceal, remove, sell, or otherwise dispose of the missing collateral. Reid did not affirmatively inform the FSA that the cattle had been stolen, and she did not attempt to recover or locate the missing collateral, or contemporaneously notify FSA of the missing collateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sawyer was arrested in October 2016, for drug crimes and eluding the police. Reid vacated the Frye Road property in October or November 2016. The only collateral remaining at the property was the New Holland tractor, which she listed for sale on Facebook. Reid testified that she sold the New Holland tractor to an unknown purchaser for between $ 6,000.00 and $ 8,000.00. When asked whether she could obtain the purchaser's information from her Facebook history, Reid testified that she deleted the Facebook account years ago and no longer has access to that information. She then testified that she used the proceeds from the sale of the New Holland tractor to bail Sawyer out of jail. Reid admitted that she did not seek authorization from FSA to conceal, remove, sell, or otherwise dispose of the New Holland tractor, nor did she ever attempt to recover or locate the New Holland tractor, or notify FSA that she sold the New Holland tractor. Debtor testified that she never sold any of the other equipment listed in the security agreement, and only received money from the sale of the tractor, which was used as Sawyer's bail. When asked why she never filled out a police report regarding the stolen collateral, Debtor's explanation was that Sawyer was the father to her child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Reid testified that payments on the loan were due annually, but she never made a payment toward either loan as the first payment had not become due when she vacated the property. Reid testified that she never intended to injure the FSA, and never intended for the collateral to be stolen in breach of the agreement with FSA. When asked about other collateral in her possession not included in the FSA security agreement, such as a Chevrolet Silverado financed through Tyndall Federal Credit Union and a Ford F-150 financed through another bank, she testified that she understood that those creditors would repossess the collateral and sue her for the debt if she did not make regular payments thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Testifying on behalf of the FSA, was Bryan Rhea. Mr. Rhea testified he has been a loan manager for twelve years for the FSA and he supervises three employees in the areas of loan making and loan servicing in ten counties. He stated he personally assisted Debtor in obtaining the two loans at issue when she came to the FSA in March of 2016. When he was questioned about his conversations with Debtor regarding the land dispute, he reiterated that FSA had an interest in the collateral and cows only, not the real property. He also stated that when Debtor reached out\n   to him regarding the land dispute, he understood it to be merely a dispute and not a lawsuit at that time. Even so, he stated that it is the borrower's responsibility to notify FSA that the collateral was in danger, and at that point, he assessed no danger to the collateral. More importantly, at this point, he stated that Debtor was not delinquent on the loan, so they had no reason to repossess the collateral. Mr. Rhea stated that in October of 2016, FSA performed a collateral inspection wherein the FSA learned that the cattle was gone and that there was no equipment on the property. This was the only collateral inspection performed other than the initial visit to the property for the application process. Mr. Rhea testified that the FSA filed a UCC-1 on the New Holland tractor, and could presumably go repossess the tractor if they could find it. He stated that the FSA performed an investigation of the location of the collateral, asking neighbors, visiting the property, etc., but were unsuccessful in determining the whereabouts of the tractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Based on Debtor's acts and omission discussed above, the USA requests that the Court find the debt owed to the FSA in the amount of $ 52,048.56 plus interest be found nondischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) for fraud, (a)(4) for fiduciary defalcation and embezzlement, and (a)(6) for willful and malicious injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Debtor requests a finding that she lacked the requisite intent to harm the FSA at every stage of this loan and the Court should find the debt owed to the FSA dischargeable in its entirety. For the following reasons, the Court finds that the debt owed to the FSA by Debtor is nondischargeable in the amount of $ 7,000.00, which is the approximate amount for which Debtor improperly sold the New Holland tractor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Exceptions to Discharge\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"Exceptions to the discharge of a particular debt are strictly construed in favor of the defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Kanewske\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204381282\">\n    2017 WL 4381282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (Bankr.

The USA admits that Debtor did not obtain the loans under any sort of fraud, (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USA Trial Brief, Doc. 29 at 10), thus the Court finds in favor of the Defendant and the relief requested under Count 1 is due to be and hereby is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 523(a)(4) Fraud or Defalcation in A Fiduciary Capacity, Embezzlement, or Larceny\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Under Count II of the Complaint, the USA requests that the entire debt owed by Debtor be found nondischargeable due to Debtor's embezzlement of the collateral pledged as security on the loans. Section 523(a)(4) excepts from discharge any debt that was obtained by debtor by fraud or defalcation while acting a fiduciary capacity,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   embezzlement, or larceny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute is written in the disjunctive, so one's debt can be nondischargeable if they are found to have engaged in fraud as fiduciary, or have committed the act of embezzlement, or have committed the act of larceny regarding the debt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The USA fails to specifically address the allegation of embezzlement in its Complaint, and raises the issue for the first time in its pretrial brief. Despite failing to specifically plead embezzlement in the Complaint, the Court finds that the USA is not excluded from litigating the same at trial. Where a complaint does not specifically use the term \"embezzlement,\" if the facts as pled in the complaint arise to the act of embezzlement, then embezzlement can nonetheless be adequately pled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Taylor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280946\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/551/506/#p521\">\n    551 B.R. 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 521 (Bankr.

After law enforcement raided the gaming center and seized the equipment, the creditor issued a notice to the debtor terminating his interest in the center and demanding liquidation of the assets to repay the loan. Instead, the debtor entered into an agreement with law enforcement that permitted him to retrieve the equipment upon agreeing to remove the equipment from the county. Upon retrieving the equipment, the debtor absconded with the equipment and failed to pay the creditor pursuant to the terms of their agreement. After the creditor obtained a judgment against the debtor in state court, the debtor filed for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, and the creditor filed a complaint seeking to have the judgment excepted from discharge.

Debtor's testimony regarding the two vehicle loans and her understanding of what would happen if she didn't make payments on those loans demonstrates that she knew her actions would harm or were substantially certain to injure the USA.

The Debtor testified at trial that the tractor was sold for $ 6,000-$ 8,000, but she could not remember the exact amount. This was the only evidence presented regarding the value of the tractor at the time of the sale.
