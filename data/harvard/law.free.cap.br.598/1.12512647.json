Judgment creditor counters that his lien did not attach to the homestead exemption, does not impair it, and therefore cannot be avoided. Having reviewed the parties' briefs and applicable law, the Court concludes that judgment lien does impair Debtor's homestead exemption and is subject to avoidance, but that the extent of the avoidance cannot be determined without an evidentiary hearing on the value of the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTS\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Debtor filed this chapter 13 case on July 12, 2018. Pre-petition, Patrick McKnight obtained a $ 40,000 judgment\n   against her in Nevada state court. McKnight domesticated the judgment and filed a transcript of judgment in Bernalillo County, New Mexico, thereby obtaining a judgment lien on Debtor's house at 8501 Northridge Ave. NE, Albuquerque, NM 87111 (the \"House\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor values the house at $ 385,000, while Mr. McKnight asserts a value of $ 425,000.

The deadline to object to the exemption has passed, Fed. R. Bankr.

In\n   <em>\n    Burrus\n   </em>\n   , the court had to construe Oklahoma's homestead exemption statute and its applicability to state and federal tax liens. The statute exempts homesteads \"from attachment or execution and every other species of forced sale for the payment of debts.\" 31 Okla. St. Ann. \u00a7 1. The district court construed the provision to mean that \"the Oklahoma liens were incapable of\n   <em>\n    attaching\n   </em>\n   to the homestead property.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179574\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/147/\">\n    59 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The Tenth Circuit disagreed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Concededly, a literal reading of the statute would seem to compel the district court's conclusion. However, read in context, we believe it is clear that the term \"attachment\" as used in the Oklahoma statute has a different meaning from the meaning of attachment for tax lien priority purposes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The law dictionaries reveal that there are two distinct meanings for the term \"attachment.\" For example,\n   <em>\n    Ballentine's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (3d ed. 1969) provides two different definitions: first, \"A provisional remedy for the collection of a debt, which is incidental to an action against the debtor ... for the purpose of having the property available in satisfaction under execution and sale upon a judgment obtained against the debtor in the action;\" and, second, \"The actual attaching, that is, the seizure and disposition of the debtor's property under a writ of attachment.\"\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (6th ed. 1990) illustrates the same dichotomy. One definition of attachment is: \"A remedy ancillary to an action by which plaintiff is enabled to acquire a lien upon property or effects of defendant for satisfaction of judgment which plaintiff may obtain.\" another meaning offered in\n   <em>\n    Black's\n   </em>\n   is: \"The act or process of taking, apprehending or seizing ... property....\" Read in context, it seems clear that the Oklahoma statute uses the word \"attachment\" in this second sense of the word, while it is the primary meaning that is relevant in the tax lien context.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"179574\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/59/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court is persuaded by the Tenth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Burrus\n   </em>\n   and concludes that the New Mexico statute should be read the same way. In N.M.S.A. \u00a7 42-10-9, the phrase \"exempt from attachment, execution or foreclosure by a judgment creditor\" refers to the creditor remedy of attachment,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   not to encumbering real property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court's construction gives meaning to the phrase \"foreclosure by a judgment creditor\" because it prevents judgment creditors from foreclosing their valid liens on homesteads. In contrast, the construction advocated by McKnight would render the foreclosure language superfluous: if judgment liens do not encumber homesteads, then creditors could not foreclose them. Construing a statute in a way that renders a portion of it surplusage should be avoided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scalia and Garner,\n   <em>\n    Reading Law\n   </em>\n   , p. 175 (2012) (Canon 26, Surplusage Canon-If possible, every word and every provision is to be given effect (\n   <em>\n    verba cum effectu sunt accipienda\n   </em>\n   ). None should be ignored. None should needlessly be given an interpretation that causes it to duplicate another provision or to have no consequence.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Finally, the Court's construction of \u00a7 42-10-9 is bolstered by the fact that the main creditor remedies involving real property are attachment, execution, and foreclosure. The phrase at issue makes sense when \"attachment\" is defined as a creditor remedy, but not when defined as encumbering debtor's property. In that vein, the Court concludes that the proper way to read the phrase is that homesteads are exempt from (i) attachment by a judgment creditor; (ii) execution by a judgment creditor; and (iii) foreclosure by a judgment creditor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum the Court concludes, persuaded by the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Burrus\n   </em>\n   and the language of N.M.S.A. \u00a7 42-10-9, that McKnight's judgment lien encumbers the Homestead and therefore is subject to avoidance under \u00a7 522(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Even if McKnight's Judgment Lien Did Not Attach to the Homestead, it Nevertheless Impairs it and Can be Avoided Under \u00a7 522(f)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Assuming arguendo that McKnight's judgment lien did not attach to the Homestead, it nevertheless \"impairs\" the exemption and is subject to avoidance under \u00a7 522(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    McKnight's Judgment Lien \"Fixed\" on the House\n   </em>\n   .

It stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   By defining \"impairment,\" the amendment also clarifies that a judicial lien on a property can impair an exemption even if the lien cannot be enforced through an execution sale, thereby supporting the result in\n   <em>\n    In re Henderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514173,6120767\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/1305/\">\n    18 F.3d 1305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1994), which permitted a debtor to avoid a lien that impaired the homestead exemption even though the lien could not be enforced through a judicial sale.... Thus, it appears that whether a lien \"impairs\" an exemption may be determined in every case by applying the \u00a7 522(f)(2) formula, regardless of the state law limitations on the exemption.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   232 B.R. at 214.\n   <em>\n    Coats\n   </em>\n   addressed Oklahoma law, which at the time allowed judgment liens to attach to homesteads but prevented judgment creditors from foreclosing the liens.
