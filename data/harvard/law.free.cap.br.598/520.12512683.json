After review of the full record of the trial as supplemented by post-trial briefing of the parties, the Court amends a portion of its previously announced findings of fact and conclusions of law, but continues to rule in favor of the defendant on the first three counts of the complaint. As to the fourth count, in which the plaintiff seeks to deny the debtor a discharge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), the Court concludes that judgment shall enter in favor of the defendant.

Girouard alleged in the first and second counts of the complaint that Mike's debt to Girouard should be determined to be non-dischargeable pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (false pretenses, false representation, or actual fraud) or 523(a)(4)(fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, embezzlement, or larceny). In the third and fourth counts of the complaint, Girouard alleged that Mike should be denied a bankruptcy discharge of his debts to all creditors pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (transfer, removal, concealment of property before or after the petition) or 727(a)(3)(failure to keep records).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   According to the allegations set forth in the complaint and testimony at trial, Girouard claimed to have an oral agreement with Mike and his brother Pasquale Cestaro, Jr. (also known as Pasquale, referenced herein as at trial as \"Pat\", or together with Mike, the \"Cestaro brothers\"), individually, to provide financing for the purchase of high-end automobiles. Mike and Pat owned and operated a car dealership called Cestaro &amp; Sons, Inc. (\"C &amp; S\"), but Girouard's testimony at trial was clear that his agreement was with the individuals rather than with the corporation.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Question: \"But the agreement was with Mike and Pat, individually?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Girouard: \"Correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Question: \"With [sic] the agreement with Cestaro and Sons?\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Girouard: \"No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , pp. 17-18.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Girouard, his oral agreement with Mike and Pat was that they would use the money he provided to purchase and refurbish high-end luxury vehicles, and then sell them at a profit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 1, p. 3. Upon a sale, Girouard\n   and the Cestaro brothers would split the profit evenly, or \"50-50.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73, p. 17. The principal or initial money used to purchase the car would then be used to purchase another vehicle, and so on. Girouard also testified that he was able to drive the fixed-up luxury cars while C &amp; S was looking for a buyer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73, p. 182.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   There was no specific plan to repay Girouard, and there was no plan about repayment if the economy soured or the market for high-end luxury cars dried up. This was made clear in Girouard's answers to the Court's questions as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Court: What was your expectation on the term -- the time when you would get the money back?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Girouard: I felt that I -- that I would keep rebuying particular cars. You know, car 1, 2, 3 sold, that either get -- replenish the funds, or that I would use those funds to purchase cars 4, 5, 6.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Court: But there was no specific end time in your mind?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Girouard: No, as long as we were making money, then I'd be fine with it. As long as there were profits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Court: And what was the mechanism when you would get the money back?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Girouard: The mechanism --\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Court: How did you think that would work?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Girouard: -- was supposed to be when the, when the cars were sold. I didn't -- I neglected to chase the money at that time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Court: And there was no agreement as to an interest rate. Is that fair to say?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Girouard: No, strictly on a 50/50 profit split.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   AP-ECF No. 73, pp. 74-75.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Contrary to this testimony, the other evidence at trial, including documents, evidence of wire transfers to C &amp; S, and testimony by both Girouard and Mike, support a finding that Girouard made an agreement with C &amp; S rather than with Mike and Pat, individually.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Question: And the business transactions were going to be done through their business. Cars were going to be purchased, and then cars were going to be sold.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Girouard: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Question: And so, it looks like you did business with their business based on those facts. But you never had them sign anything to be personally responsible for these loans. Correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Girouard: Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73, p. 70.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   According to the wire transfer information introduced by the plaintiff, a trust named the \"A Gerry Girouard M. Claire Girouard Real Est Trust\" (the \"Real Estate Trust\") made four wire transfers of substantial funds from the Real Estate Trust's account to a bank account in the name of \"Cestaro and Sons Auto Sales.\" Pl. Exh. 101. The transfers by the Real Estate Trust to the C &amp; S account totaled $ 535,000.00 (the \"Funds\") and occurred during 2006 and 2007 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-41\"><strong>Date</strong> <strong>Amount</strong> <strong>Payment Detail Noted</strong> <strong>on Wire Transfer</strong> December 1, 2006 $145,000.00 (blank) December 7, 2006 $125,000.00 Ref Richard Girouard December 15, 2006 $134,000.00 Rick Girouard March 29, 2007 $131,000.00 Rick Girouard</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Real Estate Trust is not a party to this adversary proceeding, nor was any evidence other than Girouard's testimony offered regarding the nature of the Real Estate Trust, or the relationship - if any - between plaintiff Girouard and the Real Estate Trust. Girouard testified that he established the Real Estate Trust for his parents, \"to help them out financially, and so [he,] would have access to the funds when [he] was later incarcerated.\" AP-ECF No. 73, p. 73. Girouard's father was \"basically the escrow agent\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the Real Estate Trust and his father wired the money detailed above to C &amp; S because Girouard didn't want to do it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   But no evidence other than Girouard's testimony was submitted regarding the role of the elder Girouard as an escrow agent, the terms of the Real Estate Trust documents, the beneficiaries of the Real Estate Trust, or Girouard's authority to collect monies originally disbursed by the Real Estate Trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   While the evidence was clear that the money in issue originated from an account titled in the name of the Real Estate Trust, there was a lack of clarity as to the operation of C &amp; S. Mike testified that he and his accountant were responsible for the bookkeeping for C &amp; S, but the high-end cars that are relevant here were purchased from a high-end account, which was the responsibility of Pat, only.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73, pp. 145-146. Pat, however, testified that he did not recall if Girouard loaned C &amp; S money, that he handled the car sales, and that Mike handled all of the banking and finance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73, pp. 99-100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Regarding the specific vehicles that were part of the alleged agreement, the parties agreed that plaintiff's Exhibit 103, described as an inventory list (\"Inventory Sheet\") labeled \"Rick's Money\" with some handwritten notes, should be admitted as a full exhibit. Neither Mike nor Pat adopted authorship of the Inventory Sheet, but it is substantially recreated in the table, below.\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-45\">[Hand-written note] FLOOR PLAN Mike $180,000.00 Bentley GT 103,000.00 06 Porsche Cayenne 36,000.00 06 Bentley White (into Rick's) 30,000.00 01 BMW 328 8,000.00 04 Acura TL 16,800.00 04 Turbo Cayenne 38,000.00 05 Maserati 60,000.00 01 CLK 430 14,000.00 06 525 XI 26,900.00 512,000 Total [handwritten and circled] [actual total is $512,700]</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Girouard testified that he retained possession and title to the $ 103,000 Bentley GT, referenced in the table above, which reduced the principal amount he claimed to be owed to approximately $ 409,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Later, between 2010 and 2012, Girouard was incarcerated for felony bank fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73, pp. 65-66. During that time, on November 5, 2010, Girouard's brother and Mike engaged in correspondence that tends to support the conclusion the agreement was between Girouard and C &amp; S. Girouard's brother, acting on Girouard's behalf, sent a letter addressed to Mike Cestaro at C &amp; S, enclosing an amortization schedule for $ 450,000 with monthly payments of $ 5,000 on \"the loan [Girouard] has provided to you to support and grow your business ... Please forward to my attention a check for $ 15,000 to take care of payments that we discussed over the phone three months ago.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Exhibit 108. Mike replied using C &amp; S letterhead on November 30, 2010, and asked that Girouard's brother: (1) \"provide proper authority that I can rely on that you are acting on behalf of your brother,\" (2) adjust the principal amount, and; (3) \"modify the signature line to correctly reflect the companies [sic] name not my individual name.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Exhibit 109. Girouard's brother replied on December 15, 2010, stating \"enclosed is a revised amortization schedule on the loan changing your name to your corporation and the signer as Pasquael [sic] Cestaro, President. The loan amount has also been changed to $ 433,000. As another month has gone by, please forward to my attention a check for $ 20,000 to take care of payments that we discussed over the phone four months ago.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Exhibit 110; AP-ECF No. 73, p. 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   According to Girouard, Mike and Pat agreed to make interest-only payments to Girouard, since around that time \"the economy was falling apart\" and \"[Pat and Mike] were complaining that high-end cars weren't selling anymore.\" AP-ECF No. 73, p. 31. C &amp; S only made one or two interest-only payments to Girouard. AP-ECF No. 73, p. 32. No evidence of those payments,\n   other than Girouard's testimony, was offered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   C &amp; S ceased operations in approximately 2010. AP-ECF No. 73, p. 126. According to Pat, C &amp; S had tax issues and other floor plan lenders repossessed cars on its lot. AP-ECF No. 73, p. 107. There is no evidence that Girouard had liens against any of the cars that may have been sold or repossessed. AP-ECF No. 73, p. 159.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Additionally at trial, Mike was unable to explain what happened to the Funds. AP-ECF No. 73, p. 127.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Question: As an officer and an owner of C &amp; S, don't you think it was your responsibility to know what happened to Mr. Girouard's money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Mike: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   Question: But you're not able to say what happened to Mr. Girouard's money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   Mike: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   AP-ECF No. 73, p. 129\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Mike was also unable to confirm whether C &amp; S formally wound down its business pursuant to state statute upon the cessation of its business operations.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Question: Do you know if Cestaro and Sons sent any notice to Rick Girouard saying that It was ending its business?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Mike: I do not recall that one.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Question: Do you know if Cestaro --- did Cestaro and Sons file a certificate of dissolution with the State of Connecticut?\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Mike: I am not a --- I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   AP-ECF No. 73, pp. 130, 133-134.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Girouard filed suit against Mike, Pat, and C &amp; S in the Superior Court of the State of Connecticut on September 25, 2012. Mike filed his chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on May 8, 2015, while the state court case was pending. Mike scheduled \"Richard Girouhard [sic]\" as holding a disputed and unliquidated unsecured \"Litigation Claim\" for $ 1.00. No proof of claim was filed by Girouard, the Real Estate Trust, or any creditor in Mike's \"no asset\" chapter 7 case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The undersigned observes that each of the three witnesses lacked credibility as to at least some of his testimony, due to the self-serving nature of much of the testimony, the lack of precision about significant financial transactions as to which much more detailed record keeping could be expected by all parties, and the shifting nature of the story throughout the trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     APPLICABLE LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

To have standing to bring these objections Girouard needed to be a holder of a claim against Mike. While the concept of a \"claim\" in bankruptcy is quite broad, including as it does claims that are contingent, disputed or unliquidated, a claim must at least be a legally cognizable and enforceable obligation against the debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9037708\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/319/27/#p32\">\n    319 B.R. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons that follow, the Court concludes that Girouard failed to establish that he holds an enforceable obligation against the debtor Mike.

The uncontroverted evidence offered by Girouard himself was that the substantial sum of money at issue here - approximately $ 535,000 - was transferred from the Real Estate Trust to C &amp; S. Other than Girouard's testimony that he was the grantor of the Real Estate Trust, there was no evidence connecting the dots between wire transfers of the Funds from the Real Estate Trust to Girouard's right to pursue repayment, a determination of non-dischargeability or a denial of discharge. In other words, nothing in the record of this case indicates a wire transfer from the Real Estate Trust resulted in an obligation owed to Girouard personally. Girouard did not act here in a trustee capacity and Girouard failed to present any evidence to establish that Girouard, individually, was the proper party to pursue claims or rights relating to the Funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kovitz v.

By contrast, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals recently affirmed another\n   bankruptcy court's determination that a debtor produced sufficient information to defend a \u00a7 727(a)(3) challenge by producing eight years of joint tax returns, bank statements, and credit card statements, in addition to five years of business bank statements.\n   <em>\n    In re Steinberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201076837\">\n    2019 WL 1076837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20U.S.%20App.%20LEXIS%206794\">\n    2019 U.S. App. LEXIS 6794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (2d Cir. 2019) (summary order). The facts here are markedly different than in these examples. For example, the records admitted during the trial included some information for time periods ranging from 2007 through 2010 - more than five years prior to the petition date - and the record suggests that there would be no record-keeping after 2010 when the C &amp; S business ceased. The trial testimony included the information that that additional corporate records (titles of vehicles) had been produced by the defendant to the plaintiff only to be seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation at some point, thus clouding the record of what was or was not produced. AP-ECF No. No. 73, pp. 142-143, 146-147. Notably, the Chapter 7 Trustee felt there were sufficient records produced to her to enable the full administration of the case and she concluded there were no assets that could be liquidated for the benefit of creditors.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   Chapter 7 Case No. 15-30766, docket entry made August 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Here, Girouard included in his list of trial exhibits a 2010 Tax Return for C &amp; S\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   , a letter from Santander Bank enclosing bank statements for January 1, 2008 to November 30, 2008\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   , a 2008 C &amp; S balance sheet, and a 2008 C &amp; S adjusting journal entry,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   so he had received this information. However, Mike did not produce detailed transactions of every car sold or repossessed from five years after the business ceased operations.

If this determination were a close call, which it is not, the Court is mindful that its obligation is to construe\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   strictly against those who object to the debtor's discharge and liberally in favor of the bankrupt.

Because Mike would be substantially prejudiced by a post-trial amendment to the complaint, Girouard's Rule 15(b) motion is denied\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Even if the Court granted relief under Rule 15(b), Girouard still failed to meet his burden to establish officer and director liability for two reasons. First, as discussed, Girouard is not a creditor of C &amp; S since the Real Estate Trust and not Girouard individually transferred funds to C &amp; S. Only creditors of a corporation are required to receive notice of the corporation's wind down, and Girouard's theory as pled and as he testified during the trial was that he was a creditor of Mike individually, not C &amp; S. Second, there was no evidence presented that C &amp; S did or did not wind down its business pursuant to state statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Court recognizes the evidence at trial raised a number of questions about the details of C &amp; S's business. But, the only testimony presented regarding the dissolution of C &amp; S was that Mike did not know if a certificate of dissolution was filed with the State of Connecticut. Had the Court granted the post-trial Rule 15(b) motion, it would have been Girouard's burden to prove the elements of a claim of officer and director liability, and he failed to offer evidence to meet that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The record here simply fails to support the contention that there was an enforceable obligation owed by Mike to Girouard. As it was Girouard's burden to establish his standing by a preponderance of the evidence, and because he failed to meet\n   even this low burden, his claims under \u00a7 523 and \u00a7 727 must fail for that reason alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Girouard, and not the Real Estate Trust, was the appropriate plaintiff, the various legal theories by which Girouard could be found to hold an enforceable obligation against Mike (either as an individual or as an officer or director of C &amp; S) are unsupported by the record here. Girouard failed to meet his burden of proof to show that Mike Cestaro individually owed money to him as a result of the Funds transfer. No evidence was presented supporting a common law veil-piercing claim against C &amp; S that would result in liability by Mike to Girouard, or evidence supporting a claim of officer and director liability pursuant to state corporate law and the alleged wind-down of C &amp; S. Because of these findings and conclusions, the Court concludes there is no merit to counts one through four of the complaint and will enter judgment in favor of the defendant, Mike.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The decision announced at the end of testimony on August 7, 2017, is amended in that the Court does not assume that the amount transferred from the Real Estate Trust was appropriately designated to be paid back to Girouard, although the parties seem to so assume.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 73, p. 206. Mike argued that Girouard was not a creditor his and so lacked standing to bring a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
