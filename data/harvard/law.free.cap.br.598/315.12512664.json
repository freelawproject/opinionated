Attorney Jeffrey E. Tate appeared on behalf of J Burris, and attorney Douglas M. Gierhart appeared on behalf of B Burris. As directed by the Court at the conclusion of trial, the parties filed their written closing arguments on December 17, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to hear this Complaint pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), and venue is proper pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Additionally, the parties consented to this Court's entry of final orders pursuant to Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure 7008 and 7012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties to this adversary proceeding - B Burris, an attorney, and J Burris, a non-attorney - are brothers involved in contentious and acrimonious probate litigation that began upon their father's death in early 2009. The parties' father and mother had divorced many years earlier, and subsequently, father failed to completely honor his child support obligations to mother, notwithstanding serving a six-month custodial sentence on the divorce court's contempt order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Upon father's death, the dysfunctional group of eight siblings apparently divided into two opposing factions: \"Team Mom,\" which included B Burris, and \"Team Dad,\" which included J Burris. Generally speaking, Team Mom believed mother was entitled to back child support from father's estate, and Team Dad denied she had a rightful claim thereto. Although mother ultimately obtained a judgment against father's estate in litigation conducted concurrently with the probate litigation, the legal wrangling between the factions completely drained the estate, leaving no assets to satisfy mother's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Much of the expensive legal battle involved challenges to the qualification of the parties' sibling - an older brother - who had been appointed to serve as personal representative of the estate under father's will. Early on, the designated personal representative took the position that mother's child support claim would be denied. While J Burris adamantly supported that position, B Burris felt obligated to help his mother obtain what he believed was her due. In early May 2009, B Burris filed a combined objection to appointment of the designated personal representative and motion to appoint a special administrator. B Burris first objected to his brother's appointment as personal representative on the basis of conflict of interest, alleging fraudulent transfers of bank accounts into father's and brother's names as joint tenants. Later, B Burris objected to his brother serving as personal representative on the basis of lack of integrity. Regardless of the stated bases, B Burris underlying motivation for objecting clearly centered on mother's claim against father's estate for back child support.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In early August 2009, J Burris voluntarily entered the fray by filing a \"demurrer\" to B Burris' objection to the designated personal representative, claiming that B Burris had failed to state a claim. After the probate court rejected the conflict of interest objection, B Burris filed an amended objection to the personal representative on the basis of lack of integrity. Again J Burris voluntarily interposed himself in the probate proceedings, this time by filing a combined \"demurrer\" and motion to dismiss. In the midst of the ongoing legal melee, B Burris sought to depose J Burris, who incurred attorney fees in connection therewith. Both parties were unaccommodating in the process of scheduling the deposition, but B Burris eventually deposed J Burris in April 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Like the conflict of interest objection, the probate court ultimately overruled B Burris lack of integrity objection in August 2010. In doing so, the probate court commented that there was a lack of compromise and communication by everyone involved, and that both the personal representative and B Burris had acted in \"bad faith,\" but subsequently revised its statement to reflect that both had been \"equally uncooperative,\" and should bear their own fees. However, the probate court permitted J Burris to submit an application for his attorney fees to be paid by B Burris. As a result, in 2011, J Burris obtained a state court judgment against B Burris for attorney fees and monetary sanctions in the amount of $ 29,500 for\n   vexatious litigation. B Burris appealed the judgment, and the appellate court affirmed in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B Burris and his wife sought chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2017, and J Burris filed this adversary proceeding seeking to except the state court attorney fees judgment from discharge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for willful and malicious injury. The fact of the debt owed by B Burris to J Burris, in the amount $ 37,732.01 as of December 8, 2017, was established when both parties filed motions for summary judgment. But neither party was granted summary judgment in its entirety because the Court concluded there was a genuine issue of fact as to B Burris' intent to cause J Burris injury, a required element of a Section 523(a)(6) claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Summary Judgment Order [Doc. 34] (defined below) entered on November 2, 2018. In its Summary Judgment Order, the Court instructed the parties to streamline and tailor their presentation of evidence at trial to specifically focus on the required element of B Burris' intent to injure J Burris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In making the following Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, the Court considered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   a.

(Conflict Hearing Transcript, Exhibit 12, p. 98 ll. 15-17)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   8. At the hearing, B Burris changed arguments to claim that D Burris lacked \"integrity\" to be PR under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2058%2C%20%C2%A7%20102\">\n    Okla.

B Burris was authorized to file an amended PR Objection to pursue the integrity allegation. (Conflict Hearing Transcript, Exhibit 12, p. 12 - 13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   10. At the Conflict Hearing, B Burris requested, and was authorized, to conduct discovery limited to the singular issue of D Burris' integrity. (Conflict Hearing Transcript, Exhibit 12, p. 16, ll. 8-16; p. 30, ll. 15-19)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   11. B Burris styled his amended objection as a petition, with seven \"Causes of Action\" (the \"Amended PR Objection\"). (Exhibit 13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   12. The Amended PR Objection described, in detail, the family conflict that resulted from Decedent's failed marriage to the parties' mother. (Amended PR Objection, Exhibit 13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   13. B Burris' only change relevant to the \"integrity\" issue in the Amended PR Objection was the vague and unsubstantiated claim that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   37. Upon information and belief, and per [Decedent] prior to his death, Dean Burris has entered a plea for an offense which could constitute a felony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (Amended PR Objection, Exhibit 13, p. 7)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   14. A three-day hearing on the Amended PR Objection was held August 18, 19 and 23, 2010 (the \"Integrity Hearing\"). At its conclusion, the probate court found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"Be that as it may, the demur is sustained, his [Defendant's] objection will be dismissed on the basis that it completely lacks any foundation as it relates to lack of integrity.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (Integrity Hearing Transcript, Exhibit 14, p. 37, ll. 17-18)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   THE COURT: \"The Court denies the objection of Brandon Burris. The Court finds Brandon Burris has wholly failed to prove a lack of integrity on behalf of Dean Burris as it relates to the request to prevent Gregory Dean Burris from being the Personal Representative. It's important that we say only the request of Brandon Burris, in case there is another request. The Court orders each party to pay their own fees, with the exception that attorney Mr. Dunham can make a request for fees if he desires within 30 days of this date on behalf of his client, Jason Burris from Brandon Burris. The Court specifically finds that there is bad faith on behalf of both Brandon Burris as well as Gregory Dean Burris. The Court grants both parties an exception to all of the Court's rulings and Order to be submitted by Mr. Poe. All right, does that reflect the Court's ruling, Mr. Poe?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   MR. POE: Your Honor, if I could inquire just because I'm not sure I heard. Did you say the Order would find that Dean Burris was determined guilty of bad faith?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   THE COURT: You know what, I will change that. The Court finds that both parties were equally uncooperative and as a result of which each party will pay their own fees with the exception of J. Dunham's fees to be paid upon application of Mr. Dunham on behalf of [J Burris] for fees to be paid by [B Burris].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (Integrity Hearing Transcript, Exhibit 14, p. 41, ll. 3-20)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     J Burris' Motion for Sanctions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   15. Thereafter, J Burris filed his Motion for Award of Costs and Fees; it was verified by counsel, having first-hand knowledge of the alleged facts. (the \"Sanctions Motion,\" Exhibit 15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   16. The Sanctions Motion rested upon the common law ability of a court to award fees \"when a litigant has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   17. The Sanctions Motion highlighted B Burris' general use of unsupported allegations in his\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   pleadings to misrepresent his opponents to the court. For example, B Burris made the following unsubstantiated allegations \"upon information and belief\" that D Burris had:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 committed perjury;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 committed assault with a deadly weapon;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 committed drug possession and distribution crimes; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 committed murder, or had been complicit in a murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   (Motion for Continuance Pursuant to, Inter Alia, The Court's October 12, 2009 and November 12, 2009 Orders, Exhibit 16, p. 7, \u00b6 6 and p. 9, \u00b6 6)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   18. D Burris was then, and is, an assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Oklahoma and had passed a federal background check. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B Burris' Deposition Scheduling Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   19. The Sanctions Motion focused on several categories of intentional, bad faith behaviors. It first detailed B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Burris' bad faith in scheduling J Burris' deposition prior to the Integrity Hearing. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   20. J Burris is an AT &amp; T fiber optic network technician responsible for ensuring the seamless operation of AT &amp; T facilities (e.g. server farms) essential to its global network. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   21. J Burris' daily schedule is made known to him only one month out, on a rolling basis. Blocks as long as ten consecutive days \"on\" are common. He is generally unable to schedule personal days more than 30 days out. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 5, 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   22. B Burris was advised about J Burris' job requirements from the outset. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, attached Ex. B-1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   23. But B Burris consistently demanded that J Burris pick dates more than a month out, making him decline and offer dates with which he could comply. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   24. At the Conflict Hearing, the Court ordered all deposition notices be given in 30 days, by September 17, 2009. (Conflict Hearing Transcript, Exhibit 12, p. 83, l. 7 - p. 85, l. 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   25. B Burris' next request for deposition dates was September 14, 2009, four days short of the deadline; it asked for dates \"for the first or second week of December and the first or second week of January.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 6 and its attached Ex. B-3)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   26. B Burris knew these proposed dates were far outside the 30-day window J Burris needed due to his job. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, and its attached Ex. B-1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   27. Two days later, still within the deadline for notice, J Burris offered two dates within the window, September 25 or 28. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, and its attached Ex. B-4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   28. B Burris rejected those dates, telling J Burris' counsel \"for the reasons previously outlined in my email.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 6-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   29. In a response email, B Burris told counsel that he had noticed the deposition for December 8, 2009. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, and attached Ex. B-5)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   30. However, no email informing J Burris' counsel that the last week in September was unavailable was ever sent by B Burris, a fact pointed out by J Burris' counsel in an email to B Burris. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, fn. 2, and its attached Ex. B-6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   31. The discovery cutoff was extended to December 14, 2009, at B Burris' request. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7; OSCN Docket, Exhibit 18, entry dated 10-12-2009)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   32. Regardless, J Burris still could not commit to the December 8 deposition date because it was outside the 30-day window, a fact B Burris knew when he picked it. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, and its attached Ex. B-1 and B-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   33. J Burris then offered on October 14, 2009, to appear for deposition October 26 or 27. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, and its attached Ex. B-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   34. B Burris rejected the offer without explanation. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p.7, and its attached Ex. B-8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   35. J Burris responded October 20, removing October 26 (counsel acquired a conflict) and instead offering November 2. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p.7, and its attached Ex. B-9)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   36. B Burris again refused the offered date in an email response consisting almost entirely of misrepresentations. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, and its attached Ex. B-10). The email's misrepresentations include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    \"I have properly noticed [J Burris] for deposition pursuant to our agreement...\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   There was no such agreement. [B Burris] merely selected December 8 and sent notice. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, and its attached Ex. B-5)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    \"We have discussed: (a) your representation that [J Burris] has been forbidden from missing work in November, December, and January\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   [J Burris'] counsel never made this representation. He simply conveyed that [J Burris] could not commit to dates outside a rolling 30 day window. [J Burris] knew of the issue, but repeatedly demanded deposition dates to which he knew [J Burris] could not commit. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, and its attached Ex. B-1)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    \"We have discussed: (b) your prior representation on September 17th that the only day [J Burris] was available this year is September 25th\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   No such representation was made. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    \"We have discussed [J Burris] (c) your representation now, on October 20, that the only day [J Burris]is available this year is October 27th\"\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   No such representation was made. Counsel's October 20 email to [B Burris] not only reiterated the availability of October 27th, but offered November 2 as an additional potential date. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 7, and its attached Ex. B-9)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   37. Regardless, J Burris was prepared to be deposed in Tulsa on December 8, 2009, per B Burris' \"notice.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   38. However, B Burris used an unrelated hearing on November 12, 2009, at which J Burris' counsel was not present, to extend the discovery deadline to February 12, 2010, and to obtain an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   order stating \"JASON BURRIS'S DEPOSITION IS TENTATIVELY SCHEDULED FOR FEB., 2010 AT 10:00 A.M., AS A \"TARGET DATE.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8; OSCN Docket, Exhibit 18, minute entry dated 11-12-2009)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   39. B Burris never informed J Burris about cancelling the December 8 deposition or about the Court-ordered February deposition \"target\" date. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   40. J Burris' counsel discovered the cancellation just days before the December 8 deposition. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   41. A December 22, 2009, email sent directly to both J Burris and his counsel (which will be further addressed below) was the first time B Burris even mentioned a February deposition date. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8, and its attached Ex. B-11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   42. On March 5, 2010, B Burris filed his Motion for Continuance Pursuant to, Inter Alia, the Court's October 1, 2009, and November 12, 2009, Orders, wherein he asked that the March 25, 2010, Integrity Hearing be reset (the \"Continuance Motion\"). (Exhibit 16)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   43. B Burris used the Continuance Motion to misrepresent J Burris' efforts to schedule his Deposition and to portray J Burris as uncooperative. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8; Continuance Motion, Exhibit 16, p. 2-6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   44. In reality, between August 2009 and April 2010, J Burris offered B Burris six specific dates and the entire month of March 2010, for J Burris' Deposition in Tulsa. For example, between late December 2009, and April 9, 2010:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   \u2022 J Burris asked for February 2010 dates upon which he could appear for deposition. B-12. B Burris offered February 11, 12, 18, or 19. When J Burris selected February 12 (B-14), B Burris replied that such date was \"off the table.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8, and attached Ex. B-15)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   \u2022 In response to a Notice of Deposition from B Burris, J Burris went to the Miami airport on February 12, 2010. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8, and attached Ex. B-16) - B Burris noticed J Burris for a date he earlier said was \"off the table,\" only to be informed that all regional airports were closed due to a snowstorm. By counsel, J Burris immediately offered to appear the following Monday, February 15. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8, and attached Ex. B-17) B Burris declined. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8, and attached Ex. B-18)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   \u2022 J Burris offered, consistently, to be deposed by telephone.

(Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8, and attached Ex. B-20) B Burris declined to identify any such date. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 8, and attached Ex. B-21)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   45. In the Sanctions Motion, J Burris' counsel attached his timekeeping entries related to B Burris' bad faith in selecting a deposition date and requested sanctions against B Burris for those costs in the sum of $ 3,983.34. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 9; and it attached Ex.

Instead of conducting a serious and relevant inquiry about D Burris' integrity, B Burris deposed J Burris for over four hours on wholly unrelated topics, such as: to determine which of his siblings might (many years ago) have taken a rifle from J Burris, how J Burris defined \"integrity,\" whether J Burris preferred his father to his mother, and similar, irrelevant issues. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 9)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   47. A brief sampling of the irrelevant deposition questions include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   \"Okay. Well, let me try again. In the past have you ever thought that Dean was either acting clueless or actually was clueless?\" (J Burris' Deposition, Exhibit 19, p. 29, l. 8-11)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   \"Have you ever described our mother as the one who puts her desires to possess newspapers and junk over the well-being of her kids?\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 10, and its attached Ex.

After Jay Dunham (\"Dunham\") appeared in the probate case as J Burris' lawyer, B Burris asked whether he should stop communicating directly with J Burris and communicate only with Dunham. (Sanctions Motion Exhibit 15, p. 11, and attached Ex. D-1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   49. Dunham said yes. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 11, and attached Ex. D-2)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   50. However, B Burris then intentionally communicated directly to J Burris in violation of his agreement to stop and in violation of Oklahoma Rules of Professional Responsibility 4.2 (\"Rule 4.2\") in two subsequent \"batches.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 11-13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   51. B Burris initiated the first \"batch\" when he sent a settlement demand to J Burris and other family members. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 11, and attached Ex. D-6 and D-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   52. At the bottom of the Exhibit D-7, B Burris told represented parties D Burris, J Burris, and Cherie Burns, to \"... not respond without consulting with your attorney.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, attached Ex. D-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   53. B Burris managed not to include J Burris in emails the next two weeks; however, on December 22, 2009, he again sent a settlement letter directly to J Burris and his counsel. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, and its attached Ex. D-8 and D-9)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   54. J Burris personally responded, telling B Burris his direct communication violated his ethical duties. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, and attached Ex. D-10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   55. B Burris responded back to J Burris: \"Thank you for your unsolicited legal opinion. I extensively reviewed the law regarding my ethical obligations before communicating with you.\" (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, and attached Ex. D-11)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   56. B Burris initiated the second batch of direct communications to J Burris by an email on March 11, 2010. It related to scheduling J Burris' deposition and was critical of J Burris and his counsel; B Burris copied the email to other family members and/or their counsel. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, and attached Ex. D-12)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   57. J Burris' counsel immediately demanded to know why it was sent directly to J Burris. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, and attached Ex. D-13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   58. This triggered an exchange in which J Burris' counsel presented B Burris 18 cases and bar association ethic opinions from 15 jurisdictions - no pertinent Oklahoma authority was found - that clearly prohibited B Burris' conduct. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, and attached Ex. D-14)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   59. B Burris' response offered only his own interpretation of Comment 4 to Rule 4.2, and then offered to cease direct communications with J Burris only if Dunham agreed to follow B Burris' instructions in communicating with his own client. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, and attached Ex. D-15)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   60. That response was also sent to J Burris and triggered J Burris' Motion for Injunctive Relief, in which J Burris relied on Rule 4.2 to ask the court to stop B Burris' intentional contact. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 12, Motion for Injunctive Relief, Exhibit 20)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   61. B Burris then filed his Response To Jason Burris' Motion For Injunctive Relief, again citing only his own interpretation of Comment 4 to Rule 4.2 as authority; he cited no cases or other legal authority. (Response to Motion for Injunctive Relief, Exhibit 21)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   62. The court granted J Burris' requested injunction in a Minute Order. The Minute Order enjoined B Burris from any further direct communications with J Burris, citing Rule 4.2 as its basis.

After B Burris filed the Amended PR Objection, J Burris filed a Combined Demurrer and Motion to Dismiss on September 16, 2009. (the \"Renewed Demurrer,\" Exhibit 23)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   64. The Renewed Demurrer renewed J Burris' objections related to the repeated portions of B Burris' original PR Objection. Given this similarity to the First Demurrer, which had been overruled, B Burris reasoned that the Renewed Demurrer was in bad faith and threatened to move for sanctions against J Burris, or his counsel, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Okla.%20Stat.%20tit.%2012%2C%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    Okla.

J Burris' counsel entered into a dialogue with B Burris to explain why renewing his objections in the Renewed Demurrer was not frivolous. (Sanctions Motion, Exhibit 15, p. 13, and its attached Ex. E-1 - E-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   66. Ultimately, B Burris filed no sanctions motion.

The Oklahoma Bar Association's Standards of Professionalism (\"OBA-SOP\") require that attorneys \"not knowingly misstate, distort or improperly exaggerate any fact, opinion or legal authority.\" OBA-SOP 1.2. They further require that lawyers' \"conduct with clients, opposing counsel, parties, witnesses and the public will be honest, professional and civil.\" OBA-SOP 1.6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   68. One email from B Burris to D Burris' attorney speaks volumes of B Burris' goals in this case:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   ... your client now faces the prospect of no less than two trials on his integrity and at least a year or two of litigation, depending on the appeals court, not including the two trials on his conflict of interest as to the bank accounts...

The case was then assigned to Judge Chappelle, who set all pending motions, including the Sanctions Motion, for hearing on August 10, 2011 (the \"Sanctions Hearing\"). (OSCN Docket, Exhibit 18, entry of 06-16-2011)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   71. B Burris then objected to the Sanctions Motion (the \"Sanctions Objection\"). (Exhibit 25)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   72. At the Sanctions Hearing, J Burris and B Burris were given a full opportunity to argue and present evidence related to the Sanctions Motion and Sanctions Objection.

At the Sanctions Hearing, neither J Burris nor B Burris added any argument to their sanctions pleadings. Thereafter, the Court requested suggested findings and conclusions. (Appeal No. 112,918 Answer Brief, Exhibit 26, p. 4, \u00b6 2; OSCN Docket, Exhibit 18, entry dated 08-10-2011)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   74. J Burris filed his Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law on August 22, 2011 (Findings &amp; Conclusions, Exhibit 28), and B Burris filed his on September 6, 2011. (Response to Findings &amp; Conclusions, Exhibit 29)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   75. On September 16, 2011, the court granted the Sanctions Motion, sanctioning B Burris in the amount of $ 29,500.00, out of the of $ 29,508.34 requested by J Burris in the Sanctions Motion (the \"Sanctions Judgment\"). (Exhibit 30)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   76. The Sanctions Judgment found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   1.

B Burris' substantive legal position(s) in this matter has/have been at all relevant times utterly frivolous and without any factual basis whatsoever;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n   5. As a consequence of the foregoing, J Burris should be compensated, and B Burris should be sanctioned, by monetary sanctions in the amount of $ 29,500.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   (Sanctions Judgment, Exhibit 30)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   77. B Burris then retained counsel for the first time, who filed a \"Motion for New Trial or to Reconsider.\" (the \"1st Motion to Reconsider,\" Exhibit 31)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   78. Thereafter, J Burris filed a response (Response, Exhibit 32), to which B Burris filed a reply. (Reply, Exhibit 33)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   79. The 1st Motion to Reconsider was denied. (Order, Exhibit 34)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   80. B Burris filed an untimely appeal of that denial, which was dismissed for that reason. (Appeal No. 110,287 Order, Exhibit 35)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   81. B Burris filed a second\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   \"Motion to Reconsider Interlocutory Sanctions Judgment\" pro se March 11, 2014. (the \"2nd Motion to Reconsider,\" Exhibit 36)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   82. J Burris responded to the 2nd Motion to Reconsider. (Response, Exhibit 37)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   83. The 2nd Motion to Reconsider was denied. (Order, Exhibit 38)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   84. B Burris filed a third Motion For New Trial And Alternative Motions To Vacate And Reconsider. (the \"3rd Motion to Reconsider,\" Exhibit 39)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   85. The 3rd Motion to Reconsider was denied. (Order, Exhibit 40)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   86. B Burris appealed both the fact, and amount, of sanctions (the \"Sanctions Appeal\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n   F.

J Burris timely filed his Answer Brief. (Sanctions Appeal Answer Brief, Exhibit 42)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   88. In affirming the Sanctions Judgment, the Court of Civil Appeals stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   [W]e agree with the trial court's award in this case. The order making the award made a specific finding as to the bad faith nature of [B Burris'] litigation in this probate, and our review of the record supports this conclusion. While the amount of the estate is small, [B Burris] burdened it with much unneeded animosity and made serious allegations against his siblings, their counsel, and the Special Administrator which had no basis in fact, law, or reality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-173\">\n   (Sanctions Opinion, Exhibit 43, p. 12-13)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   89. Ultimately, the trial court entered a Journal Entry of Judgment awarding J Burris appellate fees of $ 15,960.00 (the \"Appellate Fee Judgment\"). (Exhibit 44)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   90. B Burris later filed the Second/Renewed Motion to Determine Outstanding Judgment, to determine the amounts owed to J Burris (the \"Motion to Determine\"). (Exhibit 45)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   91. On November 14, 2017, the court found that the outstanding balances would be, as of December 8, 2017, $ 22,373.13 on the Sanctions Judgment and $ 15,358.88 on the Appellate Fee Judgment (the \"Judgment Amount Order\"). (Exhibit 46)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   92. Then, on December 7, 2017, J Burris filed a motion seeking an additional $ 15,259.09 in fees against B Burris incurred in collection efforts (the \"Fee Motion\"). (Exhibit 47)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Mother's Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   93. Cherie Burns, the mother of J Burris and B Burris (\"Mother\"), obtained a judgment against Decedent's estate in the amount of $ 150,464.61. (Defendant Exhibit 1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   94. Decedent's estate was insufficient to satisfy the claims of Mother. (Order/Final Decree, Exhibit 38)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ADDITIONAL FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <em>\n    (from Trial Testimony and Exhibits)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   The following facts are derived solely from the presentation of the evidence during the trial and this Court's observation and critical evaluation of the witnesses' demeanor and credibility (including that of both J Burris and B Burris).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   95. B Burris was an honor student at the University of Tulsa College of Law where he participated in law journal and mock trial competition activities,\n   as well as held student leadership positions. He was admitted to practice in Oklahoma in 2007, and by all appearances, was a competent practicing attorney for a number of years thereafter, first with a Tulsa civil litigation and insurance defense law firm, and then as an attorney for the City of Tulsa. B Burris is currently employed as Professor and Director of Legal Assistant Studies Program at Rose State College in Oklahoma City. (B Burris testimony; Employee Income Records (Bankr. Doc. 7) )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   96. J Burris, who is five years older than B Burris, left Oklahoma upon high school graduation to enlist in the Army. After five years of military service, he settled in south Florida and continues to reside there. He works as a fiber-optic network technician for AT &amp; T (J Burris testimony; Exhibit 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   97. During trial testimony, B Burris referred to his childhood as violent and traumatic, and J Burris similarly remarked there had been childhood abuses, but no further details were divulged. B Burris testified that, prior to Decedent's death, he and J Burris were working through the trauma and violence together. Regardless, for decades the Burris family has been, and remains, highly dysfunctional, and the probate proceedings were illustrative of that dysfunction. (B Burris and J Burris testimony)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   98. B Burris testified that upon Decedent's death, his siblings divided into two separate camps: \"Team Mom\" and \"Team Dad.\" Team Mom, which included B Burris, thought Mother should be paid back child support from Decedent's estate. Team Dad, which included D Burris and J Burris, was determined that any such claim be denied. (B Burris testimony)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   99. B Burris testified that he did not have any prior probate legal experience, but took over representation of Mother as a creditor of Decedent's estate because the fees billed by her previous attorney had become too expensive. He also testified that those of his siblings on \"Team Mom\" relied on him to take the lead in the probate litigation. According to B Burris, because he is an attorney, he also felt some obligation to represent Mother and litigate on behalf of his siblings without charge because Decedent had expressed his desire that his children not hire attorneys and exhaust his estate with attorney fees as had been the case with his own father's estate. (B Burris testimony)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   100. B Burris believed that, if D Burris was allowed to serve as personal representative of Decedent's estate, he would not pay Mother's claim for child support. As a result, he filed objections in the probate litigation. According to B Burris, J Burris agreed with him that D Burris lacked integrity to serve as personal representative and further agreed that D Burris was \"unnecessarily and, by implication, intentionally, creating conflict in a number of ways.\" (Exhibit 6, D-9) Thus, B Burris sought to depose J Burris in connection with his objections to D Burris serving as personal representative and the responses that J Burris had filed in reply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   101. It took months of acerbic communication between B Burris and J Burris and his counsel to schedule the deposition. Part of the difficulty was J Burris' work schedule. As a fiber-optic network technician for AT &amp; T, his position is \"mission critical,\" and therefore, his work schedule is unusual\n   and \"tight and rigid.\" Generally speaking, J Burris works ten days in a row followed by three days off. Although his work schedules are prepared for a period of only two weeks to a month's time, he does not always have much advance notice of the schedules. Additionally, his vacation days must be chosen well in advance for the coming calendar-year period and only in one or two week blocks, but personal days off cannot be scheduled in the distant future. (J Burris testimony; Dunham testimony) For example, during the probate litigation, J Burris represented that he was \"unable to schedule unpaid personal days more than 30 days out, give or take a few days,\" which J Burris alleges B Burris understood, but did not respect in trying to schedule J Burris deposition, causing rancor between the parties. (J Burris testimony; Exhibit 6) Further, in October 2009, counsel for J Burris informed B Burris that J Burris was \"adamant that his employer will not permit him any days off November, December or even January. He simply has no choice in the matter.\" (Exhibit 6, Attachment B-7) According to J Burris, however, he \"made good faith efforts to appear for deposition in Oklahoma.\" (J Burris testimony)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   102. Even after reviewing the voluminous detail contained in the exhibits of the back and forth between the parties in scheduling the deposition, and hearing testimony at trial about J Burris' work schedule, the Court lacks clarity concerning how the schedule actually operated, or the true extent of the difficulty J Burris had in getting time off from work to be available for his deposition. In contrast, the Court would note that, at the May 7, 2018, scheduling conference, the Court proposed November 29, 2018, as the trial date, a date more than six months in the future. The Court recalls no scheduling concerns being voiced by J Burris' counsel or comments that he would have to check and make sure the date would work for J Burris, and the trial in fact took place on November 29, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, given J Burris' testimony that he generally works ten days on followed by three days off, the Court finds it inconsistent that he would have absolutely no days off for the three month period of November 2009 to January 2010, as his counsel represented to B Burris. In light of the foregoing, the Court concludes that, although B Burris unnecessarily and unreasonably complicated scheduling of the deposition, it does not accept J Burris' allegation in his Sanctions Motion that the lack of agreement was \"attributable solely to [B Burris'] uncooperativeness - as well as his hidden agenda of creating a record upon which he could be critical of [J Burris], even falsely.\" (Exhibit 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   103. The deposition of J Burris finally took place on April 9, 2010. B Burris paid for J Burris' airfare from Florida to Oklahoma as directed by the probate court. In addition to the deposition being unnecessarily lengthy, B Burris' behavior was antagonistic\n   and combative. Further, he asked mostly questions that had little to do with the integrity of D Burris to serve as personal representative of Decedent's estate and instead related to family events and childhood abuses occurring many years ago. (Dunham testimony; J Burris testimony; Exhibit 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   104. Jay Dunham, who represented J Burris in the probate litigation, testified that B Burris was extremely difficult to deal with, describing phone conversations as vitriolic and the whole experience as completely miserable, with every little thing being a battle. He also testified that B Burris acted unethically by directly contacting J Burris even after being advised not to, which necessitated obtaining an order for injunctive relief from the probate court, that in turn generated additional attorney fees. Further, Dunham testified that B Burris made unreasonable requests and demands regarding copying B Burris on communication with his client J Burris, and that many of B Burris' actions were unrelated to Mother's child support claim. Dunham's conclusion was that B Burris \"picked fights over everything ... to gum up the works ... to occupy my time on behalf of my client,\" knowing that he was running up my client's bill. (Dunham testimony; Exhibits 9 and 10)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   105. However, Dunham also admitted that parties other than B Burris filed pleadings that ran up the costs of the probate and related litigation. (Dunham testimony) The Court concludes that one of the parties whose actions contributed to the high costs of litigation was Dunham's own client, J Burris. J Burris filed \"demurrers\" to both of B Burris' objections to D Burris serving as personal representative. Additionally, in early April 2010, after Mother's child support claim was deemed rejected by the special administrator of Decedent's estate, Mother filed an independent suit on her rejected creditor's claim in Tulsa County state court against the special administrator. Both J Burris and D Burris intervened in that suit. (OSCN Docket Sheet, Tulsa County CJ-2010-2180) The state court awarded judgment in Mother's favor in the amount of $ 150,464.61 for back child support. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93 above) Then in December 2011, J Burris appealed Mother's state court's judgment to the Oklahoma Supreme Court. However, in May 2012, he voluntarily dismissed the appeal. (OSCN Docket Sheet DF-110218)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   106. In requesting attorneys fees from the probate court, J Burris' Sanctions Motion described B Burris' actions and behaviors in the probate litigation as \"unnecessarily inflammatory, melodramatic, hostile and arrogant,\" and also as \"rude, insulting, disrespectful, [and] uncivil.\" J Burris stated that B Burris' goal was \"to impose upon [D] Burris (and all other family members that support(ed) his appoint[ment] as personal representative) expensive and burdensome litigation so that they would accede to [B Burris'] demands and his preferred resolution of the conflict that had plagued this family for more than 20 years.\" In fact, B Burris vowed that \"come hell or high water, I will see justice done in this family.\" (Exhibit 6)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   107. B Burris testified that he never threatened or harassed J Burris, nor did he intend to injure J Burris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Further, he testified that his intention behind all of the probate litigation was only to help his Mother obtain back child support from Decedent's estate and resolve the dispute that had afflicted his family for many years. (B Burris testimony) Such is the only direct evidence of B Burris' subjective intent, and the Court found B Burris to be credible on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   108. J Burris testified that B Burris' behavior towards him was not professional, but purely personal. His complaint is that B Burris advised him to hire an attorney and \"immediately started running up fees.\" (J Burris testimony) However, the Court finds it important that J Burris\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     did not testify\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   that the purpose of any of B Burris' litigation tactics (and resulting attorney fees) was specifically to injure him, as opposed to achieving B Burris' desired result in the probate, i.e., that D Burris not serve as personal representative so that Decedent's estate would pay Mother's child support claim, or that \"justice be done in the family.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   109. Tisha Burris, B Burris' wife of 19 years, testified that before Decedent's death, J Burris and B Burris managed to get along, and J Burris would visit them around the holidays. However, she testified that as soon as J Burris learned B Burris was going to help Mother with her child support claim against Decedent's estate, their relationship changed drastically. Tisha Burris also testified that, given the family dynamics, when she learned B Burris intended to help Mother, she specifically asked him \"are you sure you want to start this?\" He responded \"I have to, or I will always regret it.\" Further, she testified that during the entirety of the probate proceedings, B Burris never had any vendetta against J Burris, nor ever expressed wanting to make his brothers pay for what they were doing. (Tisha Burris testimony)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   110. The Court found all of the witnesses to be generally credible, but the demeanor and deportment of each witness was completely different. Given the history behind the case, the Court anticipated that the parties would be angry and hostile. Instead, B Burris appeared to be nervous and anxious, somewhat cowered, and unable to make eye contact with opposing counsel, or even his own counsel, while he answered questions on the witness stand. Additionally, the Court found B Burris to be emotionally fragile, as he suffered numerous - and sometimes inexplicable - tearful breakdowns during his testimony. He also appeared to be able to interpret and respond to questions only in a very precise and literal way, at times frustrating opposing counsel, but he did not appear to be intentionally evasive while doing so. J Burris, on the other hand, was far more confident than his brother, but took no responsibility for any part in the almost ten-year long legal battle between the parties and the on-going incurrence of legal fees. At one point, he seemed to forget that it was he who filed the adversary proceeding, and when reminded, still shifted the blame to B Burris, stating \"there was no need for [B Burris] to file bankruptcy.\" Jay Dunham was, at times, rather indignant during his questioning. He appeared to be still exasperated and irritated by his experiences with B Burris in the probate\n   and related litigation. Tisha Burris was also emotional on the witness stand, but appropriately so given the circumstances, and able to effectively communicate her observations of B Burris' attitude and behavior towards J Burris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   \"[A] central purpose of the [Bankruptcy] Code is to provide a procedure by which certain insolvent debtors can reorder their affairs, make peace with their creditors, and enjoy 'a new opportunity in life with a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of preexisting debt.' \"\n   <em>\n    Grogan v.

Here, B Burris did not bring any action or seek any legal redress against J Burris. Instead, he sought only to depose J Burris in connection with the objections he filed in the probate litigation as to D Burris' fitness to serve as personal representative of Decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   According to B Burris, J Burris initially agreed that D Burris was not the best choice to serve as personal representative because he was \"unnecessarily and, by implication, intentionally, creating conflict in a number of ways.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100 above) J Burris apparently changed his tune after learning that B Burris intended to assist Mother with her claim against Decedent's estate for child support, knowing that D Burris was resolved to make sure that such claim was not paid. Therefore, B Burris had a legitimate reason for seeking J Burris' deposition. J Burris' reversal of opinion, and his subsequent intervention in the probate proceedings in opposition to B Burris' objections, seems to have ignited the flames that grew into this lengthy legal conflagration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   The Court understands the gravamen of J Burris' complaint to be that \"B Burris advised him to get an attorney and then ran up fees.\" But as pointed out during trial testimony, B Burris, did not, and could not, force J Burris to hire an attorney. Additionally, as B Burris was not seeking to limit or impact J Burris' personal or property rights in any way, and only sought to depose him relative to D Burris' fitness to serve as personal representative, it seems the primary reason an attorney was necessary was the fact that the brothers could no longer get along in light of one of them being on \"Team Mom\" and the other being on \"Team Dad.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   When questioning B Burris at trial, opposing counsel rehashed facts already established on summary judgment and was determined to get B Burris to admit that he had not in fact helped Mother, i.e., that while she reduced her child support claim to judgment, due to litigation expenses, there were no assets left in Decedent's estate to satisfy the judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 93-94 above) But such fact is quite irrelevant to establishing a willful and malicious injury under Section 523(a)(6) and serves to illustrate that J Burris neglected to focus on and prove the critical requirement remaining for trial - that B Burris intended to injure J Burris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   B Burris' difficult behavior in scheduling and conducting the deposition was unnecessary and improper, and, of course, contributed to the amount of attorney fees J Burris incurred. But, given the family's decades-long history of dysfunction, the Court does not find B Burris' obstinate and scorched-earth litigation practices unexpected. In fact, such occurrences are\n   common place in family probate disputes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   To put it mildly, \"[p]arties involved in legal disputes fueled by a family feud frequently are driven not by detached objectivity, but by emotions.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Serfass\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8958174\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/325/901/#p902\">\n    325 B.R. 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 902 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 2005). Moreover, \"scorched earth litigation [often occurs] when people have such strong emotional issues that the money becomes irrelevant.\" Paul Fisher,\n   <em>\n    The Power Tools of Estate Conflict Management\n   </em>\n   , 24-Jun. Prob. &amp; Prop. 42 (2010). Here, Mother's claim for child support was apparently such an emotional issue that all parties involved lost sight of the mounting litigation costs in relation to the modest size of Decedent's estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Indeed it would have been surprising if, upon Decedent's death, the members of this dysfunctional family were all of the sudden capable of acting logically, rationally, and reasonably in resolving their disputes over his estate and Mother's claim for child support. But B Burris' irrational behavior is not proof of intent to injure. In fact, J Burris himself characterized B Burris' actions that caused the attorney fees as imposing \"expensive and burdensome litigation [on other family members] so that they would accede to [B Burris'] demands and his preferred resolution of the conflict that had plagued this family for more than 20 years.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 106 above) Thus, J Burris' own description of what happened points to a motive and purpose underlying B Burris' conduct other than intentionally injuring him. However misplaced or misguided they may have been, the Court concludes B Burris' actions were driven by passion and emotion, not malice. Simply put, the Court believes B Burris desired to vindicate Mother, not injure J Burris.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Establishing the required elements of a Section 523(a)(6) claim is an onerous burden.
