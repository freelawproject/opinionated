The SJM addresses two major issues in the aircraft leases between these parties: (i) whether the liquidated damages provisions in the leases violate Article 2A of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and are therefore unenforceable as against public policy, and (ii) if so, whether the guarantor of the obligations in the leases is nevertheless liable to pay the otherwise unenforceable liquidated damages. The SJM also encompasses a secondary issue of whether the lessor has a valid administrative priority claim for post-petition rent relating to certain aircraft. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the SJM, finding that the liquidated damages provisions in these leases are unenforceable because they violate Article 2A's requirement that they be reasonable in light of the then anticipated harm from default. In addition, the Court concludes that the liquidated damages provisions also cannot be enforced as against the guarantor and that the administrative expense claim is barred under the express terms of the stipulation between the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This dispute centers around Amended Leases and corresponding Guarantees-both defined below-that are the operative agreements between the parties. But there are other agreements-also discussed below-that relate to the Amended Leases and contain provisions that are relevant to the issues before the Court today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Amended Leases and Related Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Between June 2001 and November 2003, Wells Fargo Bank Northwest, N.A. (\"Wells Fargo\" or the \"Lessor\"), as owner trustee, on behalf of Mitsui &amp; Co. (U.S.A.), Inc. (\"Mitsui\"), as the trust beneficiary, purchased seven EMB-145LR aircraft and entered into seven lease transactions (the \"Original Leases\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   with Chautauqua Airlines,\n   Inc. (\"Chautauqua\" or the \"Lessee\"). Under the Original Leases, the aircraft bearing U.S. registration marks (or tail numbers) N286SK, N561RP, N562RP, N287SK, N288SK, N563RP, and N259JQ (each individually an \"Aircraft\" and collectively, the \"Aircraft\") were each leased to Chautauqua.\n   <em>\n    See Response to Republic Undisputed Facts ... and Counter Statement by Residco Parties\n   </em>\n   (\"Residco Facts\") [ECF No. 2049]. Under the terms of each Original Lease, Chautauqua agreed to pay monthly rent for each Aircraft during the term of the Original Lease as set forth on a schedule attached to that Original Lease.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blank Decl., Ex.

(\"Embraer\"), the manufacturer of the Aircraft, and Mitsui entered into a deficiency agreement (the \"Deficiency Agreements\") and a Residual Value Guarantee Agreement (the \"RVGs\") for each Aircraft. Together, these agreements provided Mitsui protection from a decline in the estimated \"residual value\" of each Aircraft,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the estimated value of the Aircraft at the end of the applicable Original Lease term.\n   <em>\n    See Declaration of Gregory C.

More specifically, the RVGs provided that Embraer would pay Mitsui the difference between the previous month's so-called stipulated loss value and the Aircraft's fair market value up to a Maximum Amount (as defined in the RVGs) upon the expiration of the basic term of each Original Lease; the stipulated loss value was established on schedules affixed to each Original Lease, as described in greater detail below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Residco Facts \u00b6 35 (citing Farrell Decl., Exs.

A (N286SK) Art. IV (Rent), Art. XVIII (Return of the Aircraft).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In late 2012, Mitsui and Chautauqua agreed to restructure the Original Leases. Accordingly, they entered into (i) amendments to the Original Leases (the \"2012 Amendments\"), (ii) a financial support agreement (the \"Financial Support Agreement\"), pursuant to which Mitsui agreed to provide Chautauqua with certain financial support payments,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iii) a guarantee (the \"Original Guarantee\"), pursuant to\n   which Republic Airways Holdings Inc.

Roughly contemporaneously with the 2012 Amendments and Financial Support Agreement, Mitsui and Embraer entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the \"Reimbursement Agreement\") under which Embraer agreed to make certain payments to Mitsui with respect to each Aircraft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amendment No. 1 to Original Guarantee, dated December 12, 2014 (the \"Guarantee Amendment\"), annexed to the Blank Decl. as Exhibit Q Schedule 2 \u00a7 2 (discussing Reimbursement Agreement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In December 2013, Wells Fargo and Chautauqua entered into amended and restated leases for each Aircraft that superseded the Original Leases (the \"Amended Leases\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blank Decl., Exs.

They provide in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   \u2022 WHEREAS, Republic Airways Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Guarantor\"), pursuant to the Guarantee, ..., has guaranteed the obligations of Chautauqua ..., as lessee, under certain aircraft lease agreements, including the Aircraft Lease Agreement listed on Schedule\n   1 hereto ..., to Mitsui ..., and Wells Fargo ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 This Guarantee is an absolute, unconditional and continuing guarantee of payment and not of collection.

The Parties' Positions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In their SJM, the Debtors argue (i) that the seven Underlying Claims for rejection of the Amended Leases should only be calculated using actual damages because the liquidated damages clauses and SLVs in the Amended Leases violate public policy and are void\n   <em>\n    ab initio\n   </em>\n   , (ii) that the seven Guarantee Claims also should be limited to actual damages because, among other reasons, the guarantee of a contract provision found unenforceable for violating public policy is likewise unenforceable, and (iii) that the Administrative Expense Claim\n   is barred under the express terms of the Section 1110 Stipulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In its Opposition, Residco argues that the liquidated damages clauses are proper. It contends that voiding the liquidated damages clauses and SLVs would violate the parties' freedom to contract, and that doing so is especially inappropriate in light of the parties' sophistication and the complex nature of the commercial finance leases involved.

Although Section 504 of Article 2A does not explicitly incorporate the common law's consideration of \"disproportionality to actual damages,\" many of the cases cited above compare the damages to \"probable harm\" rather than actual harm; as explained below, this concept is consistent with the instruction in Section 504 to examine reasonableness in light of the \"anticipated\" harm caused by a default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, courts have identified certain formulations as inherently unreasonable. For example, static liquidation\n   values-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where the SLV does not decline over the course of the lease term and thus fails to recognize depreciation and the payment of rent over time-have been repeatedly rejected.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Glob.

The Minnesota courts have held that this is a clear indication that a liquidated damages clause is an unreasonable penalty-where damages are the same whether the obligor misses the last installment payment or whether it fails to make any payment on the entire obligation.\") (citations omitted). Courts have even rejected liquidated damages formulations that do not change with sufficient frequency over time. In\n   <em>\n    Montgomery Ward\n   </em>\n   , for example, the court criticized the annual amortization schedule because it contained a multi-million dollar liability cliff that occurred from one day to the next at year-end.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312854,9138214\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/383/\">\n    326 F.3d at 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2003) (finding that \"the excessively large Casualty Value figures provided powerful in terrorem pressure for [lessee] to perform the leases rather than (for example) to terminate them voluntarily and pay the price for doing so in real damages,\" thereby rendering the Casualty Value figures an unenforceable penalty).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Amended Leases Violate Article 2A, Section 504\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   At the center of the parties' dispute is the fact that the liquidated damages provisions here allow for the unconditional transfer of residual value risk, or market risk, only upon default, without a cognizable connection to any anticipated harm caused by the default itself. As the Debtors correctly frame it, the question is \"whether the parties in a true finance lease transaction can allocate risk so that the financing is treated as a debt obligation until the end date of the Leases, and then at the end of the term the Lessor Parties becoming the true economic owners.\" Opposition at 3. Applying the applicable legal principles above to the SLVs in the Amended Leases, the Court concludes that the parties may\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allocate risk where-as here-doing so violates the reasonableness requirement of Article 2A, Section 504.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    The Stipulated Loss Value Calculations Were Designed to Protect Lessor's Investment on the Aircraft\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To understand why the liquidated damages provisions here are unenforceable, one must first understand the provisions in the context of the Amended Leases. Upon an event of default under the Amended Leases, Lessor had the right to request that Lessee return the Aircraft, after which Lessor could \"hold, use, operate or lease [the Aircraft] to others\" \"in its sole discretion.\" Blank Decl., Ex. R \u00a7 17.02(a)-(b). \"Whether or not\" Lessor took such actions, the Amended Lease provided the\n   lessor three additional optional remedies framed as \"liquidated damages\" that Lessor could choose \"in its sole discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9312854,9138214\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/326/383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Ex.

As explained in more detail above, the Lessor could demand payment of unpaid Basic Rent (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , overdue monthly rental obligations),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Blank Decl., Ex.

In between these points, the SLV table will reflect the effect of, among other things, (a) payments of portions of the Invested Amount through the lease rental payments (taking into account the lessor's required interest recovery) and (b) the Tax Attribute Amount.\"). In other words, in the event of a default, this remedy formulation effectuated a transfer of all market risk, or residual value, including any risk of idiosyncratic depreciation or damage to a particular Aircraft. This provision granted Lessor the ability to retake possession of the Aircraft and recover not just a dollar value equal to scheduled rental payments, but also any deficit in the value of the Aircraft that fell short of Lessor's desired total gross return.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Thus, the SLVs were calculated to achieve a four percent margin above the original purchase price regardless of where default may have left the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Residco Facts \u00b6 34; Weber Report at 5. Under that formulation, Lessee bore the risk of any loss of market or rental value of the Aircraft over the course of the Amended Lease, in addition to the fixed margin. Notably, the Amended Leases did not provide for a similar risk transfer at expiration of the lease term: absent an event of default, Lessee was simply obligated to return the Aircraft to Lessor, while ensuring compliance with the condition and maintenance requirements for that particular Aircraft.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Blank Decl., Ex.

(\"One of the reasons it was decided to codify the law with respect to leases was to resolve an issue that created considerable confusion in the courts: what is a lease? The confusion existed, in part, due to the last two sentences of the definition of security interest in the 1978 Official Text of the Act, Section 1-201(37).... The answer is important because the definition of lease determines not only the rights and remedies of the parties to the lease but also those of third parties.\"). But notwithstanding this interesting debate, the Court need not reach this thorny issue today given that all parties here agree that the Amended Leases are \"true leases\" governed by Article 2A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   June 28, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 17:25-18:3, 43:3-5.

Perhaps for that reason, Residco does not explicitly argue that Section 407 by itself absolves the liquidated damages clauses here from having to satisfy the reasonableness requirement of Article 2A. But to the extent that it contends this to be the case, the Court rejects such a position. Residco cites no authority for the notion that the reasonableness requirement of Section 504 is explicitly or implicitly trumped by Section 407.

Such a view improperly reads Section 504 out of the statute, something the Court declines to do. And simply put, the Court cannot square the particular liquidated damages clauses here with the requirements of Section 504-even considering the Amended Leases as finance leases-given that the pricing structure and risk allocations detailed above are untethered from the damages arising out of default.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Liquidated Damages That Constitute Unenforceable Penalties May Not Be Recovered Under Guarantees\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Having found the underlying liquidated damages provisions violate Article 2A, Section 504, the Court next turns to the validity of the Guarantees.

Normally, a lender who enables a buyer to acquire the goods is not subject to a refusal by the buyer to repay the loan if the goods are not what the buyer expected. Similarly, a finance lessee cannot refuse to pay a lessor an agreed payment. William D. Hawkland, 3\n    <em>\n     Hawkland UCC Series\n    </em>\n    , \u00a7 2A-209:01 (Frederick K.

The statutory scheme of finance leases benefits both parties. The lessor gains certainty and security for its extension of credit. The lessee forgoes its warranty claims against the lessor but becomes a statutory third party beneficiary of the supply contract between the manufacturer or other supplier and the lessor. Thus, the lessee has a right of action against the supplier and the manufacturer and so is not without a remedy.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20680.209\">\n     Fla.
