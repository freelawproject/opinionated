The Old CBA included a supplement, entitled Supplement CC, which modified American's pilot seniority list to incorporate former TWA pilots-including the Plaintiffs-that were brought into the company when American acquired the assets of TWA in 2001.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Supplement CC stripped the former TWA pilots of much of the existing seniority that they had held at TWA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. To compensate for the loss of seniority, Supplement CC created a \"protective fence\" that set aside a minimum number of Captain and First Officer positions at the St. Louis base, for which former TWA pilots were given preferential bidding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. The Old CBA-including Supplement CC-was abrogated when the Debtors obtained the Section 1113 relief in September 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In December 2012, American and APA came to an agreement on a new pilot collective bargaining agreement (the \"New CBA\"), which included a side letter of agreement numbered 12-05 (\"LOA 12-05\").\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. During the process of negotiating the New CBA, American represented that it intended to close the St. Louis base and eliminate the protective fence that had existed for the former TWA pilots.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. LOA 12-05 stated that \"a dispute resolution procedure is necessary to determine what alternative contractual rights should be provided to TWA Pilots as a result of the loss of flying opportunities due to termination of Supplement CC and the closing of the STL base.\" LOA 12-05 at 1 (attached as Ex. 1 to APA Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss [ECF No. 14-3] );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 22. Regarding the process, LOA 12-05 provided that \"the Company and APA will engage in final and binding interest arbitration pursuant to Section 7 of the [Railway Labor Act]\" in front of a panel \"consist[ing] of three neutral arbitrators who are members of the National Academy of Arbitrators with Richard Bloch as the principal neutral.\" LOA 12-05 at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2013, American and APA entered into a protocol agreement regarding the arbitration (the \"Protocol Agreement\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31. The Protocol Agreement stated that the arbitration would \"provide for party status at the hearings and for substantive presentations by: (1) American Airlines, Inc.; (2) a representative committee of AA Pilots ... and (3) a representative committee of TWA Pilots .... APA participation as a party ... shall not be for the purposes of advocating a substantive position but to facilitate an orderly process and resolution of the dispute.\" Protocol Agmt. \u00a7 1 (attached as Ex. 2 to APA Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss [ECF No. 14-4] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   It further provided that \"[w]hile party status for purposes of the Board's hearing proceedings shall be as specified in Section 1 of the Agreement, the 'parties' as to this Agreement and as used in the applicable Railway Labor Act provisions, shall be limited to AA and APA.\" Protocol Agmt. \u00a7 7. While the only parties to the arbitration were American and APA, APA established two committees to present evidence and arguments on its behalf: the APA AA Pilots Committee and the APA TWA Pilots Committee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Protocol Agreement also designated the members of the arbitration panel as Arbitrator Bloch-previously named under LOA 12-05-and Arbitrators Stephen Goldberg and Ira Jaffe.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Protocol Agmt. \u00a7 2; Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 25, 30. Arbitrator Goldberg is the president and founder of Mediation Research &amp; Education Project, Inc. (\"MREP\"), an arbitration and mediation service focusing on labor/management disputes that serves as a referral service for its more than 60 members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27. MREP is a non-profit, but does receive fees for its services, as well as member contributions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   contacts, the Protocol Agreement specified that \"[t]he Board may conduct informal\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   discussions to the extent it deems such discussions useful in an attempt to obtain a voluntary resolution of the dispute.\" Protocol Agmt. \u00a7 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Protocol Agreement explicitly incorporated Sections 7, Third and Section 8 of the RLA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Protocol Agmt. \u00a7 7. As to the finality of any award issued by the arbitrators, the Protocol Agreement provided that \"[n]othing in this Agreement should be construed to require AA or APA to file a copy of the Board's award with a federal district court in order for the award to be final and binding .... The award shall be final and binding under\n   Section 9 of the Railway Labor Act.\" Protocol Agmt. \u00a7\u00a7 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The parties submitted their opening arbitration briefs in April 2013, and the arbitrators held seven days of hearings from April through June 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 39-40. One of American's principal witnesses during the arbitration was Mark Burdette.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 42. The arbitrators issued their opinion in July 2013, which the Plaintiffs assert most closely replicated American's proposal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. American and APA then negotiated contract language based on the arbitrators' opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Mr. Burdette was one of America's principal negotiators during this process.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Issues arose during the drafting of the contract language, and on September 12, 2013 the arbitrators issued a \"Ruling on Contract Language.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. A corresponding supplement to the new CBA, entitled Supplement C, was then approved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It subsequently came to light that Mr. Burdette and Arbitrator Goldberg communicated by email on an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   basis during the arbitration process.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. These communications included, among other things, congratulations shared between the two upon Arbitrator Goldberg's appointment to the panel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   discussions regarding Mr. Burdette becoming a member of MREP,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Mr. Burdette's subsequent MREP membership.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-53. After the arbitrators issued their decision in the arbitration, Mr. Burdette also shared a mock award with Arbitrator Goldberg that Mr. Burdette had drafted with respect to the LOA 12-05 arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. Arbitrator Goldberg did not disclose these communications to the parties, nor did he share the fact that Mr. Burdette had become a member of MREP.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 50, 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   It also came to light that Arbitrator Bloch had\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications with Thomas Reinert, American's counsel in the arbitration, during which Arbitrator Bloch proposed a possible settlement of the arbitration and asked Mr. Reinert to pass the proposal along to APA.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58, 59.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Plaintiffs assert that they were denied their due process rights to a fair hearing because one or more of the arbitrators violated the Protocol Agreement and displayed bias or hostility towards one of the parties.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. Citing to the communications and business relationship between Arbitrator Goldberg and Mr. Burdette, the Plaintiffs contend that there was a conflict of interest between Arbitrator Goldberg and Mr. Burdette or that a reasonable person would believe that such a conflict of interest existed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-65. Thus, the Plaintiffs contend that Arbitrator Goldberg was impermissibly biased in favor of Mr. Burdette during the proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiffs also argue that the Protocol Agreement was violated because Arbitrator Goldberg and Arbitrator Bloch conducted\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   communications that were outside the scope of what was permitted under the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-71. The Defendants counter that the Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge an arbitration proceeding in which only the union and employer were parties, and that the Complaint is time-barred because the applicable statute of limitations under the RLA has run. The Defendants also contend that the Plaintiffs allegations in the Complaint are insufficient to state a claim because the Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the high standard for improper conduct that is necessary to overturn an arbitrator's award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Plaintiffs Lack Standing to Challenge the Arbitration Award\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Defendants ask that the Complaint be dismissed under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. They argue that these individual Plaintiffs lack standing to challenge the LOA 12-05 arbitration award because the Plaintiffs were not parties to the arbitration. The Plaintiffs maintain that the RLA provides them with standing to challenge the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1), made applicable to bankruptcy proceedings by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 7012(b), provides for dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, including a lack of standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

To hold otherwise would open the doors to substantial post-award litigation by a single dissatisfied employee within a bargaining unit, thereby destabilizing a process meant to create a labor contract that governs the interests of all employees within the unit.

And the arbitration process itself is structured to collectively address the interests of all those pilots ... beyond these individuals in exemplifying why individual pilots are not permitted to challenge such awards.\"). Allowing an individual that has not been designated as a group representative to seek to undo the work that has been achieved by the union, the actual employee representative, through interest arbitration would only serve to undermine the system of collective dispute resolution. Such individuals are not left without recourse; to the extent that their employee representatives in the APA union have acted improperly, individuals may pursue a duty of fair representation claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   But even if this Court were to hold that Section 3, First (q) were applicable to interest arbitration awards, the Plaintiffs here would still lack standing.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has twice held that even in the context of a grievance arbitration-where Section 3, First (q) is clearly applicable-an individual employee will not have standing when a union is pursuing an arbitration on behalf of all members and the dispute did not involve grievances specific only to those individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mitchell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870190\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/225/#p232\">\n    481 F.3d at 228-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232-33 ;\n   <em>\n    Mackenzie v.

Individual carriers and unions have established various special adjustment boards and supplemental adjustment boards to lighten the caseload in a NRAB division.
