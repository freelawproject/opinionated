Bernstein in his capacity as Chapter 11 Trustee, Louise A. Geer (who is the non-bankruptcy trustee of the Dille Family Trust), the putative debtor Dille Family Trust, and the Nowlan Family Trust. These parties contend that the debtor is a \"business trust\" and, as such, the debtor is eligible for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Motion to Dismiss is a core proceeding over which this Court has the requisite subject matter jurisdiction and authority to enter a final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), 157(b)(1), 157(b)(2)(A), 157(b)(2)(O), and 1334(b). For the reasons that are set forth below, the Court concludes that the Dille Family Trust is not a \"business trust\" and that this bankruptcy case must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case is a saga. After much litigation before the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board, the United States District Court for the Central District of California, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, the legal controversies concerning the Dille Family Trust found itself on this Court's docket when the Dille Family Trust filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code on November 28, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Since the Dille Family Trust was in the throes of litigation when it sought bankruptcy protection, its adversaries went on the offensive in this bankruptcy case and sought either relief from the automatic stay to complete the non-bankruptcy litigation that was consuming the debtor, and/or dismissal of this bankruptcy case alleging a myriad of \"cause\" including allegations to the effect that: (1) the Dille Family Trust is an ordinary trust and not a \"business trust\" thereby rendering it ineligible for bankruptcy relief, and (2) this bankruptcy case was not filed in \"good faith\" since it was allegedly filed as a litigation tactic to forestall ongoing litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By way of background, the Dille Family Trust purports or alleges that it owns copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property rights relative to the fictional comic character known as the 25th century space explorer \"Buck Rogers\" (also known as \"Anthony Rogers\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The intellectual property rights claimed by the Dille Family Trust include the rights relating to a novella entitled\n   <em>\n    Armageddon 2419 A.D.\n   </em>\n   , where the character \"Anthony Rogers\" first appeared. This novella was allegedly written by Phillip Francis Nowlan in 1928 or 1929 while he was under contract with either John F. Dille or his companies (John F. Dille Co., National News Service and/or National News Syndicate).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, it has been contended in pleadings that the character \"Anthony Rogers\" or \"Buck Rogers\" was created by Dille and not by Nowlan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These circumstances led to a dispute between Nowlan and Dille as to rights to the intellectual property. However, it appears that in 1942, Mr. Nowlan's estate released and assigned such rights and interests\n   in the \"Buck Rogers\" and \"Buck Rogers in the 25th Century\" intellectual property to Dille. Thereafter, and through the years that followed, these intellectual property rights were transferred between members of the Dille family (including Robert C. Dille, who is the son of John F. Dille) or to companies owned by them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 16, 1979, the Dille Family Trust was created. On that same date, it has been alleged that \"Buck Rogers\" and related trademark rights were conveyed to the Dille Family Trust. Approximately a year later copyrights were also alleged to have been assigned to the Dille Family Trust. Other assignments to the Dille Family Trust have also occurred, but the record in that regard is not fully developed. Inasmuch as this description is for background purposes, the specifics of various intellectual property assignments are not outcome determinative to the instant matter before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For reasons that are unknown to the Court, certain registrations of the \"Buck Rogers\" trademark were cancelled in 2011. Notwithstanding the cancellation, the Dille Family Trust contended that it continued to use the trademarks in commerce. In fact, the Dille Family Trust contended that in 2009 it had filed applications with the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office relative to certain marks and classes of use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In January of 2008, the Nowlan Family Trust filed an application with the United States Patent &amp; Trademark Office seeking registration of the \"Buck Rogers\" mark based upon an intent to use. The Dille Family Trust opposed the application, and in 2015 the opposition was overruled by the Trademark Trial &amp; Appeal Board because the Dille Family Trust could not \"demonstrate its proprietary interest in the asserted mark.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dille Family Tr. v. Nowlan Family Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%206121770\">\n    2015 WL 6121770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *8 (T.T.A.B., September 25, 2015). The Dille Family Trust then filed suit against the Nowlan Family Trust in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania seeking to overturn the decision of the Trademark Trial &amp; Appeal Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While this matter was making its way through the federal court system, Team Angry Filmworks, Inc. filed suit against the Dille Family Trust and its trustee, Louise A. Geer, in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Team Angry Filmworks is a film production company owned by Don Murphy. According to the lawsuit filed by Team Angry Filmworks against Dille Family Trust and Ms. Geer, Mr. Don Murphy is a \"well known motion picture producer whose production credits include 'Natural Born Killers,' 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,' 'From Hell' and 'The Transformers' motion picture franchise. Motion pictures on which Mr. Murphy has acted as a producer have generated in excess of four billion dollars in box office revenues.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Team Angry Filmworks, Inc. v. Geer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271746\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/214/432/#p436\">\n    214 F.Supp.3d 432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 436 (W.D. Pa. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The lawsuit filed by Team Angry Filmworks was ultimately transferred to the Western District of Pennsylvania because the non-bankruptcy trustee for the Dille Family Trust, Louise A. Geer, resides in New Castle, Pa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The gravamen of the Western District litigation is a claim by Team Angry Filmworks that \"Buck Rogers\" and\n   <em>\n    Armageddon 2419 A.D.\n   </em>\n   entered the public domain in the United States in 1956. The claim by Team Angry Filmworks also includes a contention that these marks or works entered the public domain worldwide in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The lawsuit also alleges that Team Angry Filmworks received various threats and/or demands by counsel for the Dille Family Trust, Mr. Daniel Herman (who is also the spouse of Louise A. Geer), which included various copyright infringement claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As such, the litigation commenced by Team Angry Filmworks included causes of action seeking a declaration that the marks and works are in the public domain and that the same may be used by Team Angry Filmworks as part of its commercial ventures and film productions. The Western District litigation also sought injunctive relief enjoining the Dille Family Trust and Ms. Geer from interfering with Team Angry Filmworks use of the \"Buck Rogers\" and\n   <em>\n    Armageddon 2419 A.D.\n   </em>\n   intellectual property in Team Angry's projects, and attorneys fees and costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Dille Family Trust's litigation against the Nowlan Family Trust in the Eastern District progressed to the point in which the case was ready for trial. In fact, trial was scheduled to begin on February 5, 2018. The litigation against Team Angry Filmworks in the Western District also progressed past the pleadings stage and entered into the discovery phase. Efforts at mediation also failed, and the case proceeded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   With the trial looming in the Eastern District, it appears that the Dille Family Trust's ability to fund payment of the fees and expenses of its legal counsel ended. Apparently, the beneficiaries of the Dille Family Trust are the surviving children of Robert C. Dille (i.e., Robert Nichols Flint Dille and Lorraine Dille Williams). The latter, Lorraine Dille Williams, was lending the trust monies enabling the Dille Family Trust to mount its litigation efforts, despite the fact that the trust on its own was not generating enough income to pay for such expenses. However, Lorraine Dille Williams ultimately ceased funding the litigation citing, among other things, alleged irregularities by either Ms. Geer or Mr. Herman, or their firm Geer and Herman, P.C. and other related entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Without funding for the litigation, the Dille Family Trust filed for Chapter 11 relief on November 28, 2017. The effect of the filing was that all litigation was stayed and, instead, the parties sharpened their litigation arrows before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   By way of example, upon the filing of this bankruptcy case, the Dille Family Trust sought to engage an auctioneer to sell the intellectual property rights \"free and clear\" of competing interests. Naturally, the Nowlan Family Trust and Team Angry Filmworks opposed such efforts because these parties claimed a right to utilize the intellectual property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Team Angry Filmworks also moved to dismiss this bankruptcy case as a \"bad faith\" filing, contending that the debtor did not belong in Chapter 11 because it had no meaningful business operations and because the bankruptcy filing was merely a litigation tactic designed to avoid the various non-bankruptcy lawsuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Team Angry Filmworks also contended that dismissal was warranted because the debtor was an ordinary trust as opposed to a \"business trust\" thereby rendering it ineligible for bankruptcy relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). As an alternative request for relief, Team Angry Filmworks also contended that these circumstances provided ample \"cause\" to grant Team Angry relief from the automatic stay pursuant\n   to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) for it to prosecute the Western District lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Similarly, the Nowlan Family Trust filed its own request for relief from the automatic stay adopting the arguments raised by Team Angry Filmworks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Around this time, the Dille Family Trust filed its proposed Chapter 11 Plan and Disclosure Statement. The gist of the plan was to liquidate the intellectual property interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Hearing was had on the Disclosure Statement, where the various parties (including the Nowlan Family Trust, Team Angry Filmworks, Robert Nichols Flint Dille and Lorraine Dille Williams) appeared and raised many of the same issues that had been permeating this case, including challenges to the debtor's eligibility as a \"business trust\" and challenges regarding the good faith filing and prosecution of this Chapter 11. The Nowlan Family Trust and Team Angry Filmworks also pressed their motions for relief from stay and for dismissal of the bankruptcy case. No decision was made at that time regarding these dueling motions because the parties argued that questions of fact remained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court then scheduled an August 21, 2018 trial on the motions for relief from stay and for dismissal of the case. The Court also authorized the parties to undertake discovery in advance of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   During the discovery period, the Dille Family Trust failed to comply with discovery requests resulting in the filing of various motions to compel against the debtor. At a July 25, 2018 hearing it became evident that not only was the failure to produce discovery willful, but that there were many other inherent problems with this Chapter 11 case. The result was that this Court exercised its discretion and appointed a Chapter 11 Trustee instead of dismissing the case at that time. In this regard, the Court found and determined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   It is clear and convincing that the above captioned Chapter 11 case is not making any meaningful progress towards a successful reorganization. In fact, the undisputed record of this case is that while the debtor has been a debtor-in-possession, it\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1. Has no business operations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   2. Has no meaningful income;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   3. Is liquidating as opposed to reorganizing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   4. Has incurred administrative expenses in the form of professional fees and yet has no liquid assets available to satisfy them;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   5. Has incurred administrative expenses in the form of professional fees, yet does not identify them in its monthly financial reports (as the line item for professional fees incurred reflects nothing in each report on file);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   6. Has invoked the automatic stay for the primary purpose of avoiding a trial regarding the debtor's alleged interest in various intellectual property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   7. Has replaced the non-bankruptcy forum litigation costs with the costs associated with the litigation that has consumed this bankruptcy case (namely, whether the debtor is eligible for bankruptcy relief; whether this case was filed in good faith; whether the debtor may sell the disputed assets; and whether the automatic stay should be lifted as to the entities having a competing interest in the disputed property);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   8. Has obfuscated lawful discovery requests propounded by litigants who have challenged the debtor's eligibility to be a debtor in bankruptcy,\n   who have challenged the good faith basis of the debtor's commencement of this case (i.e., have contended that the bankruptcy is nothing but a litigation tactic), and who have challenged the debtor's ability to sell the disputed property interests;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   9. Has provided affidavits which are evasive or incomplete or misleading in support of defective answers to discovery;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   10. Has ignored and/or obfuscated directives of this Court to produce documents responsive to lawful discovery requests and has provided no convincing arguments excusing such failures;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   11. Has improperly and without appropriate excuse withheld documents responsive to discovery requests;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   12. Cavalierly claimed that its woefully inadequate responses to discovery were \"un-important\" or \"no big deal\" or something to that effect, despite the fact that the debtor is a fiduciary, has a duty to answer discovery and despite the fact that the debtor bears the burden of proving that its bankruptcy case is one that has been filed and prosecuted in good faith;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   13. Is unable to pay a monetary sanction as a result of its failure to answer lawful discovery as the debtor has no liquid assets;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   14. Has not demonstrated to the Court and has not convinced the Court that the debtor's contumacious failure to respond to discovery requests will cease;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   15. Despite the fact that it acknowledged the existence of the ownership dispute(s) as to intellectual property rights at issue in this case, has improperly sought to pursue a \"free and clear\" sale of the disputed or alleged rights only to be \"corrected\" once the Court and certain parties-in-interest questioned the legitimacy of such efforts;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   16. Has listed on the internet various assets for sale without first obtaining prior approval of this Court;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   17. Has consulted or utilized the services of counsel (Mr. Herman) who has not been retained by an order of this Court, and who may have a conflict of interest (as his firm is an alleged pre-petition creditor and his spouse is both an alleged trustee of the Dille Family Trust and owner of a related entity that is alleged to have entered into a licensing agreement with the debtor); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   18. Admitted that the beneficiaries of the debtor-trust are deadlocked, and one 50% beneficiary received no notice and did not consent to the filing of the instant bankruptcy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   In light of all of the circumstances of this case, the record is clear and convincing that \"cause\" supports the appointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee in this case pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201104\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (a)(2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   Such appointment is not only appropriate given the aforementioned items of \"cause,\" it is also appropriate given the acrimony and pervasive litigation that has consumed this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Marvel Entertainment Group, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1275421,1318526\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/140/463/\">\n    140 F.3d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 1998) (appointment appropriate given high level of acrimony).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   In rendering its decision directing the appointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee,\n   the Court duly considered the debtor's suggestion that an examiner be appointed in lieu of the appointment of a trustee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   However, it is unlikely that the costs associated with the appointment of an examiner would be any less than that of a trustee. In addition, an examiner's investigation will do nothing but further add an element of delay to this case. Moreover, an examiner lacks the requisite powers and duties of management, which is necessary to move this case forward in a Chapter 11.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, the primary litigants in this case support the appointment of a Chapter 11 Trustee, even noting that such appointment could have the salutary effect of promoting the possibility of settlement for the benefit of all constituencies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   For all of these reasons, an Order shall be entered that directs the Office of the U.S. Trustee to immediately appoint a Chapter 11 Trustee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Dille Family Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203629650\">\n    2018 WL 3629650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. W.D. Pa., July 25, 2018).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Attorney Robert S. Bernstein was duly appointed Chapter 11 Trustee in this case. In this regard he has exercised his duties admirably and consistent with his fiduciary duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Despite the appointment of the Chapter 11 Trustee, the trial of the motions to dismiss and relief from stay remained on the Court's calendar for August 21, 2018. On or about that date, the Chapter 11 Trustee and Team Angry Filmworks reached a tentative agreement whereby the Team Angry motions were withdrawn without prejudice, and the Chapter 11 Trustee and Team Angry Filmworks proposed a Chapter 11 Plan to be funded through the development and monetization of the intellectual property. The Nowlan Family Trust was also granted relief from stay to complete the Eastern District litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Thereafter, the Chapter 11 Trustee filed a motion seeking approval of the Team Angry deal pursuant to Fed.R.Bankr. 9019. This deal, however, was opposed by the Nowlan Family Trust, Ms. Geer, Mr. Herman and others. Geer and Herman then filed their own competing plan whereby Geer and Herman would allegedly control the monetization of the \"Buck Rogers\" related intellectual property for themselves and certain creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A hearing was then held on November 27, 2018. At that hearing, the Chapter 11 Trustee observed, in so many words, that this case is a difficult case and that the negotiations have been fluid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Specifically, much to the surprise of Team Angry Filmworks, the Chapter 11 Trustee advised the Court at the November 27, 2018 hearing that the Chapter 11 Trustee was exercising his business judgment and elected to abandon the Team Angry Filmworks proposal and forge ahead with a plan agreed upon by the Nowlan Family Trust, Ms. Geer, and Mr. Herman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Mr. Bernstein's analysis of the competing proposals was that the joint proposal of Nowlan Family Trust and Geer &amp; Herman was a better offer for creditors because it proposed remitting to the bankruptcy estate $ 500,000 for creditors. It was represented that this sum would pay creditors a dividend of approximately fifty cents on the dollar. It has been stated in these\n   proceedings that trust beneficiaries (Ms. Wiliams and Mr. Dille) would receive nothing on account of their interests under this new proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Obviously Team Angry Filmworks and Don Murphy were dismayed at this turn of events. Ms. Williams and Mr. Flint Dille were also dismayed. As such, at the November 27, 2018 hearing, counsel for Team Angry Filmworks orally renewed the Team Angry motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   At the November 27\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing, the Chapter 11 Trustee was then directed to file his amended plan and the colloquy of that hearing reflected not only the recognition that debtor eligibility remained a live issue in this case, but also that a determination of this issue would be a precondition to the confirmation of any plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Thereafter, on December 11, 2018, the expedited Motion to Dismiss was filed by Team Angry Filmworks, Don Murphy, Lorraine Dille Williams, and Robert Nichols Flint Dille.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   This written motion renewed the challenge to the debtor's eligibility to be a debtor, and argued that the Dille Family Trust is not a \"business trust.\" This motion also reasserted the claims of \"bad faith\" that were contained in the prior motion. The motion also asserted various claims that Ms. Geer and Mr. Herman committed various misdeeds in connection with both their representation of the Dille Family Trust and the filing and prosecution of this bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   A hearing on the Motion to Dismiss was held on January 7, 2019. At that hearing, argument was spirited by all parties including the Chapter 11 Trustee and Team Angry Filmworks. In addition, Lorraine Dille Williams appeared\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   and counsel for Robert Nichols Flint Dille appeared. At the hearing, these beneficiaries reported to the Court that they lost confidence in Ms. Geer and are concerned that no estate fiduciary is looking out for the interests of the beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court then took this matter under advisement and ordered supplemental briefing. Briefing was completed on February 5, 2019, and thereafter the Chapter 11 Trustee filed a slew of motions including: a motion to convert this case to a Chapter 7 liquidation, a motion to sell assets, and a motion for bid procedures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The gist of these motions is that given all of the acrimony, and the costs attendant to litigation, the Trustee believes that a reorganization is neither possible nor likely. The Trustee would therefore like to sell the intellectual property and other assets for the benefit of creditors and convert this case to a Chapter 7 liquidation. The putative stalking horse bidder of the assets is an entity owned or controlled by one of the co-trustees of the Nowlan Family Trust, and the effect of such sale is to result in no distribution on account of the beneficial interests of Lorraine Dille Williams and Robert Nichols Flint Dille. The current offering price for the assets in question is $ 300,000, and such price will also result in less than full payment to unsecured creditors whose claims listed on the Court's official claims register exceed $ 4.8 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, it appears that a substantial share of the proceeds would be paid to administrative expense creditors because the Chapter 11 Trustee's fees alone exceed $ 143,000 given all of the acrimony in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Suffice to say, Team Angry Filmworks, Don Murphy, Lorraine Dille Williams, and Robert Nichols Flint Dille have objected to the flurry of motions filed by the Chapter 11 Trustee.

Section 4.A. of Article IV of\n   <em>\n    The Dille Family Trust\n   </em>\n   supports this conclusion, where the trust empowers the trustee to \"receive, take possession of, sue for, recover and preserve the assets of the trust fund, both real and personal, coming to its attention or knowledge, and the rents, issues and profits arising from such\" assets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Section 5.F. of Article V of\n   <em>\n    The Dille Family Trust\n   </em>\n   provides further support, where it states with respect to tangible personal property the following: \"In the event husband and/or wife surrender any such property to the trustee, or upon their deaths, trustee shall take possession, assume control, preserve and maintain such property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Section 6.A. of Article VI of\n   <em>\n    The Dille Family Trust\n   </em>\n   also supports this conclusion where it states: \"During the term of this trust agreement, trustee shall hold, manage, invest and reinvest the trust fund, collect the income and profits from it, pay the necessary expenses of trust administration, and distribute the net income and principal as provided in this ARTICLE VI.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Other provisions of\n   <em>\n    The Dille Family Trust\n   </em>\n   reflect the estate planning nature of the trust. For example, the document contains provisions relating to the \"Division of Trust Fund Upon Death of First Settlor,\" \"Authorized Actions at Settlors' Deaths,\" \"Deceased Spouses Expenses\" (including provisions for estate or inheritance taxes, and funeral expenses), \"Payments of Income to Surviving Spouse,\" \"Payments of Principal to Surviving Spouse,\" \"Special Withdrawal Rights of Surviving Spouse,\" \"Power of Appointment in Surviving Spouse,\" and \"Distribution at Surviving Spouses' Death.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Article VI of\n   <em>\n    The Dille Family Trust\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 6.D., 6.F., 6.G., 6.H., 6.I., 6.J., 6.K., and 6.L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   That the Dille Family Trust is primarily an estate or succession planning device designed to protect and preserve the\n   <em>\n    res\n   </em>\n   is embodied in the\n   <em>\n    Amendment\n   </em>\n   dated January 5, 1982. A stated purpose of the amendment was that \"several provisions of said [\n   <em>\n    Dille Family Trust\n   </em>\n   ] agreement require revision in view of the changes in the Federal Estate Tax Law effective January 1, 1982...\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amendment\n   </em>\n   at p. 1. Ms. Geer has even acknowledged that the\n   <em>\n    Amendment\n   </em>\n   was designed to \"take advantage of the federal estate tax marital deduction to minimize the federal estate death tax.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 508 at p. 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Amendment\n   </em>\n   also contains various provisions addressing \"Division of Trust Fund Upon Death of First Settlor,\" \"Authorized Actions at Settlors' Deaths,\" \"Deceased Spouses Expenses,\" payments to \"Surviving Spouse,\" and \"Special Withdrawal Rights of Surviving Spouse.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amendment\n   </em>\n   at pp. 2-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Amendment\n   </em>\n   further highlights that in exercising discretion conferred upon the trustee, the \"trustee is requested to take into consideration the fact that settlors' intent is to benefit primarily the Surviving Spouse and the interests of the remaindermen should be considered of secondary importance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   All of these provisions of the trust agreement lead this Court to conclude that the Dille Family Trust is an ordinary trust as opposed to a business trust. The Court's conclusion is particularly acute since neither the Chapter 11 Trustee nor Ms. Geer have offered or produced any evidence indicating that when the Dille Family Trust was created the settlors intended anything other than the creation of an ordinary trust.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The record reflects that Lorraine Dille Williams has filed with the Court a letter dated February 5, 2019. In this letter, Ms. Williams admitted that the Dille Family Trust was \"created as an estate planning vehicle.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 507. She also produced an email from her parents' attorney, Dennis Fox, who created the Dille Family Trust. In this email, Mr. Fox states that the Dille Family Trust \"was a revocable, living ('inter-vivos') trust. I never prepared a 'business trust.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Such statements made by Ms. Williams and Mr. Fox are hearsay, because they are out of court statements not made under oath and are offered for the truth of the matter asserted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.R.Evid. 801. The Court will therefore not consider them in connection with the findings and conclusions herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Regardless, the Court observes that Ms. Geer has filed various documents with the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 508. Such documents include a 2012 U.S. Income Tax Return for Estates and Trusts (Form 1041) filed by the Dille Family Trust.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Ex. F. In this form, the Dille Family Trust made no election as a small business trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   In addition, neither the Chapter 11 Trustee nor Ms. Geer has offered any explanation as to why the Dille Family Trust, if it is a true \"business trust\" to be treated as an entity other than a small business trust, did not file its tax returns using IRS series 1120 forms (which relate to taxation of corporate entities or unincorporated associations having the attributes of corporate entities).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morrissey v.

Perhaps its because the Dille Family Trust is an ordinary trust, i.e. a fiduciary relationship, and not a business trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   A review of the litigation before the California District Court reflects that the Dille Family Trust argued as much.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, in the California District Court action, Ms. Geer argued that because the Dille Family Trust \"lacks the capacity to sue and be sued,\" the lawsuit should be dismissed or transferred to the location where Ms. Geer resides.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss Complaint\n   </em>\n   at pp.1, 3, 5, and 7-8 (filed at ECF No. 15 at Case No. CV 15-05880-R (C.D. Cal. 2015) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In support for this assertion, Ms. Geer further stated that a \"trust is not a legal entity\" but rather is a fiduciary relationship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 5. Therefore, she admitted that \"the Trust has no independent legal\n   existence and therefore jurisdiction must exist over the Trustee [Ms. Geer] personally.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reply Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint\n   </em>\n   at pp. 6, 9, and 11 (filed at ECF No. 23 at Case No. CV 15-05880-R (C.D.

The Central District of California then transferred the civil action to the Western District of Pennsylvania apparently in agreement with the position of Ms. Geer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   All of these circumstances reflect that the Dille Family Trust is to be regarded as an ordinary trust as opposed to a business trust.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Business Activity, Without More, Does Not Convert the Trust Into a Business Trust\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   It is true that the Dille Family Trust has from time to time licensed certain \"Buck Rogers\" related intellectual property. The extent and magnitude of these affairs is hardly clear in the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   For example, Ms. Geer points to the\n   <em>\n    Documentation of Flint Dille in Support of Proof of Claim\n   </em>\n   as evidence of the alleged extensive business activities of the Dille Family Trust. Aside from being hearsay, this document is far from being convincing support for the legal position of Ms. Geer because it states unequivocally at paragraph 23: \"There were numerous deals that did not happen due to either incompetence or other agenda of the Trustee of the Trust.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 508.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   In addition, the 2012 tax returns filed by Ms. Geer reflect no net income\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   as all royalties were consumed by the professional expenses and management fees of the trustee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   In filings made by Ms. Geer before this Court under penalty of perjury, the gross revenue of the Dille Family Trust was admitted as being \"none\" when this bankruptcy case was commenced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Statement of Financial Affairs\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 17, at \u00b6 1.

Trust assets consisted of shares of stock in several corporations, a number of patents, and trademarks. The trust agreement directed the trustee to pay income to the beneficiaries, and empowered the trustee to invade the principal if the income was insufficient for their comfort and support. The trust agreement vested the trustee with broad discretionary powers, including to retain, sell and invest trust property, to borrow money for any purpose, to mortgage and pledge trust property, to receive and commingle any other property, and to \" 'operate, maintain, repair, rehabilitate, alter or remove any improvements on real estate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   [90 B.R.] at 327. The court found that the object and purpose of the trust was to provide assets for the comfort and support of the two beneficiaries, and that business activities were but one of the options considered by the trustee in promoting the purposes of the trust.

This record hardly supports a claim of estoppel because the Chapter 11 Trustee received exactly what he agreed to in this case, that is that the parties could renew their motion to dismiss if the original settlement was not consummated or approved.
