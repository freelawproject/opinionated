Material Facts Not in Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Debtors Ivan Goins and Gabriella Gibbs filed a Chapter 13 petition on September 24, 2013. [Complaint \u00b6 7; Answer \u00b6 3; SMF \u00b6 1]. The Court entered an order confirming their Chapter 13 plan on April 14, 2014. [Complaint \u00b6 8, Answer \u00b6 4; SMF \u00b6 2]. The plan provided no dividend to general unsecured creditors. [\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ]. On December 11, 2015, the Chapter 13 Trustee filed a motion to dismiss the bankruptcy case for failure to make plan payments. [Complaint \u00b6 9; Answer \u00b6 5; SMF \u00b6 3]. On April 13, 2016, the Court entered an order converting the case to Chapter 7, at which time Plaintiff was appointed as Chapter 7 Trustee. [Complaint \u00b6 10; Answer \u00b6 6; SMF \u00b6 4].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the second reset meeting of creditors, held on July 11, 2016, Debtors testified that on October 6, 2014, they were both injured in an automobile accident. [Complaint \u00b6 14; SMF \u00b6 7; Resp. at 4]. A year after the accident, Debtors received a settlement of $ 500,000 (the \"Settlement\"). [Complaint \u00b6 14; SMF \u00b6 8; Resp. at 4]. Debtors never amended their sworn statements to disclose the personal injury claim or their sworn schedules to schedule the Settlement. [Complaint \u00b6 15; SMF \u00b6 9; Resp. at 4]. Debtors testified that approximately $ 250,000 went to legal fees, expenses, and medical costs. [Complaint \u00b6 15; SMF \u00b6 10; Resp. at 4]. On October 17, 2015, Debtors deposited $ 286,971.37 (the \"Remaining Settlement Funds\") in their joint bank account. [Complaint \u00b6 16; SMF \u00b6 11]. When questioned by Plaintiff, Debtors testified that they only had about $ 20,000 of the Remaining Settlement Funds. [Complaint \u00b6 17; SMF \u00b6 12].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiff directed Debtors to immediately turn over those funds to him. [Complaint \u00b6 17; SMF \u00b6 13]. To date, Debtors have turned over $ 16,000 in cash, plus the Chapter 13 Trustee returned $ 3,161.18. [Complaint \u00b6 17; SMF \u00b6 14]. Debtors further testified that their children and grandchildren all received gifts from the Remaining Settlement Funds. [Complaint \u00b6 18; SMF \u00b6 15]. Debtors have six children between the ages of 23 and 34, all of whom\n   received between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 as gifts. [Id.]. Some of the gifts were used Mercedes-Benz vehicles purchased from Defendant. [SMF \u00b6 15; McGhee Aff. \u00b6 12-13, 21]. Defendant is a used car dealer. [Complaint \u00b6 13; Answer \u00b6 9; SMF \u00b6 16]. Clifford McGhee has owned and operated Defendant for more than 40 years. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 3].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   To resolve discharge issues raised by Plaintiff, Debtors signed a waiver of discharge, which was approved by the Court. [Complaint \u00b6 19-21; SMF \u00b6 17-19]. Debtor Ivan Goins became ill following conversion of the case and passed away on February 7, 2017. [Complaint \u00b6 22; SMF \u00b6 20].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In October 2015, Mr. Goins presented to Mr. McGhee either a copy of a settlement check or a deposit slip for funds he had received from the personal injury claim. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 6]. On October 24, 2015, Mr. Goins appeared at Defendant's Covington Highway location seeking to purchase vehicles for his family members in a cash transaction to be paid by personal check. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 7, 9, 12]. Defendant's staff executed documents indicating the vehicles to be sold, which effectively removed those vehicles from Defendant's active inventory. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 10, 11]. Mr. McGhee informed Mr. Goins that once the personal check cleared, he could take delivery of the vehicles. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 14]. Based on the information provided to Mr. McGhee by Mr. Goins, Mr. McGhee believed Mr. Goins to be solvent. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 15]. Mr. McGhee did not conduct a credit check because it was a cash transaction. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 16]. The transaction was a typical cash transaction not unlike hundreds Mr. McGhee has participated in over 40 years. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 17]. Mr. Goins did not disclose to Mr. McGhee that Debtors were in bankruptcy, and there were no indications that Debtors should be treated differently than any other cash buyer. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 18]. Four subsequent transfers occurred in a similar manner, except that Debtor Gabriella Gibbs asked to be listed as a lienholder on certain vehicles. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 22, 23].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Debtors made the following transfers (collectively, the \"Transfers\") postpetition and without bankruptcy court approval to Defendant for the purchase of vehicles for Debtors' adult sons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 On or about October 26, 2015, Debtors transferred $ 57,801 (the \"First Transfer\") to Defendant for the purchase of three 2008 Mercedes-Benz vehicles and one 2009 Mercedes-Benz vehicle.

[Complaint \u00b6 27; Answer \u00b6 23; SMF \u00b6 25; McGhee Aff. Ex. B].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant received a total of $ 123,007.50 from Debtors postpetition. [SMF \u00b6 26; McGhee Aff., Ex. B]. On August 27,\n   2017, Plaintiff made demand by certified mail on Defendant for the amount of the First Transfer. [Complaint \u00b6 28; Answer \u00b6 24]. Upon further investigation, Plaintiff identified an additional four transfers to Defendant. [Id.] Defendant, through its attorney, responded on September 19, 2017 and denied responsibility. [Complaint \u00b6 29; Answer \u00b6 25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant's Response to the Motion includes a\n   <em>\n    Statement That There Are Material Facts to Be Determined by a Jury\n   </em>\n   . [Resp. at 4]. The disputed facts identified by Defendant are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (1) Whether the personal injury settlement check made payable to Debtors and their attorneys is the \"initial transfer\" of postpetition assets of the estate? [Resp. at 4]. Defendant asserts that \"The facts of this case indicate that a personal injury check was tendered, deposited and disbursed post-petition by attorneys without prior appointment of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.\" [Id.] The Court takes judicial notice that the Court approved Plaintiff's motion to enter into a settlement agreement with the law firm that handled Debtors' personal injury claim, Montlick &amp; Associates (\"Montlick\"), to approve Montlick's employment, approve the personal injury settlement, and to recover a portion of Montlick's fees. [Case No. 13-70835, Docs. 147, 150]. The motion to settle indicated that Montlick received the settlement proceeds and then disbursed the funds to Debtors and to itself for its attorney fees. [Id. Doc. 147 at 2]. Defendant has not shown any dispute about the underlying facts of disbursement of the settlement proceeds-i.e., that the proceeds were initially transferred to Montlick, which then disbursed a portion of the proceeds to Debtors, who in turn transferred part of the proceeds to Defendant. Whether these facts establish that Defendant is not the initial transferee is a question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   (2) In an action to avoid and recover postpetition transfers, are the limitations to Plaintiff's recovery efforts pursuant to \u00a7 550(a)(2) applicable to Defendant as a subsequent transferee? [Resp. at 5]. Again, this goes to whether Defendant is an initial or subsequent transferee and whether Defendant is therefore entitled to a \"good-faith\" defense to Plaintiff's recovery of the Transfers. [\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Part III.B]. As Defendant contends, there is no dispute that Defendant provided vehicles in exchange for the funds paid by Debtors. Nor is there any dispute for purposes of this Motion that Debtors paid in cash, and Defendant was unaware of their pending bankruptcy case. Whether these facts establish Defendant as a subsequent transferee with a good-faith defense is a question of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (3) Is the entry of a default judgment in Adversary Proceeding No. 17-5257-BEM on June 7, 2018, a \"satisfaction\" pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20550\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) ? [Resp. at 6]. As explained further below, the\n   <em>\n    judgment\n   </em>\n   is not a satisfaction, but any funds Plaintiff recovered based on the judgment may constitute a full or partial satisfaction of unauthorized transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

As explained above, the Trustee has demonstrated the Transfers are avoidable. However, Defendant\n   argues that Montlick was the initial transferee of the settlement proceeds, and Defendant is a subsequent transferee. Defendant further argues that it meets the elements of the good faith defense under \u00a7 550(b) because the Transfers were conducted at arm's length, for reasonably equivalent value, and Defendant was unaware of Debtors' bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Defendant has not shown that it is a subsequent transferee. There is no dispute that the initial recipient of the settlement proceeds was Montlick. However, under the Georgia Rules of Professional Conduct, an attorney has no control over client funds. Ga. R. Prof. Conduct 1.15(I)(c) (\"[A] lawyer shall promptly deliver to the client ... any funds or other property that the client ... is entitled to receive and, upon request by the client ... shall promptly render a full accounting regarding such property.\") Thus, an attorney in possession of settlement proceeds is generally regarded as a mere conduit, in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    Harwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076253,3787431\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/1312/\">\n    628 F.3d at 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In the vast majority of cases, a client's settlement funds transferred in and out of a lawyer's trust account will be just like bank transfers, and lawyers as intermediaries will be entitled to mere conduit status because they lack control over the funds.\"). Because the record contains no evidence that Montlick exercised control over the funds that were ultimately transferred to Defendant\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   or that Montlick acted without good faith, Defendant has failed to prove that it was an immediate or mediate transferee of the initial transferee, which is the threshold element of the affirmative defense under \u00a7 550(b). Instead, the evidence shows that Defendant was the initial transferee of the settlement proceeds at issue. Thus, even taking as true that Defendant took the Transfers for value, in good faith, and without knowledge of their avoidability, Defendant cannot escape liability under \u00a7 550 based on an affirmative defense under \u00a7 550(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant argues in the alternative that Plaintiff is not entitled to a double recovery under \u00a7 550(d). Section 550(d) provides that \"The trustee is entitled to only a single satisfaction under subsection (a) of this section.\" But this does not preclude the trustee from recovering the full value of the transfers. \" Section 550(d) limits the trustee to a 'single satisfaction': no more and\n   <em>\n    no less\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Dzikowski v.

[Gordon v. Goins, AP No. 17-5257, Doc. 12]. The Goins AP involves some, but not all, of the same vehicles at issue here, and it encompasses cash gifts not at issue in this proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the judgment establishes\n   liability for the transfers avoided in the Goins AP, there is no satisfaction until the Trustee has actually recovered the property or its value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   There is no evidence in the record regarding whether Plaintiff has obtained any recovery from the defendants in the Goins AP or how such recovery was allocated. To the extent this proceeding involves transfers not at issue in the Goins AP, there is no factual dispute regarding Defendant's liability under \u00a7 550(a). However, to the extent Plaintiff seeks to avoid the same transfers in both proceedings, Plaintiff cannot recover any amounts that may have been received from the defendants in the Goins AP for the vehicles in the First Transfer. Plaintiff's judgment for the First Transfer must be limited to the amount of the First Transfer less any amounts allocated to the First Transfer transactions received from defendants in the Goins AP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Defendant further argues that it is entitled to recoup or set off against Plaintiff's recovery efforts under \u00a7 550(e) as a good faith transferee. Section 550(e) provides as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   (e)(1) A good faith transferee from whom the trustee may recover under subsection (a) of this section has a lien on the property recovered to secure the lesser of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   (A) the cost, to such transferee, of any improvement made after the transfer, less the amount of any profit realized by or accruing to such transferee from such property; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (B) any increase in the value of such property as a result of such improvement, of the property transferred. (2) In this subsection, \"improvement\" includes-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (A) physical additions or changes to the property transferred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (B) repairs to such property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (C) payment of any tax on such property;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   (D) payment of any debt secured by a lien on such property that is superior or equal to the rights of the trustee; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (E) preservation of such property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In the McGhee Affidavit, Defendant makes various assertions about its costs to acquire, repair, and maintain the vehicles that were ultimately transferred in exchange for the settlement proceeds. [McGhee Aff. \u00b6 19-20 &amp; Ex. A]. However, the estate property at issue here was the settlement proceeds, not the vehicles. Furthermore, subsection (e) only applies when the transferee made improvements to the property\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the transfer. The costs incurred by Defendant occurred prior to the Transfers. Accordingly, Defendant is not entitled to the benefit of \u00a7 550(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant also argues that Plaintiff is precluded from a recovery against Defendant because Defendant is not an insider of Debtors. [Resp. at 13]. Section 550(c) prohibits the trustee from recovering from non-insiders if certain requirements are met. Those requirements include that the transfer occurred 90 days to one year prepetition, the transfer was avoided under \u00a7 547, and the transfer was made for the benefit of a creditor who was an insider. Here, the Transfers were made postpetition rather than during the applicable prepetition period, and the Transfers were avoided under \u00a7 549 rather than \u00a7 547. Accordingly, \u00a7 550(c) does not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Finally, Defendant makes much of the undisputed fact that it is an innocent party to the Transfers. However, except as otherwise set forth in \u00a7 549 and \u00a7 550 and\n   discussed above, there is no innocent-transferee defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Delco Oil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798842,4224093\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/1255/\">\n    599 F.3d at 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" Sections 549(a) and 550(a) by their terms contain no reference to, let alone an actual defense based on, the transferee's status (vendor, purchaser, etc.) or upon its state of mind (innocent, culpable, etc.)\") In\n   <em>\n    Delco\n   </em>\n   , the court declined to create an exception for initial transferees of postpetition transfers of cash collateral when Congress had not done so.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3798842,4224093\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/1255/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, this Court cannot create an exception for Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment on Count II of the Complaint. With respect to the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Transfers, Plaintiff may recover the property or its value from Defendant. With respect to the First Transfer, which is related to some of the transfers avoided in the Goins AP, Plaintiff's may recover the property or its value from Defendant less any amounts that have been collected from the defendants in the Goins AP for the vehicles in the First Transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Preservation of Transfers for the Estate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code provides for preservation of avoided transfers as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   Any transfer avoided under section ... 549 ... of this title ... is preserved for the benefit of the estate but only with respect to property of the estate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
