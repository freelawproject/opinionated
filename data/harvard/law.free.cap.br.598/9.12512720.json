JACOBVITZ, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n   At a status conference held December 12, 2018, an issue arose concerning the applicability of the automatic stay to the removal of a state court class action lawsuit to this Court initiating Adversary Proceeding No. 18-1055-J, and whether, if the stay did not apply to removal, the automatic stay applies to the continuation of the litigation in the removed case before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Resulting from Status Conference - Docket No. 46. The Court directed the parties to brief these issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee (\"Trustee\") contends that the automatic stay applies to removal of the state court class action lawsuit to this Court and to the continuation of the litigation in the removed case before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chapter 7 Trustee's Brief on Applicability of the Automatic Stay (\"Trustee's Brief\" - Docket No. 62). The Trustee requests the Court to strike the Notice of Removal and all subsequent documents filed in Adversary Proceeding No. 18-1055-J and remand the Adversary Proceeding to state court. Debtor disagrees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor's Brief in Response to Chapter 7 Trustee's Brief on Applicability of the Automatic Stay (\"Debtor's Response Brief\" - Docket No. 70). The Chapter 7 Trustee also filed a reply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chapter 7 Trustee's Reply Brief on Applicability of the Automatic Stay (\"Reply\" - Docket No. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court has considered the Trustee's Brief, the Debtor's Response Brief, the Reply, and relevant case law. Courts disagree whether the automatic stay applies to the removal and to continued litigation of a removed state court action in the bankruptcy court.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hoskins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9500799\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/266/872/#p877\">\n    266 B.R. 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 877 (Bankr.

E.D.N.Y. May 5, 2009) (\"[T]he automatic stay would not apply to a case removed to the forum of the debtor's bankruptcy case\") (citation omitted). The Court is convinced that the automatic stay does not apply to the Debtor's removal of the state court class action lawsuit to this Court and does not apply to the continuation of the litigation in the removed class action lawsuit before this Court. However, to the extent the automatic stay applies to removal or to the continuation of the litigation of the removed action in this Court, the Court\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   annuls the automatic stay to validate the removal of the state court class action suit to this Court and modifies the automatic stay to permit litigation of Adversary Proceeding No. 18-1055-J before this Court. The Court is not modifying the stay to permit continued litigation before the state court in the event of remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Debtor commenced this bankruptcy case by filing a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on August 6, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. Pre-petition, Matthew Kitts commenced an action against the Debtor in the Second Judicial District Court as Cause No. D-202-CV-2016-01851 (the \"State Court Action\"). The State Court Action is a class action lawsuit filed against the Debtor; Budget Payday Loans, Limited Partnership (\"Budget Payday\"); and Hitex, Inc. (\"Hitex\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Adversary Proceeding No. 18-1055-J - Docket Nos. 18 and 19. The state court certified the class as to the Debtor. The class has not yet been certified as to Budget Payday or Hitex. Budget Payday is a Chapter 7 debtor in Case No. 18-11967-t7 pending before Judge David T. Thuma. Hitex is not in bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 23, 2018, Debtor filed a notice of removal of the State Court Action to this Court, initiating Adversary Proceeding No. 18-1055-J (the \"Class Action Adversary Proceeding\"). Mr. Kitts, as Plaintiff in the Class Action Adversary Proceeding, filed a motion for remand and abstention, which the Court stayed pending the Court's ruling on the applicability of the automatic stay.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Action Adversary Proceeding - Docket Nos. 10 and 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The Removal Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Removal of claims related to bankruptcy cases is governed by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , which provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   A party may remove any claim or cause of action in a civil action ... to the district court for the district where such civil action is pending, if such district court has jurisdiction of such claim or cause of action under section 1334 of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The removal statute thus has three applicable requirements: 1) the removing party must be a party to the state court action; 2) the state court action must be removed to the district court where the state court action is pending; and 3) the district court must have jurisdiction over the claim.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Bankruptcy Rule 9027 sets forth the procedure for removal, including time restrictions for timely filing a notice of removal. Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9027.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Debtor satisfied the statutory removal requirements and timely filed the notice of removal per Bankruptcy Rule 9027. The Debtor was a party to the State Court Action and removed the case to the bankruptcy court in the district where the State Court Action was pending. Although the removal statute provides for removal to the federal district court, all matters related to a bankruptcy case pending in the District of New Mexico are automatically referred to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Administrative Order - Misc. No. 84-0324 (\"Pursuant to the authority of Section 157, Title 28, United States Code, and Rule 9029 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure... all cases under Title 11 and all proceedings arising under Title 11 or arising in or related to a case under Title 11 are referred to the bankruptcy judges for the district to the extent permitted by\n   law.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has jurisdiction over the class action claims asserted against the Debtor in the State Court Action because such claims are related to the Debtor's bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (conferring jurisdiction over \"all civil proceedings ... related to cases under title 11.\"). The State Court Action is related to the Debtor's bankruptcy case because its outcome will have an effect on the administration of claims in the Debtor's bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Gardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6122748,10540340\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/1515/\">\n    913 F.2d 1515\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1518 (10th Cir. 1990) (explaining that \"[r]elated proceedings are civil proceedings that, in the absence of a bankruptcy petition, could have been brought in a district court or state court\" and that a proceeding \"is related to the bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor's rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action in any way, thereby impacting on the handling and administration of the bankruptcy estate.\") (citations omitted). Finally, the notice of removal, filed on August 23, 2017, seventeen days after the filing of Debtor's voluntary Chapter 7 petition, was timely filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9027(a)(2) (\"If the claim or cause of action in a civil action is pending when a case under the Code is commenced, a notice of removal may be filed ... within ... 90 days after the order for relief in the case under the Code\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"The commencement of a voluntary case under a chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under such chapter.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Applicability of the Automatic Stay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   It is undisputed that that the State Court Action was stayed upon the filing of Debtor's bankruptcy petition with respect to claims in the State Court Action asserted against the Debtor. The State Court Action is a judicial proceeding filed against the Debtor to recover class action claims against the Debtor that arose before the commencement of Debtor's Chapter 7 bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Arguments of the parties\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Trustee argues that the automatic stay applies to the removal of the State Court Action to this Court inasmuch as removal results in the continuation of the State Court Action. The Trustee reasons further that because removal of the stayed State Court Action violated the automatic stay it therefore is void.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ellis v. Consolidated Diesel Elec. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6121770,10532043\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/894/371/\">\n    894 F.2d 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 372 (10th Cir. 1990) (\"It is well established that any action taken in violation of the stay is void and without effect.\") (citations omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F &amp; M Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%203941382\">\n    2013 WL 3941382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (concluding that removal of the state court action to federal court without first obtaining relief from the automatic stay was void). The Trustee argues, alternatively, that even if the automatic stay does not apply to the removal of the State Court Action to this Court, the stay applies to continuation of the removed action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, the Trustee argues that it makes no difference to the applicability of the stay that the Debtor as defendant in the State Court Action removed the action to bankruptcy court. The Trustee relies upon\n   <em>\n    TW Telecom Holdings, Inc. v. Carolina Internet, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4192659,3847373\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/661/495/\">\n    661 F.3d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 2011) and\n   <em>\n    In re Beery\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3763517\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/452/825/\">\n    452 B.R. 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. D.N.M. 2011) to assert that the automatic stay, which applies to a creditor's prosecution of a claim against the debtor, likewise applies to the debtor's actions to defend the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Debtor's principal argument to counter the Trustee's assertions is that removal did not constitute a continuation of the litigation but merely effectuated a change of venue. The Debtor argues further that although continuation of the removed action in bankruptcy court may be subject to the automatic stay, a motion to remand is mere a response to the removal and does not amount to continuation of the removed action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Authority supporting the Trustee's position that the automatic stay applies to removal to bankruptcy court and to the continuation of the removed action in the bankruptcy court\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Trustee relies on the plain language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) to support his position. Section 362 provides, in relevant part, that the filing of a bankruptcy petition\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (1) the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial, administrative, or other action or proceeding against the debtor that was our could have been commenced before the commencement of the [bankruptcy] case ... or to recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the [bankruptcy] case ...; [or]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the [bankruptcy] case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (6).

Based on that ruling, the parties will litigate and the Court will make rulings in the Class Action Adversary Proceeding, including a ruling on the motion for abstention and remand. The purposes of the automatic stay are not served by barring removal of the State Court Action or by barring the continuation of the Class Action Adversary Proceeding before this Court.

Provided a state court action is removed to the bankruptcy court where the debtor's bankruptcy case is pending, the automatic stay does not apply to the removal or to the continuation of the removed state court action before the bankruptcy court. Further, to ensure the orderly adjudication of the Class Action Adversary Proceeding before this Court, annulment and termination of the automatic stay is appropriate, if and to the extent the stay otherwise would apply as determined by another court.
