Sacca, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The principal issue before this Court is whether the 87-year-old Mrs. Wade and 74-year-old Mr. Wade, both of whom live on fixed incomes from social security and pensions, converted their case from Chapter 7 to 13 in bad faith to gain the benefit of the more generous discharge provisions in Chapter 13. This issue arises through an Objection to Confirmation of Amended Plan and Amended Motion to Dismiss (the \"Motion to Dismiss\") [Bnkry. Doc. 54] and\n   an Amended Complaint to Object to Discharge of Debtors, to the Dischargeability of Their Debt to Plaintiff, to Determine the Validity and Priority of Claims, and to Subordinate Certain Claims and/or for Damages\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the \"Amended Complaint\") [Adv. Doc. 10] filed by judgment creditor Dale Recycling &amp; Used Auto Parts, Inc.'s (\"DRUAP\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The underlying bankruptcy case was filed by Arnold and Winnifred Wade on August 24, 2017 [Bnkry. Doc. 1]. The Wades are elderly, fixed-income debtors against whom DRUAP obtained a judgment in the amount of $ 20,000, the circumstances of which will be discussed below. In its Amended Complaint, DRUAP seeks to: (1) deny confirmation of the Wades' plan, (2) deny the Wades' discharge (and find that the debt owed to DRUAP is specifically non-dischargeable), and (3) direct the trustee to pursue fraudulent transfer claims or allow DRUAP standing to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Motion to Dismiss, of which the Amended Complaint is largely duplicative, requests that the Court deny confirmation of the Amended Plan and dismiss the case on the grounds it was allegedly filed (and subsequently converted) in bad faith by the Wades. This is a core matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(L) and this Court has jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons below, this Court will dismiss DRUAP's Amended Complaint, deny the Motion to Dismiss and confirm the Wade's Amended Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Wades are retired and subsist on income from social security and pension plan payments. Mrs. Wade is 87-years-old, and Mr. Wade is 74-years-old. DRUAP's claim arises from a longstanding and contentious dispute between DRUAP and certain nearby residents, including the Wades, over the existence and operation of DRUAP's recycling and automobile salvage business. The Wades, the Clarks, the Gerrins, and Nancy Ledford (collectively the \"Neighbors\") engaged in litigation with DRUAP over the course of five years, culminating in a judgment in favor of DRUAP in the Superior Court of Jackson County against the Neighbors in 2017. DRUAP's pleadings allege that the Neighbors engaged in a smear campaign, spearheaded by the Clarks, to shut down DRUAP by attempting to generate broad opposition to its continued operation. DRUAP alleges that the Clarks disseminated false information about the legality and safety of DRUAP's operations, both verbally and in the form of lawn signs and\n   flyers. The Wades displayed some of the signs on their property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   DRUAP contends that the Neighbors tried to extort money from it, and when that proved unsuccessful, the Neighbors hired an attorney who issued a cease and desist letter to DRUAP. Shortly thereafter, the Neighbors, while represented by an attorney, sued DRUAP for nuisance and trespass in the Superior Court of Jackson County in a case styled\n   <em>\n    Jackie Clark, et al. v. Dale Recycling &amp; Used Auto Parts, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. W14CV0705 (the \"Lawsuit\"). The action sought damages and a permanent injunction of DRUAP's business activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, DRUAP counterclaimed for defamation, tortious interference with business relations, and conspiracy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Lawsuit was then tried before a jury, which rendered a general verdict. In its verdict, the jury found that DRUAP was not liable for nuisance or trespass and generally found in favor of DRUAP on DRUAP's counterclaims. The judgment awarded DRUAP $ 20,000 against the Wades,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and other judgments were awarded against the Neighbors, the largest of which was $ 70,000 against the Clarks. The Wades then filed a voluntary Chapter 7 petition on August 24, 2017, one day prior to DRUAP conducting its post-judgment discovery. The Chapter 7 trustee filed a Report of No Distribution on September 25, 2017. About a week before the deadline by which DRUAP had to file a complaint to determine the dischargeability of its claim and object to the discharge of the Wades, the Wades moved to convert their case to Chapter 13 and an order was entered converting the case to Chapter 13 on December 1, 2017 [Doc. 28]. DRUAP thereafter filed a timely proof of claim in the Wades' bankruptcy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of filing, the Wades' primary assets consisted of their residence which they valued at less than $ 90,000, another home they valued at $ 69,000, a 2011 Chevy Tahoe worth $ 23,000, a 20-year-old Ford F-150 pick-up truck worth $ 2,500, a burial plot worth $ 2,500, typical household goods worth a few thousand dollars, and a few thousand dollars in a credit union account. The Wades claim to have no equity in any of these assets. With respect to their secured liabilities on the petition date the Wades had a reverse mortgage on their residence for $ 160,000, a mortgage on the other home for $ 81,000, a lien on the Chevrolet Tahoe for $ 26,000 in favor of a credit union, and a right of set-off in favor of the credit union with respect to the cash held in the Wades' credit union account. The Wades' other liabilities consisted of the DRUAP judgment, which is secured by a judgment lien on the real estate but which the Wades have sought to avoid under \u00a7 522 to make it an unsecured claim, a claim for abusive litigation, a judgment against Mr. Wade in favor of Midland Credit for about $ 19,000, a credit card debt to Capital One for $ 6,000, and a medical debt owing to North Georgia Medical Center for about $ 1,300.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Wades' initial Chapter 13 plan proposed a plan payment of $ 710 per month and a zero percent dividend to unsecured creditors. Based on their income, any plan proposed by the Wades' is subject to an applicable commitment period of 36 months. The Chapter 13 trustee and DRUAP objected to this initial proposed plan. The Wades have since filed an amended Schedule J that showed an increase generally in their expenses and consequently decreased the disposable income available to contribute to a plan along with an amended Chapter 13 plan that reflected that decrease which reduced the proposed plan payment to $ 550 per month and retained that zero percent dividend to unsecured creditors. The Wades proposed to surrender their second home and the balance in their credit union account under both plans. Under the initial and amended plan, after the trustee takes her commission and the Wades' attorney's fees are paid, only the credit union will be paid on its secured claim on the Chevrolet Tahoe. The Chapter 13 trustee is satisfied with the Amended Plan, has withdrawn any objections, and recommends confirmation of the Amended Plan. DRUAP has continued to object to the Wades' amended plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DRUAP's objections to the Amended Plan can generally be summarized as follows. First, DRUAP argues that the Wades have inappropriately scheduled expenses for the care of their non-custodial great grandchild and improperly borrowed funds to pay the bail of Winnifred Wade's son.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, DRUAP alleges that the Wades' conversion to Chapter 13 constitutes a bad faith attempt to discharge a debt that would not be dischargeable in Chapter 7 and the Wades' plan does not propose to pay DRUAP anything on the judgment. Third, DRUAP asserts that the Wades should be required to pay into their plan for 60 months in order to pay something to unsecured creditors even though they qualify for a 36 month applicable commitment period. Finally, DRUAP asserts various other objections to alleged post-petition payments and debtor's amended schedules that this Court will address in assessing DRUAP's allegations of bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

DRUAP's judgment arises from a general jury verdict that included, among other things, a defamation claim against the Wades, but it also included a claim for tortious interference with business relations which is not per se non-dischargeable in a Chapter 7.\n   <em>\n    In re Cantu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782258,5729148\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/389/342/\">\n    389 F. App'x 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346 (5th Cir. 2010). In Chapter 7, this judgment would be nondischargeable if it was based on the defamation claim because that would satisfy \u00a7 523(a)(6)'s broad criteria of being a \"willful\" injury to an \"entity.\" However, upon conversion to Chapter 13, DRUAP's judgment, even if it was based on defamation, would fall outside the narrower nondischargeability provisions of Chapter 13. Although\n   defamation is sufficiently \"personal\" to qualify as a \"personal injury\" under existing law, this injury was suffered by Dale Recycling &amp; Used Auto Parts, Inc., a corporate entity. Because DRUAP is not a natural person, it cannot satisfy the \"to an individual\" criteria of \u00a7 1328(a)(4). The inevitable application of the plain meaning of the text of \u00a7 1328(a)(4) precludes a finding of nondischargeability. Thus, the only remaining question in determining the ultimate dischargeability of DRUAP's judgment is whether the Wades' conversion from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 was proper or whether it was done in bad faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The implication of this broader discharge in Chapter 13 will be that the Wades can discharge their judgment debt owed to DRUAP after paying future income into their plan for the life of the plan. Regardless of whether this is the ideal outcome of conversion for DRUAP, it is statutorily permissible.

In this case, DRUAP's judgment against the Wades accounts for less than 50% of the Wade's potentially dischargeable debt. On their Schedule E/F the Wades listed $ 55,000 in unsecured claims, $ 30,000 of which was comprised of creditors other than DRUAP [Bnkry. Doc. 1]. Whether or not those creditors filed claims is irrelevant in assessing the good faith of the Wades at the time of filing their petition. Additionally, the Wades are a fixed income household, receiving all income from social security and their pensions, with a combined monthly income of approximately $ 3,800. As such, the Wades do not have any reasonable likelihood of significantly increasing their income or earning potential, a marked difference from the\n   <em>\n    McGovern\n   </em>\n   case. The Wades are not retaining any luxury items, and they have surrendered a parcel of real estate and cash in a bank account to creditors. Other than a car payment that DRUAP erroneously asserts is disproportionately expensive to the Wades income, there are no allegations here of a luxurious or extravagant lifestyle. Finally, DRUAP makes a point of asserting in several filings that the Wades filed their petition the day before a post-judgment deposition in order to \"avoid...discovery and collection efforts.\" [Adv. Doc. 10], [Bnkry. Doc. 54]. However, by submitting themselves to the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court, the Wade's finances have been and will continue to be thoroughly disclosed. Obtaining a breathing spell from collection efforts is permitted and even contemplated by the Bankruptcy Code and should not be read as per se bad faith. The totality of the circumstances clearly distinguishes the\n   <em>\n    McGovern\n   </em>\n   debtor from the Wades and warrants a finding that they filed and converted their case in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   DRUAP also makes the argument that one of the most important factors to consider in the good faith analysis is whether the Wades ever attempted to pay the judgment pre-petition. The Court can only conclude\n   from the evidence on the record that the Wades did not make any payments to DRUAP, just as they failed to make payments to another judgment creditor. In\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the court cites numerous cases where courts have \"refuse[d] to adopt a per se rule that a debtor's failure to make substantial repayment demonstrates lack of good faith: Congress has nowhere in the statute provided a definition of the term \"good faith.\" The legislative history is similarly silent on the point...[H]ad Congress intended that such repayment be a condition precedent to confirmation of all Chapter 13 plans it could have explicitly so stated.\"\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6126443,1848030\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/885/\">\n    702 F.2d at 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   DRUAP also relies in briefing and in oral argument on the pre-BAPCPA cases\n   <em>\n    In re Whitlock\n   </em>\n   (confirming plan of debtor and granting discharge of judgment based on breach of fiduciary duty as father's executrix),\n   <em>\n    In re Caldwell\n   </em>\n   (dismissing case of Chapter 13 debtor who was seeking discharge of false arrest and imprisonment judgment and had failed to disclosed substantial assets), and\n   <em>\n    In re LeMaire\n   </em>\n   (denying discharge to debtor of judgment from civil suit resulting from debtor attempting to kill someone by shooting him five times) in support of its contention that the Wades failure to pay DRUAP pre-petition is demonstrative of bad faith.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   All of these cases concerned good faith analysis of a debtor's Chapter 13 plan in relation to the dischargeability of certain debts, and this Court does not dispute that while pre-petition behavior of the debtors was a factor considered by the courts, it was certainly not the only factor. In fact, only in\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   did the court emphasize the importance of the debtor's actions post-judgment to avoid paying the creditor.\n   <em>\n    Caldwell\n   </em>\n   , 895 F.2d at 1127.

Although the deduction of the post petition payments to repay the prepetition loan technically should have been stopped, the deduction was harmless because North Main had a right of set off and the Wades proposed in their plan to surrender the balance of the account to North Main to repay the loan anyway. The Wades were not permitted to use the money in their credit union account without providing North Main adequate protection, which\n   was clearly impossible in this case. Accordingly, this Court finds no bad faith on the part of the Wades because North Main Credit Union was being paid the funds in this account in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    F.

The Court will note, however, that the Wades scheduling of expenses related to the care of their non-custodial great grandchild, does not appear to be inappropriate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the bail payment was de minimis in the grand scheme of things so the Court will not deny confirmation over that.

The Court shall issue its standard order confirming a Chapter 13 plan that provides for the avoidance of judicial liens under \u00a7 522.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Clerk is directed to serve a copy of this order on DRUAP, counsel for DRUAP, Debtor, counsel for Debtor, the\n   Chapter 13 trustee and the United States Trustee.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    DRUAP's original Motion to Dismiss was amended, at least in part, because the original motion incorporated much of the Chapter 13 trustee's prior objection to confirmation. Since that original Motion, the trustee has considered her objection satisfied, no longer seeks dismissal and recommends confirmation. As such, this Court will not consider arguments made in the trustee's objection and will only consider the arguments made in DRUAP's original motion to the extent they were expressly reasserted in DRUAP's Amended Motion to Dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Section 548 grants the power to avoid transfers solely to the trustee. While Courts are split as to whether a third-party creditor can possess derivative standing, those courts that do recognize such standing require a formal, written demand upon the trustee, refusal to pursue the transfer by the trustee, and a determination that the refusal is unreasonable by the court.\n    <em>\n     Canadian Pac.

There also appeared to be some confusion about the scheduling of medical expenses as out-of-pocket or covered by insurance. The Court has considered whether this could potentially lower the Wades' expenses and thereby increase income available to contribute to the plan, but the Court has decided not to require the Wades to adjust their plan payment on account of this because (1) the Wades had lower expenses in some areas than allowed on the means test so the expenses basically even out, in other words the Court will not penalize a debtor who is subject to a 36 month applicable commitment period who is thrifty in some areas because the debtor wants to spend money in other necessary areas such as the care of family members and (2) the effect of increasing the monthly plan payment would only serve to shorten the time period over which the secured creditor - who has not objected to its treatment - would get paid and not produce any benefit to unsecured creditors.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
