On August 19, 2015, Debtor filed a Chapter 13 petition for relief. (Doc. 1). While Debtor was represented by counsel at the time of her chapter 13 filing, she later filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   Motion to Convert Case from Chapter 13 to Chapter 7 (Doc. 47) with the assistance of Ms. Sneed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   2. Ms. Sneed testified that she owns and operates\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Business \"Low Cost Documents Services\" (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     LCDS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"), and that since March of 2018\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   , it has been located at 9051 Mansfield Road, Building E, Suite 2, Shreveport, Louisiana. (Tr. at 47:2-9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   3. The LCDS Facebook page has advertised that \"Low Cost Specialize [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   .] in Bankruptcy filing,\" including chapter 13 and chapter 7 cases. (UST Ex. 1 at 2). Another advertisement on the LCDS Facebook page states that \"we can convert your 13 to a 7.\" (UST Ex. 1 at 2). The LCDS Facebook page has also advertised the service of explaining the difference between chapter 7 and chapter 13 proceedings. (UST Ex. 1 at 10). The LCDS Facebook page has included a photograph of the words \"Legal Services\" in its marketing materials. (UST Ex. 1 at 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   4. Ms. Sneed is not a lawyer licensed in the state of Louisiana or any other state, and LCDS has not worked with or had any association with a Louisiana attorney\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   in providing bankruptcy assistance. (Tr. at 49:23-50:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   5. Debtor contacted Ms. Sneed for bankruptcy assistance in converting her case to a chapter 7. (Tr. at 39:8-13). She paid Ms. Sneed $ 200. (Tr. at 39:25-40:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   6. Ms. Sneed prepared for Debtor a motion to convert the case from chapter 13 to chapter 7, an amended petition, a chapter 7 statement of intent, and a declaration regarding electronic filing. (Doc. 47, 48, 50, 51). Ms. Sneed also prepared an Official Form 119 \"Bankruptcy Petition Preparer's Notice, Declaration and Signature (\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BPP Notice\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   \"), reporting that she had prepared these documents. (Doc. 49). All of these documents were filed on August 3, 2018. Ms. Sneed brought the documents to the\n   Clerk of Court's office on behalf of Debtor for filing. (Tr. at 41:3-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   7. Neither Debtor nor Ms. Sneed filed Official Bankruptcy Form B 2800, which is a declaration under penalty of perjury disclosing compensation as bankruptcy petition preparer. Ms. Sneed did not present credible testimony establishing that she ever prepared any such declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   8. Apart from her work as a BPP in this case, Ms. Sneed has been a BPP in three (3) other Louisiana bankruptcy cases. (Tr. at 64:1-8). Additionally, Ms. Sneed testified that she provides bankruptcy services through her company's online website, and that these services include preparing bankruptcy schedules and other documents for filing in other states. (Tr. at 52:23-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   9. Debtor's testimony was credible. Ms. Sneed's testimony was not credible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Conclusions of Law and Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   This Court makes the following conclusions of law pursuant to Rule 7052 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which incorporates Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

The Bankruptcy Petition Preparer Statute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The bankruptcy petition preparer statute, Section 110 of Title 11, was enacted as part of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994, and provides penalties for a person, other than an attorney or employee of an attorney, who negligently or fraudulently prepares bankruptcy petitions.\n   <em>\n    In re Farner\n   </em>\n   , 17 Mont. B.R. 48, 50 (Bankr. D.

D. Or. 1996). The House Report explains the rationale behind \u00a7 110 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Bankruptcy petition preparers not employed or supervised by any attorney have proliferated across the country. While it is permissible for a petition preparer to provide services solely limited to typing, far too many of them also attempt to provide legal advise and legal services to debtors. These preparers often lack the necessary legal training and ethics regulation to provide such services in an adequate and appropriate manner. These services may take unfair advantage of persons who are ignorant of their rights both inside and outside the bankruptcy system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   H.R. Rep. 103-384, 103rd Cong., 2nd Sess. at 40-41 (Oct. 4, 1994);\n   <em>\n    In re Rankin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9027465\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/320/171/#p179\">\n    320 B.R. 171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179-80 (Bankr. D. Mont. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ms. Sneed is a Bankruptcy Petition Preparer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Under \u00a7 110(a)(1) of the Code, a \"bankruptcy petition preparer\" is someone, other than an attorney for the debtor or an employee of such attorney under the direct supervision of such attorney, who prepares, for compensation, for a debtor \"documents for filing,\" as that term is defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20110\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Ms. Sneed stated, under penalty of perjury, in Official Form 119 (Doc. 49) that she is a bankruptcy petition preparer and Debtor's testimony supports that conclusion. The Court concludes that Ms. Sneed is a \"bankruptcy petition preparer\" as that term is defined in \u00a7 110 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Because Ms. Sneed is a bankruptcy petition preparer, she is subject to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20110\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and can be penalized and fined in accordance with the statute for violations thereof.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Failure to File Declaration of Payments by Debtor to Petition Preparer in Violation of \u00a7 110(h)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Section 110(h)(2) of the Code provides that \"a declaration under penalty of perjury by the petition preparer shall be filed together with the petition, disclosing any fee received from or on behalf of the debtor within 12 months immediately prior to the filing of the case, and any unpaid fee charged to the debtor.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   , Official Bankruptcy Form B 2800. Section 110(h)(3)(B) provides that a failure to comply with \u00a7 110(h) is cause for forfeiture of all fees charged by a petition preparer in a case. Section 110(l) further provides that a petition preparer may be fined a maximum of $ 500.00 per violation for failure to comply with \u00a7 110(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As evidenced by the case record, such a declaration was never filed, despite Ms. Sneed's admission that she received $ 200 from Debtor. (Tr. at 36:7-11). Ms. Sneed testified that she prepared and provided Debtor such a declaration but that Debtor did not file it, despite filing other documents she prepared for her. The Court finds this testimony self-serving and not credible. See\n   <em>\n    In re Bay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202600114\">\n    2014 WL 2600114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2014) (holding that \"a self-serving pattern of selective recall and selective disclosure weakens credibility and the court may give such testimony lesser weight.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Debtor, however, credibly testified that it was Ms. Sneed, rather than Debtor, who actually brought the documents to the clerk of court's office for filing. (Tr. at 41:3-5). Ms. Sneed filed several documents but the \u00a7 110(h)(2) declaration was not among them. Furthermore, between the January 9, 2019 hearing and the post-trial briefing deadline of February 11, 2019, Ms. Sneed had ample opportunity to provide the Court with a copy of the \u00a7 110(h) declaration that she claims to have provided to Debtor for filing, but such a declaration was never provided. This is in spite of the fact that Ms. Sneed's testimony indicated that she \"kept a copy of all documents\" for her own file. (Tr. at 59:1-3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Ms. Sneed's protestations notwithstanding, the Court cannot overlook credible testimony to accept that Debtor was provided a signed compensation declaration by Ms. Sneed, but that such compensation declaration was not filed with the Court, despite the fact that Ms. Sneed filed numerous other documents with the Court on Debtor's behalf. Even if Ms. Sneed did prepare a compensation declaration, why hasn't Ms. Sneed been able to produce a copy of such declaration? The clear implication, and this Court's finding, is that Ms. Sneed never prepared or delivered to Debtor a compensation declaration in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because the Court finds that Ms. Sneed failed to deliver to Debtor the required compensation declaration under \u00a7 110(h)(2), the Court pretermits consideration of Ms. Sneed's argument that the bankruptcy petition preparer statute does not require her to file the \u00a7 110(h) declaration but that it requires Debtor to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 73, \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Ms. Sneed also relies heavily on a purported \"contract\". (Sneed Ex. 3). Such reliance is misplaced because Ms. Sneed was not able to produce a copy of any contract signed by Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This Court agrees with the UST's assertion that Ms. Sneed exhibited a pervasive neglect of her duty to disclose her compensation to the court, with no evidence she prepared, much less filed, the declaration under penalty of perjury required by \u00a7 110(h)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Violation of \u00a7 110(f) in Advertising\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Section 110(f) of the Bankruptcy Code prohibits a petition preparer from using the word \"legal\" or \"any similar term in any advertisement....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20110\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f). As set forth above, the underlying purpose of \u00a7 110 is to protect debtors who may be \"ignorant of their rights both inside and outside the bankruptcy system.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120181\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/259/379/#p385\">\n    259 B.R. 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 385 (Bankr.

As set forth above, Ms. Sneed failed to comply with \u00a7 110(e), (f) and (h) in connection with her assistance of Debtor. This Court concludes that all fees charged to Debtor should be forfeited. Debtor testified that she paid a total of $ 200.00 to Ms. Sneed. Therefore,\n   <strong>\n    $ 200.00 should be forfeited by Ms. Sneed, and made payable to Debtor.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Additionally, \u00a7 110(l)(1) provides that a bankruptcy petition preparer who fails to comply with any provision of Subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) or (h) of \u00a7 110 may be fined not more than $ 500.00 for each violation. The evidence discussed above supports the United States Trustee's assertions of violations of \u00a7 110(e), (f) and (h). The United States Trustee's motion requests the imposition of fines in addition to the forfeiture of fees. This Court concludes that it should fine Ms. Sneed $ 250.00 for each violation. Since the Court has concluded that Ms. Sneed committed three (3) violations of \u00a7 110,\n   <strong>\n    Ms. Sneed's fines aggregate to $ 750\n   </strong>\n   . Ms. Sneed shall pay such fine to the United States Trustee, who shall deposit the amount in the United States Trustee Fund.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20110\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (l)(4)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    2.

The use of the word \"shall\" in \u00a7 110(i)(1) indicates that the bankruptcy court has no discretion in deciding whether\n   to impose statutory damages of $ 2,000.00 once it finds a violation of \u00a7 110(f), (h) or (e).\n   <em>\n    In re Wojcik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135037\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/560/763/#p770\">\n    560 B.R. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 771 (9th Cir.

Even if no actual damages are requested, the court must award statutory damages which are computed to be the greater of either: (1) $ 2,000.00, or (2) twice the amount paid by the debtor to the BPP for his or her services ($ 400.00 here).\n   <em>\n    In re Branch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3670672\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/504/634/#p648\">\n    504 B.R. 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 648 (Bankr.

Due to the multiple violations of \u00a7 110 described above, the Court finds that it is well within its discretion to order the disgorgement of Ms. Sneed's $ 200.00 fee under \u00a7 110(i)(1), and to fine her $ 250.00 (half of the maximum of $ 500.00) per violation for three violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the Court concludes that the United States Trustee has met its burden in showing that Ms. Sneed violated \u00a7 110 of the Bankruptcy Code on multiple occasions. The evidence showed that Ms. Sneed: (1) was paid compensation by a Chapter 13 debtor that was not disclosed to the Court, (2) advertised her BPP business as one offering \"legal services,\" and (3) illegally went beyond the scope of the \"typing/scrivening\" services that BPP's are authorized to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court orders Ms. Sneed to forfeit $ 200.00, payable to Debtor. The Court also imposes a fine of $ 250.00 against Ms. Sneed for each of her three violations of \u00a7 110, for an aggregate fine of $ 750.00, payable to the United States Trustee. Finally, the Court holds that Ms. Sneed is liable to Debtor for mandatory statutory damages in the amount of $ 2,000.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court will issue a separate Order consistent with this Memorandum of Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Ms. Sneed used her former name, Cheynita Gordon, in connection with her work as a bankruptcy petition preparer in this case.
