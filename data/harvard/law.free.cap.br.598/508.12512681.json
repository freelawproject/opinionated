Plaintiff asserts that \"[i]f Dr. Moss had been truthful in his representations to [Plaintiff] of his financial condition, then [Plaintiff] never would have made the Loan.\" [Doc. 13 at 8].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court finds that the inferences necessary to determine that Plaintiff reasonably and detrimentally relied on Dr. Moss's undervaluation of his assets, namely his income, real estate holdings, and\n   personal property, in order to grant the Loan to Dr. Moss are not reasonable. The argument that Dr. Moss misled the Plaintiff into extending him the Loan when he stated that he had \"Stocks/Bonds/IRA/401k\" of $ 100,000 but that the Debtors scheduled a little more than $ 150,000 in their retirement accounts, does not survive the Motion. The Court finds this allegation, like the undervaluations of real estate holdings, personal property and income discussed above, does not support Plaintiff's claims. In effect, Plaintiff argues that, had it known Dr. Moss actually had assets of at least $ 15,964 greater and annual income $ 56,319.26 higher than reflected on the Loan Application, it would not have extended the Loan to Dr. Moss. Thus, the Court disagrees that these facts support a reasonable inference of reasonable reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   However, the remaining assertions survive the motion to dismiss. Plaintiff's primary argument, that it would not have made the Loan had it known that Dr. Moss was a guarantor on SCMA's SBA Loan and other loans of SCMA, is a plausible one on the facts alleged. Plaintiff is correct that because \"SCMA did not apply for the Loan,\" \"Dr. Moss only had to supply [Plaintiff] with the amounts [of SCMA's debt] he was personally liable for at the time of the application.\" [Doc. 13 at 6 \u00b6 39]. But a personal guaranty or guarantees by Dr. Moss in the amount of over $ 420,000 that was not disclosed on the Loan Application is material and supports the reasonable inference that Plaintiff relied on this omission when extending the Loan to Dr. Moss. These allegations are sufficient to deny the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     PLAINTIFF HAS FAILED TO STATE A CLAIM UNDER\n     <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n      11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (a)(6).\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff seeks nondischargeability of its alleged debt as well as attorney's fees and costs pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6), which provides that debts \"for willful and malicious injury by the debtor to another entity or to the property of another entity\" are nondischargeable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6).

All allegations in the Amended Complaint that have been made directly about Dr. Moss's malicious intent have been made as legal conclusions. Therefore, the Court must consider the allegations about implied malice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Malice may be implied where \"[t]he very nature of [the debtor]'s actions implies a malefic intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Monson v. Galaz (In re Monson)\n   </em>\n   , 661 Fed. App'x 675, 684 (11th Cir. 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Monson\n   </em>\n   , the debtor ran an internet caf\u00e9, which he financed with a loan secured by the computers in the caf\u00e9. The debtor failed to pay the secured debt and absconded with the computers, re-emerging in another county and using the computers to start a different caf\u00e9. The debtor had actual knowledge of the lienholder's interest. The very act of \"mak[ing] off with equipment he bought with someone else's money\" showed that Monson \"knew his actions were wrongful and without just cause.\" 661 Fed. App'x at 685. In contrast, a \"debtor's knowing act of failing to obtain workers' compensation insurance ... was not the sort of willful and malicious injury required for nondischargeability under \u00a7 523(a)(6) because it cannot not be said that the employer intended for the employee to suffer a fall or that the failure to insure led directly to the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 685 (internal quotations omitted) (summarizing\n   <em>\n    In re Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412483,6119270\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/48/1161/\">\n    48 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1163-65 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff has alleged that malice should be implied in this case because Dr. Moss failed to disclose the SBA Loan on the Loan Application, misrepresented his intended use of the Loan Proceeds, and filed for bankruptcy shortly after obtaining the Loan Proceeds. It is a close question, but the Court finds this case more resembles\n   <em>\n    Monson\n   </em>\n   than\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   . Unlike the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Moss could be said to have intended to receive the Loan Proceeds, fail to repay the Loan and then use the Loan Proceeds for a non-business purpose. It can be said that Dr. Moss's failure to repay the Loan and use the Loan Proceeds to invest in his business directly caused Plaintiff's economic injuries in the case at bar. Similarly to the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Monson\n   </em>\n   , Dr. Moss had actual knowledge of the Loan and the expected use of the Loan Proceeds. He then failed to pay the Loan and filed for bankruptcy. Although these allegations are not as nefarious as \"making off with equipment he bought with someone else's money,\" these allegations are sufficient to allege malice. However, given the failure to sufficiently allege willfulness, the \u00a7 523(a)(6) claim does not survive the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In consideration of the foregoing, it is hereby ORDERED that\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Motion is GRANTED as to the\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6) claim and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Motion is DENIED as to the remaining claims.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Unless otherwise indicated, all docket entries refer to this adversary proceeding, Adv.
