BERNSTEIN, United States Bankruptcy Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   1141 Realty Owner LLC (\"Debtor\") owns the Flatiron Hotel, a 62-room hotel located at 9 West 26th Street a/k/a 1141 Broadway, New York, New York (\"Property\"). The Property is encumbered by a mortgage currently held by Wilmington Trust, N.A. (\"Wilmington\") solely in its capacity as Trustee for the benefit of the Registered Holders of Wells Fargo Commercial Mortgage Trust 2015-C28, Commercial Mortgage Pass Through Certificates, Series 2015-C28. Wilmington filed a proof of claim (\"\n   <em>\n    Claim\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 129) in the approximate sum of $ 32 million. The\n   <em>\n    Claim\n   </em>\n   includes a \"make-whole\" or yield maintenance premium, defined below, in the approximate sum of $ 3.1 million. The Debtor objected,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , to the enforceability of the make-whole premium\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Wilmington filed a response\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   that the parties agreed the Court could treat as a motion for summary judgment on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   is granted to the extent of concluding that the make-whole premium at issue is enforceable under New York law, and the Debtor's corresponding objection is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The material facts are not in dispute. On April 16, 2015, the Debtor entered into a loan agreement (\"\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   \") with Wilmington's predecessor in interest, Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC (\"Rialto\"). (\n   <em>\n    Motion\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contemporaneously, the Debtor executed two promissory notes\n   (Note A and Note B, and collectively, the \"Notes\") for a combined amount of $ 25 million, secured by a mortgage on the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The \"Maturity Date\" of the loan was \"the Stated Maturity Date [May 6, 2025]\n   <em>\n    or such other date\n   </em>\n   on which the final payment of the principal of the Note becomes due and payable as therein or herein provided,\n   <em>\n    whether at such stated maturity date, by declaration or acceleration\n   </em>\n   , or otherwise.\" (\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   at p. 7, \u00a7 1.1.2 (emphasis added).) Rialto subsequently assigned the mortgage, along with the\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   and Notes (collectively, the \"Loan Documents\"), to Wilmington. (\n   <em>\n    Claim\n   </em>\n   at Exhibit E;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at Exhibit F (assigning leases and rents to Wilmington).) The\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   is governed by New York law. (\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 9.3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Default and Acceleration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 15, 2017, Wilmington's counsel sent a Notice of Default and Acceleration (\"September Default Notice\"), informing the Debtor \"that it is in default of its obligations under the Loan Documents in that, among other things, [the Debtor] has failed to maintain valid and effective liquor licenses issued by the New York Liquor Authority permitting [the Debtor] to serve alcoholic beverages at the Property.\" (\n   <em>\n    See Motion\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11.) The\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   provided a host of available remedies following an Event of Default, including the acceleration of the debt, (\n   <em>\n    see Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 7.2), and Wilmington's remedies were cumulative and not exclusive of any other right under the Loan Documents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 7.2, 7.3.) Wilmington opted to \"accelerate[ ] and demand[ ] immediate repayment in full of the entire outstanding indebtedness due under the Note, Mortgage, and the Loan Documents in the principal sum of $ 24,209,357.00 together with all accrued interest thereon ... and all other sums due under the Loan Documents.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (September Default Notice.) On October 11, 2017, Wilmington's servicer sent the Debtor a Notice of Additional Defaults (\"October Default Notice\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Claim Objection\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Debtor's Reply in Further Support of Objection to Claim No. 14\n   </em>\n   , dated January 22, 2019 (\"\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   \") (ECF Doc. # 105) do not contest the Debtor's defaults under the Loan Documents although the Debtor insists that its default was not intentional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Make-Whole Premium\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The present dispute centers on Wilmington's entitlement to the \"Yield Maintenance Default Premium\" defined in the\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   as the:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   amount equal to the greater of: (i) three percent (3%) of the principal amount of the Loan being repaid and (ii) the excess, if any, of (a) the present value (determined using a discount rate equal to the Treasury Rate at such time) of all scheduled payments of principal and interest payable in respect of the principal amount of the Loan being repaid provided\n   that the Note shall be deemed, for purposes of this definition, to be due and payable on the Free Window Date, over (b) the principal amount of the Loan being repaid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   at p. 13, \u00a7 1.1.2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   With certain exceptions that do not apply, the Debtor could not prepay the loan prior to the Maturity Date except in accordance with the\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.3.1.) Furthermore, any payment following an Event of Default was deemed a \"voluntary prepayment\" requiring the payment of the Yield Maintenance Default Premium:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   If,\n   <em>\n    following an Event of Default\n   </em>\n   which occurs prior to Free Window Date, payment of all or any part of the Debt is tendered by Borrower or otherwise recovered by Lender, such tender or recovery\n   <em>\n    shall be deemed a voluntary prepayment\n   </em>\n   by Borrower in violation of the prohibition against prepayment set forth in Section 2.3.1 and Borrower shall pay, in addition to the Debt, (i) an amount equal to the\n   <em>\n    Yield Maintenance Default Premium\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2.3.3 (emphasis added).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Debtor and an affiliate filed voluntary petitions for chapter 11 relief in this Court on July 31, 2018 and Wilmington filed the\n   <em>\n    Claim\n   </em>\n   three months later asserting an amount \"not less than\" $ 32,048,285.29. This sum included $ 3,108,096.78 allocated to the Yield Maintenance Default Premium. (\n   <em>\n    Schedule to Proof of Claim of Wilmington Trust, N.A.\n   </em>\n   at p. 6, \u00b6 17.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor objected arguing that the Yield Maintenance Default Premium is unenforceable as a matter of New York law because Wilmington had accelerated the debt, and hence, the Maturity Date, and the acceleration requires disallowance of the prepayment premium. (\n   <em>\n    Claim Objection\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11.) Wilmington responded that the Yield Maintenance Default Premium is allowable under the unambiguous terms of section 2.3.3. In essence, the latter section governs any post-default payment, not just prepayments, and merely \"deems\" the post-default payment to be a \"prepayment\" for the purpose of the Yield Maintenance Default Premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response, the Debtor contended that courts will only uphold prepayment premiums after acceleration where the applicable loan agreement expressly provides that the premium is due following an acceleration and uses the word \"acceleration,\" or some other variant. (\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) Because the word \"acceleration\" is \"conspicuously absent\" from the relevant provision of the\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   , (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16), Wilmington's acceleration of the debt precludes entitlement to a Yield Maintenance Default Premium. The\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   also claimed there is no evidence that the Debtor subjectively intended to default. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

First, it is bereft of any legal or factual analysis and the Debtor fails to show that the Yield Maintenance Default Premium is disproportionate to Wilmington's loss; it just says so. Second, in arguing that it is disproportionate, the Debtor seems to compare the amount of the Yield Maintenance Default Premium to the amount of the first post-default loan payment that triggered it because the Debtor implicitly concedes that it would not be disproportionate if the entire debt is repaid.

The Debtor attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    AE Hotel\n   </em>\n   arguing that the term \"acceleration\" was implied if not expressed in the section of the\n   <em>\n    AE Hotel\n   </em>\n   Note that mandated payment of the make-whole premium following a default. According to the Debtor, the\n   <em>\n    AE Hotel\n   </em>\n   make-whole provision required the payment of the premium if the debt was paid at any time prior to a foreclosure sale, a foreclosure sale could only occur after acceleration, and therefore, the provision anticipated payment of a premium after the acceleration of the debt.

But parties can and here did contract around the general rule, and Wilmington's rights depend on the terms of the\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   , not upon the wholly different agreements in\n   <em>\n    MPM\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    AMR\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    AMR\n   </em>\n   , the relevant provisions of the Indenture explicitly stated that in the event of an automatic acceleration, which had occurred, no make-whole premium was due.\n   <em>\n    AMR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3657424,3703424\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/730/88/\">\n    730 F.3d at 99-100, 104-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    MPM\n   </em>\n   , the relevant provision required the payment of a make-whole premium in the event of an optional redemption. The Court concluded that the post-acceleration, post-bankruptcy payment was not an optional redemption because a redemption refers to a pre-maturity payment and \"[a] payment made mandatory by operation of an automatic acceleration clause is not one made at MPM's option.\"\n   <em>\n    MPM\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12270104,12265893\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/787/\">\n    874 F.3d at 802-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Loan Agreement\n   </em>\n   requires the payment of the Yield Maintenance Default Premium with any post-default payment and not only when there is an optional redemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Finally, the Debtor argues that the make-whole provision must expressly require the payment of the make-whole premium after acceleration and cites a string\n   of cases that allowed a make-whole premium after acceleration where the relevant make-whole provision stated that the payment was due after default and acceleration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Reply\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 12.) The short answer is parties can provide for their rights with any language that plainly conveys their intent. One way to ensure that a make-whole premium is payable even after acceleration is to say so explicitly. Another way to ensure that the make-whole premium is payable even after acceleration is to render acceleration irrelevant and, as here and in\n   <em>\n    AE Hotel\n   </em>\n   , make the premium contingent on any post-default payment. Deeming the post-default payment to be a \"voluntary prepayment\" does not forfeit the Yield Maintenance Default Premium; it confirms the parties' intent that it must be paid even if it is not an actual prepayment.
