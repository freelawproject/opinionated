The Court concludes that the debtors may claim both parcels as a rural homestead protected under Texas law. As a result, the Court will deny the creditor's objection to the rural homestead exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 8, 2018, Roy Kevin Pool and Cynthia Anne Pool (\"\n   <em>\n    Debtors\n   </em>\n   \"), filed a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. John Patrick Lowe was appointed as trustee (\"\n   <em>\n    Trustee\n   </em>\n   \") for the Debtors' bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 15, 2018, the Trustee and Nathan Joshua Herrington (\"\n   <em>\n    Creditor\n   </em>\n   \") jointly filed their Objections to the Debtors' Claims of Exemption (\"\n   <em>\n    Objection\n   </em>\n   \") (dkt# 34), objecting to the Debtors' claims\n   of homestead exemption as to two separate, non-contiguous tracts of real property located in Llano County, Texas and Burnet County, Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On October 31, 2018, the Debtors filed their Response to the Objection (\"\n   <em>\n    Response\n   </em>\n   \") (dkt# 35). In the Response, the Debtors denied several of the legal and factual contentions made in the Objection and requested that the Court deny the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At a hearing conducted on December 18, 2018, the Trustee advised the Court that he would no longer join the Creditor in objecting to the Debtors' exemptions. The Trustee then filed a notice of dismissal of his objections (dkt# 59). The Creditor continued to prosecute the Objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 20, 2018, the Court conducted a hearing on the merits of the Objection. Counsel for the Debtors and counsel for the Creditor presented legal argument. During the hearing, the Court admitted certain exhibits into evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of the Debtors, Mr. Pool, provided the only testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court took its ruling on the Objection under advisement. The Court provided the parties with the opportunity to file post-hearing briefs. On December 20, 2019, the Debtors filed their brief with Legal Authorities (dkt# 61). On January 7, 2019, the Debtors filed their Supplemental Brief and Legal Authorities (dkt# 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Objection under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

First, the Debtors claim their residence comprising 1.4 acres in rural Sunrise Beach, Llano County, Texas (\"\n   <em>\n    Residence\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the Debtors claim as exempt a separate, rural, non-contiguous tract of less than one acre in Kingsland, Burnet County, Texas, where Mr. Pool operates his automotive repair and restoration business known as \"God's Hot Rod Shop\" (\"\n   <em>\n    Body Shop\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Together, the Residence and the Body Shop comprise considerably less than 200 acres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the hearing, the parties stipulated that the Residence met the requirements for a rural homestead exemption. Although the parties did not dispute the Body Shop's rural character, they disagreed\n   about whether the Debtors could properly claim the Body Shop as part of their exempt rural homestead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Consequently, the argument and testimony presented by the parties at the hearing focused on the Body Shop's status as exempt homestead property. While the Debtors contended that the Body Shop was part of their rural homestead, the Creditor argued that the Body Shop was not exempt under Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In their Bankruptcy Schedules, the Debtors valued their Residence and the Body Shop at $ 140,000 and $ 200,000, respectively-totaling $ 340,000-the lion's share of the Debtors' assets. Both properties, however, are subject to purchase money liens held by other secured creditors (about $ 88,477 on the Residence and $ 147,440 on the Body Shop). As a result, the claimed exemptions listed on their Bankruptcy Schedules amounted to $ 51,523 in the Residence, and $ 52,560 in the Body Shop-for a total homestead exemption claim of $ 104,083.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As the crow flies, the Residence is just over two miles from the Body Shop. As the car drives, the properties are about ten miles apart.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Residence and the Body Shop are on separate (non-contiguous) parcels of land.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. C-6. The Residence and the Body Shop are both rural (not urban) properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Purchased by the Debtors in 2015, the Body Shop specializes in the repair, restoration, and maintenance of classic American automobiles.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. D-4. Both Debtors actively work at the Body Shop four to five days per week, although Mr. Pool typically spends more time working at the Body Shop than Ms. Pool.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Debtors earn almost all their income from the work they perform at the Body Shop, which they use to support their family and to maintain and pay expenses associated with their Residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedules I and J, Ex. C-3. Mr. Pool is the head of the Debtors' household, and he works full-time at the Body Shop. He does not have any expertise other than working on cars; the Body Shop is where Mr. Pool practices his vocation. Without the Body Shop as their source of income, the Debtors and their minor daughter, as a family, would face great financial difficulty. The Body Shop income also allows the Debtors to cope with less foreseeable expenses, like those the Debtors recently incurred to address their daughter's medical issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Debtors also use the Body Shop for purposes connected to their Residence. Mr. Pool uses the Body Shop's equipment and facilities to repair and maintain household items he brings there from the Residence. For example, on a number of occasions, Mr. Pool has made the short drive to the Body Shop to repair washers, dryers, and lawn equipment used at the Residence. Mr. Pool also uses equipment and tools from the Body Shop for routine home improvement and repair projects at the Residence on a regular basis. At the Body Shop, Mr. Pool repairs the Debtors' personal cars stored and used at the Residence. In one instance, Mr. Pool fabricated a barbeque pit at the Body Shop for use at the Residence. In another, Mr. Pool used some of the Body Shop's tools to repair a gazebo at the Residence that had fallen into disrepair. While working at the Body Shop, Mr. Pool regularly utilizes certain facilities normally associated with a home, such as the Body Shop's kitchen and shower. On at least one occasion, Mr. Pool has spent the night on the Body Shop's premises after working late into the evening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Overview of the Texas Homestead Exemption\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 522(b)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code allows debtors who file jointly (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , as spouses) to claim certain property as exempt.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1).

By contrast, if an \"urban\" homestead consists of more than one lot, the lots must be contiguous to be granted homestead protection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Seidemann v.

However, the Fifth Circuit, after carefully examining Texas law, has concluded that a rural homestead may include property where a debtor conducts his business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n    345 F.3d at 316-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Perry\n   </em>\n   , the Fifth Circuit dealt with a debtor that claimed a \"rural\" homestead consisting of his residence and a contiguous tract where the debtor operated his business-a mobile home and RV park.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n    at 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The bankruptcy court concluded that the tract where the debtor ran his business did not fall within the exemption, holding that a rural homestead does not extend to business property and the operation of a business on the tract forfeited the homestead protection.\n   <em>\n    In re Perry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9487792\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/267/759/#p768\">\n    267 B.R. 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 768 (Bankr.

The Fifth Circuit held that a rural homestead can include not only a debtor's residence but may also include property where a debtor operates his business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perry,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n    345 F.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In reaching its decision, the Fifth Circuit recognized that a \"business element has historically been embedded within the definition of a rural homestead\" under Texas law, and cited a number of Texas cases in support.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n    at 316-18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It was contemplated that a rural homestead would serve both purposes, and, therefore, no separate provision was made for a residence and a business homestead, although it was permitted that the homestead consist of separate and detached parts, if used for the purposes of a home ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 317 (citing\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

In\n   <em>\n    Murray\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the debtor established this \"nexus\" on his non-contiguous tract because he used it to cut wood and for hunting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11112519\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/260/815/#p830\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11112519\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/260/815/#p830\">\n    at 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Crump\n   </em>\n   , the court concluded that the use of the separate, non-contiguous tract for farming established a nexus to the debtor's residential tract sufficient to qualify it as part of their homestead.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222735\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/533/567/#p569\">\n    533 B.R. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In the other decisions requiring the presence of a nexus between the separate rural properties, the courts held that the claimants failed to show that the non-contiguous property was associated with their residential tracts because the claimants did not presently use the separate property in question. Instead, the claimants, in each case, only expressed an\n   <em>\n    intent\n   </em>\n   to use the separate property at some point in the future. In\n   <em>\n    Schott\n   </em>\n   , the court decided that the debtor could not claim the separate tract in question (a golf course) as part of his rural homestead, because the tract was investment property that the debtor intended to develop in the future.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3752413\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/449/697/#p702\">\n    449 B.R. at 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   spotted similar issues, concluding that the debtor's future intent to use a separate, non-contiguous tract for haymaking, a cattle business, and dog training did not establish its nexus with the residential property sufficient to provide rural homestead protection on the separate parcel. 391 B.R. at 392.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Body Shop is Exempt Rural Homestead Property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   After carefully considering the relevant principles of Texas homestead law, the Court concludes that the Body Shop has been properly claimed by the Debtors as part of their exempt rural homestead. Although the Body Shop is located on a separate (non-contiguous) parcel from their rural Residence, the Texas Constitution and Texas Property Code expressly provide rural homestead protection for a non-contiguous parcel of land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Under Texas law, rural homestead protection extends to both property where the family lives and to property where the claimant operates a business to support the family. Here, the Debtors' business, the Body Shop, is located on rural property. The Debtors actively work at the Body Shop and earn income necessary to support their family and their Residence. Moreover, the income earned by the Debtors from the Body Shop is not passive income; instead, the Debtors themselves consistently spend considerable time working at the Body Shop to earn their living.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Additionally, to the extent necessary, the Debtors have established a nexus between the Body Shop and their Residence sufficient to make the Body Shop part of their rural homestead. The Body Shop is actually used by the Debtors to repair and maintain household items, make improvements to the Residence, store equipment used at the Residence, and repair their personal cars. The Body Shop also has a shower, kitchen and other facilities used and normally associated with a home. In many ways, the Body Shop is as an extension of the Residence, akin to a garage, tool shed, or living quarters normally within the confines of a household.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Homesteads are \"favorites of the law\" in Texas, and courts liberally construe Texas homestead protections. The Debtors have established that their Body Shop, as well as their Residence, is protected as a rural homestead under Texas law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this Opinion, the Court will deny the Creditor's\n   Objection to the Debtors' homestead exemption.

However, the Fifth Circuit recognized in\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    that operation of a non-agricultural business on a rural homestead did not sacrifice the homestead character of that portion of the property.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Perry\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9088368,9092893\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/345/303/\">\n     345 F.3d at 319\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Fifth Circuit has also rejected the notion that a debtor must demonstrate that the land is used for \"agricultural\" or other \"rural\" economic activity to be entitled to protection as a rural homestead.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Rush Truck Centers v.
