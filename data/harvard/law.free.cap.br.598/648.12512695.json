JACOBVITZ, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  Debtors Ruben R. Maynes, Jr. and Donna L. Maynes seek to redeem a 1978 Ford F350 truck (the \"Truck\") subject to a lien held by State Employees Credit Union (the \"Credit Union\") for $ 1,500 payable within sixty days of the date of entry of the order authorizing redemption.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  Debtors' Motion for Redemption of 1979\n  <footnotemark>\n   1\n  </footnotemark>\n  Ford F350 Truck (\"Motion to Redeem\") - Docket No. 16. The Credit Union objected to the Motion to Redeem.\n  <em>\n   See\n  </em>\n  State Employees Credit Union's Objection to Debtors' Motion for Redemption of \"1979 Ford F350 Truck\" (\"Objection\") - Docket No. 18.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-8\">\n  The Court held a final, evidentiary hearing on the Motion to Redeem on February 7, 2019 and took the matter under advisement.\n  <footnotemark>\n   2\n  </footnotemark>\n  For the reasons explained below, the Court finds that the value of the Truck for redemption purposes is $ 5,000, not $ 1,500 as requested by the Debtors in their Motion. Accordingly, the Court will deny the Motion to Redeem, with leave for the Debtors to redeem the Truck by paying the redemption value of $ 5,000 to the Credit Union within 30 days of the date of entry of this Memorandum Opinion and Order and thereby to retain the Truck.\n </opinion>\n <footnote label=\"1\">\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Motion to Redeem describes the Truck as a 1979 Ford F350. In fact, the Truck-year is 1978.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <footnote label=\"2\">\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   With the parties' consent, the Court took judicial notice of the documents filed in the Debtors' bankruptcy case, including the Debtors' statements and schedules.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   FACTS\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Debtors filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on June 26, 2018. Debtors listed the following vehicles with the following values on Schedule A/B:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-11\">1979 Ford F350 $6,010 2001 Ford F150 $6,010 2013 Hyundai Sonata $4,350</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1. The vehicle scheduled as the 1979 Ford F350 is the 1978 Truck. On Schedule C, Debtors claimed an exemption in the Truck in the amount of $ 7,550.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Debtors' Schedule A/B reflects that the Truck is secured by a lien held by the Credit Union in the \"approximate amount of $ 14,591.62\" cross-collateralized with the 2001 Ford F150.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Debtors have since returned the 2001 Ford F150 to the Credit Union. Mr. Maynes testified that the identification of the Truck as a 1979 Ford F350 rather than a 1978 Ford F350 in his bankruptcy schedules was a mistake that he did not notice when he reviewed his bankruptcy schedules before signing them. He also testified that to arrive at the scheduled values he simply divided the combined value of the two trucks listed in his schedules in half because they were\n   cross-collateralized to secure loans from the Credit Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Truck was not originally manufactured as an F350. It started out as an F150, two-wheel drive truck, but was heavily modified into a custom truck with four-wheel drive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor testified that the Truck is a \"heavily modified one ton truck\" with a \"3/4 ton chassis.\" The body of the Truck is a Super Cab. Notwithstanding the Truck's origination as an F150, the exterior of the Truck now bears an F350 designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Debtors obtained a loan in the principal amount of $ 15,715.88 from the Credit Union to purchase the Truck in August of 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors obtained the Truck from Spokane, Washington. The Truck also served as collateral for another loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit No. 4. Mr. Maynes has collected these types of trucks over the years. The Truck is titled in the name of Ruben Maynes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 4. The Debtor wants to redeem the Truck because it was his son's first vehicle. The Debtor wants to give the Truck to his son who wants to fix it up when he comes home on leave from the coast guard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The odometer on the Truck runs to 99,999 before it rolls over to begin again at zero. Because the Truck is well over thirty years old, it is difficult to estimate the Truck's mileage. The mileage reflected in the repair estimate prepared in December of 2018 is 62,997.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 16. In the past when the Debtor lived in Pecos, New Mexico, the Debtor used the Truck for hauling wood and for camping. At the time Debtor filed his bankruptcy petition, the Truck was not operating. A repair estimate for the Truck prepared by San Tan Ford in Gilbert, Arizona in December of 2018 recommends repairs that would cost an estimated $ 1,746.50.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 16. In addition, in the Debtor's opinion the cam shaft in the Truck is damaged and in need of repair, and the transmission needs to be replaced. It would be difficult to find a replacement transmission for the Truck because it is an obsolete item.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Because the Truck came from Spokane, Washington and weathered the northwest climate, it has some rust on the exterior. The exterior of the Truck could use a full paint job, although pictures of the Truck indicate that the exterior is in fair condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 16. Pictures of the Truck's interior show some cracking in the upholstery of the front bench seat, but for the most part, the interior looks to be in fairly good condition considering its age. The Debtor currently keeps the Truck at his home in Gilbert, Arizona. The Debtor considers the Truck a daily driver, though he agrees it is a \"classic\" because of its age. In the Debtor's opinion, the Truck is worth only $ 600 because of the need for repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because the Truck was modified from its original manufactured form, it is difficult\n   to find comparable NADA values. The Truck has a Super Cab, but Ford did not manufacture an F350 in 1978 that had a Super Cab. The NADA retail values for a 1978 Ford F350 (no Super Cab) as of July 11, 2018 are: 1) low retail value of $ 2,375; 2) average retail value of $ 5,800; and 3) high retail value of $ 8,050.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The NADA retail values for a 1978 Ford 350 1 ton Styleside Crew Cab with four wheel drive and a 351 V8 engine as of January 17, 2019 are: 1) low retail value of $ 3,525; 2) average retail value of $ 8,025; and 3) high retail value of $ 10,775, with a list price of $ 6,100.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 3. The NADA values for a 1979 Ford F350 range from a low retail value of $ 4,275 to a high value of $ 21,800.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit B. NADA values for a 1978 Ford F250 \u00be Ton Flareside as of August 6, 2014 range from a low retail value of $ 1,775 to a high retail value of $ 7,125 with a list price of $ 5,087.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Linda Moya, collections manager for the Credit Union, with eighteen years of experience testified on behalf of the Credit Union. She is familiar with working on old cars and has assisted in rebuilding engines, transmissions, and replacing clutches and brakes. If the Credit Union repossessed the Truck, the Credit Union would perform the recommended repairs and sell the Truck. A representative of the Credit Union has not recently inspected the Truck in person because the Truck is no longer located in New Mexico. In Ms. Moya's opinion, this type of truck is in high demand and would be easy for the Credit Union to sell. In her opinion, the Truck is worth $ 9,000 after making the $ 1,746.50 of recommended repairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court finds that the value of the Truck is $ 5,000 for purposes of redemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 722 governs redemption. Under that section, an individual chapter 7 debtor may redeem exempt personal property intended for personal or family use subject to a lien securing dischargeable\n   consumer debt by paying the lienholder at the time of redemption the amount of the lienholder's secured claim in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20722\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   6 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 722.01 (Richard Levin &amp; Henry J.

First, the Debtors claimed an exemption in the Truck on Schedule C. Second, the Truck will be used primarily for personal, family, or household use. Although Mr. Maynes testified that he wants to redeem the Truck for the benefit of his son rather than for himself, such use fits within the requirements for redemption. Mr. Maynes' son is a family member, and the Truck will be used primarily for personal, rather than business purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cypher Chiropractic Center v.

Mo. 2003) (\"[T]he appropriate date for valuing collateral is the date the motion for redemption is filed or, if the redemption is contested, the date of the hearing on redemption.\") (citation omitted). The Court is persuaded that the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) requires valuation as of the petition date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 506(a)(2) consists of two sentences. The first sentence applies to Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 cases in which the debtor is an individual and provides for valuation of personal property securing an allowed secured claim \"based on the replacement value of such property\n   <em>\n    as of the date of the filing of the petition\n   </em>\n   without deduction for the costs of sale or marketing.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (emphasis added). The second sentence applies to \"property acquired for personal, family, or household purposes\" and further defines \"replacement value\" as \"the price a retail merchant would charge for property of that kind considering the age and condition of the property\n   <em>\n    at the time value is determined.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). As the Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   , the question is whether the second sentence in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) requiring valuation \"at the time value is determined\" changes the valuation date when property is valued under the second sentence of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565790\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/387/36/\">\n    387 B.R. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   One way to read the statutory language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) is that its two sentences fix different valuation dates. Under that construction, the first sentence fixes the petition date as the valuation date for personal property\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   acquired for personal, family, or household purposes, and the second sentence fixes the time of the valuation hearing as the valuation date for\n   personal property that\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   acquired for personal, family, or household purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4121923\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/415/529/#p533\">\n    415 B.R. 529\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 533 (Bankr.

This construction does not render superfluous the clause in the second sentence of \u00a7 506(a)(2), \"at the time value is determined,\" because that language is used to refer back to the petition date stated in the first sentence as the time value is determined.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morales,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565790\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/387/36/\">\n    387 B.R. at 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]his interpretation reads the clause as referring back to the petition date standard of the first sentence.\"). Further, if \"at the time value is determined\" is not read to refer back to the petition date petition date standard of the first sentence, the language does not provide meaningful guidance to determine the relevant valuation date. It could mean the time a valuation motion is filed, the time a valuation hearing is held, or even under an illogical but literal reading, the time the Court issues a decision determining value. Construing \"at the time value is determined\" in the second sentence to mean the \"date of the valuation hearing\" reads additional words into the statute that are neither present nor implicit in the statutory language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court agrees with the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Morales\n   </em>\n   and concludes that the appropriate time to value personal property for redemption purposes is the petition date, not the date of the valuation hearing. By using the petition date as the appropriate valuation date, the creditor does not bear the risk of a post-petition decrease in the value of its collateral when a debtor seeks to redeem personal property. Nor does the creditor, in the rare instance of a post-petition increase in the value of personal property serving as collateral, reap the benefit of such increased value by requiring a debtor to pay a higher amount to redeem the property.

The 1979 Ford F350 (Exhibit B), which ranges from a low retail value of $ 4,275 to a high retail value of $ 21,800, is the wrong model year. The 1978 F250 3/4/Ton Flareside (Exhibit 6), which ranges from a low retail value of $ 1,775 to a high retail value of $ 7,125, is the correct year, but the wrong model, and has a valuation date of nearly four years before the Debtor filed his bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The two NADA valuations for a 1978 F350 1Ton Styleside Crew Cab (Exhibits 2 and 3) are the most comparable to the Truck, although the body style of the 1978 F350 1 Ton Styleside Crew Cab in the NADA valuations does not match the Truck, which has a Super Cab. The only NADA valuation admitted into evidence that provides a value of a similar truck at or near the petition date has a suggested low retail value of $ 2,375 and an average retail value of $ 5,800.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 2. Although Mr. Maynes stated that in his opinion the Truck is only worth $ 600, his estimate is based in part on his opinion that the Truck needs a new transmission. There is no corroborating evidence to support that conclusion. The estimated cost of repairs to put the Truck in good mechanical condition made by San Tan of Gilbert, Arizona did not include a new transmission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhibit 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"As the party seeking redemption, the Debtor[s] 'bear the burden of proving the appropriate redemption value by a preponderance of the evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Perales\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-8045,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20902790\">\n    2012 WL 902790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (6th Cir.
