In essence, the parties dispute whether Defendant Seterus, Inc. (\"Seterus\") provided \"inaccurate\" or \"materially misleading\" information to the three major credit reporting agencies (\"CRAs\") in 2016, when Seterus reported Plaintiff Charles Hrebal (\"Hrebal\") as delinquent on his mortgage, shortly after Hrebal successfully completed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. The parties also dispute whether Seterus's FCRA violations (if any) were willful, as well as whether Seterus's FCRA violations (again, if any) caused Hrebal to suffer actual damages. With discovery complete, both sides now move for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After carefully reviewing the record and applicable case law, the Court grants in part and denies in part Seterus's motion, and denies Hrebal's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Charles Hrebal lives in Annandale, Minnesota with his wife, Christina, and three of his four children. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. A [Doc. No. 37] at 9 (\"Charles Hrebal Deposition\"); Lyons Dec., Ex. I [Doc. No. 44-7] \u00b6 8 (\"Christina Hrebal Declaration\").) Hrebal works in car sales. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hrebal Dep. at 9-10.) In October 2007, Hrebal took out a mortgage loan from CitiMortgage, Inc. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Doc. No. 1] \u00b6 22]; An. [Doc. No. 7] \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Exs. A-B [Doc. No. 36] (\"Original Note and Mortgage\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant Seterus, Inc. is a national loan servicing company. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Doc. No. 1] \u00b6 5; An. [Doc. No. 7] \u00b6 5.) Seterus has serviced Hrebal's home mortgage loan since February 1, 2014, when the Federal National Mortgage Association (\"Fannie Mae\") purchased Hrebal's loan from CitiMortgage, and contracted with Seterus to service Hrebal's loan on its behalf. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff. [Doc. No. 36] \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Chapter 13 Bankruptcy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2010, Hrebal's car dealership began experiencing financial difficulties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hrebal Dep. at 33.) As such, on September 1, 2010, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. B [Doc. No. 37] (\"Chap. 13 Petition\");\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Lyons Dec., Ex. J [Doc. No. 44-8] (\"Bankruptcy Case Docket\").) At the time Hrebal filed for bankruptcy, he was four payments behind on his home mortgage, which was\n   then owned by CitiMortgage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Ex. C [Doc. No. 36] at ECF p. 39 (\"CitiMortgage Payment History\").) Consequently, Hrebal's initial Chapter 13 plan, dated August 27, 2010, stated that Hrebal owed CitiMortgage $ 10,200 in arrears (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , four months' worth of payments), and set forth a plan to repay that debt. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. C [Doc. No. 37] (\"First Chapter 13 Plan\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   However, for unclear reasons, on September 22, 2010 CitiMortgage filed a Proof of Claim stating that Hrebal only owed it $ 6,152.37 in pre-petition arrears (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , two months' worth of payments). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. D [Doc. No. 37] (\"CitiMortgage Proof of Claim\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   A few months later, on January 5, 2011, Hrebal filed an amended Chapter 13 plan reflecting this (lower) arrearage. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. F [Doc. No. 37] (\"Am. Chapter 13 Plan\"); Bankruptcy Docket, No. 23.) CitiMortgage did not object to this plan, and, on March 18, 2011, the Bankruptcy Court approved Hrebal's amended plan following a hearing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. G [Doc. No. 37] (\"Order Confirming Modified Post-Confirmation Chapter 13 Plan\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The relevant portion of Hreabl's final confirmed plan stated that Hrebal would cure \"the actual amounts of default\" by gradually paying $ 6,152.37 to the Trustee, who in turn would pay CitiMortgage. (Am. Chapter 13 Plan \u00a7 6.) The plan also stated that Hrebal would \"pay the [mortgage] payments that come due after the date the petition was filed directly to the creditor.\" (Am. Chapter 13 Plan \u00a7 6;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5) (allowing an individual who owes arrears on their home mortgage to create a Chapter 13 plan that \"provide[s] for the curing of any default within a reasonable time\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   maintenance of payments while the case is pending\").) It is undisputed that, from October 2010 onwards, Hrebal timely made both his plan payments and his regular mortgage payments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. I [Doc. No. 37] at 33-34 (\"Michael McNeil Deposition I\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   According to internal CitiMortgage servicing records produced in discovery, sometime around January 2012, CitiMortgage realized that its Proof of Claim was incorrect. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lyons Aff., Ex. D [Doc. No. 47] at ECF pp. 2-3 (\"Servicing Notes\").) However, despite dozens of internal notes from 2012 through 2014 suggesting that CitiMortgage should file an amended Proof of Claim, including a note stating that an amended Proof of Claim had been sent out \"for filing\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), CitiMortgage never in fact amended its Proof of Claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Dep. I at 22-25 (confirming these facts); Lyons Dec., Ex. A [Doc. No. 44-1] at 88-105 (\"Michael McNeil Deposition II\") (providing further detail).) Moreover, it seems that, because the Trustee had already paid off the arrears detailed in CitiMortgage's Proof of Claim when CitiMortgage sold Hrebal's loan to Fannie Mae/Seterus in February 2014, Seterus did not investigate this issue any further during the bankruptcy proceeding. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Dep. I at 41-45;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. H [Doc. No. 37] (\"Trustee Payment History\") (showing that the Trustee had paid CitiMortgage its entire $ 6,152.37 Proof of Claim by December 27, 2011).) Rather, Seterus continued to accept Hrebal's normal monthly mortgage payments without filing an amended Proof of Claim or otherwise notifying the Bankruptcy Court or Trustee about the missing arrears. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, when Hrebal called to\n   inquire about his mortgage's status during this time period, Seterus appeared to inform him that he was \"current on all payments.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Servicing Notes at ECF p. 93 (noting, in response to a call from Hrebal, that there were \"no missing payments\" on Hrebal's account);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   C. Hrebal Dec. \u00b6 4 (stating that, when Hrebal called Seterus during the bankruptcy, they told him \"your account is current\"); Hrebal Dep. at 15 (similarly noting that, the first \"couple times\" he called Seterus, \"they said I was fine and there wasn't anything wrong\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 27, 2015, Hrebal successfully completed his modified Chapter 13 plan, and the Bankruptcy Court granted him a discharge under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. J [Doc. No. 37] (\"Bankruptcy Discharge\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   However, the issue of the \"missing two payments\" returned to the fore on November 3, 2015, when the Bankruptcy Trustee sent Fannie Mae/Seterus a Notice of Final Cure Payment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Ex. E [Doc. No. 36] (\"Notice of Final Cure\").) The notice stated that, in the Trustee's view, Hrebal had \"paid in full the amount required to cure the default under [CitiMortgage/Fannie Mae's] claim\" and requested a response confirming or denying this fact, as well as inquiring if Hrebal was behind on his \"post-petition\" payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1(f) (requiring this notice for claims \"secured by a security interest in the debtor's principal residence\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Fannie Mae/Seterus timely responded, and asserted (seemingly for the first time) that, although Hrebal had \"paid in full the amount required to cure the default [prior to the bankruptcy],\" \"as of November 17, 2015 ... [Hrebal] was [not] current on all\n   <em>\n    post-petition\n   </em>\n   payments, fees, expenses, and charges.\" (McNeil Aff., Ex. F [Doc. No. 36] (\"Response to Notice of Final Cure\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1(g) (requiring the creditor to file a statement \"itemiz[ing] the required cure or postpetition amounts, if any, that the holder contends remain unpaid as of the date of the statement\").) In particular, Fannie Mae/Seterus claimed that Hrebal was \"past due\" on his mortgage payments for October 2015 and November 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because Hrebal knew he had made his mortgage payments for these months (just as he had made all of his required mortgage payments since filing the Chapter 13 petition back in September of 2010), Hrebal (and, apparently, his bankruptcy attorney) assumed Fannie Mae/Seterus was mistaken. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hrebal Dep. at 35-37.) Consequently, Hrebal did not follow up on this letter. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-37;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3002.1(h) (allowing debtor to request a \"hearing\" after receiving a response to a notice of final care, to \"determine whether the debtor has cured the default and paid all required postpetition amounts\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Seterus viewed the situation differently. As its corporate witness, Michael McNeil, testified, \"even though [Hrebal] made every monthly payment [after entering bankruptcy], [because] there was two outstanding payments [from before the bankruptcy], it [made] [Hrebal] still outstanding at the end because it wasn't included in [the] bankruptcy like it should have been.\" (McNeil Dep. I at 35.) Although \"if everything [had been] done right, [Hrebal] should have been current coming out of the bankruptcy,\" McNeil asserted, the erroneous Proof of Claim resulted in Hrebal \"walk[ing] out of bankruptcy still two payments behind.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36.) Moreover, Seterus was apparently treating these missing pre-petition payments as part of Hrebal's ongoing mortgage balance (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , late in October and November 2015), rather than as uncured pre-petition arrears (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , late in August and September 2010),\n   because, in McNeil's words, \"when you make a payment ... and the loan is delinquent, it's going to go to the prior month payment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. E [Doc. No. 37] at 97-98, 143-45 (\"Sequoia Watts Deposition\"); McNeil Aff., Ex. B [Doc. No. 36] at 4 \u00a7 2 (\"Hrebal Mortgage\") (stating that payments will be applied \"in the order in which [they] become due\").) Therefore, in Seterus's view (as evidenced by its internal payment records), Hrebal had been continuously \"two months behind\" on his mortgage since Seterus began servicing his loan in 2014, even as Hrebal timelymade his usual monthly mortgage payments; Seterus simply refrained from enforcing these two back payments while Hrebal was still in bankruptcy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Ex. D [Doc. No. 36] (\"Hrebal Payment Records\") (showing how Hrebal's \"regular payments\" were applied to months prior to the month in which Hrebal paid).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Post-Bankruptcy Credit Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The situation worsened when Hrebal began checking his credit reports in early 2016. Hrebal discovered that Seterus was informing the three major CRAs (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , Experian, Equifax, TransUnion) that he was delinquent on his mortgage, even though, in his view, he had been making timely payments for over five years and had just (successfully) emerged from bankruptcy. As Hrebal explained it, \"I just knew that this wasn't right ... and I had to get this taken care of. Those payments were wrong, and it wasn't my fault.\" (Hrebal Dep. at 15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, on March 1, 2016, Hrebal called Seterus to dispute the delinquency. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Servicing Notes at ECF p. 120;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Hrebal Dep. at 15; Watts Dep. at 85-87.) The Seterus representative told Hrebal to send his dispute in writing to the CRAs, which Hrebal appeared to do that day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, on March 1, Seterus received an Automated Credit Dispute Verification (\"ACDV\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   from Experian, containing the following message from Hrebal: \"I was never late. I have proof that I always paid on time and also this account should be included in my Chapter 13 bankruptcy.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Ex. G [Doc. No. 36] (\"Response to March 1, 2016 Experian ACDV\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Seterus (through one of its \"credit bureau specialists,\" Sequoia Watts) responded to Experian on March 23, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Watts reviewed Hrebal's \"payment history profile,\" along with the discharge status of his\n   bankruptcy, and determined that Hrebl was \"60 days past due\" as of March 23, 2016, with a \"first date of delinquency\" of March 3, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 91-95.) This made it appear as though \"Hrebal had brought his account current and then was now falling behind.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98.) For unclear reasons, Watts also noted that Hrebal was \"one month late\" during September 2015, but not during any of the months between then and March 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to March 1, 2016 Experian ACDV.) At her deposition, Watts admitted that, because Seterus's policy is to suppress payment history during a bankruptcy (and because Hrebal did not receive his bankruptcy discharge until October 2015), this \"September 2015 entry\" was a \"mistake.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 100;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 28-29, 94-105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing company policy with respect to bankruptcy reporting).) Notably, in responding to Experian, Watts did not inform the CRAs that Hrebal was disputing his delinquency, or otherwise confirm the legitimacy of Hrebal's dispute, even though there was a code that allowed her to do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 75-76, 99, 134-35 (describing the \"CCC\" and \"XB\" codes).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Two days later, following a call from Hrebal, Watts issued an AUD removing the mistaken \"September 2015 entry,\" and then changed the report to say that Hrebal was \"30 days past due,\" as opposed to \"60 days past due.\" Watts apparently made the latter change because she realized Hrebal had made a double payment at some point in time, and thus his outstanding balance was only \"$ 2,916 due\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one monthly payment). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Ex. H [Doc. No. 36] (\"March 25, 2016 AUD\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 138-41 (explaining Hrebal's payment history).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   For unclear reasons, and contrary to Watts's description of company policy, in this March 25, 2016 AUD Watts also changed Hrebal's \"first date of delinquency\" to \"December 1, 2013,\" even though the rest of the AUD showed his mortgage as \"30 days past due\" as of March 25, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 110-14 (stating that she does not know why she changed this date).) At this point, Hrebal looked as if he had been one payment behind for over two years. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 14, 2016, Seterus received a second ACDV from Experian. This ACDV appeared to contain a few documents that Hrebal sent to Experian alongside his dispute notification, such as a copy of his Chapter 13 discharge notice and a copy of CitiMortgage's transfer of claim to Fannie Mae. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Ex. I [Doc. No. 36] (\"Response to March 14, 2016 Experian ACDV\").) Seterus (again, by way of Watts) responded to this ACDV on March 29, 2016. This response essentially re-affirmed Seterus's March 25, 2016 AUD (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , stated that Hrebal was 30 days past due as of March 28, 2016), but changed Hrebal's \"first date of delinquency\" to again say \"March 3, 2016.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Watts did not mark Hrebal's delinquency as disputed in this ACDV response either. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 119.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, on March 25, 2016, Seterus received a third ACDV, this time from Equifax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The request simply stated: \"Consumer states that this account was never late.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec., Ex. K [Doc. No. 37] (\"Response to March 25, 2016 Equifax ACDV\").) This ACDV was handled by a credit bureau specialist named Jermaine Daniels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Daniels's response, dated April 14, 2016, he stated that Hrebal was 30 days past due as of April 14, and that Hrebal's \"first date of delinquency\" was March 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This response was essentially in accord with Watts's March 29, 2016 response to Experian. Yet, for unclear reasons, and contrary to Watts's responses, Daniels failed to suppress Hrebal's payment history for the period of time between the bankruptcy discharge in October 2015 and the current date. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, based on this Equifax credit report, Hrebal appeared that he had been one payment late for several months, rather than only one payment late as of the current month. According to McNeil, \"this was, comparing it to all the other ACDVs, done incorrectly.\" (McNeil Dep. II at 82.) Daniels also did not mark Hrebal's delinquency as disputed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 134.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court pauses to note that, in responding to Hrebal's CRA disputes, it does not appear that anyone at Seterus, including Watts, understood at the time that the erroneous CitiMortgage Proof of Claim constituted the root of the parties' confusion. Indeed, McNeil admitted that the company did not uncover the connection between that Proof of Claim and Hrebal's consistently-behind-on-his-payments issue until months into this litigation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Dep. I at 40, 45-46; McNeil Dep. II at 116.) Rather, at the time, the Seterus representatives in contact with Hrebal and the CRAs, such as Watts, observed that Hrebal was behind on his mortgage according to Seterus's recent payment history (even after his Chapter 13 discharge), and therefore saw no need to investigate the situation further. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Watts Dep. at 44-45 (stating that, although she has access to a \"prior servicer's notes,\" she did not recall reading those notes in this case, and that it is \"not common\" to review such notes when handling a credit report dispute);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   McNeil Dep. II at 92-94 (explaining that CitiMortgage's servicing notes were made available to Seterus upon the transfer of the loan, but that \"nobody is responsible [for] go[ing] through all the loan comments\").) Moreover, although Watts had the means to contact somebody in Seterus's \"bankruptcy department\" to learn more about these prior servicing notes, she did not do so. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 44.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In any event, months later, and following several more phone calls from Hrebal (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Watts Dep. at 135-36; Servicing Notes at ECF pp. 123-34), Hrebal and Seterus entered into a loan modification agreement that allowed Hrebal to add the \"missing payments\" to his loan balance and pay the arrears back over time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Aff., Exs. J-K (\"Jan. 1, 2017 Seterus Loan Modification\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Hrebal Dep. at 41-42, 76-77.) As best the Court can tell, Seterus stopped reporting Hrebal as delinquent sometime between February and April 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   McNeil Dep. II at 62.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Damages Allegedly Incurred by Hrebal As a Result of the Credit Reports\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although the parties eventually resolved this matter, Hrebal argues that Seterus's (allegedly erroneous) credit reporting injured him in the following ways:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   First and foremost, Hrebal contends that Seterus's reporting prevented him from receiving a favorable loan modification\n   in April of 2016. Specifically, he points to a declaration from Roger Fisette, a loan officer with Embrace Home Loans (\"EHL\"). In his declaration, Fisette states that, in March of 2016, \"all [the] paperwork was finalized\" for Hrebal to receive a government-backed Home Affordable Refinance Program (\"HARP\") loan from EHL. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Lyons Dec., Ex. G [Doc. No. 44-5] \u00b6\u00b6 7-10 (\"Roger Fisette Declaration\").) Because HARP had \"no credit score or bankruptcy waiting period requirement,\" the loan was ideal for Hrebal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) Moreover, the loan would have lowered Hrebal's interest rate to 4.375 percent and accordingly saved him around $ 800 a month in mortgage payments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) However, \"on April 18, 2016, Mr. Hrebal's March 1, 2016 mortgage payment was referenced as late [by 48 days],\" and therefore \"Embrace Home Loans had no alternative but to deny Mr. Hrebal a refinance loan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tsai Dec. II, Ex. B [Doc. No. 51] (\"April 18, 2016 Payoff Statement\") (stating that Hrebal's \"next payment\" was due \"March 1, 2016\" and assessing late charges).) Instead, Hrebal had to wait to refinance until March 2017, after he became current on his mortgage with Seterus. \"Ultimately,\" Fisette noted, \"the March 17, 2017 loan that Mr. Hrebal was able to successfully close on [was] at an interest rate of 4.625 percent,\" and therefore only saved him around $ 300 a month in monthly payments. (Fisette Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 15-20;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   Hrebal Dep. at 83-84.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Second, Hrebal asserts that Seterus's reporting caused him to feel embarrassment and shame when he applied for a new job in December 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hrebal Dep. at 24-25.) Because the job application stated that his putative employer would check his credit score, and because Hrebal feared that his credit report would inhibit his odds of securing the job, Hrebal told his boss \"up front\" about his impaired credit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.) Although Hrebal received the job (where he works to this day) and none of his colleagues ever referenced his late mortgage payments to him, Hrebal nonetheless felt embarrassed by the whole process. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-26.) Hrebal's wife, Christine, confirmed his feelings, noting that, when Hrebal applied for the new job, he constantly asked, \"How [am I] supposed to explain the two late payments after being out of bankruptcy for just a year? Would [my] future employer even believe [me]?\" (C. Hrebal Dec. \u00b6 15.) According to Ms. Hrebal, this stress resulted in \"many restless nights.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Finally, Hrebal contends that, as a general matter, Seterus's reporting caused him a great deal of stress. Although the stress neither manifested in serious physical illness, nor caused Hrebal to miss work, both Hrebal and his wife testified that, during this time period, Hrebal became \"short tempered\" and \"would snap\" because \"no one would help [him] with the situation.\" (Hrebal Dep. at 22-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that, during this time, he \"just didn't feel good ... [and had] headaches\").) Ms. Hrebal confirmed that her husband \"became very short tempered with [herself] and the three kids,\" and that she is \"not sure [Hrebal] will ever be the same after everything he has been through over the last eight years.\" (C. Hrebal Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8.) Moreover, Hrebal expressed deep frustration that Seterus's (alleged) misreporting\n   was happening just months after he had a successfully completed a years-long bankruptcy plan. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , C. Hrebal Dec. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (stating that \"it's never easy to make the decision to file for bankruptcy,\" but \"we never expected to finalize our bankruptcy and then [have to] fight to fix [Hrebal's] credit report\").)\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On May 31, 2017, Hrebal filed this FCRA suit against Seterus. In his complaint, Hrebal sought actual, statutory, and punitive damages for willful and negligent non-compliance with the FCRA, as well as attorney's fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Prayer for Relief (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1681n and 1681\n   <em>\n    o\n   </em>\n   ).) Seterus answered on July 21, 2017, and the parties proceeded through discovery. On July 11, 2018, both parties moved for summary judgment, accompanied by a complete set of briefing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Support of Summ. J. [Doc. No. 35] (\"Def.'s Br.\"); Pl.'s Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Summ. J. Mot. [Doc. No. 52] (\"Pl.'s Opp. Br.\"); Def.'s Reply Br.

The Threshold Question of Bankruptcy Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Before proceeding to the merits of Hrebal's FCRA claim, the Court first acknowledges that the parties dispute a threshold question of bankruptcy law. That is, they dispute whether the Bankruptcy Code entitled Seterus to enforce the two missing\n   <em>\n    pre-petition\n   </em>\n   mortgage payments\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Hrebal's discharge, when neither Seterus nor its predecessor, CitiMortgage, included those two payments in their Proof of Claim, or otherwise challenged Hrebal's final, confirmed bankruptcy plan setting his pre-petition arrears at $ 6,152.37. (\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Br. at 19 (arguing that Hrebal's discharge order \"completely absolved [him] of any old arrearages or liability outside of what was listed in the proof of claim,\" and that Seterus could not \"seek collection of [that] discharged debt by mischaracterizing at as occurring after the bankruptcy was completed\")\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp. Br. at 29 (noting that \" 'a secured creditor's claim for mortgage arrearage survives the confirmed plan to the extent that it is not satisfied in full by payments\n   under the plan,' \" and that, \"because the bankruptcy did not discharge [Hrebal's] personal liability for the [home mortgage] debt, [he] remained liable for the two payments after bankruptcy\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re Bateman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9120643,9113431\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/821/\">\n    331 F.3d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 822 (11th Cir. 2003).) In the parties' view, this issue matters because, on the one hand, if the law did allow Seterus to declare Hrebal \"two payments behind\" as he exited bankruptcy, the company's credit reporting would have been at least technically accurate. On the other hand, if the law did not allow Seterus to do that, and Seterus could have uncovered its error upon investigation, its credit reporting would have been inaccurate, or, at best, misleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As explained below, though, the Court can resolve this FCRA case without opining on that complex question of bankruptcy law, which, as best the Court can tell, can be answered in favor of either party.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269604\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/575/869/#p879\">\n    575 B.R. 869\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 879 (Bankr.

First, the parties dispute whether evidence exists from which a reasonable juror could find that Seterus breached its duties under the FCRA to reasonably investigate Hrebal's credit dispute, and then correct any \"inaccurate\" or \"materially misleading\" information following that investigation. Second, assuming the first issue is resolved in Hrebal's favor, the parties dispute whether evidence exists from which a reasonable juror could find that Seterus \"willfully\" or \"recklessly\" breached its statutory duties. Third, and again assuming the first issue is resolved in Hrebal's favor, the parties dispute whether evidence exists from which a reasonable juror could find that Hrebal suffered actual damages, including emotional distress, as a result of Seterus's breach. The Court will address each dispute in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Although Hrebal's complaint contains only one FCRA count, he essentially advances two alternative theories of liability. First, Hrebal argues that Seterus breached its duties under \u00a7 1682s-2(b) because, in responding to the three ACDVs, Seterus failed to uncover that Hrebal was not, in fact, behind on his mortgage, and accordingly failed to remove the delinquency from his credit report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 2-11.) This theory is inextricably linked to the bankruptcy issue detailed above, in that Seterus could only have definitively determined that Hrebal was not behind on his mortgage if the bankruptcy discharge barred Seterus from enforcing the missing pre-petition arrears. Second, however, Hrebal contends that, regardless of the merits of the bankruptcy law question, Seterus breached its duties under \u00a7 1682s-2(b) because, in responding to the three ACDVs, Seterus failed to uncover that Hrebal's dispute was bona fide, and accordingly failed to at least mark the delinquency as \"disputed.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 36 (describing the second theory as viable \"regardless\n   of what happens [with] the bankruptcy dispute\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court finds that it need not rule on the first theory of liability (and thereby resolve the underlying question of bankruptcy law) because the record plainly demonstrates that Hrebal is entitled to a jury trial on his second theory of liability. Consider the following undisputed facts, drawn from Section I,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Hrebal's only missing payments from the bankruptcy filing through spring of 2016 were the two pre-petition payments from August and September 2010, which CitiMortgage failed to include in its Proof of Claim.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , neither Seterus nor CitiMortgage ever amended this Proof of Claim, and, after Hrebal successfully completed his bankruptcy plan in October 2015, the Bankruptcy Court discharged Hrebal's remaining debts.\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Watts and Daniels had access to the servicing notes and payment history that elucidate the prior two facts (and hence would have explained why Hrebal's \"delinquency\" made no sense to him), but, in investigating Hrebal's three ACDVs, neither person looked past their recent payment history screen. (Indeed, no one at the company deduced the source of Hrebal's well-founded confusion until months into this litigation.)\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , Watts and Daniels also had access to a specialized bankruptcy department that could have helped explain the prior servicer notes, but, in investigating Hrebal's three ACDVs, neither person contacted this department.\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   , following their \"investigations,\" Watts and Daniels issued a series of inconsistent responses to the CRAs, all of which gave the impression (one way or another) that Hrebal had fallen behind on his mortgage immediately after exiting bankruptcy.\n   <em>\n    Sixth\n   </em>\n   , and perhaps most importantly, Watts and Daniels could have marked Hrebal's mortgage delinquency as \"disputed,\" but never did, despite receiving three separate ACDVs about Hrebal's dispute, as well as multiple phone calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   On these facts, a reasonable juror could find that Seterus's investigation(s) into Hrebal's dispute(s) was nothing more than a \"mere cursory review,\"\n   <em>\n    Boggio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5866221\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/696/611/#p616\">\n    696 F.3d at 616\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that a reasonable investigation should have resulted in Seterus (1) determining that Hrebal had a bona fide dispute with respect to his mortgage delinquency, and (2) reporting the delinquency as disputed on its ACDV responses, through either their \"CCC\" or \"XO\" codes. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 260.) In other words, a reasonable juror may find that simply re-affirming Hrebal's delinquency, without\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   mention of a dispute, rendered Seterus's credit reporting \"inaccurate\" because \"through omission,\" \"it create[d] a materially misleading impression\" that Hrebal was more financially irresponsible than he actually was.\n   <em>\n    Seamans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119314\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/853/#p865\">\n    744 F.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, a reasonable juror might find this omission especially \"misleading\" because Hrebal had just successfully completed a (years-long) Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan and received a discharge, and had not missed a mortgage payment in over five years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In response, Seterus does not appear to defend the substantive reasonableness of its investigation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4239338\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/780/879/#p883\">\n    780 F.Supp.2d at 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Generally, questions regarding the reasonableness of an investigation are best\n   for a jury to determine.\"). Rather, Seterus seems to argue that, regardless of whether Watts and Daniels should have probed deeper into Hrebal's record to discover the root of his \"missing payments,\" Seterus cannot be held liable under the FCRA because (1) the information it reported was accurate (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. at 4-6), and (2) even if the information it reported was inaccurate (because bankruptcy law barred it from enforcing the uncured arrears), Seterus should not have to report a dispute to the CRAs if that dispute is legal, as opposed to factual. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9). Neither argument is availing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As to the first point, Seterus essentially relies on the bankruptcy argument detailed above. Namely, that, because bankruptcy law purportedly entitled Seterus to enforce the uncured pre-petition arrears against Hrebal, and because Hrebal never paid those arrears, \"the undisputed material evidence demonstrates that Seterus reported accurate information in response to [the] ACDVs.\" (Def.'s Opp. Br. at 30.) The Court disagrees. For one, because the bankruptcy case law does not definitively demonstrate that Seterus was entitled to enforce the uncured arrears, this case is a far cry from those cited by Seterus, where a court found a furnisher's report of a debt accurate as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chiang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215803\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/26/#p35\">\n    595 F.3d at 40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting furnisher summary judgment where consumer's only evidence of inaccuracies were his own, uncorroborated affidavits \"that he told [the furnisher] he disputed various bills\");\n   <em>\n    Edeh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4261608\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/748/1030/#p1039\">\n    748 F.Supp.2d at 1039-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (granting furnisher summary judgment when consumer \"admit[ted] that he owe[d] the full amount of the debt that [the furnisher] verified to the CRAs\"). Moreover, even if Seterus's reporting was \"technically correct\" under some reading of the bankruptcy law, a reasonable juror could nonetheless determine that failing to even mark Hrebal's delinquency as \"disputed\" constituted a materially misleading \"inaccuracy by omission.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seamans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119314\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/853/#p865\">\n    744 F.3d at 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   With respect to the second argument, Seterus cites the First Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Chiang\n   </em>\n   case for the proposition that, \"[e]ven if [Hrebal] could argue that his bankruptcy somehow prevents Seterus from enforcing the two payments that Citi omitted from its [Proof of Claim], [Hrebal's] FCRA claim would still fail because the mere existence of a disputed legal question does not render credit reporting inaccurate or incomplete.\" (Def.'s Br. at 8;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chiang\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4215803\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/595/26/#p35\">\n    595 F.3d at 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"a plaintiff's required showing is\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   inaccuracy, rather than the existence of disputed legal questions,\" because \"furnishers are neither qualified nor obligated to resolve matters that turn on questions that can only be resolved by a court of law\").) In other words, Seterus seems to argue, because Watts and Daniels are not bankruptcy lawyers, the Court should not fault them for failing to resolve Hrebal's dispute.

There, the District Court found that a furnisher did not need to report a delinquency as disputed because the consumer's dispute was \"completely meritless,\" if not \"disingenuous\"; the consumer's only justification for missing his payments was his mortgage lender's purported failure to mail him a paper copy of his mortgage statement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889348\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/871/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889348\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/871/\">\n    at 875-76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Suffice it to say, Hrebal's dispute with Seterus is a far cry from that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   For these reasons, a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether Seterus breached its duties under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1682s-2(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Willfulness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Seterus also argues that no reasonable juror could find that it \"willfully\" or \"recklessly\" violated the FCRA \"because Seterus has policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with FCRA requirements,\" and therefore \"any violation of \u00a7 1681s-2(b) was unintentional and deviated from Seterus's standard procedures.\" (Def.'s Br. at 16.) However, two facts convince the Court that a reasonable juror could find otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, Seterus's inconsistent responses to Hrebal's inquiries from 2014 through 2016 cast into doubt whether Seterus's (arguable) non-compliance with the FCRA was entirely \"unintentional.\" (Def.'s Br. at 16.) For instance, when Hrebal initially called Seterus in 2014 about his payments, Seterus's representative supposedly informed him that he was \"current,\" despite the fact that Seterus's internal payment records listed him as behind at this time. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 257-58 and n.2.) However, when Hrebal called again after seeing the delinquency on his credit report, in spring of 2016, Seterus informed him that he\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   delinquent, despite the fact that Hrebal had not missed a mortgage payment in the months between the two calls. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 259-60.) As a fellow judge of this District has held before, \"inconsistent responses in the face of numerous requests from [the consumer] and inquiries from the CRAs\" may evince a furnisher's \"willfulness in failing to comply with the FCRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Schaffhausen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8908675\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/393/853/#p859\">\n    393 F.Supp.2d at 859\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court finds likewise here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, and more importantly, the Court finds that Seterus's blanket policy against reporting debts as disputed also calls into question Seterus's culpability. At her deposition, Ms. Watts testified that Seterus does not ever inform CRAs that a debt is \"disputed\" in response to an ACDV, because \"the [CRAs] have already been notified on their end that the consumer is disputing something.\" (Watts Dep. at 134, 149-50.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, at least three courts, including two federal circuit courts, have found that a virtually identical \"blanket policy\" against \"marking accounts as disputed\" may evince a \"willful\" or \"reckless\" disregard for compliance with the FCRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seamans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119314\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/853/#p865\">\n    744 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   868-69 ;\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3578231\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/142/#p148\">\n    526 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   150-51 ;\n   <em>\n    Van Veen v.

Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Seamans\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   explicitly rejected Watts's proffered rationale for the \"no dispute\" policy. In\n   <em>\n    Seamans\n   </em>\n   , for instance, the Third Circuit stated that reporting a debt as \"disputed,\" in response to an ACDV (which itself constitutes a notice of dispute), serves \"two purposes\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [F]irst, the furnisher, not the CRA, is in the best position to determine whether the dispute is bona fide, and thus the furnisher's validation of the dispute signifies that the dispute is genuine; and second, the furnisher must provide notice of the dispute to all CRAs to whom it originally submitted the information - not just to the CRA which initially notified the furnisher of the dispute.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    Seamans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119314\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/853/#p865\">\n    744 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   867 n.11 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3578231\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/142/#p148\">\n    526 F.3d at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court finds the reasoning articulated in these decisions persuasive here. Indeed, the Court finds it notable that\n   <em>\n    Seamans\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Saunders\n   </em>\n   were rendered long before March of 2016, and yet Seterus (a nationwide mortgage servicer) did not appear to modify its practices in response to these federal circuit court decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For these reasons, a genuine dispute of material fact exists as to whether Seterus \"willfully\" or \"recklessly\" violated the FCRA, such that Hrebal may be entitled to statutory and/or punitive damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Actual Damages\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Finally, Seterus argues that, to the extent Hrebal is seeking actual damages (which he may collect under either a \"willfulness\" theory or a \"negligence\" theory), none of his alleged damages are cognizable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   First, Seterus argues that Embrace Home Loans (\"EHL\") \"did not deny credit because of Seterus's alleged credit reporting.\" (Def.'s Br. at 12.) In particular, Seterus notes that the HARP loan for which Hrebal was applying had no credit score requirement (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fisette Dec. \u00b6 6), and that, in any event, the April 8, 2016 credit report upon which EHL purportedly relied showed Hrebal's mortgage as \"current with no past due payments.\" (Def.'s Reply Br. at 12.) In response, Hrebal argues that the April 8, 2016 credit report is irrelevant because \"the loan was denied based on the broker's subsequent review of [Hrebal's] credit that occurred prior to closing.\" (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 19.) Hrebal does not provide any record citation in support of this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   On this point, the Court agrees with Seterus. Even viewing the record in the light most favorable to Hrebal, there is no evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that EHL denied Hrebal a HARP loan \"as a result of\" Seterus's credit reporting.\n   <em>\n    Edeh\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4231519\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/974/1220/#p1242\">\n    974 F.Supp.2d at 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Roger Fisette, the EHL loan officer who denied the loan, specifically stated in his declaration that an April 18, 2016 pay-off statement, which \"referenced\" Hrebal's loan as \"48 days late,\" caused the loan denial, not the delinquent credit reporting. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at 261-62.) At his deposition, Fisette did not testify to the contrary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at n.9) This makes sense, as Fisette's declaration also noted that HARP loans have \"no credit score requirement.\" (Fisette Dec. \u00b6 6.) Moreover, to the extent EHL considered Hrebal's credit score, the record shows that (for unclear reasons) the relevant credit report did not list Hrebal as delinquent on his mortgage. (\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   at n.9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Of course, as a matter of bankruptcy law, Seterus may have acted wrongfully in declaring Hrebal \"behind\" on his mortgage solely as a result of the missing pre-petition arrears. But malfeasance is only actionable through the FCRA if the consumer can connect their damages to a credit report. Because Hrebal did not do so with respect to the EHL loan, Seterus is entitled to summary judgment on this issue.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dao v.

At oral argument, Seterus's counsel also rejected the idea that Seterus's failure to \"check a box\" (marking Hrebal's delinquency as disputed) injured Hrebal. (Hr'g Tr. at 46.) Hrebal ripostes by noting that both Hrebal and his wife \"provided specific, detailed testimony that [Seterus's] actions caused [Hrebal] to suffer emotional distress and mental anguish, which manifested in sleep, anxiety, and fear of foreclosure.\" (Pl.'s Opp. Br. at 20.) Because of this, Hrebal contends, \"a genuine issue of material fact exists as to the cause and extent of [Hrebal's] damages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court declines to grant Seterus summary judgment on this issue, for a few reasons. For one, when one views the record in the light most favorable to Hrebal, it becomes clear that a fear of foreclosure was not the \"sole\" driver of Hrebal's anxiety. (Def.'s Reply Br. at 13.)

Importantly, Hrebal's wife corroborated her husband's testimony in a 19-paragraph declaration. In her declaration, Ms. Hrebal stated that her husband \"became very short tempered with [herself] and the three kids,\" and that she is \"not sure [Hrebal] will ever be the same after everything he has been through over the last eight years.\" (C.

For instance, if Hrebal's employer could have seen that Hrebal was disputing the delinquency, it likely would have made Hrebal less stressed about applying for a new job. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , C.
