The Chapter 13 Trustee (\"Trustee\") objects to the Modification arguing there has been no unanticipated change in Debtor's circumstances and the Modification has not been proposed in good faith. This is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) and (L) and the Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the following reasons. Debtor's Modification is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FINDINGS OF FACT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Trustee and Debtor have stipulated to the following facts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. Debtor filed his chapter 13 petition and plan on July 3, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. A modified plan before confirmation (Dckt. No. 14) was filed on July 17, 2017, providing for plan payments of $ 617.00 and a 100 percent dividend to general unsecured creditors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. Debtor's Schedule I (Dckt. No. 1 at 28-29) reflected net monthly income from employment of $ 800.00 and monthly income from Debtor's fiance for Social Security disability benefits of $ 1,956.00, resulting in combined monthly income of $ 2,756.00. Debtor's Schedule I indicated he was resuming employment on July 1, 2017, that his employment income was estimated and that Debtor would amend his schedules upon receipt of more accurate information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   4. Neither Trustee nor Debtor, nor their attorneys, caught the error in Schedule J Line 23a (Dckt. No. 1 at 30-31) which brought forward combined monthly income from Schedule I of $ 5,422.66 rather than carrying forward the correct figure of $ 2,756.00. As a result of this error. Debtor's Schedule J reflected expenses totaling $ 3,401.00 and monthly net income of $ 2,021.66 instead of the negative net monthly income of $ 645.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5. Based on the appearance that Debtor had net monthly income in excess of the proposed plan payments of $ 617.00, Trustee objected to confirmation and required 5.5 percent interest be added to unsecured claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   6. Trustee's Motion to Confirm Plan As Amended (Dckt. No. 49) provided for 5.5 percent interest and an increase in monthly plan payments to $ 924.00. The Order Confirming Plan (Dckt. No. 53) was entered on February 15, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   7. Trustee's records indicate that since confirmation, the Debtor's payments have been made consistently through his employers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   8. On August 15, 2018, Debtor filed the Modification reducing his plan payments to $ 600.00 and reducing the dividend to general unsecured creditors to 0 percent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   9. In conjunction with filing the Modification, Debtor provided amended Schedules I and J. Dckt. No. 74. Amended Schedule I reflects that Debtor's gross income from employment is now\n   $ 4,342.22 and his combined monthly income is $ 3,635.28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   10. Debtor's fiance's Social Security income is not included in the amended Schedule I. Dckt. No. 74 at Schedule I. As of [the date of the stipulation of facts] the fiance does not have any other source of income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   11. Amended Schedule J includes Debtor's fiance as a dependent and includes a deduction for her car payment of $ 477.00 per month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   12. The Trustee's Objection was filed on August 22, 2018.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dckt. No. 90, Joint Stipulation of Facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   There are two issues before the Court: whether Debtor has demonstrated the requisite evidence to support a modification of a plan after confirmation/ and, if so, whether Debtor's modified plan has been proposed in good faith. The Trustee first contends, without an unanticipated change in circumstances, Debtor cannot modify his confirmed chapter 13 plan. The Trustee further argues under the facts of this case. Debtor's proposal to reduce his monthly chapter 13 plan payments from $ 924 to $ 600 and decrease the dividend paid to his unsecured creditors from 100% to 0% does not meet the good faith requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Conversely, Debtor maintains the Bankruptcy Code does not require an unanticipated change in circumstances to modify a confirmed chapter 13 plan. Furthermore, assuming arguendo a substantial and unanticipated change is required. Debtor argues this Court's recent ruling in\n   <em>\n    In re Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201581635\">\n    2018 WL 1581635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D. Ga. Mar. 27, 2018) constitutes such a change. Debtor also argues the Modification is proposed in good faith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Modification After Confirmation.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 1329 authorizes a debtor to modify a chapter 13 plan after confirmation under certain circumstances, providing in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a) At any time after confirmation of the plan but before the completion of payments under such plan, the plan may be modified, upon request of the debtor, the trustee, or the holder of an allowed unsecured claim, to\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1) increase or reduce the amount of payments on claims of a particular class provided for by the plan; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (b)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (1) Sections 1322(a), 1322(b), and 1323(c) of this title and the requirements of section 1325(a) of this title apply to any modification under subsection (a) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) The plan as modified becomes the plan unless, after notice and a hearing, such modification is disapproved.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201329\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(l) and (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Pursuant to \u00a7 1327, a confirmed chapter 13 plan is binding upon the debtor, trustee, and creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201327\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (\"The provisions of a confirmed\n   plan bind the debtor and each creditor, whether or not the claim of such creditor is provided for by the plan, and whether or not such creditor has objected to, has accepted, or has rejected the plan.\").

Some courts hold a substantial, unanticipated change in circumstances is a required prerequisite for confirmation of a modification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713631\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/143/\">\n    474 F.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2007) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4189168\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/458/745/\">\n    458 B.R. 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8th Cir.

These courts find the confirmation order is a final order binding upon the parties and entitled to preclusive effect under \u00a7 1327, and to allow modifications without an unanticipated change in circumstances undermines the finality of the order and allows modification proponents to relitigate issues that were or could have been addressed at confirmation.\n   <em>\n    Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5713631\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/143/\">\n    474 F.3d at 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Other courts conclude such a change is not a prerequisite for modifications.

No. 1, Official Form 122C-1. There is a difference between \"requiring\" SSI to be contributed and \"voluntarily\" contributing SSI to the plan. In this case. Debtor's proposed plan had significant feasibility concerns, with Debtor's actual monthly net income, without his fiance's SSI, averaging less than -$ 1,100.00.

Debtor voluntarily opted to include his fiance's SSI and his plan was confirmed. Since that time. Debtor has made monthly payments of $ 924 for more than a year.
