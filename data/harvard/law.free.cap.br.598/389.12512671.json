A response to the Objection was filed by Southern Roots Farming Company, LLC (\"Southern Roots\") on June 14, 2018, Dkt. 401 (the \"Response\"). Bench briefs were supplied to the court by CFG and Southern Roots on October 24, 2018. Hearings were held in Raleigh, North Carolina on October 25, 2018 and on November 5, 2018, after which the court took the matter under advisement. After a review of the case record and consideration of the parties' arguments, the Objection will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Wayne Bailey, Inc. (the \"debtor\") filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 21, 2018 (the \"Petition Date\"). The court issued a Notice of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Case on the Petition Date, Dkt. 2, which established a deadline of May 29, 2018 for the filing of claims by non-governmental creditors in this case (the \"Claims Bar Deadline\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The debtor is a sweet potato grower, packer, and shipper based in Chadbourn, North Carolina. As part of its business operation, the debtor regularly purchases sweet potatoes from local growers, packs the purchased potatoes, and sells and ships them to wholesale and retail vendors. Many of the growers who sell potatoes to the debtor are licensed produce sellers pursuant to the Perishable Agricultural Commodities Act (\"PACA\"), which governs the sale of produce in the United States and is codified at 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 499a - 499t. Under PACA, upon the sale of produce, a statutory trust is imposed upon the purchased \"perishable agricultural commodities\" and all receivables and proceeds thereof. As a result, the debtor contends that many of the sellers in this case may hold claims subject to PACA's statutory trust provisions, such that a separate PACA-specific claims process was necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    A. Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on the large number of anticipated PACA claims in the case, the court entered a consent order on March 5, 2018, Dkt. 139 (the \"Consent Order\"), which required any unpaid produce \"seller or supplier of the debtor alleging rights under [PACA]\" to file a proof of claim using a specific form on or before April 16, 2018 (the \"PACA Claim Deadline\"). Southern Roots timely filed its PACA proof of claim on April 13, 2018 in the amount of $ 1,870,411.09 for sweet potatoes grown during the 2017 growing season. Southern Roots filed an Amended PACA Proof of Claim No. 79-2, on July 17, 2018 in the amount of $ 1,882,944.67. The original proof of claim and the amended proof of claim differ only by the inclusion of an interest component. Objections to Southern Roots' PACA proof of claim were filed by both the debtor and CFG.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    ISSUES AND PARTIES' POSITIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In its Amended PACA Claim, filed on July 17, 2018 (Claim No. 79-2), Southern Roots asserts a claim in the amount of $ 1,882,944.67 and contends that this full\n   amount is entitled to statutory trust protection pursuant to PACA. The debtor's objection asserts that: 1) Southern Roots \"was not the grower of, and had no actual ownership interest in, the 2017 sweet potato crop reflected in the invoices attached to the PACA Proof of Claim and therefore, \"Southern Roots is therefore not eligible for PACA trust benefits;\" 2) that the Grower Agreements entered into between the debtor and Southern Roots created payment terms in excess of those prescribed by PACA; and 3) the payment terms contained in the Grower Agreements conflicted with the payment terms contained in the invoices. The CFG objection asserts that: 1) since Southern Roots \"was not a supplier, seller or agent who transferred ownership, possession or control of the sweet potatoes identified in the invoices issued by Southern Roots, [Southern Roots] is not entitled to assert the benefits of a PACA trust,\" and 2) the PACA waiver executed by George Wooten is binding upon Southern Roots and waives the PACA claim in its entirety, or alternatively, to the extent of George Wooten's 50% ownership interest in Southern Roots. The SPF Objection asserts that the Southern Roots PACA Claim was waived by George Wooten. In the CFG Supplemental Objection filed after the hearing held on October 25, 2018, CFG asserted an additional argument that incorporated the position of the debtor taken in its objection by contending that the payment terms between the parties exceeded those allowed under PACA statutes and regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In response, Southern Roots maintains that 1) it is the proper holder of the PACA claim because it \"transferred ownership, possession or control of the potatoes,\" 2) the waiver executed by George Wooten does not waive Southern Roots' PACA rights, and 3) the payment terms between the parties do not exceed those allowed under PACA statutes and regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   For purposes of its ruling, the court will assume, but not decide, that Southern Roots is the proper party to assert the PACA claim and that the waiver is unenforceable as against Southern Roots. The court's ruling, therefore, will only be based upon its analysis of the payment terms between the parties and their effect on PACA eligibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    A. PACA, Generally\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   PACA, enacted by Congress in 1930, exists \"to encourage fair trading practices in the marketing of perishable commodities by suppressing unfair and fraudulent business practices in marketing of fresh and frozen fruits and vegetables ... and providing for collecting damages from any buyer or seller who fails to live up to his contractual obligations.\" H.R. Rep. No. 543, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 3 (1984). To this end, the statute creates, \"immediately upon a delivery [of produce], a nonsegregated 'floating' trust in favor of sellers on the perishable commodities sold and the products and proceeds derived from the commodities.\"\n   <em>\n    Reaves Brokerage Co., Inc. v.

Southern Roots maintains that it \"accepted\" the sweet potatoes from the debtor at the time of packing of the produce, and that since its terms were Net 10, the payment terms are PACA compliant. In response, CFG and the debtor make two arguments: 1) \"acceptance\" of the potatoes occurred significantly prior to pack out, such that the \"10 days after packing\" stipulated terms would exceed the statutory limitations; and, 2) the payment terms set forth in the written Grower Agreements conflict with those found on the invoices, also rendering the invoices PACA ineligible.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \"Acceptance\" is defined in the PACA regulations as \"any act by the consignee which is inconsistent with the consignor's ownership, but if such act is wrongful against the consignor it is acceptance only if ratified by him.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.2\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dd).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The competing positions of the parties direct the court's focus to the Grower Agreements. The debtor entered into (4) four Sweet Potato Grower's Agreement, Right of Entity, Security Agreement and Pledge of Collateral (hereinafter \"Grower Agreement\") with Southern Roots for the 2017 growing season as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   1. Grower Agreement dated August 24, 2017\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   between Southern Roots and the debtor relating to 1050 acres located in Columbus County, NC;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.

Grower Agreement dated August 17, 2017 between Southern Roots and the debtor relating to 650 acres located in Sampson County, NC;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   4. Grower Agreement dated August 17, 2017 between Southern Roots and the debtor relating to 115 acres in Columbus County, NC for organic sweet potatoes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   A pre-transaction agreement to extend payment terms beyond the 10-day period\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   permissible under PACA's regulations, provided that the agreement is memorialized\n   <em>\n    in writing\n   </em>\n   and the agreed-upon payment term does not exceed the statutory maximum of thirty days.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.46\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The applicable regulation states, in relevant part\n   <strong>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Parties who elect to use different times for payment must reduce their agreement to writing before entering into the transaction and maintain a copy of their agreement in their records, and the times of payment must be disclosed on invoices, accountings, and other documents relating to the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.46\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The questions posed by the Grower Agreements are: do the Grower Agreements contain payment terms and, if so, are those terms PACA compliant? The parties do not disagree regarding the import of the \"growing\" portion of the Grower Agreements. It provides terms pursuant to which sweet potatoes are planted, grown and harvested on the grower's land-the debtor contributes plants, labor, equipment and expertise and the grower contributes land, pesticides, fertilizer and cultivation expertise. Interpretation of the\n   following provisions contained in the Grower Agreements forms the basis of the controversy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   WBI and Grower shall produce the 2017 organic sweet potato crop on a cooperative basis whereby upon harvesting, half the crop yield ... shall be the property of WBI free and clear of any claims of the Grower and half the crop ... shall be the property of the Grower free and clear of any claims of WBI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   WBI will pay $ 200 per 18 bushel bin equivalent ($ 422.56 per 38 bushel bin equivalent for Grower's half ... of the sweet potatoes ...)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Upon the harvesting and gathering of sweet potatoes upon Grower's land by WBI ... Grower hereby transfers and assigns Grower's full legal and beneficial title, rights and interests ... to said sweet potatoes to WBI ... subject to WBI's and Grower's agreement as to purchase price. WBI will store Grower's half of the crop yield in one of WBI's ... facilities ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   In the event that WBI elects to purchase Grower's half of the crop yield ... WBI will pay Grower the prices indicated above. If payment has not been remitted on or before December 1, 2017 ... Grower will have the option to sell its half ... but subject to WBI having the right of refusal. WBI purchases made subsequent to December 1, 2017 shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent (10%) per annum.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The parties clearly have agreed to a price. They have also placed an outside due date of December 1, 2017 before interest begins to accrue. The court therefore concludes that the Grower Agreements set forth payment terms. But do those terms exceed 10 days from acceptance of the produce?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Both the debtor and CFG assert that the Grower Agreement terms which vest title in the sweet potatoes in the debtor upon harvest and gathering of the sweet potatoes set the date of acceptance at the point, not the later packing date asserted by Southern Roots. The court agrees. Since the packing dates could, and the court assumes do, in fact, significantly post date the harvest date, i.e., in excess of 30 days, the payment terms set forth in the Grower Agreements render the invoices PACA ineligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Furthermore,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2046.46\">\n    7 C.F.R. \u00a7 46.46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) provides that if a pre-transaction agreement between the parties sets forth a date in excess of 10 days (but not more than 30) for payment, such term must be set forth on the invoices related to the transactions. Although the invoices set forth payment terms of 10\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   days, they do not set forth the terms provided in the Growers Agreements. For that reason as well, the invoices are PACA ineligible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Objections to the PACA Claim of Southern Roots are ALLOWED. The record is unclear as to whether the sum of $ 1,882,944.67 reflected on Southern Roots' Amended Proof of Claim is disputed because the parties requested resolution of the legal issues only. Therefore, the debtor shall have 14 days to file an objection to the amount asserted by Southern Roots. If an objection\n   is filed, the court will set a hearing. If not, upon the expiration of the 14-day period, Southern Roots shall have an allowed general unsecured claim in the amount of $ 1,882,944.67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Southern Roots moved to strike the additional argument regarding payment terms contained in CFG's Supplemental Objection on October 23, 2018, Dkt. 685, and CFG responded. The court will consider the arguments in the Supplemental Objection since they mirror the objection basis set forth by the debtor, and therefore do not prejudice Southern Roots in any way.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    The definition of \"acceptance\" is made up of three components in the disjunctive, therefore requiring only one to apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The dates of the Grower Agreements are noted as of the date of the last party to sign.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    Actual prices differ between the Grower Agreements but are designated in the same place and form on the document.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    It is unclear whether the invoice terms are actually Net 10-the invoices state that term but reflect a Due Date thirty days past the date of the invoice.
