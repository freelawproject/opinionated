Broadly the questions include (1) wheth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>er a conveyance of' homestead property by a widow to herself and one of her four children may constitute a \u201croot of title\u201d under the Florida Marketable Record Title Act, so as to extinguish the homestead interests of the other three children, and (2) if so, is such an application of the Florida Act constitutional under the Florida Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-4\">We defer decision on these questions and certify the issues to the Supreme Court of Florida. We will decide such other issues as may remain after decision of the Florida Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-5\">Following our practice, we requested that the parties submit a proposed agreed certificate of the issues for decision. They have reached substantial, though not full, agreement upon them. Believing that the alternative form of submission of Issue 1 suggested by the parties is appropriate here, as the selection of the proper form of this issue also involves application of uncertain Florida law, we submit the parties\u2019 statement of facts and issues hereby, disclaiming, however, any intention or desire that the Supreme Court of Florida confine its reply to the precise form or scope of the questions certified. See <em>Allen v. Estate of Carmen, </em>446 F.2d 1276 (5th Cir. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">CERTIFICATE FROM THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA, PURSUANT TO SECTION 25.031, FLORIDA STATUTES 1975, AND RULE 4.61, FLORIDA APPELLATE RULES.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">TO THE SUPREME COURT OF FLORIDA AND THE HONORABLE JUSTICES THEREOF:</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">It appears to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that the above styled case in this Court involves questions or propositions of law of the State of Florida which are determinative of the cause, and there appear to be no clear, controlling precedents in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">This Court hereby certifies the following questions of law to the Supreme Court of Florida for instructions concerning said questions of law, based on the facts recited herein, pursuant to Section 25.031, Florida Statutes 1975, F.S.A., and Rule 4.61, Florida Appellate Rules, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-11\">(1) <em>Style of the Case:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-12\">The style of the case in which this certificate is made is William L. Wads-worth, Mary Elizabeth Wadsworth Taylor and Joseph Brady Wadsworth, appellants, versus ITT Rayonier, Incorporated, appellee, Case No. 75-2185, United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, such case being an appeal from the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-13\">(2) <em>Statement of Facts :</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1098-14\">L.

WADSWORTH, a three-fourths undivided interest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1100-10\">\u201cTO LEWIS E. WADSWORTH a one-fourth undivided interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1100-11\">This instrument was signed, sealed, witnessed and acknowledged by Lotta M. Wadsworth and was placed of record in August of 1937.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-12\">This is the deed which Rayonier contends is a \u201croot of title\u201d within the provisions of the Florida Marketable Record Title Act, <em>Florida Statutes, </em>Section 712.-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-13\">By deed dated December 30, 1942, and recorded on January 18, 1943, Lotta M. Wadsworth and Lewis E. Wadsworth, Jr., conveyed the land together with other real property in Flagler County, Florida, to Rayonier Incorporated, now ITT Rayonier, Incorporated. Lotta M. Wads-worth is still living.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-14\">By instruments recorded in 1971, William L. Wadsworth, Mary Elizabeth Wadsworth Taylor and Joseph Brady Wadsworth (hereafter called appellants), first filed of record notice of their claims each to a vested undivided one-fourth interest in remainder in the lands which had been the homestead of their father at the time of his death, subject only to the life estate of their mother, Lotta M. Wadsworth.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-15\">On October 25, 1972, Rayonier, being in possession and claiming full fee title to the land, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida to quiet title in itself to the land against the claims of the appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-16\">The District Court granted Summary Judgment on Rayonier\u2019s motion, holding that the Florida Marketable Record Title Act, Chapter 712, <em>Florida Statutes, </em>as applied to the 1937 deed, extinguished any interests of appellants in the land. The appellants challenge this conclusion, asserting the continuing validity of their remainder interests in the land that was their father\u2019s homestead at his death in 1935, and that the 1937 deed, purporting to convey the fee title to the land is not a valid \u201croot of title\u201d as to their remainder interests, within the meaning of the Florida Marketable Record Title Act, Chapter 712, <em>Florida Statutes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-17\">(3) <em>Questions of Law:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1100-18\">1. The parties are unable to agree as to the form of the first question. Accordingly, this question is set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>the form proposed by appellants and by appellee:</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\"><em>Question 1 as proposed by Appellants: </em>With respect to the interest purportedly conveyed to Lotta by the 1937 deed, does the deed constitute a valid \u201croot of title\u201d upon which can be established a \u201cmarketable record title\u201d within the meaning of <em>Florida Statutes, </em>Sections 712.01 and 712.02?</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\"><em>Question 1 as proposed by Appellee: </em>Does the 1937 deed from Lotta M. Wads-worth constitute a valid \u201croot of title\u201d upon which can be established a \u201cmarketable record title\u201d within the meaning of <em>Florida Statutes, </em>Sections 712.01 and 712.02?</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">2. If the answer to 1 is in the affirmative, are the rights of appellants within the exception to the operation of the Marketable Record Title Act provided by <em>Florida Statutes, </em>Section 712.03(1)?</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">3. If the answer to 1 is in the affirmative, are the rights of appellants within the exception to the operation of the Marketable Record Title Act provided by <em>Florida Statutes, </em>Section 712.03(3)?</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">4(a). Are the interests which appellants claim protected by the provisions of the Florida Constitution of 1885 and Florida statutory law applicable in 1935 as they relate to homestead?</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-10\">(b) If the answer to 4(a) is in the affirmative, does the Florida Marketable Record Title Act extinguish them in the same manner as it extinguishes other interests in land?</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-11\">(c) If the answer to 4(b) is in the affirmative, is the Marketable Record Title Act as so applied unconstitutional under the Florida Constitution of 1885?</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-12\">The entire record in this case, together with copies of the briefs of the parties and agreed certification in this Court, are transmitted herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
