Appellant contends that the district court erred in denying his habeas corpus petition without an evidentiary hearing. As grounds appellant alleges that: (1) he was unconstitutionally resentenced to life imprisonment when his death sentence was set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>aside; (2) his counsel\u2019s failure to challenge the petit jury did not constitute a waiver; and (3) his Sixth Amendment rights were violated by the denial of representation of counsel at his preliminary hearing.
