BROWN, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1446-6\">While I concur in the order vacating the en banc largely because the overwhelming majority thought the case was essentially a factual one, on the merits of the case I register my concurrence in Judge Clark\u2019s dissenting opinion for the panel and now that of Judge Goldberg.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1446-7\">GOLDBERG, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aq5\">with whom WISDOM, GODBOLD, CLARK and GEE, Circuit Judges, join, dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-8\">The majority opinion for the panel in this case assumed that the operation of the Florida voucher rule excluded the' evidence sought to be introduced, and that the issue before the panel was whether this cumulation of exclusions was consistent with <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>1973, 410 U.S. 284, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297. I would agree that this case would be unenbancworthy if the panel had avoided the <em>Chambers </em>question on any of the several grounds suggested in appellee\u2019s briefs, or if the panel majority had presented a version of the facts which contradicted the account succinctly set forward in Judge Clark\u2019s dissent. The panel chose, however, to face the <em>Chambers </em>issue squarely and, I think, decided it wrongly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-17\">As the majority noted, it was at least a \u201cveiled\u201d theory of the defense that the defendant\u2019s wife, and not the defendant, was the perpetrator of the crime. The testimony that the defendant wanted to introduce attacked the wife\u2019s story that she was out of the house at a crucial time, attacked the wife\u2019s credibility generally, and attempted to demonstrate a basis for the defense theory that the defendant\u2019s confession was a lie to protect his wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1446-10\"><em>Chambers </em>reaffirmed the general principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1446-11\">[t]he right of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity to defend against the State\u2019s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and to call witnesses in one\u2019s own behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process..</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVX\">410 U.S. at 294, 93 S.Ct. at 1045. I am convinced the panel majority\u2019s opinion is inconsistent with this general principle, and can only be distinguished from <em>Chambers </em>in immaterial factual details. Assuming the <em>Chambers </em>issue had to be faced, I find Judge Clark\u2019s dissent from the panel majority unanswerable. I consider this case to be enbancworthy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
