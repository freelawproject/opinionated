It averred that by virtue of an Act of Assembly, approved April 2d 1870, and of the supplement^ thereto, approved February 1st 1871 and March 20th 1872, the improvements in the grading and paving of Penn avenue and other streets and avenues of Pittsburgh, had been made at great expense; that for the purpose of providing for the cost of the same, in pursuance of the said Act of Assembly, the commissioners elected to superintend said work, made requisition upon the mayor of the city of Pittsburgh for the issue of its bonds; that the mayor, in pursuance of said requisition and of the authority conferred upon him by said act, from time to time made and executed bonds of said city for the contract price and the incidental expenses of said improvements, the amount of the issue being $5,823,800 ; that the bonds so issued were duly signed by the mayor, countersigned by the controller, and sealed with the corporate seal of the city ; that said bonds, bearing different rates of interest, were delivered to the said commissioners, and by them negotiated, and the proceeds thereof paid to the treasurer of the said city; that the proceeds were applied to the expense and cost of the improvements in question; that said bonds have been presented to the treasurer of the said city and have been duly registered; that the petitioner, as a member of a firm, is the holder and owner of said bonds, amounting to the sum of $9500, and he is also the agent of the several trust companies mentioned, who hold, in a fiduciary capacity, a large amount of said bonds as trustees; that the amount of interest in arrears on said bonds is $398,514 ; that said interest accrued in 1877, and a larger amount accrued in 1878; that there is the sum of $46,500, the principal of bonds issued as a temporary loan under the Act of April 2d 1870, due on the 1st January 1877.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b65-8\">Annexed to the petition is a statement of the interest and of the bonds, and of the dates of their maturity. It further avers that it is the duty of the city to make annual appropriations, and apply the samo to the payment of the salaries of the city\u2019s officers, and to the payment of the original current expenses of the city, and to the payment of the interest on the funded debt of said city; that it is the duty of \"said councils in case there are no funds with which to pay the same to make temporary loans to do so ; that said councils have disregarded their duty and have not made any appropriations, and have made no temporary loan for the purpose of paying the same; that it is the duty of said councils annually to make appropriations to pay interest of its funded debt and to provide for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>appropriation by assessments and collection of taxes; tbat the said councils have failed to pass an appropriation ordinance for the purpose ' of making such appropriation; that by their act in refusing to pass an ordinance they have evidenced an intention to refuse to provide for the payment of the interest. The petitioner, and those holding the bonds, have been unable to collect their interest, although they have demanded the payment of the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-6\">The petitioners then pray for a mandamus compelling said councils forthwith to make full and ample provision for the payment of all the interest now due on said bonds, and that which may become due thereon during 1878 ; that they be commanded to assign and appropriate out of the revenue of said city sufficient money derivable from all sources to pay the funded debt of said city, giving preference to these bonds, if there be any deficiency in the payment of said interest, before paying the salaries of the city officers, and the ordinary current expenses of the city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-7\">The return of the respondent admits that under and in pursuance of the authority contained in the Acts of Assembly, that the curbing, paving and improvements alleged were done; that upon the requisition of the commissioners the bonds were duly issued; that the bonds were of the following form :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-8\">Registered Bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-9\">United States of America, State of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-10\">Citv or Pittsburgh.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-11\">Ellsworth Avenue Bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-12\"><em>Snow all men by these </em>Presents,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-13\">Tbat the City of Pittsburgh is indebted to of assigns, in the sum of</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-14\">lawful money of the United States, which sum of</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-15\">the said City of Pittsburgh promises to pay to the said</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-16\">or assigns,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-17\">at the office of the Treasurer of said City, on the 1st day of April, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Eighty-five, with interest at the rate of seven per centum, payable semi-annually, on the 1st days of October and April, of each year, and for the true and faithful payment of the said sum of and the semi-annual interest thereon as aforesaid, the faith, credit and property of said City of Pittsburgh are hereby solemnly pledged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b66-18\">\u2019 This bond is issued for the Ellsworth Avenue Improvement, in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, entitled \u201c An act to provide for the improvement of Penn avenue and other avenues and streets in the City of Pittsburgh,\u201d approved the 2d day of April, a. d. 1870, and supplements thereto, and an ordinance of the Councils of said city, adopted on the 9th day of December 1872, authorizing the grading and paving of Ellsworth avenue, from Penn avenue to Neville street, and the election of Commissioners for that purpose.

The failure is admitted to provide for the payment of the interest on its bonds; but it is denied that the bonds hold by Whelen and others are part of the city funded debt, and that the respondents have in any manner failed .to perform the duty required by them. The answer further admits the authority of the city to make temporary loans for the payment of interest upon its funded debt, and that they have failed to make the appropriation to pay the interest on said bonds; that prior to the Act of April 2d 1870, the cost and expense of streets and avenues of said city were paid by assessments upon the property abutting upon each of said streets and avenues, without expense to the city; that the owners of property procured the passage of the said Act of April 2d 1870, and in pursuance of the same, the said avenues were paved, and the bonds issued for the same, amounting to the sum of $4,436,900; that the total cost of street improvements was assessed upon property fronting or abutting upon the respective streets and avenues, in accordance with the said act; that a list of owners was duly made out, with the amounts of the assessment stated and due notice thereof given; that the requirements of the act were duly followed; that the aggregate of said assessment exceeded $4,436,900, and are liens upon the property abutting on said streets; that said assessments are payable in ten equal annual instalments, bearing interest at the rate of seven per cent, per annum; that there was due, January 1st 1877, a sum exceeding $1,000,000 of said assessments, more than sufficient to pay the interest due on said bonds, and that there is now due more than sufficient to pay interest for 1878; that respondents have requested the city attorney and the city treasurer to proceed speedily to collect the instalments that are due upon the assessments; that these bonds were issued and sold'upon the faith and credit of said assessment made to pay upon the abutting property of each street, and that the petitioner and those he represents, with this knowledge, purchased said bonds. It avers that the debt of the city of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Pittsburgh was $7,527,300, and that the assessed value of the property of said city is $19,614,975; that the amount of bonds issued under Act of April 2d 1870, was $2,134,600; that the amount of the indebtedness, including said last-mentioned sum, would be $9,661,900; that under the Act of April 2d 1870,'there had been issued $4,652,700 of bonds; that said amount of bonds are included in the amount named in this petition, and were issued under the authority contained in the Act of April 2d 1870, and with the assent of the electors of said city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-6\">The portions of the Act of April 2d 1870, referred to in respondents\u2019 answer that are material, are as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-7\">Sect. 12. For the purpose of providing for the payment of the cost and expense of said improvements, the said commissioners shall be authorized, from time to time, as the work progresses, to make requisition upon the mayor of the city of Pittsburgh for the issue of bonds of said city, in such sums as they deem best; and it shall be the duty of the said mayor to make and execute bonds in the name of said city, to an amount not exceeding the amount of the contract price for said work, and the incidental expenses attending the same; said bonds shall be known as Penn Avenue bonds; they shall be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the controller, and sealed with the corporate seal of said city; they shall be all of the same date, and they shall be payable twelve years after date, and redeemable at any time at the option of said city; they shall bear interest at the rate of seven per centum per annum, payable semi-annually from date, principal and interest payable at the office of the treasurer of the city of Pittsburgh; the said bonds shall be free of taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">Sect. 15.

The following opinion was filed by Bailey, J.:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-6\">\u201c \u2018In mandamus cases,\u2019 Mr. Justice Thompson says, \u2018 the establishment of a duty and the obligation to perform it, is upon the plaintiff to show, and this is considered as done, prima facie, when the court awards the (alternative) writ.\u2019 Commonwealth ex rel. Armstrong <em>v. </em>Allegheny County, 1 Wright 279. This may bo the case where the practice still prevails to have a preliminary hearing, upon motion or rule with notice to the proposed respondent, before the granting of the alternative writ. Such has not been the practice of this court, and was not in this case. Wheii the suggestion is presented by counsel of proved ability and integrity, the practice has been to grant the writ upon mere statement of the case, without even the reading of the suggestion, and such was the course here. And this would seem the better practice; courts in modern days cannot give the time to hearing a preliminary argument, and a .second, after return to the writ, when one will suffice; and it would be a useless expense to make two services, when one can be made to answer all the ends of justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-7\">\u201c Counsel for the relator explicitly recognised this practice, and the fact that the court had, in granting this writ, determined nothing. Had this not been done, I could not have consented that the case should have been heard in its present shape, lest the injustice should have been done the respondents of depriving them of the right to contest the case made by the relator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-8\">u The great chief justice of this state declared in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Canal Commissioners, 2 P. &amp; W. 518, that the granting of a writ of mandamus \u2018 involves the exercise of extraordinary power, which fits it for use only in extraordinary cases, where there would be otherwise a failure of justice.\u2019 See Commonwealth ex rel. <em>v. </em>Henry, 13 Wright 538. In order to involve the exercise of this power, the relator must establish in himself \u2018a right to enforce, which is specific, complete and legal, and for which there is no other specific, legal remedy.\u2019 Heffner <em>v. </em>Commonwealth ex rel., 4 Casey 112. And that this right rests upon \u2018 some duty that those to whom it may bo directed owe to the public, and upon their obligation to perform it.\u2019 Armstrong\u2019s Case, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-9\">\u201c The command of this writ is, that the councils of the city of Pittsburgh \u2018 make full and ample provision for the payment of all the interest now duo on said bonds (Penn Avenue bonds), and that which shall become due thereon in the year 1878, by the assessment and collection of such taxes as may be necessary for the purpose, and that you assign and appropriate, out of the revenue of said city, derivable from all sources, sufficient moneys for the payment of the interest of the funded debt of said city, so as aforesaid in arrears, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>and to become due,\u2019 or the cause wherefore you cannot, &amp;c. As I understand the counsel of the relator, they claim that the relief thus sought is two-fold. First, that the councils make provision for the interest by the assessment and collection of a specific tax ; and second, that they appropriate sufficient for this purpose out of the revenue derived from taxes, assessed for general municipal purposes. If this were so, the relator would have failed to define the duties resting upon the respondents, and his writ would be bad. But the command may possibly be construed to be single.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">\u201c In order to maintain the duty and right set forth, it is essential that the bonds referred to shall be bonds of the city, and also that they shall constitute a part of its \u2018funded debt.\u2019 The writ, however, nowhere states in terms that the bonds were issued by the city of Pittsburgh, nor that they form a part of such \u2018 funded debt.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-7\">\u201cAs in the case of a return, the writ must set forth its case with certainty, and no.t argumentatively nor inferentially : Armstrong\u2019s Case, <em>supra.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-8\">\u201c The writ, after setting forth the Acts of Assembly, by authority of which the bonds were issued, proceeds to state that the commissioners controlling the grading and paving of Penn and other avenues, \u2018 made a requisition upon the mayor for the issue of the bonds of the city,\u2019 and that \u2018the mayor did make and execute bonds in the name of the city\u2019 to the sum of nearly $6,000,000; that they were signed by the mayor, countersigned by the controller, sealed with the corporate seal, and delivered to the commissioners. As it is not alleged that the mayor and controller constitute the legislature of the city, and it does appear that. there exist city councils, this is entirely consistent with the fact that the councils may not have ordered their issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-9\">\u201cIf the writ had asserted that the relator was the owner of certain bonds of the city, this might have been construed as an allegation that they had been issued by the city; but when the writ says that he was the owner of certain \u2018bonds of the city of Pittsburgh, issued under the said Act of Assembly,\u2019 it adds nothing to, but merely refers us to what has been set forth before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-10\">\u201c If the relator cannot assert that the bonds were issued by the city, he fails to show an obligation upon respondents to provide for the interest, and if the fact be that they were so issued, and he has failed, as we have seen, to so aver, his pleading is bad.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-11\">\u201c The same defective pleading appear-s with respect to the matter of the \u2018 funded debt \u2019 of the city. The relator finds the \u2018 duty \u2019 of councils in the enactment that they shall provide for the interest upon the funded debt, and he should have averred clearly that his bonds are part of such debt. The writ sets forth that there is in arrear, interest on his Penn Avenue bonds, and complains that councils have failed to appropriate * sufficient moneys for the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ment of the interest of the funded debt of said city, so as aforesaid in arrearsthis is wanting in the required certainty in pleading.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-6\">\u201cThe Act of 1870 was no act, until, as provided in section 25, it was \u2018approved\u2019 by councils. The writ nowhere alludes to this condition precedent, much less alleges its performance. The truth is that the action of councils was of the most informal character. This \u2018 approval \u2019 seems, to have been regarded as so unimportant a matter that the trouble was not taken to frame a resolution on the subject, and there was consequently no recording or advertising of the action, as was essential.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-7\">\u201c But the fault is not with the pleader; he has asserted all that he honestly could, and what he could honestly assert is not enough. If to demonstrate that his bonds are extraordinary in character were to prove his right to this \u2018 extraordinary remedy \u2019 the relator\u2019s task would have been an easy one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-8\">\u201cThe Penn Avenue Act of the 2d of April 1870, enacts that the owners of abutting property upon a specified part of said avenue, should elect, in a manner prescribed, five of their number to be commissioners, to control the paving and grading of such part of the avenue \u2014 the commissioners shall fill vacancies in their number, arising from the member ceasing to be an owner of abutting property, or otherwise \u2014 the commissioners shall have unlimited power to determine the kind and description of pavements, and to make contracts; such Contracts to be in the name of, and the contractor to give bond to the city. The commissioners were authorized to make requisition upon the mayor for the issue of bonds of the city, in such sums as they deemed best. It shall be the duty of the mayor to execute bonds in the name of the city, to be signed by him, countersigned by the controller, and sealed with the corporate seal; the commissioners to negotiate the bonds in such manner as they might think best, to pay the proceeds to the treasurer of the city, who should keep the same in a separate fund, and pay it out on the requisition of the commissioners. When the work was done, the commissioners were to ascertain the cost, and assess it equally per foot front on the abutting property, prepare a plot of the improvement, and schedule of assessments, give notice of time for correcting errors, make the corrections, and file the schedule in the prothonotary\u2019s office, as a lien; and the act then provides for the payment of assessments at the office of the city treasurer, and for the collection of the unpaid assessments by the city attorney; which collections were to be appropriated, under the direction of the finance committee of councils, to the payment of the interest on, and the redemption of the bonds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">\u201cIt will be seen how scrupulously the city has been excluded from every right and duty, under this act. It shall not select the commissioners, nor issue the bonds, nor control the amount of the issue, nor determine the character or cost of the pavement, nor make, nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>regulate any. contract, nor negotiate the bonds, nor receive the proceeds into its treasury, nor supervise their disbursement, nor determine whether the contracts had been properly fulfilled, nor whether the street was good or bad, nor assess the cost, nor correct the assessments, nor file the liens, nor supervise nor enforce their collection, nor receive them into its treasury when collected, nor apply them, through its officers, elected for such purposes, to the payment of bonds, or their interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-6\">\u201cIt is quite clear that the legislature meant to empower the commissioners to require the issue of bonds in the name and sealed with the seal of the city,, and to command the officers of the city as their servants, as they might require. It is equally clear that these bonds, thus issued, can bind the city no further than the legislature has disclosed, either expressly or by necessary implication, the intention that they should. It is not clear that the legislature intended they should be a debt of the city at all.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-7\">\u201c To borrow money and to issue bonds therefor are the highest acts of legislation. \u2018 Such powers do not belong to a municipal corporation as an incident of its creation. To be possessed they must be' conferred by legislation:\u2019 The Mayor <em>v. </em>Ray, 19 Wall. 475. See Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Erie &amp; Northeast Railroad Co., 9 Harris 351; Same ex rel. <em>v. </em>Allegheny County, 1 Wright 290 ; Same <em>v. </em>\u25a0Same, 7 Id. 391.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-8\">\u201c The city councils could not, under the Penn Avenue Act, have issued even one bond. It conferred no power upon them, and these bonds are solely the creature of this act. As the city authorities could not have issued these bonds, even had they so desired, and the act does not expressly or by implication declare that the city shall resort to taxation (the only implied mode of paying municipal debts), to raise one dollar to pay principal or interest, it is just to assume that the legislature did not so intend. The 1400 pages of statutes, passed in 1870, among which this act appears, do not indicate that the English language was used with such parsimony at Harrisburg that the legislature could not have spared the few words \u2022more that would have expressed this intention, had they entertained it. It would have been so very simple a matter for that body to have said that the city was to pay these bonds, and they have taken such great pains not to say it that we need not ascribe its absence to mistake.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-9\">\u201c Again: the legislature, in the manner fully set forth in the return, enacted for this city, the system of local assessments for the opening, grading and paving of <em>streets, even to the </em>extent of assessing the older parts of the city for the streets on which they abut, though these had been improved by general taxation long years before: Magee <em>v. </em>City of Pittsburgh, 10 Wright 358.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b72-10\">\u201c The Penn Avenue Act was in furtherance of this system. The locality had to bear the burden. What more reasonable than that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the citizens of the locality should control the expenditure of their own money, and as they would thereby furnish a street for the whole city, that they should have the use of the city officials and machinery to aid them. The theory of the relator, however, would reverse the entire system. It would throw a debt of millions upon the whole city for a purpose which the legislature had for years declared was a local improvement, to be paid for exclusively by the locality benefited. Such a reversal of an established system of legislation must more clearly appear, to be accepted as the intention of the legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-6\">\u201c Moreover, in establishing this system of local assessments for local benefits, the legislature, by Act of the 6th of April 1850, required the city to fund its debt, and to provide a sinking fund for its extinguishment, and therein provided by sect. 4, \u2018that it shall not be lawful for the said councils to issue, or authorize to be issued, any bonds, certificates of loan or of indebtedness, nor any other device as evidence of any indebtedness for or on account of any contract or engagement or undertaking hereinafter entered into under the authority of said councils for grading, paving, re-paving or repairing any streets, lanes or alleys in said city, or for sewerage of the same.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-7\">\u201c If this section was not repealed by the Penn Avenue Act, councils could not have issued these bonds.

If these avenue bonds are a debt of the city, and the principal or interest be paid out of the city taxes, it must be done in violation of this subsisting contract, the consideration of which has been paid by the old city.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-10\">\u201c But if the legislature did intend to bind these bonds upon the city, their power so to do is more than doubtful.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\u201cA highly respectable authority, the Illinois Supreme Court, has adjudged repeatedly upon general principles, that \u2018 no well regulated, mind can entertain the idea that it is within the constitutional competency of the legislature to compel any one of our many cities to issue its bonds, against its will, to erect a park, or for any other improvement \u2014 to force it to create a debt of millions \u2014 in effect, to compel every property owner in the city to give his bond to pay a debt thus forced upon the city:\u2019 <em>Peoplev. </em>Chicago, 51 111. 17; Marshall <em>v. </em>Silliman, 61 Id. 218. However, our own case of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Field, 8 R. F. Smith 320, holds that it is competent for the legislature to create, without the consent of the city, ministerial \u25a0 officers, who may contract a debt, of which the same legislature may compel the city to provide means of payment. But neither Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Field, nor any other case which the zeal of counsel has disclosed, has held that the legislature can authorize a few rural property holders in the outskirts of the city, representing nobody but themselves, under the pretence of making a local improvement, to absorb the highest legislative functions of the councils, representing the whole city, and to borrow money and issue bonds of the city, which shall he binding upon every taxpayer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\">\u201c It is true, according to some decisions, that municipal corporations are as subject to legislative caprice, as is clay in the hands of the potter. To say, however, that the legislature may 4 erect, change, divide, and even abolish at pleasure,\u2019 a municipal corporation, is to stop far short of saying to its people, we have permitted you to borrow money and to issue bonds through your representatives ; we will now create a power which does not represent you, which shall also issue bonds for you, and shall apply the money borrowed thereby to local and not to municipal uses. This too nearly resembles the state of things put by Black, 0. J., in the Sharpless Case, 9 Harris 169: \u2018Taxation is a mode of raising revenue for <em>public </em>purposes. . When it is prostituted to objects in no way connected with the public interests or welfare, it ceases to be taxation, and becomes plunder.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-7\">\u201c Again, the citizens of the other wards, under the provisions of the Act 16th May 1857, paid the consideration, which the legislature had declared was to give them a perpetual exemption from assessment or taxation for the improvement of other streets. To hold now that the legislature may enact that the bonds' for the grading and paving of Penn avenue shall be binding upon the whole city, and that a tax can be' levied upon the older wards to pay the interest thereon, would be to sustain a \u2018law impairing contracts.\u2019 See Society <em>v. </em>Philadelphia, 7 Casey 182; Philadelphia u.'

There are other portions which are not entitled to this security. In the latter category are these Avenue bonds, even assuming them to be debts of the city. If the term be more than an idle name, and \u2018 funded\u2019 was intended to distinguish one class of debts from all others, that must be the \u2018 funded debt,\u2019 for whose security the law has provided the greatest safeguards. In this view we must assume that the \u2018 funded debt\u2019 is that for whose payment the sinking fund was established, and the duty imposed upon councils, by express enactment, to provide ahnually for the interest, even though the city officers should go unpaid.

From the care with which it is provided that these assessments are made payable \u2018 at the office of the city treasurer,\u2019 and not even \u2018to the treasurer,\u2019 as is the phrase used, when the act speaks of payments of the proceeds of the bonds, and the designation of a special committee to see to their application, to the exclusion of the city controller, it would seem to be the design that these moneys should not go into the treasury of the city, nor under the control of the city officers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-9\">\u201c But, however this may bo, the fund thus appropriated is a trust, which could be diverted to no other use: Maenhart <em>v. </em>New Orleans, 2 Woods 108. It is not a fund provided for the reimbursement of the city, but, as the act says, \u2018 for the redemption of the bonds.\u2019 No duty was imposed upon the city to see to its collection, and no right was conferred upon the city to interest itself in the subject. From such premises it would be difficult to deduce that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the city was bound to produce still another fund, and that by taxation of those who had been studiously excluded from all duties and rights in the matter.

No objection can be urged against the Penn Avenue legislation on the ground that the improvements were made under the direction of commissioners elected for the purpose by the owners of the abutting properties: Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Field, 8 P.

L. 796, bears upon its face, the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>dence that the legislature intended a system by which the city of Pittsburgh should be enabled to extend its streets and avenues from time to time, as required for its convenience or pleasure. The immediate occasion of the passage of the act, was probably the large extension of the city limits by the Act of 1867. Said extension embraced a considerable amount of strictly rural territory, used and cultivated for the most part as farm lands. It was considered desirable, during a period of inflation, and in the midst of expanding values, to open broad avenues.for miles through these farms, to grade down hills, fill up ravines, and curb and pave the avenues in a costly manner. The Penn Avenue Act may be regarded as the result of this condition of things. We will not stop to discuss its wisdom. It is enough to say it was passed with all the forms necessary to a legal enactment, and its 25th section provides that said act should not take effect \u201cuntil the councils of the city of Pittsburgh shall have approved thereof.\u201d The city councils having approved of it, and proceeded to act under it in the opening of its avenues, the city must be held to the full measure of its legal responsibility therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Without going into unnecessary detail the principal features of the act are those providing for the election of commissioners by the owners of property abutting on the street to be improved, whose duty it is declared to be to control and superintend the grading, curbing and paving; the payment of the cost of the work from the proceeds of sales of bonds of the city; the assessment of the cost upon the abutting property, which was made payable in ten equal annual instalments, with seven per cent, interest, thereby creating a fund to be applied under the direction of the finance committee of councils, to the payment of interest on, and the redemption of the bonds. Under the system thus briefly sketched, Penn Avenue and several other streets and avenues have been graded and paved, and bonds of the city, amounting to over $5,000,000,-have been sold in the market, the proceeds paid into the city treasury, and drawn out upon the orders of the commissioners, in payment of the cost of the improvements referred to. Eor several years the city paid the interest upon these bonds with promptness, but defaulted for the year 1877, and has paid no interest since.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The relator, Henry Whelen, is the owner of $9500 of these bonds, and is the agent of several corporations and individuals, who are large holders of the same. In February 1878 he presented his petition to the court below, praying the said court to award a writ of alternative mandamus, commanding the councils of said city to show cause why they should not provide for the payment of the interest. To the writ thus granted, a majority of the councils made a return denying the liability of the city upon the bonds. The relator filed a demurrer to the return. The president judge 'of the court below, being the owner of some of the bonds, declined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>for that reason, to sit at the hearing. The remaining two judges differed in opinion. In order, however, that the case might be brought to this court, they entered judgment for the defendants, and refused the writ of peremptory mandamus. To the judgment thus entered this writ of error was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">That the writ of mandamus is a proper and appropriate remedy in such cases is settled law. We need only to refer to Commonwealth ex. rel. Hamilton <em>v. </em>The Councils of Pittsburgh, 10 Casey 496; Commonwealth ex. rel. Middleton <em>v. </em>Commissioners of Allegheny County, 1 Wright 237; Commonwealth ex. rel Armstrong v. Same, Id. 277; Von Hoffman <em>v. </em>The City of Quincy, 4 Wallace 535; Perkins et al. <em>v. </em>Slack, 5 Norris 270. The relator having selected the proper remedy it remains to be seen whether ho has shown such a case as entitles him to the writ. That the facts set forth in his petition establish a prima facie case is too clear for argument, and must prevail unless the defendants have set out such matters in their return as relieve them from responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">We need not go over in detail the grounds of defence specified in their return. They may be reduced to two heads: 1st. That the bonds issued under the Act of April 2d 1870 (Penn Avenue Act) and its supplements, do not constitute part of the funded debt of the city of Pittsburgh; that the holders of said bonds are bound to look for the payment of interest thereon, and to become duo, to the assessments made under the provisions of said act upon the properties abutting upon the streets and avenues improved; and that no authority or power has been given or delegated to the councils of the city to levy a general tax, or any tax, to pay the interest on said bonds, or to apply any moneys out of the general revenues of the city for that purpose. 2d. That the bonds in question were issued in disregard of that provision of the Constitution which limits the debt of the city; and on the requisition of commissioners, without any previous appropriation made for their payment by councils, as required by the Constitution. We will consider these propositions in the order in which they are stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">The first material question is, are the bonds in controversy the bonds of the city of Pittsburgh, apd for which the city is directly liable to the holders for the payment of both principal and interest ? That they are so in form is manifest. They purport to be the bonds of the city; are signed by the mayor and controller, countersigned by the Penn Avenue commissioners, and have the corporate seal affixed. And for the true and faithful payment of the sum of money mentioned in each bond, and the semi-annual interest thereon as aforesaid \u201cthe faith, credit and property of the city of Pittsburgh\u201d are therein solemnly pledged. So that if the bonds were issued by authority of law, upon a sufficient consideration, there can be no doubt but that they are the bonds of the city. No question has been made as to the consideration. It is not denied that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>the holders paid par for them in good money, and that the proceeds went into the city treasury. Were they issued in pursuance of law? It is admitted that they were issued under section 12 of the Penn Avenue Act, which section is as follows: \u201cFor the purpose of providing for the payment of the cost and expense of said improvements the said commissioners shall be authorized from time to time as the work progresses, to make requisition upon the mayor of the city of Pittsburgh for the issue of bonds of said city, in such sums as they deem best; and it shall be the duty of the said mayor to make and execute bonds in the name of said city to an amount not exceeding the amount of the contract price for said work, and the incidental expenses attending the same; said bonds shall be known as Penn Avenue bonds; they shall be signed by the mayor and countersigned by the controller, and sealed with the corporate seal of said city; they shall be all of the same date, and they shall be payable twelve years after date, and redeemable at any time, at the option of said city; they shall bear interest at the rate of seven per centum per annum, payable semi-annually from date, principal and interest payable at the office of the treasurer of the city of Pittsburgh ; the said bonds shall be free of taxation.\u201d Every street or avenue improved under the Penn Avenue Act and its supplements, was so improved by virtue of an ordinance of the city councils directing the grading and paving thereof in accordance with the provisions of said acts, and authorizing the election of commissioners by the owners of the abutting properties. Each bond issued by the city has a recital of the ordinance authorizing the improvement of the street or avenue for which it was issued. The contract for each improvement was made in the name of the city, and the security for the faithful performance of the work was in each instance given to the city. Here, then, we have the case of bonds issued in the name and under the corporate seal of the city, the proceeds of which went into the city treasury and were drawn out upon orders for the payment of the debts of the city, lawfully contracted in the course .of its municipal improvements. That all this was done through the interposition of a commission, amounts to nothing. That such commissions created by the legislature may lawfully bind a municipality, was expressly ruled in' the City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Field, 8 P. F. Smith 320. But these commissions, if not created by the direct action of the city councils, were certainly raised up with their consent. We need not argue that a municipal corporation may give its bond or other evidence of indebtedness for a debt lawfully contracted in the proper performance\u2019 of its municipal duties. That question is settled by Commonwealth ex rel. Reinboth <em>v. </em>The Councils of the City of Pittsburgh, <em>5 </em>Wright 378; City of Williamsport <em>v. </em>Commonwealth ex rel. Bair, 3 Norris 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">It. was urged, however, \u2022 that notwithstanding the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the bonds were issued by the city, and upon their face pledge the faith and credit of the city for their payment, yet that the holders must look for the payment of their interest to the street assessments upon the properties abutting upon the avenues. There is nothing in the case to indicate that such was the understanding or agreement of the parties at the time the bonds were sold. On the other hand, there are persuasive reasons to show that it was not. These bonds were sold at par. The 14th section of the Act of 2d April 1870, required that they should be sold at not less than par. That they could have been disposed of at par, or indeed for any considerable sum, had it been known that the holders were to look for payment to the municipal assessments upon abutting property, is a proposition too absurd for discussion. It is not alleged that the city at any time, or at any place, gave notice to anybody that these bonds, though issued by her over her corporate seal, were payable out of street assessments. It is true, each bond contained the statement that it was issued for the improvement of a certain avenue, in pursuance of the before-recited Act of 2d April 1870. It is conceded that the bondholders are bound by the terms of that act, for the reason that it is the authority upon which the bonds were issued. But I have looked in vain through the act for anything to show even a glimmering of legislative intent that the bondholder should look to the street assessments for his pay. Such a provision, if apparent upon the face of the act, must necessarily have rendered it wholly abortive. The whole plan depended upon the ability of the city to borrow the necessary amount of money. In construing this act, therefore, we are not to assume that the legislature intended to do that Avhich Avould entirely defeat the object of the act itself. We do not regard it, however, as of doubtful interpretation. It clearly makes the city responsible. By the 12th section, as well as by the express terms of the bonds themselves, the city is to pay the interest semi-annually from the date of the bonds, whereas by the 18th section, the first instalments of the assessments are not payable until the first day of October succeeding the time of the assessment. By section 16 the assessment is not to be made until after the improvement is completed; and the basis for the assessment is the amount of the bonds previously sold. By section 22 it is provided that \u201c all-moneys received from assessments shall bo appropriated, under direction of the finance committee of the councils of the city of Pittsburgh, to the payment of the interest, and the redemption of the bonds which may be issued for said improvement; if any interest shall become dub on said bonds, when there is no fund from which to pay the same, the councils of the city of Pittsburgh shall be authorized to make a temporary loan for the purpose of paying the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">Surely, it was never heard that an Act of Assembly authorized the councils of a city to make a temnorary loan to enable them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>pay money which the city did not owe. An examination of these sections, as well as the entire scope of the act, leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that the legislature did not intend that the bondholders should depend for the payment of their interest upon the street assessments. Had such been the intention of the legislature, it would have been expressly so provided. Grood faith to the bondholders required that they should have been told so in explicit terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">The system of municipal assessments is not new. It has been in use for a long time, and is well understood. Streets are being constantly paved and sewers constructed, the cost of which is by authority of the legislature assessed upon the abutting property. Yet it has never been held that the city contracting for such work can turn the contractor over to the property owners for his pay, unless he agrees to look to them for payment. The plain object of the provision in the Penn Avenue Act for the assessment of the cost of the street improvements upon the abutting properties, was to provide a fund out of which the city should be reimbursed, in whole or in part, for the outlay. The bondholders have nothing to do with it. They have no contract relation with the property owners as such, nor have they any right to enforce the payment of the assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">If the bonds in question are bonds of the city, then the duty of the city councils to include the interest as it accrues in the annual appropriation ordinance, and to provide for its payment by a levy of sufficient taxes, is clear. Section 3 of the Act of 6th April 1850, Pamph. L. 407, makes it the duty of councils to assign and appropriate the revenue of said city derivable from all sources, and in case of a deficiency, preference shall be given to the payment of the interest on the funded debt of the city. The Act of April 15th 1867, Pamph. L. 1258, removes all limitations and restrictions contained in prior Acts of Assembly, upon the power of the city to raise money by a tax levy to pay the interest upon the city debt and for other city purposes; while the tax rate is to be adjusted so as to meet the liabilities of the city. The second section of the Act of 19th of March 1873, Pamph. L. 317, provides \u201cthat the councils of the said city of Pittsburgh shall hereafter make the appropriations during the month of January or February in each and every year, in the manner prescribed by the said Act of April 6th 1850.\u201d This act (19th of March 1873) was after the Penn Avenue legislation, and after the issue of bonds thereunder had commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">A further objection was made to the bonds, that they were issued in violation of art. 9, sect. 8, of the Constitution, limiting the debt of municipal corporations. It is a sufficient answer to this to say, that the section of the Constitution referred to does not apply. It is prospective in its operation. The same remark may be made in regard to the further objection, that the bonds were issued without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>any previous appropriation made for their payment by councils, as required by the present Constitution. It appears from the return that $2,134,600 of the bonds were issued prior to the 1st of January 1874. The remainder were issued after that date. But we gather rom the record that the contracts for the improvements for which the later bonds were issued, were entered into prior to January 1st 1874. It was the contracts that increased the debt of the city. The issuing of bonds to raise money to pay the liabilities of the city under the contracts, was but the exchanging of one form of indebtedness for another. It did not increase the debt. That the sections in the Constitution invoked by the defendants do not apply to their case, we think is settled by Lehigh Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Lower Macungie Township, 31 P. F. Smith 432; Watson <em>v. </em>Chester and Delaware River Railroad Co., 2 Norris 254; Indiana County <em>v. </em>Agricultural Society, 4 Norris 357; Perkins et al. <em>v. </em>Slack, 5 Id. 270.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">We are all of opinion that the bonds in controversy are the bonds of the city of Pittsburgh, and a part of its funded debt; that they were issued by lawful authority and for a sufficient consideration; and that honor, good faith, and the law of the land alike require that the city should provide for their payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The judgment is reversed, and judgment is now entered for the relator upon the demurrer; and it is further ordered that a writ of peremptory mandamus issue to the Select and Common Councils of the city of Pittsburgh, commanding said councils to forthwith make full and ample provision for the payment of all interest now due on said bonds, and the interest as it shall become due; and further cofnmanding the said councils to assign and appropriate out of the revenue of the said city, derivable from all sources, sufficient moneys for the payment of the interest of the funded debt of said city, so as aforesaid in arrear, and to become due, giving preference, if any deficiency should arise, to the payment of said interest before the payment of salaries of city officers and the ordinary current expenses of the city.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b85-7\">Chief Justice Agnew</author>\n<p id=\"A2h\">filed the following concurring opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">I concur in the judgment of this case. I think the entire Penn Avenue Act bears conclusive evidence of the intent of the legislature that the money for the <em>immediate </em>construction of the avenue should be raised by loan on the faith and credit of the city, and then that the city should be reimbursed by assessments upon the property-holders, payable in annual instalments. The only evidence the lender of the money has for his debt is the bond of the city, and this was to be issued by the city, through her proper officers. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The law is the <em>express </em>authority for the debt, and the bond-holder had no other security. He has nothing to do with the assessment in any form, and nothing to do with its collection. It formed an inducement to make the loan, because it would put the city in the possession of the means of payment, but it was not made even as a collateral security in the hands of the lender himself. He cannot control it.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The decision in Seely\u2019s Case, 1 Norris 360, was against the legality of the assessment, on the ground that the charge per foot front was a gross and palpable violation of the taxing power, and has nothing to do with the question before us now. That pertained to the relation between the city and the property-owners \u2014 this to the relation between the city and her creditors, the lenders of the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">But the learned judge who delivered the opinion of this court refers to the Williamsport bond case as if it had some bearing on this case; and I notice that an impression is created that it has. This <em>dictum, </em>and consequent impression, make it necessary that I should distinguish this case, otherwise I could not concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">I shall not repeat what I said then, but shall merely state the points in which that case differs. There the law gave authority to issue bonds only to the sum of $200,000. The officers of the city actually issued and delivered an excess over this sum of $450,000, or $650,000 in all of negotiable bonds, and sold them at various rates of discount, from thirteen to thirty-seven per cent. This over-issue was justified upon an <em>implied </em>power to issue them in payment of debts \u2014 a doctrine in my judgment founded in no authority of law, and subversive of the right of property and the welfare of the people. It is unfounded also in any authority derived from the people, who are represented in, a <em>municipal </em>corporation, <em>a public body, </em>only to the extent that the laws creating the municipality confer power upon the officers elected to carry out the law. These laws convey the only authority of the people, whose officers are not agents, but persons elected to perform legal duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">At the time when that decision was made, the city of Philadelphia had a floating debt exceeding eleven million dollars. If by. a mere <em>implication </em>from the creation of a debt for ordinary corporate purposes, a power can be inferred to issue negotiable bonds to be sold in the market to raise money, on terms determined by the city councils, I see no reason why the councils may not, under the Williamsport decision, fund the whole of the floating debt, and as that city raises less revenue than her expenditures, why this funding process may not go on for ever, \u00f3r at least until the <em>maximum </em>allowed by the new Constitution shall be reached; or it comes into conflict with some other provision. This was the latitudinarian doctrine, to which I objected in the Williamsport case, and to which I would again object, if it were in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">This brings out as fully as I think it necessary, in a short opinion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the difference between the two cases. Here, Pittsburgh, by the Penn Avenue Act, is <em>expressly </em>authorized and commanded to issue her bonds for the money to improve the avenue. There Williams-port had authority to issue only \u00a7200,000 in city bonds, and an over-issue of \u00a7450,000 (it might have been so many millions so far as the question of power is involved), was defended on the ground of an <em>implied </em>authority. The difference is plain. Hence, 1 concur here because of the express authority of law, while I dissented there because of the want of this authority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
