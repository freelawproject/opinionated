The property was not received in the course of business as a means of making a livelihood, and does not come within the exceptions of the common-law rule: Price <em>v. </em>McCallister, 3 Grant 248 ; Cadwalader <em>v. </em>Tindall, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered, October 14th 1878,</p>\n<author id=\"b92-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aie\">The piano in this case was simply the property of a stranger, found on the demised premises, left for no purpose of trade or other purpose requiring protection, as a matter of public policy. It did not belong to or further the business of J. H. Smith, but was simply leased to his wife, at a rental, for her private benefit. The fact that the Act of Assembly of 13th May 1876 was passed to exempt pianos, melodeons and organs from levy and sale in such a case, is a legislative interpretation of the law as it stood before. We see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
