Geo. L. Ilart, president judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Washington county, called in the Hon. W. G. Hawkins, president judge of the separate Orphans\u2019 Court of Allegheny county, to hear and determine the questions involved. His honor, Judge Hawkins, after a hearing, filed an opinion and made a decree \u201cthat the proceedings in said matter be vacated and set aside from which decree Samuel Livingston took this appeal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b207-12\">Washington county is a separate judicial district, but has no separate Orphans\u2019 Court, the judge of the Court of Common.Pleas being judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court by the Act of May 19th 1874, Pamph.

Dig. 230, 231, authorizes the holding of special Common Pleas courts in any county by calling in the president judge who may reside nearest for the trial of those cases wherein the president judge of the court in which the suit is brought is incapacitated for trying through interest in the cause; where title in dispute is claimed through him ; through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>kindred to the parties; or through having been concerned as coun-' sel. By the Act of April 4tli 1843, Purd.

Dig. 2050, Pamph. L. 5, sect. 1, provides that \u201cwhenever, by reason of sickness, absence, interest or other cause, a judge of the Orphans\u2019 Court, in any judicial district in this Commonwealth, may be unable to sit in any matter depending in such court, it shall be lawful for him to call upon any other Orphans\u2019 Court judge, or judge of-any other Court of Common Pleas in this Commonwealth, to preside in and determine such matter, with the same force and effect as though he, the regularly commissioned judge of such district, if presiding, might do.\u201d \u2022 ; \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b208-7\">The question of jurisdiction was not raised in the court below, and no allusion was made to it in the paper-books furnished the Supreme Court. In the argument, however, a question as to the power of Judge Hawkins was suggested, as will appear in the following brief thereof. A like opinion was filed and judgment entered in Jane Neill\u2019s Appeal, which came up from Washington county at the same term, and in which Judge Hawkins had presided and made the decree. The same counsel were engaged in both causes.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b208-8\"><em>D. S.
