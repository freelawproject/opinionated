We cannot declare the contract fraudulent, as a matter of law, and decline saying so to-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>the jury. In our view of the question, from the face of the contract, and the proof that there were $200 and upwards paid upon it in money, or its equivalent, in the surrender of Cole's notes to McClane for borrowed money, [we cannot say, as a conclusion of law, that the contract was voluntary and without valuable consideration, and fraudulent and void. This, we think, is a question of fact, to be arrived at and determined by the jury, from all the proofs in the case, and it is therefore referred to the jury; and we say, that if the jury find, from all the evidence in the case bearing upon the questions, that Daniel Cole had, on and before the 4th of July 1868, the date of his contract of sale with the defendant, creditor or creditors, to any amount whatever, and of which he had knowledge, and that the sale of his property was made to McClane with intent to hinder, delay and defraud the creditor or creditors, the contract would be fraudulent and void.] [If, however, you do not find, from the evidence, that Daniel Cole had, on and before the 4th of July 1868, creditor or creditors known to him, and that the contract was not voluntary, and without consideration, but for a consideration, paid in part in money, and to be paid as provided in the contract as to the remainder, and not entered into with design and intent to place his property in shape to benefit himself and wife, and beyond the reach of his creditors, so as to hinder, delay and defraud creditor or creditors of their money, then the contract would not be fraudulent and void.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">[\u201c The question then on which the case turns is one of actual fraud, and this is for you to determine. We say in brief that the contract between the parties on 4th July 1868, was of the character of purchase for a valuable consideration over $200 of this consideration actually paid in hand at the execution of the contract. The contract was not voluntary, but founded on a valuable consideration, and we cannot instruct you as a conclusion of law that it was made with fraudulent intent and consequently void; but instruct you that the fraudulent intent must be shown as a matter of fact, and the burden of proof is on the plaintiff in this case, to satisfy you by evidence that Daniel Cole was knowingly indebted at the time ho made the contract, and that he made it for the purpose and with the intent to place his property beyond the reach of his creditor or creditors, and thereby to hinder, delay and defraud such creditor or creditors. If you cannot find such intent from the evidence in the case, then the contract is not void, but valid, and the defendant has good title to the land in dispute.\u201d]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">Verdict for defendant, and after judgment plaintiff took this writ and, inter alia, assigned for error the portions of the above charge noted in brackets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b219-8\"><em>D.

The question of legal fraud stands on a different footing. That may be the result of the bargain itself without any intended fraud, where the terms of the bargain upon the face of the transaction must hinder and delay creditors. It is well settled that one in debt cannot convey away all his property to his wife or children, by way of settlement merely, and without an adequate consideration. Nor can he convey his property in consideration of a. support for himself or those dependent upon him, where the effect is to deprive his creditors of the means of payment of their debts. Indeed the decisions do not stop here, for the statute of 13 Eliz. being directed against conveyances that <em>hinder and delay </em>creditors, as well as those made with a covinous intent, bargains which are not ordinary sales to pay debts, but which are unusual and tie up property out of the reach of creditors, preventing the collection of their debts in the ordinary course of law, are held to be against the statute, and therefore fraudulent in law. Thus, a sale of all a man\u2019s property to his sons on bonds, \"not due for a long time, is invalid, on the ground of hindering and delaying. In such a case, the law determines the intent to be fraud'ulent on the face of the transaction, which, on its front, shows that it must nec\u00e9ssarily prejudice the right of creditors : for otherwise it would be in the power of the debtor to impose his own terms of payment regardless of their rights : Kepner <em>v. </em>Burkhardt, 5 Barr 478; Johnston <em>v. </em>Harvy, 2 P. &amp; W. 82 ; Adlum <em>v. </em>Yard, 1 Rawle 163; Sanders <em>v. </em>Wagonseller, 7 Harris 248. In this view of the law the charge of the learned judge, which placed the case wholly on the \u25a0ground off the intentional fraud is scarcely accurate, except on the supposition that he did not consider it necessary to answer the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>positions made, because of the absence of sufficient evidence of the existence of debts at the time, to be prejudiced by the sale of Cole to MeClane. So far as the evidence is laid before us, this appears-to be so. Certainly it is too weak to require a reversal for misdirection, the transaction being entirely fair in fact. If there were evidence of actual existing debts, the evidence ought to have been furnished upon the paper-books. What we have is very small, uncertain, and stale. We discover no substantial error in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
