A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff for the amount of his claim, viz., for f&gt;7945.91; An application for a new trial was refused, and the Fourth Avenue Regular Baptist Church of Pittsburgh, and the Smithfield National Bank of Pittsburgh both sued out writs of error, assigning for error the allowance of the amendment and the refusal to charge as requested.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b124-6\"><em>Bruce $ JSfegley, W. 0.

But the amendments allowed in this case by the court below, which form the only matters complained of in the five assignments- of error, were immaterial and unnecessary. When the work of the plaintiff below was commenced, the legal title of the lot upon which the building was erected was in the First Baptist Church, against which the claim was filed. He was not bound to inquire further, or to take notice of any subsequent conveyance of the property. Doubtless he might have named the party owning the ground at the time of filing, but he was not bound to do so. Jones <em>v. </em>Shawhan, 1 W. &amp; S. 257, is in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
