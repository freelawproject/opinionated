This principle is distinctly recognised and was acted upon by this court in the case of the Baltimore and Philadelphia Steamboat Co. <em>v. </em>Brown, 4 P. F. Smith 77.</p>\n<p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b359-9\">No shipper upon reading this bill would doubt that he had received an instrument contracting for the through carriage of his goods to their point of destination, and the plaintiffs in error are bound by the writing in having held themselves out to the world as through carriers.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b359-10\">Mr. Justice Woodward</author>\n<p id=\"AkE\">delivered the opinion of the court, March 3d 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">Whether the carriers of the books consigned to the plaintiffs below undertook to deliver them at the point to which they wrere finally destined, or became responsible only for their safe conveyance to the termination of the steamship company\u2019s line, must be determined by the facts set out in the case stated and by the terms of the bill of lading. One of the facts agreed upon was that Messrs. Clyde &amp; Co. were the general managers of the Philadelphia &amp; Charleston Steamship Company. In the bill of lading the name of such a corporation did not occur, and no contract on its behalf was specifically made. On the back of the bill there was this endorsement, \u201c Attention of shippers is called to the Clyde Steam Linos.\u201d Nine different lines were then designated, of which that between Philadelphia and Charleston was one. Of all of them Messrs. Clyde &amp; Co. described themselves to be the general managers, and in no instance was there any designation by a corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>title. From the heading of the instrument the contract for the carriage of the books appears <em>to </em>have been made in the names of the defendants below on behalf of the \u201c Philadelphia and Charleston Steamship Line <em>and </em>Through Freight Line South and Southwest.\u201d The case containing the books was' marked \u201c Hubbard Bros., Collinsville, ReKalb Co., Ala., <em>via </em>Charleston.\u201d The description of the carriers and the form of address to the consignees would naturally imply a single contract for through transportation and delivery at the point of final destination.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Was there anything in the stipulation in the body of the bill of lading to subvert or overbear this natural implication, and to discharge the carriers from responsibility after delivery at the terminus of the ocean line ? \u201c One case of books, marked and numbered as per margin,\u201d were \u201c shipped by Hubbard Bros., in apparent good order on board the steamship Fanita, with leave to transfer to any other steamship, and bound for Charleston, S. C.,\u201d * * * \u201cand to be delivered in like apparent good order at'Charleston, S. 0.\u201d After providing for the protection of the carriers from liability for loss in certain specified contingencies, it was provided that the case should \u201c be delivered at the vessels\u2019 tackles at the South Carolina Railroad, and by said road be transported to destination as per marks on the articles.\u201d In substance and effect, what was this contract? The steamship company described itself not only as a \u201c Steamship Line,\u201d but as a \u201c Through Freight Line South and Southwest.\u201d It undertook to carry goods to Charleston, but it undertook the further duty of providing for their delivery to the railroad company,.and for their railroad transportation. It would be difficult to find a reason why these stipulations did not bind the carriers to convey these books from Philadelphia to Collinsville.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-8\">That railroad transportation was in contemplation is apparently clear from other clauses of the bill of lading in these words: \u201c In case any claim shall arise from any damage or injury to the articles mentioned, * * * while <em>in transitu </em>and before delivery, the extent of such damage or injury shall be adjusted in the presence of an officer of the railroad before the same are taken from the station. And the amount of the claim, when so ascertained, shall be preferred at the office of the chief of transportation of the road which shall have delivered the goods within ten days after delivery.\u201d These clauses do not apply to the demand of the plaintiffs, for their books were surrendered to H. P. Gribbs, who had no authority to receive them. But they proved that the steamship company were carriers by land as well as carriers by water. The provision that was made was for the adjustment of any claim for injury to goods, whenever and wherever occurring between the point of shipment and the point of delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">No question was raised upon the argument as to the legal rule determining the rights of the parties. It was agreed that in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>absence of stipulation by a carrier to transport freight beyond the terminus of his own route, he is not responsible for the default of those he employs to carry the remainder of the distance. And the principle of The Pennsylvania Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Berry, 18 P. F. Smith 272, was accepted that the proof of the contract should be clear. Looking at all the provisions of this bill of lading, no doubt is felt that the claim of the plaintiffs ought justly to be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">All objections to the judgment on the ground that the suit was brought against Clyde <em>&amp; </em>Co. instead of the steamship company were waived by counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
