Scott, Receiver of the National Bank of Waynesburg, from the decree of the court dismissing his exceptions to the report of the auditor appointed to make distribution of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate of Godfrey Gordon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b172-7\">The auditor found that B. E. Elenniken, who had been a member of the firm of Gordon, Campbell, Courtney &amp; Co., during a period of about six months, retired from the firm in June 1872, leaving Gordon and Campbell still members, Courtney having also retired about the same time. That Elenniken\u2019s withdrawal was entirely voluntary, with the mutual consent of the remaining partners, and with the agreement that he was to go out of the firm without profit, and that Gordon and Campbell, the remaining members were to pay the debts of the firm, including the rent of the store-room and warehouse which they had rented in December 1871, when the partnership was formed, from John Hays, in the city of Pittsburgh. That John Hays brought suits in the Common Pleas of Greene Co., Pa., to Nos. 298 December Term 1873, and 180 June Term 1874, for two quarters\u2019 rent of the store-room and warehouse, and judgments obtained against Godfrey Gordon, B. E. Campbell and B. E. Elenniken, no service being had upon Courtney. The judgment of the appellant, Scott, against Gordon was to No. 212, June Term 1875. On April 6th 1874, and January 25th 1875, respectively, Elenniken paid the two judgments of Hays, and took assignments thereof. The auditor decided that Elenniken, holding these two judgments, was entitled to be subrogated to the rights of Hays as against Gordon and Campbell, and to share in the proceeds of Gordon\u2019s property. Scott filed exceptions to this report which the court dismissed, and hence this appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-8\"><em>Wyly, Buchanan Walton, </em>for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AsS\">If Elenniken upon the facts of the case, was not entitled to subrogationj the assignments would not give him that right: Himes <em>v. </em>Keller, 3 W. &amp; S. 401; Fleming <em>v. </em>Beaver, 2 Rawle 132.
