When the red cap porter came out of the car plaintiff tipped him, and the red cap porter then left. Not finding his. bag plaintiff immediately notified .the Pullman porter and the conductor and later the conductor of the train, and they all looked for the bag, but without result.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The facts do not warrant the assumption that the bag was left in the custody of the defendant so as to make defendant liable to plaintiff as an insurer. It does not appear that the red cap porter was the servant of the defendant; the facts indicate the contrary, and the trial judge apparently so decided. Nor is it satisfactorily established that the bag was left in the car. Assuming, however, that the red cap porter left the bag in the car, plaintiff to make out his ease was required to show that his loss was sustained through defendant\u2019s negligence <em>(Goldstein </em>v. <em>Pullman Co., </em>220 N. Y. 549; <em>Hasbrouck </em>v. <em>New York Central &amp; H. R. R. R. Co., </em>202 id. 363; <em>Holmes </em>v. <em>North German Lloyd S. S. Co., </em>184 id. 280), and a finding of negligence against the defendant must be based upon the proposition that during the period of about two minutes which elapsed from the entry of the red cap porter upon the car until plaintiff entered, it was the duty of defendant\u2019s servants to have kept their eyes upon plaintiff\u2019s property; and that therefore the mere loss of the bag under the circumstances testified to made out a <em>prima facie </em>case. The ruling imposing liability on the defendant is not so rigorous. <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Pullman Co., supra, </em>552, 553. In the case cited the passenger\u2019s property disappeared during the night while the passengers were in their sleeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\"berths, at which time the sleeping car company is required to be vigilant so that the passenger may not lose his property through the company\u2019s inattention. In this ease, however, we see no basis for a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Respondent makes the point that twice plaintiff was prevented from following the red cap porter into the car, and that the loss would not have happened if the conductor had allowed him access at the same time with the porter. This is undoubtedly true; but plaintiff\u2019s passage was barred, in accordance with a reasonable regulation, to give defendant an opportunity to examine his tickets; his progress was not stopped for more than two minutes; and it could not have been reasonably anticipated that the slight delay to which\" he was subjected in common with other passengers would result in the loss of his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Judgment reversed, with thirty dollars costs, and complaint dismissed, with costs in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">McCook, J., not sitting.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Judgment reversed, with thirty dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
