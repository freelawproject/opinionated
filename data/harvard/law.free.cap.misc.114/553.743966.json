Defendants sought to prove this in support of- their contention that their initials were not intended to be nor were they understood by plaintiff to be anything other than part of the corporation signature, and not special signatures of the defendants whereby they made and intended to make themselves personally liable to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>tiff on this paper. This evidence was ruled out by the trial judge, and in my opinion this was prejudicial error which requires that the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Lehman and Mullan, JJ., concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Judgments reversed and new trial ordered, with five dollars costs in each action to appellants to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
