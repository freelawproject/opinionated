The court below decided that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the tenancy had expired and awarded the possession of the premises to the landlord.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">This conclnsion we think was error. The provision of the lease under which the landlord claims possession is a condition of the lease and not a conditional limitation. The term of the lease did not expire by the giving of the thirty days \u2019 notice. By refusing to vacate the tenant has breached a covenant which gives the landlord the right to re-enter or a suit for damages. The tenant is not a holdover until his lease has expired. Therefore summary proceedings did not lie. Re-entry can only be accomplished by an action in ejectment.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Judgment appealed from reversed, with thirty doP lars costs and petition dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">Present: Guy, Wagner and McCook, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Judgment reversed, with thirty dollars costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
