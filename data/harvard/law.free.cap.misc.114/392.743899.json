[the name under which defendant carried on business] at 41 Liberty Street, New York City, s/s Lake Beacon hereinafter known as the occupant and the Carroll, Hagon &amp; Carroll of New York, lessees and mortgagees of pier #2 North River, hereinafter known as the landlord. It is agreed as follows :\u2014 to lease the south side of pier #2, North River for an off shore berth without dock space, wharfage to commence today at 7 a. m. at the rate of $100 per day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">The hiring of an off-shore berth meant that the ship discharged its cargo off the side into lighters or scows. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The steamship <em>Beacon </em>occupied the berth about five days, for which a bill for $500 was sent to defendant, and that amount was paid by defendant. The lighters remained in the berth or slip five days longer, however, for which a bill for an additional $500 was rendered by plaintiffs to defendant, which defendant refused to pay; and it was to recover for this additional charge that the action was brought and for which the court awarded a judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Despite the fact that plaintiff\u2019s claim as pleaded was that the defendant used and occupied the pier for docking and wharfage purposes not only for the time that the steamship <em>Beacon </em>was in the slip but also for the five additional days during which the lighters remained in the slip after the departure of the <em>Beacon, </em>the trial judge refused to allow the defendant to show whether the defendant had any control over the lighters remaining at the pier after the steamship left, or whether the defendant had any connection with the owner of the cargo. The evidence thus offered by defendant was relevant to the issue whether the defendant, or the <em>Beacon, </em>had occupied the berth as pleaded, and its exclusion was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">On the back of the written agreement are certain printed conditions made a part of the contract, and one of these conditions reads: \u201c Berth is not vacated until vessel is out of slip, all merchandise removed from and pier cleaned.\u201d This clause is susceptible of the construction, which was evidently given it by the trial judge, that although none of the cargo was put on the pier, if the lighters remained in the slip after the departure of the steamship, the occupation of the lighters might be regarded as a continuance of the occupation by the steamship. And plaintiffs\u2019 counsel on the direct examination of their witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Donohue asked that witness \u201c What is the custom with regard to an off-shore berth, are lighters considered part of the ship for the transaction?\u201d to which the witness answered \u201c in this special case, yes; \u201d notwithstanding which defendant was not permitted to show the custom with reference to lighters occupying docking space. Having thus brought out the custom, as claimed, the respondents evidently conceded that the contract was ambiguous. Under the circumstances the appellant should have been permitted to show what he claimed to be the custom, and it was error to exclude that evidence. Parties who contract on a subject matter concerning which known usages prevail incorporate such usages by implication into their agreement if nothing is said to the contrary. <em>Hostetter </em>v. <em>Park, </em>137 U. S. 30. In commercial transactions incidents may be annexed to the written agreement by usage or custom.
