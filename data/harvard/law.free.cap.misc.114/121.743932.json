The trial judge thereupon dismissed the landlords\u2019 petition, stating that under chapter 942 of the Laws of 1920 the landlord can maintain summary proceedings against a tenant who is holding over only <em>\u201c </em>if this tenant is doing things that are objectionable at the time of the commencement of the proceedings.\u201d \"We have no doubt that the interpretation of the statute of the trial justice is too narrow. The statute requires the landlord to establish \u2018 \u2018 that the person holding over is objectionable,\u201d but that fact may naturally be established by evidence- of conduct at some previous time. Subsequent discontinuance of the objectionable acts and remoteness of the time when they were performed are undoubtedly factors to be considered by the jury in regard to the weight to be given to the testimony, but the trial judge had no right to withdraw the case from the jury merely because there was no evidence that the objectionable acts had continued over the summer.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The record shows that the trial judge granted the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss the petition, but no appeal lies from a dismissal of the petition until a final order has been entered thereon. The record in this case does not show that any final order was ever entered. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>.paper in the record denominated \u201cjudgment or verdict \u201d has none of the characteristics of a final order or judgment, and must be regarded as a mere nullity. The appeal must, therefore, be dismissed without costs to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Present: Guy, Lehman and Wagner, JJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">Appeal dismissed, without costs to either party.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
