In the mandamus and declaratory judgment action from which this appeal arises, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County (Evans, J.) held that such authority had been granted. We issued a writ of certiorari prior to consideration of the case by the Court of Special Appeals and, for reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">At the heart of this case is the effect of Chapter 452, Laws of 1968 upon Maryland Code (1957, 1975 Repl. Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 277, dealing with the recordation tax, and the impact upon those statutory provisions of a recent decision of this Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Chapter 452, in relevant part, added to \u00a7 277 a new subsection q which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-5\">\u201cEvery county and Baltimore City may, by resolution or ordinance duly enacted by its governing body, fix the rate of tax imposed by this subtitle. In the absence of such resolution or ordinance, the rates specified in this subtitle shall continue to apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Prior to 1957, \u00a7 277 (b), which provided that the recordation tax rate generally \u201cshall be at the rate of 55$ for each $500.00 or fractional part thereof,\u201d applied to the 23 counties and the City of Baltimore. Subsection m was initially enacted by Chapter 778 of the Laws of 1957 so as to provide that the rate in Montgomery County \u201cshall be at the rate of $1.10 for each $500 or fractional part thereof.\u201d By the close of the 1968 legislative session, seven other counties had been added to (m) by a series of amendments. Subsection n, added in 1961, applied to the City of Baltimore and three counties at the conclusion of the 1968 session. The City of Baltimore and six of the eleven counties named in (m) and (n) are among the appellees here.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Pursuant to the enactment of Chapter 452 in 1968, each of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>the political subdivisions appearing here as an appellee, the City of Baltimore and the counties of Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Charles, Dorchester, Montgomery and St. Mary\u2019s, enacted local measures establishing the rate of the recordation tax in their respective jurisdictions. The rates thus established ranged from $1.65 to $3.50, thereby exceeding in each instance the amounts fixed by either (m) or (n) of \u00a7 277 for those six counties and the City of Baltimore.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">A challenge to the recording tax rate set by Anne Arundel County precipitated the litigation which culminates in this appeal. When the Clerk of the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County refused to accept a deed offered for recordation by appellants, who were the grantors therein, because they had tendered a recording tax computed at the $1.10 rate specified in \u00a7 277 (m) rather than the $3.50 rate enacted by the county council, appellants filed a suit in the circuit court which was ultimately amended to include as defendants the Comptroller, the City of Baltimore and the Clerk of the Superior Court of Baltimore City, as well as Baltimore, Charles, Dorchester, Montgomery and St. Mary\u2019s Counties and the clerks of their respective circuit courts. After the defendants moved for summary judgment, Judge Evans filed a thoroughly considered opinion and an order granting the motion, in which he ruled that \u00a7 277 (q) was applicable to the six counties and Baltimore City, and that the local enactments in each of those political subdivisions \u201csetting the rate for the recordation tax in excess of that provided for in Article 81 Section 277 (m) and (n) are valid and have been valid since their enactment.\u201d The appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">Appellants advance several grounds for their contention that \u00a7 277 (q) does not authorize the political subdivisions enumerated in \u00a7 277 (m) and (n) to increase the recordation tax rate by local ordinance or resolution. We shall address these arguments, not all of which need be treated separately, in the course of dealing with the issues as we perceive them in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>Since all the subsections of \u00a7 277, constituting with \u00a7 278 the subtitle \u201cRecordation Tax.\u201d represent a general statutory scheme or system, they must be read and considered together to ascertain the true intention of the Legislature. <em>Thomas v. State, </em>277 Md. 314, 317, 353 A. 2d 256 (1976); <em>County Council v. Supervisor, </em>274 Md. 116, 120, 332 A. 2d 897 (1975); <em>Parker v. Junior Press Printing, </em>266 Md., 721, 725, 296 A. 2d 377 (1972). It is this rule, which we are bound to apply, that contributes to the dilemma in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Confronted by the apparent contradiction between subsections m and n, on the one hand, each of which purports to mandate fixed rates for the political subdivisions enumerated therein, and (q), on the other, permitting \u201c[e]very county and Baltimore City\u201d to fix the tax rate, the circuit court concluded, correctly in our view, that an ambiguity existed requiring for its resolution a resort to the available legislative history of Chapter 452. Appellants do not attack this conclusion, but challenge instead both the rules of statutory construction and the particular legislative history relied upon in the court below. That resort may be had to the legislative history of a statute when an ambiguity exists is a cardinal rule of construction. <em>Mackie v. Town of Elkton, </em>265 Md. 410, 415, 290 A. 2d 500 (1972); <em>Pressman v. Barnes, </em>209 Md. 544, 558-59, 121 A. 2d 816 (1956); <em>see Crim. Inj. Comp. Bd. v. Gould, </em>273 Md. 486, 495, 331 A. 2d 55 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">As the record in this case reveals, House Joint Resolution 24 of the 1967 session of the General Assembly provided for creation of a commission to conduct studies and prepare corrective legislation for various state and local taxation and fiscal problems. This action led to formation of the Joint Legislative-Executive Committee to Study Taxation and Fiscal Problems which submitted its report to the General Assembly on January 1, 1968.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting that the federal recordation tax, which theretofore had been imposed at the rate of 55&lt;f per $500, was to be discontinued as of January 1, 1968, as part of an overall federal program of excise tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>reduction, the joint committee recommended \u201cthat the counties and Baltimore City be authorized to impose a recordation tax, upon \u2018instruments of writing1 presently taxed in Maryland, <em>at such rate as each shall elect.\u201d </em>(emphasis added). A footnote to one of the exhibits attached to the report, summarizing the fiscal effects of the various recommendations, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">\u201cAlthough local governments would be authorized to elect <em>any </em>level of increase, this estimate <em>assumes </em>a 55&lt;\u00a3 for $500 increase for all \u2014 the level of the Federal tax being removed.\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">House Bill 410 of the 1968 session, implementing the committee recommendations, was introduced by the house members of the joint committee, and Senate Bill 209, ultimately enacted as Chapter 452, was introduced by the senate members of the joint committee. A comparison of the various recommendations of the joint committee with Chapter 452, which dealt with a number of tax matters in addition to the recordation tax, erases any doubt that the enactment is the very embodiment of those recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">While conceding that the report and recommendations accurately reflect the intention of the joint committee that every county and Baltimore City be authorized to impose a recordation tax at such rate as each should elect, appellants maintain that this was nevertheless not the intention of the General Assembly itself. Unquestionably, the report of the joint committee may be considered in ascertaining the legislative intent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-8\">\u201cThe history of the legislation, <em>committee reports, </em>other statutes in pari materia, and all related provisions of the same act must be considered in the construction of revenue laws.\u201d 3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction, \u00a7 66.03 (4th ed. Sands 1974) (emphasis added, footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">In short, as we have said, \u201cthe courts are not shut off from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>any discussion or sources of information available to the Legislature in order to ascertain the legislative intent.\u201d <em>Public Service Comm. v. Sun Cab Co., </em>160 Md. 476, 481, <em>[West v. Sun Cab </em>Co.] 154 A. 100 (1931). <em>Accord, Allers v. Tittsworth, </em>269 Md. 677, 683, 309 A. 2d 476 (1973) (revision commission reports considered by court).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Appellants urge, however, that there is a more accurate means of ascertaining the intention of the General Assembly. They point to the plethora of bills introduced and enacted at the 1968 session \u2014 no less than eight in number \u2014 effecting changes in \u00a7 277.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They argue that the unanimity displayed in regard to the eight bills by the committee in each house to which they were referred, and by the General Assembly itself, reflects an intention that (q) should not be operative with respect to the political subdivisions enumerated in (m) and (n). They reason that had the Legislature intended by its enactment of (q) to permit literally \u201cevery\u201d county in the state and Baltimore City to fix its own rate, the six bills simultaneously amending (m), (n), (o) and (p), which set specific rates for many of the state\u2019s political subdivisions, would have been unnecessary, that is, mere surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The argument advanced by appellants overlooks the very nature of subsection q. It is, in effect, enabling legislation, which merely permits the governing body of \u201c[e]very county and Baltimore City\u201d to fix the recordation tax rate. Neither the committees of each house nor the General Assembly itself, while considering the eight bills, could have prophesied what might subsequently occur in some, let alone all, of those political subdivisions. The Legislature clearly recognized that the governing bodies of the political subdivisions enumerated in (m) and (n) might delay local implementation of (q) or, indeed, might not opt at all for different rates under authority of the enabling legislation reflected in (q). The purpose of the amendments to (m) and (n), therefore, was to ensure that absent a local resolution or ordinance fixing the tax rates in any of the political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>subdivisions covered by (m) and (n), provision would have been made by the General Assembly for specific rates to be charged in those subdivisions. That the Legislature was cognizant of these various possibilities while enacting Chapter 452 is evident from the second sentence of (q):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">\u201c. .. In the absence of such resolution or ordinance, the rates specified in this subtitle shall continue to apply.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">An additional reason for the precaution taken by the General Assembly could have been its recognition that Chapter 452 might ultimately fail of passage at the 1968 session.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In sum, then, the General Assembly clearly intended that subsection q should apply to Baltimore City and to the counties enumerated in (m) and (n).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Stripped of its rhetoric, the thrust of appellants\u2019 argument is that our recent decision in <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. White, </em>275 Md. 314, 340 A. 2d 236 (1975), fully supports their contention that (q) does not apply to Baltimore City and the counties enumerated in (m) and (n). That case is distinguishable. There, we were confronted by the interaction between (q) and subsection r, which was enacted by Chapter 301 of the Laws of 1968. Chapter 301, the title of which states that (r) is \u201cto follow immediately after Section 277 (q),\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-9\"><em>\u201cNotwithstanding the other provisions of this section </em>the County Commissioners of Prince <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>George\u2019s County in lieu of the rate of tax provided in subsection (b) above, are authorized by resolution to adopt a rate of tax as follows: In the case of instruments conveying title to property, the tax shall be at the rate of $1.10 for each $500.00 or fractional part thereof of the actual consideration paid or to be paid; and in the case of instruments securing a debt, the tax shall be at the rate of $1.10 for each $500.00 of the principal amount of the debt secured....\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Subsequent to the enactment of Chapters 301 and 452 at the 1968 session, the County Commissioners for Prince George\u2019s County adopted a resolution pursuant to (r) setting the tax rate at $1.10, but then, acting under the authority of (q) , replaced it with a second resolution fixing the rate at $1.65. In the face of conflicting claims regarding the interplay between (q) and (r), we said in <em>White </em>that those subsections could be harmonized so as to render (r) neither superfluous nor repealed by implication. We found additional support for this result in the Legislature\u2019s express anticipation of Chapter 452 in Chapter 301, evidenced not only by the provision that (r) should obviously follow (q), but also by the opening words of (r), \u201cNotwithstanding the other provisions of this section . . . .\u201d We held, accordingly, that (r) , not (q), was controlling in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">In our decision in <em>Prince George\u2019s Co. v. White, supra, </em>however, we included the following dicta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\u201c. .. As we see it, the basic rates are set at $0.55 in subsection (b). By subsections (m), (n), (o), (p), and (r), the rates in the City of Baltimore and in 16 of the 23 counties, including Prince George\u2019s, are fixed in some other specific amount. Subsection (q), which merely allows \u2018[e]very county and Baltimore City\u2019 to fix the rate by resolution or ordinance, is presently not operative in any of those counties and the City of Baltimore.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">Appellants seize upon the last sentence to support their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>position in this case. Unfortunately for them, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">It should be clear from a glance that (q) does not bear to (m) and (n) the same relationship which it does to (r). Neither (m) \u00f1or (n), though repealed and re-enacted at the very same 1968 legislative session, includes the words found in (r), \u201cNotwithstanding the other provisions of this section,\u201d or otherwise refers to any other subsection of \u00a7 277. As we have demonstrated, (q) and (r) can be reconciled with each other while (q) vis-\u00e1-vis (m) and (n) produces an ambiguity. The statement in <em>White </em>upon which appellants rely here, however incorrect it may have been, was a mere dictum, not being necessary to a determination of the question there presented, <em>Kardy v. Shook, </em>237 Md. 524, 544, 207 A. 2d 83 (1965), and is not controlling authority for their position.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">What we have said disposes in large measure of appellants\u2019 further contention that subsections m and n, each containing the word \u201cshall,\u201d are mandatory in character. Although it is true that the word \u201cshall\u201d ordinarily imports a mandatory result, <em>Bright v. Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund Bd., </em>275 Md. 165, 169-70, 338 A. 2d 248 (1975); <em>Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, </em>272 Md. 528, 533, 325 A. 2d 718 (1974); <em>Ginnavan v. Silverstone, </em>246 Md. 500, 505, 229 A. 2d 124 (1967), this rule is not absolute. Whether a statute is to be treated as mandatory or directory must be ascertained from the provisions of the statute itself, and the word \u201cshall\u201d is not treated as signifying a mandatory intent if the context in which it is used indicates otherwise, <em>Bright v. Unsat. C. &amp; J. Fund Bd., Maryland St. Bar Ass\u2019n v. Frank, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Ginnavan v. Silverstone, </em>all <em>supra. </em>Whatever may be the mandatory tenor of (m) and (n) standing alone, they must be read, as we said earlier, together with (q). The result is that (q), by its own terms, qualifies the mandatory effect of those prior subsections. We recognized in <em>White, </em>moreover, that subsection b, which also contains the word \u201cshall,\u201d initially prescribed the basic recordation tax rate for the entire state. Since 1957, the General Assembly has established by the addition of further subsections, including (m) and (n), a different rate for Baltimore City and some but not all of the 23 counties. At no time since 1957 does it appear to have been suggested that (b) was of mandatory effect because of the word \u201cshall.\u201d Were we to treat the word \u201cshall\u201d as having a mandatory import in (m) and (n), while not doing so in regard to (b), we would be according contrary meanings to the identical word within the very same statute, a consequence which, in the absence of legislative expression, we should strive to avoid. The word \u201cshall,\u201d therefore, no more produces in (m) and (n) a mandatory effect than it does in (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">We hold that Chapter 452, enacting subsection q of \u00a7 277, authorizes the governing bodies of Baltimore City and the counties enumerated in subsections m and n to fix by local ordinance or resolution the rate of recordation tax to be paid within their respective jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">Appellants also urge that even if \u00a7 277 (q) permits Baltimore City and the counties to fix the recordation tax rate, the ordinances enacted by Baltimore City and by Baltimore and Charles Counties, though adopted after Chapter 452 was signed and though not themselves to become effective until July 1, are void because they were promulgated prior to the effective date of subsection q, July 1, 1968. Appellants argue that when political subdivisions implement legislation prior to its effective date, they act beyond their authority. They rely primarily upon an opinion of the Attorney General, 46 <em>Opinions of the Attorney General </em>199 (1961), to support their contention. There, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>took the position that the action of the Queen Anne\u2019s County Commissioners on May 29, 1961, purporting to put into effect an increase in the recordation tax rate, was unlawful because the act of the General Assembly authorizing them to do so did not become effective until June 1, 1961. The Attorney General there narrowly construed the rights and powers of the counties. We have said, on the other hand, that a county may exercise \u201cthe authority with which [it has] been expressly, or as a reasonable implication, invested by law.\u201d <em>Montgomery Co. v. Met. District, </em>202 Md. 293, 304, 96 A. 2d 353 (1953). We think that by reasonable implication Chapter 452 conferred upon the political subdivisions the power to adopt, prior to the effective date of the statute, implementing legislation which itself was not to become operative until that very same effective date.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Appellants contend, however, that to prevent ultra vires action by a county, ordinances are required to conform precisely to the enabling legislation upon which they are based. For this proposition, they cite <em>Scrivner v. Baltimore, </em>191 Md. 165, 169, 60 A. 2d 190 (1948), <em>Consolidated Diesel Elec. Corp. v. City of Stamford, </em>156 Conn. 33, 238 A. 2d 410, 411-12 (1968), <em>Mastrangelo v. Buckley, </em>433 Pa. 352, 250 A. 2d 447, 452-53 (1969), and <em>Taylor v. Abernathy, </em>422 Pa. 629, 222 A. 2d 863, 865 (1966). Those cases, however, involved discrepancies between the substantive aspects of the enabling and implementing legislation and are thus readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">One of the recognized purposes in providing that a statute become effective on some future date, rather than upon the signing of the bill, is \u201cto allow the government time to establish machinery\u201d for enforcement of the act. 2 Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 33.07 (4th ed. Sands 1973). Here, the counties properly utilized the time before July 1 to establish appropriate tax rates. They did not, however, collect the recordation tax at the increased rates until July 1, which by law, Code (1957, 1973 Repl. Vol.) Art. 19, \u00a7 35, is the beginning of their fiscal year. Appellants maintain also that to enact an implementing ordinance prior to the effective date of the enabling legislation- defeats <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>another objective, \u201cto inform persons of the provisions of a statute ... in order that they may take steps to protect their rights and discharge their obligations.\u201d 2 Sutherland, Statutory Construction \u00a7 33.07 (4th ed. Sands 1973). They claim that as a result of the action by the local units prior to July 1, the citizens of those subdivisions were unable to make their views on the ordinances known to their local governing bodies. We are not persuaded by this argument. Appellants conceivably had more notice of the ordinances prior to the effective date than they might have been afforded had the counties and the City of Baltimore waited until July 1 before acting. Nor did the local ordinances in any manner curtail appellants\u2019 right to petition Chapter 452 to referendum pursuant to Art. XVI, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2 of the Maryland Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">The Supreme Court, under circumstances perhaps more compelling than those present here, rejected in <em>Druggan v. Anderson, </em>269 U. S. 36, 46 S. Ct. 14, 70 L. Ed. 151 (1925), a contention that parallels appellants\u2019 position in this case. Contesting a refusal to issue a writ of habeas corpus, Druggan argued that the National Prohibition Act was void because it was enacted before the prohibition was placed in effect, although after the Eighteenth Amendment had been ratified. The Court, speaking through Mr. Justice Holmes, perceived the ratification as a present grant of power and held that the Constitution may give Congress \u201ca present power to enact laws intended to carry out constitutional provisions for the future when the time comes for them to take effect.\u201d 269 U. S. at 39. <em>See also </em>Annot., 171 A.L.R. 1070, 1075-78 (1947). We hold that the enactment of Chapter 452 on May 7, 1968, the date on which it was signed by the governor, granted to the local authorities a present power to enact ordinances in preparation for increasing the tax rate on July 1,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The result we reach here makes it unnecessary for us to pass on appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellants to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\">.

Vol.) Art. 81, \u00a7 277, as they provided following the 1968 session of the General Assembly, are relevant to this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-9\">\u201c(b) <em>Instruments conveying title or securing debts. </em>\u2014 In the case of instruments conveying title to property, the tax shall be at the rate of 55$ for each $500.00 or fractional part thereof of the actual consideration paid or to be paid; in the case of instruments securing a debt, the tax shall be at the rate of 55$ for each $500.00 of the principal amount of the debt secured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-10\">\u201c(m) <em>Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Dorchester, Garrett, Montgomery, St. Mary\u2019s and Wicomico counties. </em>\u2014 The rate of tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>applicable to instruments recorded with the clerk of the circuit court for Baltimore, Montgomery, St. Mary\u2019s, Wicomico, Allegany, Garrett, Dorchester, and Anne Arundel counties shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-9\">\u201cIn the case of instruments conveying title to property, the tax shall be at the rate of $1.10 for each $500 or fractional part thereof of the actual consideration paid or to be paid; in the case of instruments securing a debt, the tax shall be at the rate of $1.10 for each $500 of the principal amount of the debt secured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-10\">\u201c(n) <em>Baltimore City and Calvert, Charles and Worcester counties. </em>\u2014 The rate of tax applicable to instruments recorded with the clerk of the Superior Court of Baltimore City and with the clerk of the circuit court for Charles, Calvert and Worcester counties shall be as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-11\">\u201cIn the case of instruments conveying title to property, the tax shall be at the rate of $1.65 for each $500 or fractional part thereof of the actual consideration paid or to be paid; in the case of instruments securing a debt, the tax shall be at the rate of $1.65 for each $500 of the principal amount of the debt secured.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b437-7\">. The report of the Joint Legislative-Executive Committee was entitled \u201cNext Steps in Tax Reform in Maryland.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b439-6\">. Apart from the enactment of subsections q and r, six amendments were made to (m), (n), (o) and (p).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\">. As further evidence of the legislative intention that (q) should apply to the political subdivisions enumerated in (m) and (n), appellees point to the enactment of Chapter 129, Laws of 1976, which they also say, by motion to dismiss, renders this appeal moot. Chapter 129 and Chapter 142, a companion measure, were enacted as emergency legislation in obvious response to our recent decision in Prince George\u2019s Co. v. White, 275 Md. 314, 340 A. 2d 236 (1975). In a word, they appear designed to establish once and for all that (q) applies literally to the City of Baltimore and the 23 counties and to ratify and confirm <em>retroactively </em>the recordation rate fixed by any local resolution or ordinance of Baltimore City or the 23 counties becoming effective on or after July 1,1968, notwithstanding a different rate specified for such political subdivision in any subsection of \u00a7 277. Because we have found, for the reasons given above, what the legislative intention was respecting Chapter 452, we need not rely on Chapters 129 and 142 for that purpose.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b442-6\">. It might be well to note that unlike here, the record in <em>White </em>included neither the committee recommendations nor the report to which we have referred, undoubtedly because it was recognized that (q) vis-a-vis (r) did not present an ambiguity. The position of Prince George\u2019s County in <em>White, </em>as we there indicated, was simply that (r) was intended to apply only if (q) never became law. As noted above, we rejected this argument because we determined that there had been no implied repeal of (r). Although Prince George\u2019s County, in <em>White, </em>referred to the committee report for the first time in its <em>motion </em>for reargument, inclusion of the report in the record itself would not have produced a different result in that case because, as we have said here, it was inappropriate to resort there to the legislative history of Chapter 452.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
