Murphy, C. J., and Eldridge, J., concur in the judgment and Murphy, C. J., filed a concurring opinion in which Eldridge, J., concurs at page 119 <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Generally speaking, this case involves the question of what information the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires state trial courts to obtain from defendants who plead guilty to criminal charges in order to ensure that the record reflects that they do so voluntarily and intelligently. More precisely, we are faced here with the issue of whether that provision of the Constitution, with special reference to its interpretation in <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U. S. 238, 242-44, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 1711-12, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), obliges state trial judges, on the record, to both specifically inform such defendants of their privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and obtain from them a proper waiver of this right before accepting a guilty plea. Because we think no individual reference to or waiver of that right is required, and because we think the record in this case establishes that the confession of guilt made by the petitioner, Lloyd Franklin Davis, Jr., was entered voluntarily and intelligently, we shall affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The factual background of this case merits only brief recitation as it is undisputed and relatively simple. After being charged with nine counts of burglary, pleading not guilty and requesting a jury trial, the petitioner was scheduled to be tried in the Circuit Court for Allegany County (Naughton, J.) on April 22, 1974. On that day, following plea negotiations, counsel for Davis informed the court that the petitioner wished to enter pleas of guilty to three of the counts; whereupon the State\u2019s Attorney replied that if the pleas were accepted by the court the prosecution would stet the remaining six counts. Judge Naughton then engaged in the following colloquy with Davis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-7\">\u201cBY THE COURT: Stand please, Mr. Davis. Mr. Davis, in order to make certain that you are entering your pleas of guilty to these three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>counts willingly, freely, knowingly and with some degree of intelligence, it is necessary that I ask you a few questions and determine that fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-5\">Now would you please state your full name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-6\">MR. DAVIS: Lloyd Franklin Davis, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-7\">BY THE COURT: Are you able to hear my questions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-8\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-9\">BY THE COURT: And are you now under the influence of any alcohol, drugs, narcotics or pills of any kind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-10\">MR. DAVIS: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-11\">BY THE COURT: Are you represented by an attorney in this case, and if so is he present with you at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-12\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-13\">BY THE COURT: And what is his name?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-14\">MR. DAVIS: Mr. Robb.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-15\">BY THE COURT: Now have you been furnished with a copy of the information filed in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-16\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-17\">BY THE COURT: And have you read the information and discussed it with your attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-18\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-19\">BY THE COURT: Do you fully understand the three charges to which you have entered pleas of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-20\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b139-21\">BY THE COURT: Now the charges that you\u2019ve entered pleas of guilty to are burglary, three counts of burglary, each being a felony for which this Court could give you twenty years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>in prison on each charge, or a total of sixty years. Do you understand that, Mr. Davis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">BY THE COURT: Now has anyone promised you that I would go easy on you if you entered pleas of guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">MR. DAVIS: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">BY THE COURT: Any promises or threats been made to induce you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">MR. DAVIS: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-10\">BY THE COURT: You understand that if you plead not guilty that at the trial the State would have to produce witnesses against you in open court, and that you would have the right through your attorney to cross-examine all of them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-11\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-12\">BY THE COURT: <em>Do you also understand if you plead not guilty you would not have to take the witness stand in your own defense unless you desired to do .so, and if you did not take the stand the prosecuting attorney may not comment or make reference to your failure to testify?</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-13\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-14\">BY THE COURT: Do you understand that? Do you also understand that if you plead not guilty that you have the right to trial by a Jury or by the Court without a Jury, the choice would be yours? At the trial you would be presumed innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-15\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-16\">BY THE COURT: Now I have recited to you certain constitutional rights which you have as a defendant in a criminal case. Do you understand that by pleading guilty you are in fact waiving these rights?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-17\">MR. DAVIS: Yes sir/\u2019 (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ahp\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>Having by this inquiry ascertained to his satisfaction that the petitioner was acting voluntarily and intelligently, Judge Naughton accepted the defendant\u2019s guilty plea; subsequently, the court sentenced Davis to prison for three consecutive five-year terms. On appeal these convictions were affirmed by a divided panel of the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Davis v. State, </em>28 Md. App. 50, 343 A. 2d 550 (1975). We granted certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Davis asserts \u2014 relying on <em>Boykin v. Alabama, supra, </em>and four decisions of the Court of Special Appeals which interpret that case to hold that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires state trial judges to specifically inform defendants of the essential elements of their privilege against compulsory self-incrimination before accepting their guilty pleas \u2014 that the information imparted to him \u201cwas patently inadequate\u201d to fulfill this requirement. <em>See English v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 439, 298 A. 2d 464, <em>cert. granted, </em>268 Md. 748 (1973), <em>cert. dismissed as improvidently granted, </em>July 3, 1973; <em>Williams v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 570, 271 A. 2d 777 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 730 (1971); <em>McCall v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 191, 263 A. 2d 19, <em>cert. denied, </em>258 Md. 729 (1970); <em>Silverberg v. Warden, </em>7 Md. App. 657, 256 A. 2d 821 (1969). Specifically, and as he phrases it, the petitioner points out that he \u201cwas not advised that if he elected to stand trial on a plea of not guilty he could not be compelled by the State to testify against himself,\u201d and \u201che was not apprised that if he elected to exercise his privilege against self-incrimination the trier of fact could draw no inference of guilt from his failure to testify,\u201d but rather, he was only \u201cinformed that if he pleaded not guilty he could refrain from testifying <em>in his own defense </em>and that <em>the prosecutor could not comment </em>on his failure to testify.\u201d Consequently, Davis reasons that since \u201cthe record failed to affirmatively show [he] had an intelligent understanding of this privilege and waived it in the constitutional sense,\u201d his guilty plea cannot stand. On the other hand, the State asserts that the trial court is not required to adhere to any particular litany when interrogating such a defendant, but instead the only requirement is that the record demonstrate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>that the accused entered his confession of guilt voluntarily and intelligently. In order for us to resolve this controversy, it will perhaps be helpful if we briefly review the development of the prerequisites for the acceptance of guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">This Court first embraced a standard for the acceptance of confessions of guilt in criminal causes in <em>Lowe v. State, </em>111 Md. 1, 15, 73 A. 637 (1909), wherein we quoted with approval the following passage from 19 Encyclopaedia of Pleading and Practice 437:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201c[The trial court must see to it that the guilty pleal is made by a person of competent intelligence, freely and voluntarily, and with a full understanding of its nature and effect, and of the facts on which it is founded.\u201d (Emphasis deleted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">In <em>Lowe </em>our predecessors held that the judgment of conviction was improperly entered because the record did not reflect compliance with this standard. <em>Lowe v. State, supra, </em>111 Md. at 15-20. In the cases which followed, however, this Court was more reluctant to make a finding on a barren record that a guilty plea had not been properly entered. Thus, when the facts before the Court of Appeals were insufficient for a determination of the issue, <em>see State v. Darling, </em>130 Md. 251, 254, 100 A. 91 (1917); <em>cf. State v. Stafford, </em>160 Md. 385, 390, 153 A. 77 (1931), or when the record merely disclosed that the accused was represented by counsel and was capable of participating in his own defense, the acceptance of the confession of guilt was sustained \u201calmost as a matter of course.\u201d <em>James v. State, </em>242 Md. 424, 428, 219 A. 2d 17 (1966); <em>see Cooper v. State, </em>231 Md. 248, 253, 189 A. 2d 620 (1963); <em>Brown v. State, </em>223 Md. 401, 164 A. 2d 722 (1960) (per curiam); <em>Jones v. State, </em>221 Md. 141, 144, 156 A. 2d 421 (1959). Those cases reflect the views of this Court until 1966, when in two cases, <em>James v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Owens v. State, </em>243 Md. 719, 222 A. 2d 838 (1966) (per curiami, we implied that the voluntary and intelligent nature of guilty pleas'need be clearly established in the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>court before they are accepted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Until now, we have had no occasion to address these issues sine <em>&amp; James </em>and <em>Owens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Over this same span of time the courts of our sister states were confronted with the identical problem and developed an extensive body of law with respect to the requirements for the acceptance of guilty pleas. <em>See In re Tahl, </em>1 Cal. 3d 122, 126-27, 460 P. 2d 449, 452, 81 Cal. Rptr. 577, 580 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U. S. 911 (1970). By statute, court rule or case law, a number of these states required, in general, that before a trial court accepted a confession of guilt it had to be convinced that the plea was offered freely and voluntarily, and that the defendant understood the nature of the charge, the consequences of his plea and that he was waiving various constitutional rights. <em>Id. See, e.g., People v. Mendez, </em>27 Cal. 2d 20, 161 P. 2d 929, 930 (1945); <em>People v. Doyle, </em>20 Ill. 2d 163, 169 N.E.2d 250, 251-52 (1960); <em>People v. Bumpus, </em>355 Mich. 374, 94 N.W.2d 854, 855, 857 (1959); <em>Rudolph v. State, </em>32 Okla. Crim. 265, 240 P. 761, 762-63 (1925). <em>See generally </em>Annot., 97 A.L.R.2d 549 (1964). In order to determine whether there had been compliance with the applicable standard, courts usually looked to the totality of the circumstances as reflected in the entire record. <em>In re Tahl, supra, </em>1 Cal. 3d at 127, 460 P. 2d at 452, 81 Cal. Rptr. at 580. <em>See, e.g., People v. Doyle, supra, </em>169 N.E.2d at 252; <em>People v. Bumpus, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In 1969 the Supreme Court of the United States demonstrated a keen interest in the prerequisites for a trial court\u2019s acceptance of guilty pleas \u2014 first with regard to federal trial courts in <em>McCarthy v. United States, </em>394 U. S. 459, 89 S. Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418 (1969), and then with respect to state trial courts in <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U. S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969). In <em>McCarthy </em>the Supreme Court held that Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure required that a confession of guilt be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>set aside because the district judge, contrary to the dictates of the rule, accepted the guilty plea without addressing the defendant personally to determine whether he understood the nature of the charge and without ascertaining that there was a factual basis for the plea. 394 U. S. at 463-72, 89 S. Ct. at 1169-74. In the course of so holding, Chief Justice Warren, for the Court, noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-5\">\u201cA defendant who enters [a guilty plea] simultaneously waives several constitutional rights, including his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, his right to trial by jury, and his right to confront his accusers. For this waiver to be valid under the Due Process Clause, it must be \u2018an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege.\u2019 Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Consequently, if a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is not equally voluntary and knowing, it has been obtained in violation of due process and is therefore void. Moreover, because a guilty plea is an admission of all the elements of a formal criminal charge, it cannot be truly voluntary unless the defendant possesses an understanding of the law in relation to the facts.\u201d <em>McCarthy v. United States, supra, </em>394 U. S. at 466, 89 S. Ct. at 1171 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Two months later, in <em>Boykin, </em>the Supreme Court addressed the question of what minimum requirements are imposed by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment with regard to the acceptance of guilty pleas in state courts. The defendant in <em>Boykin </em>pled guilty to five indictments for robbery; however, so far as the appeal record indicated, the trial judge asked no questions of the accused concerning his plea, nor did the defendant address the court. Pursuant to the Alabama procedure calling for a jury determination of punishment, the accused was, as then permitted by that state\u2019s law, sentenced to death on each of the five indictments. Justice Douglas, speaking for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>majority, found reversible error because the record did not affirmatively disclose that the defendant voluntarily and understanding^ entered his pleas of guilty. <em>Id. </em>at 242, 244, 89 S. Ct. at 1711, 1713. If that, the strict holding of the case, had been all that <em>Boykin </em>contained, there is little chance the opinion would have led anyone to conclude that it had substantially altered the procedures for the acceptance of guilty pleas which then existed in most state courts. However, the opinion also contained the following paragraph, drawn from <em>McCarthy, </em>which has led some to conclude that <em>Boykin </em>had a much broader meaning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-5\">\u201cSeveral federal constitutional rights are involved in a waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered in a state criminal trial. First, is the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and applicable to the States by reason of the Fourteenth. Second, is the right to trial by jury. Third, is the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. We cannot presume a waiver of these three important federal rights from a silent record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243, 89 S. Ct. at 1712 (citations omitted). <em>See in addition id. </em>at 243 n. 5, 89 S. Ct. at 1712 n. 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Justice Harlan, joined by Justice Black, dissented in <em>Boykin </em>on the ground that the majority had taken a wholly unprecedented and unfounded step:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201cSo far as one can make out from the Court\u2019s opinion, what is now in effect being held is that the prophylactic procedures of [Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure] are substantially applicable to the States as a matter of federal constitutional due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 247, 89 S. Ct. at 1714.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The Supreme Court of California, about five months later, in the case of <em>In re Tahl, </em>1 Cal. 3d 122, 460 P. 2d 449, 81 Cal. Rptr. 577 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>398 U. S. 911 (1970), interpreted <em>Boykin </em>to require state trial courts to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>from defendants who plead guilty a specific on-the-record waiver of the three constitutional rights Justice Douglas had enumerated. The Court explained its position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-5\">\u201c[E]ach of the three rights mentioned \u2014 self-incrimination, confrontation, and jury trial \u2014 must be specifically and expressly enumerated for the benefit of and waived by the accused prior to acceptance of his guilty plea. .. . While the <em>Boykin </em>text contains no such requirement in express terms, we believe it is not only a fair inference from the opinion \u2014 especially in light of the court\u2019s references therein to the recently strengthened federal guidelines (see McCarthy v. United States (1969) supra, 394 U.S. 459, 89 S.Ct. 1166, 22 L.Ed.2d 418) \u2014 but it is the only realistic means of assuring that \u2018the judge * * * leaves a record adequate for any review that may be later sought.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201cThis does not require the recitation of a formula by rote or the spelling out of every detail by the trial court. It does mean that the record must contain <em>on its face </em>direct evidence that the accused was aware, or made aware, of his right to confrontation, to a jury trial, and against self-incrimination, as well as the nature of the charge and the consequences of his plea. Each must be enumerated and responses elicited from the person of the defendant. Because mere inference is no longer sufficient, the presence of an attorney cannot alone satisfy these requirements; as noted, the defendant in <em>Boykin </em>was represented by counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 460 P. 2d at 456,81 Cal. Rptr. at 584 (footnote omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">A number of other courts quickly followed California\u2019s lead. <em>See, e.g., Purvis v. Connell, </em>227 Ga. 764, 182 S.E.2d 892, 894 (1971); <em>State v. Abodeely, </em>179 N.W.2d 347, 351-52 (Iowa 1970), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>402 U. S. 936 (1971); <em>People v. Jaworski, </em>387 Mich. 21, 194 N.W.2d 868, 869-72 (1972); <em>State v. Guy, </em>81 N. M. 641, 471 P. 2d 675, 677 (1970); <em>Nachtigall v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number><em>Erickson, </em>85 S. D. 122, 178 N.W.2d 198, 200-01 (1970); <em>cf United States ex rel. Curtis v. Zelker, </em>466 F. 2d 1092, 1102 (2d Cir. 1972) (dictum), <em>cert. denied, </em>410 U. S. 945 (1973); <em>State v. Laurino, </em>106 Ariz. 586, 480 P. 2d 342 (1971); <em>State v. Bugbee, </em>161 Conn. 531, 290 A. 2d 332 (1971). <em>See generally J. Bond, Plea Bargaining and Guilty Pleas </em>\u00a7 3.08[1], at 90-92 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Similarly, this State\u2019s Court of Special Appeals, at least until its decision in the case at bar, interpreted <em>Boykin </em>in the same manner as California. In <em>McCall v. State, supra, </em>9 Md. App. at 198-99, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">\u201cThe precise holding in <em>Boykin </em>was that it was error for the state trial judge to accept a plea of guilty without an affirmative showing on the record that it was intelligent and voluntary. [395 U. S. at 242,] 89 S. Ct. at 1711. As we have stated, this was the law of this State prior to the <em>Boykin </em>opinion. <em>See Duvall v. State, </em>[5 Md. App. 484, 487, 248 A. 2d 401 (1968)]. But while we have recognized generally that federal constitutional rights were involved in the waiver that takes place when a plea of guilty is entered, what <em>Boykin </em>did was to specify three such rights which are among those so involved. They are: (1) the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination; (2) the right to trial by jury; and (3) the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. Although other federal constitutional rights are also involved, <em>Boykin </em>made clear that if the record does not affirmatively show that a defendant had an intelligent understanding that he possessed each of these specified rights and voluntarily waived them, the acceptance of a plea of guilty would not be effective in any event.\u201d <em>Accord, English v. State, supra, </em>16 Md. App. at 442; <em>Williams v. State, supra, </em>10 Md. App. at 572; <em>see Silverberg v. Warden, supra, </em>7 Md. App. at 658-59.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">Then, in <em>English v. State, supra, </em>16 Md. App. at 446, that court set forth with great particularity what it believed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>constitutionally necessary to constitute a valid waiver of the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201c[I]n order for an accused to waive the privilege . . . as it applies to his trial on a criminal charge he must understand that he has the right not to testify and that no unfavorable inference may arise from his not testifying. Unless the record affirmatively shows that he understood this privilege and waived it in the constitutional sense, acceptance of his plea of guilty is not effective.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Davis, of course, relies on <em>English, Williams, McCall, </em>and <em>Silverberg, </em>as well as on the decisions of other courts which construe <em>Boykin </em>to require a specific on-the-record reference to and waiver of the three rights that Justice Douglas listed. We, however, are unable to accede to this interpretation of <em>Boykin. </em>Our position is based on our own reading of <em>Boykin </em>and subsequent Supreme Court cases, as well as on the rejection of the petitioner\u2019s contention both by the vast majority of state courts and by all of the federal courts of appeal which have considered the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">As we have already pointed out, the <em>Boykin </em>decision itself was rendered in the context of a trial record totally silent with respect to whether the guilty plea was voluntary and intelligent, and thus the Supreme Court could not rule on the sufficiency of anything other than a barren record. After scrutinizing the language employed by Justice Douglas, we conclude that <em>Boykin </em>does not stand for the proposition that the due process clause requires state trial courts to specifically enumerate certain rights, or go through any particular litany, before accepting a defendant\u2019s guilty plea; rather, w.e think <em>Boykin </em>merely holds that the record must affirmatively disclose that the accused entered his confession of guilt voluntarily and understandingly. Cases decided by the Supreme Court after <em>Boykin </em>do not indicate otherwise, nor do they themselves mandate express individualized references to and waivers of the particular rights mentioned by Justice Douglas. <em>See generally </em>Bishop, <em>Guilty Pleas in Wisconsin, </em>58 Marq. L. Rev. 631, 635 (1975). Meritin'g our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>particular attention in this regard is <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), a case decided shortly after <em>Boykin </em>in which the Court upheld an accused\u2019s guilty plea, citing <em>Boykin, </em>on the ground that it was \u201cvoluntary\u201d and \u201cintelligent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747-48, 90 S. Ct. at 1468-69. The Court in a footnote strongly intimated that the fears expressed in Justice Harlan\u2019s dissent in <em>Boykin </em>were groundless:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201cThe requirement that a plea of guilty must be intelligent and voluntary to be valid has long been recognized. . . . The new element added in <em>Boykin </em>was the requirement that the record must affirmatively disclose that a defendant who pleaded guilty entered his plea understanding^ and voluntarily.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 747 n. 4,90 S. Ct. at 1468 n. 4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Moreover, nowhere in <em>Brady </em>or the two related cases decided the same day did the Court indicate or imply that specific articulation of the three rights set forth in <em>Boykin </em>was required. <em>See Parker v. North Carolina, </em>397 U. S. 790, 90 S. Ct. 1458, 25 L.Ed.2d 785 (1970); <em>McMann v. Richardson, </em>397 U. S. 759, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 25 L.Ed.2d 763 (1970). To like effect is <em>North Carolina v. Alford, </em>400 U. S. 25, 31, 91 S. Ct. 160, 164, 27 L.Ed.2d 162 (1970), decided but a year after <em>Boykin, </em>wherein the Court by negative implication again indicated that <em>Boykin </em>did not represent a substantial departure from its prior views with respect to the acceptance of guilty pleas:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-7\">\u201cThe standard was and remains whether the plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action open to the defendant. See <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 1711, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969); <em>Machibroda v. United States, </em>368 U.S. 487, 493, 82 S.Ct. 510, 513, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); <em>Kercheval v. United States, </em>274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009 (1927).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">As in <em>Brady, </em>there is no language in <em>Alford </em>referring to an express enumeration of the three constitutional rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>mentioned in Boykin; similarly, no decisions of the Supreme Court subsequent to <em>Alford </em>indicate otherwise. <em>See Henderson v. Morgan, </em>96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U. S. 258, 93 S. Ct. 1602, 36 . L.Ed.2d 235 (1973); <em>Fontaine v. United States, </em>411 U. S. 213, 93 S. Ct. 1461, 36 L.Ed.2d 169 (1973) (per curiam). <em>But see Johnson v. Ohio, </em>419 U. S. 924, 95 S. Ct. 200, 42 L.Ed.2d 158 (1974) (Douglas, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., dissenting from denial of petition for certior\u00e1ri on the ground that <em>Boykin </em>established that trial courts must obtain from defendants pleading guilty a specific and knowing waiver of the three enumerated rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Many courts, both federal and state, have reached the same conclusion as to Boykin\u2019s meaning. Agreeing that the issue is whether the record affirmatively shows that the guilty plea is voluntary and intelligent, all seven of the federal courts of appeals which have addressed the question have held that <em>Boykin </em>does not require specific reference to and waiver of the three rights highlighted by Justice Douglas. <em>See, e.g., Fontaine v. United States, </em>526 F. 2d 514, 516 (6th Cir. 1975); <em>Roddy v.

Ternullo, </em>510 F. 2d 844, 845 &amp; n. 1 (2d Cir. 1975) (reserving judgment). Similarly, a majority of the state courts which have ruled on this issue have taken the identical position with regard to <em>Boykin. See, e.g., Barrett v. State, </em>544 P. 2d 830, 832-34 (1975), <em>aff'd on rehearing, </em>546 P. 2d 161 (Alas. 1976); <em>Hall v. State, </em>273 So. 2d 90 (Dist. Ct. App. Fla. 1973) (per curiam); <em>Commonwealth v.

Finally, we think it particularly significant that several states which had at first concluded that <em>Boykin </em>required a specific enumeration and waiver of the three rights have since retreated from that stance and have now joined the increasing number of courts holding otherwise. <em>Compare People v. Jaworski, </em>387 Mich. 21, 194 N.W.2d 868, 869-72 (1972) <em>with People v. Kuchulan, </em>390 Mich. 701, 213 N.W.2d 95 (1973); <em>Higby v.

Williker, </em>107 Ariz. 611, 491 P. 2d 465, 468 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Since the decisions of this Court have long required guilty pleas to be entered voluntarily and intelligently, <em>Boykin, </em>as we interpret it, does not change the law as heretofore announced by this Court with regard to the acceptance of confessions of guilt except to command that the \u25a0 record affirmatively reflect what we had already mandated. Examining the facts of the present case in light of what we have just said, we hold that Davis\u2019 guilty plea was properly entered because, as demonstrated by the colloquy previously quoted, the record taken as a whole affirmatively discloses that the petitioner\u2019s plea was, as found by the trial judge, voluntary and intelligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Beyond the constitutional minimum inquiry, however, we encourage trial judges to engage those persons seeking to enter guilty pleas in a dialogue as detailed as time, resources and circumstances permit. Such an on-the-record colloquy should insure beyond cavil that the plea is properly entered, and thus insulate it from successful direct or collateral attack. For suggested approaches, <em>see, e.g., Call v. McKenzie, </em>W. Va., 220 S.E.2d 665, 670-71 (1975); <em>Fed. R. Crim. P. </em>11; ABA Project on Standards for Criminal Justice, The Function of the Trial Judge \u00a7 4.2 (Tent. Draft, June 1972); Bishop, <em>Guilty Pleas in Wisconsin, </em>58 Marq. L. Rev. 631, 654-58 (1975); Bishop, <em>Waivers in Pleas of Guilty, </em>60 F.R.D. 513, 532-38 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. We hasten to add that these cases specifically rejected any intention to require the trial judge to follow any set ritual when accepting a guilty plea. <em>See </em>Owens v. State, 243 Md. 719, 721, 222 A. 2d 838 (1966) (per curiam); James v. State, 242 Md. 424, 428, 219 A. 2d 17 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b150-6\">. As distinguished from the case now before us, in which the defendant argues that his guilty plea was not entered voluntarily and intelligently because he did not understand the nature of one of the constitutional rights he was waiving by pleading guilty, in the recent case of Henderson v. Morgan, 96 S. Ct. 2253, 49 L.Ed.2d 108 (1976), the defendant contended that his guilty plea was not entered voluntarily and intelligently because he did not understand the nature of the charge to which he was pleading guilty (second-degree murder). The Supreme Court, in <em>Morgan, </em>under the somewhat unusual facts of that case, accepted the accused\u2019s assertion, holding that because the requisite intent of the crime, which it characterized as \u201ca critical element of the offense of second-degree murder,\u201d was not explained to the defendant, his guilty plea was involuntary. <em>Id. </em>at 2258. In the course of so holding, the Court made the following statement, which we think lends some support to the position we have taken in the case at bar:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201cInstead of testing the voluntariness of a plea by determining whether a ritualistic litany of the formal legal elements of an offense was read to the defendant, [the state] argues that the court should examine the totality of the circumstances and determine whether the substance of the charge, as opposed to its technical elements, was conveyed to the accused. <em>We do not disagree with the thrust of [the state\u2019s] argument, </em>but we are persuaded that even under the test which [it] espouses, this judgment finding respondent guilty of second-degree murder was defective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2257 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b153-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\n<em>Murphy, C. J.,</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AWk\">\n<em>concurring in the judgment:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">I agree with the Court that the record in this case affirmatively discloses that the appellant intelligently and voluntarily entered his guilty pleas and I, therefore, concur in the judgments affirming the convictions. I do not, however, agree with the Court\u2019s holding that the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not require that the substance of the three constitutional rights specified in <em>Boykin v. Alabama, </em>395 U. S. 238, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969), be shown on the record to have been enumerated to the accused, and his intelligent and knowing waiver thereof obtained, prior to acceptance of his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Shortly after <em>Boykin </em>was decided, the Court of Special Appeals interpreted that decision as making clear \u201cthat if the record does not affirmatively show that a defendant had an intelligent understanding that he possessed each of these specified rights and voluntarily waived them, the acceptance of a plea of guilty would not be effective in any event.\u201d <em>McCall v. State, </em>9 Md. App. 191, 199, 263 A. 2d 19 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>258 Md. 729 (1970). <em>Accord, Williams v. State, </em>10 Md. App. 570 at 572, 271 A. 2d 777 (1970), <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 730 (1971); <em>see Silverberg v. Warden, </em>7 Md. App. 657 at 658-59, 256 A. 2d 821 (1969). The trial courts of the State, adhering to these decisions, have long required a specific, on-the-record reference to, and waiver of, the three constitutional rights outlined in <em>Boykin. </em>I think it is a dangerous and unnecessary departure from the established practice to now hold, absent a clear mandate from the Supreme Court, that <em>Boykin </em>does not mean what it so plainly says; and that the substance of the so-called <em>Boykin </em>constitutional rights need not be given preliminary to acceptance of a guilty plea and an on-the-record waiver obtained. Indeed, five years after <em>Boykin </em>was decided, the author of that decision, Justice Douglas, stated in a dissent from the denial of a certiorari petition (joined by Justices Brennan and Marshall) that <em>\u201cBoykin </em>established that the State must demonstrate the defendant\u2019s knowing waiver of the three constitutional rights there enumerated.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Ohio, </em>419 U. S. 924, 95 S. Ct. 200, 42 L.Ed.2d 158 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Because Judge Naughton specifically and sufficiently apprised the appellant on the record that his guilty pleas would constitute a waiver of each of his <em>Boykin </em>enumerated constitutional rights, there can be no doubt that the pleas were voluntary and intelligently entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">Judge Eldridge authorizes me to state that he concurs in the views expressed herein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
