J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AcTE\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">We granted certiorari to consider whether, in the circumstances of this case, certain vulgar language constituted \u201cfighting\u201d words within the sense contemplated by <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, </em>315 U. S. 568, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942), and its progeny, and were therefore outside of the protection of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">Appellant Downs was conversing with three friends while eating an early morning breakfast in a Lexington Park restaurant. In the course of the conversation Downs said in a loud voice, \u201cAll the goddamn policemen in this County are no fucking good, they\u2019re just after me.\u201d A few minutes later he loudly said, \u201c[T]he fucking niggers in this County are no better than goddamn policemen.\u201d A uniformed State Trooper (Trooper Taylor) sitting at a table about eight feet away from the booth in which Downs and his friends were seated overheard these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">The trooper went over to Downs\u2019 booth and told him that his talk was disruptive and that he would be placed under arrest if he did not refrain from using such profane language. Downs replied, \u201cYou ain\u2019t bad enough to place me under arrest,\u201d whereupon the trooper grabbed him and informed him that he was under arrest for disorderly conduct. A scuffle ensued, but Taylor finally managed to handcuff Downs.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Downs was charged with disorderly conduct in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 123 (c),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>resisting arrest, and assault and battery. At his trial before a jury in the Circuit Court for St. Mary\u2019s County, it was established that the restaurant was crowded, busy, and noisy. All but three or four of the 20 stools at the counter were occupied, as well as all the tables and booths. Approximately 35 to 45 persons were in the restaurant; three or four were black. Two black women were sitting at the counter about four feet from the booth in which Downs and his friends were sitting. Downs had a newspaper article in his possession; it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">\u201cYou can call your local cop a MOTHER (fornication expletive deleted) PIG or any other name and there is NOT A THING he can do to you LEGALLY, not even tell you to shut up.... The U.S. Supreme Court has said so INDIRECTLY by refusing to back Arkansas in a recent COP BADMOUTHcase....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Trooper Taylor testified that he could hear Downs\u2019 remarks as distinct from the general noise level of the restaurant. He was not personally aroused by the reference to police officers but was concerned only about the provocativeness of the racial remarks in the racially mixed crowd. Two of Downs\u2019 friends who were seated with him during the incident testified; both said that the remarks were not directed to anyone in particular but were merely part of the general conversation between Downs and themselves. One of the cooks and a patron of the restaurant testified; neither could distinguish Downs\u2019 remarks from the general din. Downs himself said that his remarks were not directed to anyone in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The jury found Downs guilty on all three charges. His original sentence of sixty days on the disorderly conduct charge and concurrent three-year sentences on the resisting arrest and assault and battery charges were modified by a sentence review panel to suspended sentences and indeterminate probation. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions but vacated the indeterminate probation because it was not in accord with Code, Art. 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>\u00a7 641A. <em>Downs v. State, </em>30 Md. App. 253, 351 A. 2d 166 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The Court of Special Appeals did not consider whether the remarks about police officers constituted \u201cfighting\u201d words because the State Trooper was not offended or angered by them. It considered the remark about blacks and found that \u201cthe strong racial slur\u201d amounted to \u201cfighting\u201d words because the trier of fact could have inferred from the volume of Downs\u2019 voice and from the racial composition of the crowd that the comment \u201c \u2018inflicted injury\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018tend[ed] to incite an immediate breach of the peace.\u2019 \u201d 30 Md. App. at 261, 351 A. 2d at 171. The court found it unnecessary for the State to prove that a fight or a riot was imminent. All that it need show was that \u201cthe average person or persons to whom [the words] were addressed, directly or indirectly at the time spoken, would be stirred to the point of violent eruption or fighting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 262, 351 A. 2d at 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">The doctrine of \u201cfighting\u201d words was originated by the Supreme Court in 1942 in <em>Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, supra. </em>Chaplinsky was distributing religious literature, and the City Marshal had received complaints about it. After being twice warned of the complaints by the marshal, Chaplinsky said to him, \u201cYou are a God damned racketeer\u201d and \u201ca damned Fascist and the whole government of Rochester are Fascists or agents of Fascists.\u201d He was found guilty of violating a statute which prohibited \u201c... address [ing] any offensive, derisive or annoying word to any other person who is lawfully in any street or other public place, [or] call [ing] him by any offensive or derisive name...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">In a now classic passage, the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-8\">\u201cThere are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which has never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or \u2018fighting\u2019 words \u2014 those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfL\">315 U. S. at 571-72, 62 S. Ct. at 769, 86 L. Ed. at 1035.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Court adopted the construction of the statute by the highest court of New Hampshire which had limited its application to words having \u201c \u2018a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the persons to whom, individually, the remark is addressed.\u2019 \u201d 315 U. S. at 573, 62 S. Ct. at 770, 86 L. Ed. at 1036, quoting <em>State v. Brown, </em>68 N. H. 200, 38 A. 731 (1895); <em>State v. McConnell, </em>70 N. H. 294, 47 A. 267 (1900). According to the New Hampshire court, the statute prohibited \u201c \u2018... face-to-face words plainly likely to cause a breach of the peace by the addressee ....\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 573, 62 S. Ct. at 770, 86 L. Ed. at 1036. \u201c \u2018The test is what men of common intelligence would understand would be words likely to cause an average addressee to fight.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Noting that the terms \u201c \u2018damned racketeer\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018damned Fascist\u2019 \u201d are \u201clikely to provoke the average person to retaliation,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 62 S. Ct. at 770, 86 L. Ed. at 1036, the Supreme Court affirmed Chaplinsky\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Although <em>Chaplinsky </em>makes it clear that \u201cfighting\u201d words are outside of the protection of the Constitution, it was not made clear in that case whether the words must be directly addressed to someone who is either injured thereby or incited to a breach of the peace. The New Hampshire construction adopted by the Supreme Court referred, somewhat inconsistently, to the individual to whom a remark is addressed and to the average addressee. In <em>Chaplinsky, </em>the words were addressed to a particular individual, but there was no evidence that the marshal was either injured or incited. The Supreme Court was satisfied that an \u201caverage\u201d person would be provoked to retaliate.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">Later cases have resolved this ambiguity and make it clear that the only speech which can be punished, in this context, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>is that which has \u201c \u2018a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gooding v. Wilson, </em>405 U. S. 518, 524, 92 S. Ct. 1103, 1107, 31 L.Ed.2d 408, 415 (1972), quoting <em>Chaplinsky. </em>In effect, \u201cfighting\u201d words have been recognized as having some social value and are punishable now not on a \u201cper se\u201d basis but only when there is a likelihood of imminent disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The first limitation on the \u201cfighting\u201d words doctrine occurred in <em>Cohen v. California, </em>403 U. S. 15, 91 S. Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1970), where the Court reversed Cohen\u2019s conviction for \u201cmaliciously and willfully disturbing] the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or person ... by ... offensive conduct\u201d by wearing into the Los Angeles Courthouse a jacket bearing the words \u201cFuck the Draft.\u201d The Court described \u201cfighting\u201d words as \u201cthose personally abusive epithets which, when addressed to the ordinary citizen, are, as a matter of common knowledge, inherently likely to provoke violent reaction.\u201d 403 U. S. at 20, 91 S. Ct. at 1785, 29 L.Ed.2d at 291. It assumed that the words must be \u201cdirected to the person of the hearer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The slogan on Cohen\u2019s jacket did not fall into that category because it was not directed to anyone in particular and there was no evidence that anyone who saw it was aroused. The Court went on to defend Cohen\u2019s use of the admittedly vulgar word \u201cfuck.\u201d It refused to allow the State the right \u201cto cleanse public debate to the point where it is grammatically palatable to the most squeamish among us\u201d because it concluded that \u201cone man\u2019s vulgarity is another\u2019s lyric.\u201d 403 U. S. at 25, 91 S. Ct. at 1788, 29 L.Ed.2d at 294. By these words, the Supreme Court has made it difficult to find any curse words <em>inherently </em>provocative.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">The second limitation occurred two years later in <em>Gooding v. Wilson, supra. </em>During an anti-war protest, Wilson said to police officers attempting to move him from the door of a military building, \u201cWhite son of a bitch, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d \u201cYou son of a bitch, I\u2019ll choke you to death.\u201d \u201cYou son of a bitch, if you ever put your hands on me again, I\u2019ll cut you all to pieces.\u201d He was convicted under a Georgia statute which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>provided: \u201cAny person who shall, without provocation, use to or of another, and in his presence .. . opprobrious words or abusive language, tending to cause a breach of the peace ... shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d Because the Georgia appellate courts had not limited the application of the statute to words that \u201chave a direct tendency to cause acts of violence by the person to whom, individually, the remark is addressed,\u201d 405 U. S. at 524, 92 S. Ct. at 1107, 31 L.Ed.2d at 408, the Supreme Court found the statute unconstitutional on its face. The <em>Chaplinsky </em>element of merely \u201cinflicting injury\u201d was not mentioned. The new test appears to require the likelihood that \u201c. .. the person addressed would make an immediate violent response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528, 92 S. Ct. at 1109, 31 L.Ed.2d at 417. Thus, while affirming the proposition that \u201cfighting\u201d words are punishable under a narrowly drawn statute, the Court so limited the application of the original doctrine that Mr. Justice Blackmun, in dissent, said that the Court \u201cis merely paying lip service to <em>Chaplinsky. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 537, 92 S. Ct. at 1113,31 L.Ed.2d at 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The Court has dealt in a summary fashion with \u201cfighting\u201d words cases arising since <em>Gooding. </em>In <em>Rosenfeld v. New Jersey, </em>408 U. S. 901, 92 S. Ct. 2479, 33 L.Ed.2d 321 (1972) (mem.), it vacated and remanded without opinion in light of <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gooding </em>a conviction for disorderly conduct under a statute prohibiting \u201cloud and offensive or profane or indecent language in any ... public place ....\u201d The defendant had used the term \u201cmother fucker\u201d several times at a public school board meeting. Mr. Justice Powell, in dissent, recognized that the defendant\u2019s words were not directed to a specific individual and that physical violence on the part of the audience was unlikely. His argument that the words could have offended the sensibility of the audience was unheeded by the majority. In <em>Brown v. Oklahoma, </em>408 U. S. 914, 92 S. Ct. 2507, 33 L.Ed.2d 326 (1972) (mem.), the Supreme Court vacated and remanded in light of <em>Cohen </em>and <em>Gooding </em>a conviction under a statute prohibiting obscene or lascivious language in a public place or in the presence of females. During a meeting at which no police officers were present, Brown had referred to police officers in general and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>to one in particular as \u201cmother fucking Fascist pigs.\u201d In <em>Lewis v. City of New Orleans, </em>408 U. S. 913, 92 S. Ct. 2499, 33 L.Ed.2d 321 (1972) (mem.), the Court vacated and remanded in light of <em>Gooding </em>a conviction under a statute prohibiting cursing, reviling, or using obscene or opprobrious language to a police officer while in the performance of his duties. Lewis had called the police officers \u201cGod damned mother fuckers.\u201d Mr. Justice Powell, concurring, would have considered the words to be \u201cfighting\u201d words had they been addressed face to face in a hostile manner to someone other than a police officer, trained to exercise restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Upon remand to the Louisiana Supreme Court, Mrs. Lewis\u2019 conviction was affirmed. 263 La. 809, 269 So. 2d 450 (1972). The United States Supreme Court, finding the statute facially invalid, reversed and remanded. 415 U. S. 130, 94 S. Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974). Four more cases followed in quick succession, all involving the constitutionality of statutes prohibiting loud, profane, insulting, lewd or boisterous words. By memorandum decisions, the Court vacated the judgment in each case and remanded in light of the second <em>Lewis </em>decision. <em>Lucas v. Arkansas, </em>416 U. S. 919, 94 S. Ct. 1917, 40 L.Ed.2d 277 (1974);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Kelly v. Ohio, </em>416 U. S. 923, 94 S. Ct. 1922, 40 L.Ed.2d 280 (1974); <em>Rosen v. California, </em>416 U. S. 924, 94 S. Ct. 1922, 40 L.Ed.2d 280 (1974); <em>Karlan v. City of Cincinnati, </em>416 U. S. 924, 94 S. Ct. 1922, 40 L.Ed.2d 280 (1974). <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Having traced the development of the \u201cfighting\u201d words doctrine, we now apply it to the facts in this case. We need not consider whether Downs\u2019 first remark, \u201cAll the goddamn policemen in this County are no fucking good, they\u2019re just after me,\u201d constituted \u201cfighting\u201d words because the state trooper, a possible addressee, was not aroused by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>comment. We need only examine his second remark, \u201c[T]he fucking niggers in this County are no better than goddamn policemen.\u201d Since <em>Cohen v. California, supra, </em>apparently teaches that the use of the adjective \u201cfucking\u201d is not punishable in the absence of compelling reasons, the potentially punishable words are \u201c[T]he niggers in this County are no better than goddamn policemen.\u201d This remark was made by Downs during a conversation with friends. There was no direct evidence that it was spoken to anyone other than the persons sitting in the booth with Downs. Even if there were, no evidence was adduced that anyone else, beside Trooper Taylor, heard this statement. Even if someone else did, there was no evidence that he or she was offended by it. And, even if someone were offended by it, there was no evidence that any person was so aroused as to respond in a violent manner. Thus, Downs\u2019 remarks were not the kind of personally abusive epithets which fall outside of the protection of the First Amendment under the rubric of \u201cfighting\u201d words. He engaged in protected speech. That his views might be offensive to someone who overheard him does not warrant a conviction for disorderly conduct. <em>Bachellar v. Maryland, </em>397 U. S. 564, 90 S. Ct. 1312, 25 L.Ed.2d 570 (1970). Accordingly, we hold that the trial judge erred in not granting Downs\u2019 motion for judgment of acquittal on the disorderly conduct charge, and that conviction must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals affirming the conviction for disorderly conduct reversed; case remanded to that Court with instructions to remand it to the Circuit Court for St. Mary's County for a new trial; costs to be paid by the County Commissioners of St. Mary's County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b645-11\">.
