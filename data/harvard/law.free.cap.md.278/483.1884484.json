Torrence on 14 July 1974 to 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>January 1975. The charging documents declared that Wheeler and Torrence were each \u201can employee of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, a municipality or other political subdivision of the State\u201d and that Canova had given or offered to give each employee forty dollars \u201cin order to influence said employee of said Commission in the performance of his official duties in violation of Article 27, Section 23, Annotated Code of Maryland.\u201d Canova filed a motion to dismiss each information and the State answered. Upon hearing, the informations were dismissed with prejudice by order of the court issued 7 June 1976. The State appealed from the order to the Court of Special Appeals. Courts Art. \u00a7\u00a7 12-302 (c) and 12-308. We granted a writ of certiorari before decision by that Court.

M. Perkins, Criminal Law </em>469 (2d ed. 1969). At the common law, bribery and an attempt to bribe are misdemeanors. 3 <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure </em>778 (Anderson 1957); <em>Clark </em>&amp; <em>Marshall, A Treatise on the Law of Crimes </em>1032 (7th ed. 1967); <em>R. M. Perkins, Criminal Law, supra, </em>at 479; 1 <em>W. L. Burdick, The Law of Crime </em>428 (1946); 1 <em>Russell on Crime </em>420 (J. W. C. Turner ed. 1950); cf. <em>J. P. Bishop, Criminal Law </em>66 (9th ed. 1923). In early times, the offense was limited to the acceptance of a bribe by a man in a judicial place. 4 <em>W. Blackstone, Commentaries </em>*140; 3 <em>Coke, Institutes </em>145; 4 <em>S. Stephen, Commentaries </em>331 (6th ed. 1868). Over the years the crime was broadened to the point where it became equally an offense to give or to receive a bribe. Eventually the offense was extended to cover not only judicial officers and other persons concerned in the administration of justice, but also all public officers and finally to all persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>performing a public duty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As summed up by <em>Perkins, supra, </em>at 469:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-5\">\u201c[T]he common law as recognized in this country, came to look upon bribery as the giving of any valuable consideration or benefit to the holder of a public office, or to \u201ca person performing a public duty, or the acceptance thereof by such person, with the corrupt intention that he be influenced thereby in the discharge of his legal duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\n<em>The Statutory Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">The inhabitants of Maryland are constitutionally entitled to the common law of England.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The common law, however, is subject to the control and modification of the legislature, and may be abrogated or changed as the General Assembly may think most conducive to the general welfare. <em>County Council v. Investors Funding, </em>270 Md. 403, 416-419, 312 A. 2d 225, 232-234 (1973); <em>Heath v. State, </em>198 Md. 455, 464, 85 A. 2d 43, 47 (1951); <em>Robb v. State, </em>190 Md. 641, 650, 60 A. 2d 211, 213 (1948); <em>Matter of Davis, </em>17 Md. App. 98, 102, 299 A. 2d 856, 859 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The General Assembly first dealt with the matter of bribery when it included the offense in ch. 138, Acts 1809, a comprehensive criminal statute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Section VIII of the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>pertained to offenses \u201caffecting public justice or public property.\u201d The 4th subsection thereof provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-5\">\u201cIf any judge, or other person concerned in the administration of justice, take any illegal fee, gift or undue reward, to influence his behaviour in his office, and if any person shall give any money or thing to any judge, or other person concerned in the administration of justice, with intent to influence his behaviour in his office, every such judge or person shall be deemed guilty of bribery, and on being convicted thereof, shall be sentenced to undergo a confinement in the penitentiary for a term of time not less than two nor more than twelve years, to be treated as is prescribed by law, and shall be disqualified from holding any office for ever thereafter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Codified as Art. 30, \u00a7 17 of the Maryland Code of 1860 (Mackall), this remained the statutory law on the subject until 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">The Constitution of Maryland of 1867 contained a mandate to the General Assembly to provide by law for the punishment of those who commit bribery.* **<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 50 of Art. Ill declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of the General Assembly, at its first session, held after the adoption of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>Constitution, to provide by Law for the punishment, by fine, or imprisonment in the Penitentiary, or both in the discretion of the Court, of any person, who shall bribe, or attempt to bribe any Executive, or Judicial officer of the State of Maryland, or any member or officer of the General Assembly of the State of Maryland, or of any Municipal Corporation in the State of Maryland, or any Executive officer of such corporation, in order to influence him in the performance of any of his official duties; and, also, to provide by Law for the punishment, by fine, or imprisonment in the Penitentiary, or both, in the discretion of the Court, of any of said officers, or members, who shall demand, or receive any bribe, fee, reward, or testimonial, for the performance of his official duties, or for neglecting, or failing to perform the same; and, also, to provide by Law for compelling any person so bribing, or attempting to bribe, or so demanding or receiving a bribe, fee, reward, or testimonial, to testify against any person, or persons, who may have committed any of said offences; provided, that any person, so compelled to testify, shall be exempted from trial and punishment for the offence, of which he may have been guilty; and any person, convicted of such offence, shall, as part of the punishment thereof, be forever disfranchised and disqualified from holding any office of trust, or profit, in this State.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0j\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Section 50 was one of the original provisions of the Constitution of 1867 and remains unchanged. Chapter 369, Acts 1868, repealing the former statute, was enacted in compliance with this constitutional mandate. <em>State v. Comes, </em>237 Md. 271, 273, 206 A. 2d 124, 125 (1965); <em>Brown v. State, </em>233 Md. 288, 293, 196 A. 2d 614, 616 (1964). See <em>State v. Panagoulis, </em>253 Md. 699, 705, 253 A. 2d 877, 881, n. 2 (1969). Today it appears in the 1976 Replacement Volume of the Maryland Code as Art. 27, \u00a7 23, and, as amended from time to time, reads, in pertinent part, thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-5\">\u201cIf any person shall bribe or attempt to bribe any executive officer of the State of Maryland, any judge, or other judicial officer of this State, any member or officer of the General Assembly of Maryland, any officer or employee of the State, or of any county, municipality or other political subdivision of the State, including members of the police force of Baltimore City and the State Police or any member or officer of any municipal corporation of this State, or any executive officer of such corporation, in order to influence any such officer or person in the performance of any of his official duties; and if the Governor or other executive officer of this State, any judge, or other judicial officer of this State, any member of the General Assembly of Maryland or officer thereof, any officer or any employee of the State, or of any county, municipality or other political subdivision of the State, including members of the police force of Baltimore City and the State Police or any member or officer of any municipal corporation, or mayor or other executive officer thereof in this State shall demand or receive any bribe, fee, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>reward or testimonial for the purpose of influencing him in the performance of his official duties, or for neglecting or failing to perform the same, every such person so bribing or attempting to bribe any of such officers or persons, and every such person so demanding or receiving any bribe, fee, reward, or testimonial shall be deemed guilty of bribery . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">As passed in 1868 the statute differed in substance from the statute now in effect in two respects. First, although ch. 369 specified the persons who may be bribees, it did not declare that such persons demanding or receiving a bribe were guilty of bribery and did not provide for their punishment, even though the constitutional mandate clearly required that this be done. This oversight was corrected by ch. 142, Acts 1882, which added the language with respect to the guilt and punishment of bribees as it now appears in \u00a7 23 of Art. 27.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Second, the 1868 Act did not include as bribees any officer or employee of the State, or of any county, municipality or other political subdivision of the State including Baltimore City and State police. Such persons were included as bribees by ch. 202, Acts 1933.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">We observe that under the statute bribery is not made a felony. \u201c[I]n this State only those [crimes] are felonies which were such at common law, or have been so declared by statute/\u2019 <em>Bowser v. State, </em>136 Md. 342, 345, 110 A. 854, 855 (1920) quoting <em>Dutton v. State, </em>123 Md. 373, 378, 91 A. 417, 419-420 (1914). The statute, however, authorizes imprisonment in the penitentiary upon conviction. Therefore, bribery and attempted bribery are excluded from those misdemeanors which must be prosecuted within one year after the offense was committed. Courts Art. \u00a7 5-106.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In <em>Blondes v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 165, 184, 294 A. 2d 661 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>(1972),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Court of Special Appeals said that Art. 27, \u00a7 23 is not \u201c. . . more all inclusive than common law bribery.\u201d The court observed that upon a literal reading of the constitutional mandate set out in Art. Ill, \u00a7 50, \u201c.. . no directive was given that the offense of bribery be provided for by statute; rather it directed legislative enactment of a statute to punish that common law crime. .. .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 182.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It found that the statute was declaratory of the common law. We agree that the statute embodies the basic elements of the common law without extending its boundaries to persons outside the ambit of the common law. With respect to the bribe-giver or briber, the statute now in effect speaks of \u201cany person\u201d, and like the common law, anyone not entirely without criminal capacity, <em>see Matter of Davis, </em>17 Md. App. 98, 100, 299 A. 2d 856, 858 (1973), may be a briber. With respect to the bribe-taker or bribee, however, the statute designates classes, and only a person within one of those classes is a potential bribee. In the words of <em>Glickfield v. State, </em>203 Md. 400, 404, 101 A. 2d 229, 231 (1953), the statute limits bribery \u201c. .. to specified public officers or public employees in the performance of their official duties.\u201d We list the classes of bribees as we find them in the statute from the provisions prohibiting the giving or attempting to give a bribe.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-5\">1) any executive officer of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">2) any judge or other judicial officer of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>3) any member or officer of the General Assembly of Maryland;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">4) any officer or employee of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">5) any officer or employee of .any county, municipality or other political subdivision of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-7\">6) members of the police force of Baltimore City and the State Police;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">7) any member or officer of any municipal corporation of this State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-9\">8) any executive officer of any municipal corporation of this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">It may be that by the very breadth of the classes of bribees specified the Legislature intended to include all public officers and all public employees so that, under the statute, no public officer and no public employee is excluded as a bribee with respect to the performance of his official duties.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We do not so decide at this time, but assuming <em>arguendo </em>that such was the Legislative intent, it is immaterial in the posture of this case. We are not concerned with whether an employee of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission (the Sanitary Commission) may come within the statute as an employee of the State <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because Canova was charged with bribing and attempting to bribe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>not employees of the State, but employees of \u201ca municipality or other political subdivision of the State.\u201d The question at this point, therefore, is whether the Sanitary Commission is a municipality or other political subdivision of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">\n<em>THE WASHINGTON SUBURBAN SANITARY COMMISSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Montgomery County, </em>267 Md. 82, 94, 296 A. 2d 692, 698 (1972) we held that the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission (the Planning Commission) was not a political subdivision within the meaning of Section 99 of Acts 1959, ch. 780 (the Regional District Act). The reasons for the holding advanced by Levine, J., speaking for a unanimous Court in a comprehensive opinion, are not only apposite but germane and material to the question now considered \u2014 whether the Sanitary Commission,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> recognized in the opinion as \u201c. . . a sister agency which possesses powers and characteristics similar to those granted to the [Planning Commission] ...\u201d, is a municipality or other political subdivision of the State within the meaning of the bribery statute before us. <em>Id. </em>at 90, 296 A. 2d at 696. After a thorough examination of the authorities and the case law, the Court in <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>was left with \u201clittle room for doubt as to what type of governmental bodies constitute \u2018political subdivisions\u2019 \u201d and found that the Planning Commission possessed \u201c. . . none of the characteristics which mark a \u2018political subdivision\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 296 A. 2d at 698. We adopt the reasons supporting the holding in <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>and, applying them, conclude that the Sanitary Commission is not a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>The bribery statute speaks of \u201cmunicipality or <em>other </em>political subdivision\u201d, (emphasis supplied) Thus, the Legislature used \u201cmunicipality\u201d in the frame of reference of a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the State.\u201d It would appear, therefore, that if the Sanitary Commission is not a political subdivision of the State, it is not a \u201cmunicipality\u201d within the contemplation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u201cMunicipality\u201d and \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d are frequently deemed to be synonymous by the courts, <em>see Neuenschwander v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, supra, </em>at 74, 48 A. 2d at 597, by the Legislature, <em>see </em>Md. Code, Art. 23B, \u00a7 2 (1973 Repl. Vol.), and by the text writers, <em>see </em>1 <em>E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 2.20 (3d ed. 1971). With respect to Art. 27, \u00a7 23, we find no logical distinction to be made between \u201cmunicipality\u201d and \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d as used therein and are satisfied that the Legislature intended none.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The State points to <em>Neuenschwander </em>which, in the context of liability for a negligent act, held that \u201c[t]he attributes of a municipal corporation are possessed by the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission to an extent amply sufficient to bring it within that designation.\u201d 187 Md. at 75, 48 A. 2d at 597. Canova questions the continued vitality of this holding and points to our opinion in <em>Arnold v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>270 Md. 285, 311 A. 2d 223 (1973) where we noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">\u201cWe have already observed that the lower court analogized the [Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning] Commission to the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission and relied heavily upon the holding of our predecessors in Neuenschwander v. Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, 187 Md. 67, 48 A. 2d 593, decided on July 23, 1946, that the Sanitary Commission was a \u2018municipal corporation.\u2019 We note that Chapter 423 of the Laws of 1955, <em>inter alia, </em>added \u00a7 9 \u2018Definitions and limitations\u2019 to Art. 23A, entitled \u2018Corporations \u2014 Municipal,\u2019 which pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>vided under the subtitle \u2018Home Rule\u2019 the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">(b) <em>Certain corporations excepted. </em>\u2014 The term \u2018municipal corporation\u2019 does not embrace or include the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, or the Washington Suburban Sanitary District under the jurisdiction of such Commission; the term \u2018municipal corporation\u2019 does not embrace or include the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, or the Maryland-Washington Metropolitan District or the Maryland-Washington Regional District under the jurisdiction of such commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-7\">This identical language has been continued unchanged until the present time. See Code (1957 Repl. Vol.) Art. 23A, \u00a7 9 (b). The Act of 1955, of course, was enacted some nine years after the decision in the Neuenschwander case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 292, n. 1, 311 A. 2d at 227.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">We note further that prior to <em>Arnold, </em>in \u00a7\u00a7 1-1 (g) and 18-4 of the Washington Suburban Sanitary District Code (1970), the General Assembly declared that the term \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d in Art. XI-E of the Constitution of Maryland, entitled \u201cMunicipal Corporations\u201d, ratified 2 November 1954, did not embrace or include the Washington Suburban Sanitary District. In the light of <em>Arnold </em>and the cited statutes, we are not persuaded to extend the holding attributed to <em>Neuenschwander </em>that the Sanitary Commission is a municipal corporation beyond the posture of that case, confining it to the liability of the Sanitary Commission with respect to the application of the law concerning liability of a municipal corporation for injuries caused by the defective condition of a street.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">It was not claimed in <em>Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>that the Planning Commission was a municipality or municipal corporation. Thus, it was not necessary for us to make that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>precise holding.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In arriving at the conclusion that the Planning Commission was not a political subdivision, however, we fully discussed the status of the Commission as a municipal corporation. Inherent in our finding that the Planning Commission was not a political subdivision of the State, was that it was not a municipal corporation. We said it is arguable that, in a narrow sense, the Planning Commission has aspects of a municipal corporation, but that it \u201c.. . clearly does not fit the popular concept of a municipal corporation such as that intended by Article XI-E of the Constitution.\u201d 267 Md. at 90, 296 A. 2d at 696. By the same rationale, the Sanitary Commission, being a sister agency similar to the Planning Commission, is also not a municipal corporation or municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Aside from the view that a commission like the Sanitary Commission does not fit the popular concept of a municipal corporation, two basic factors have been suggested upon which to determine whether an entity is a municipal corporation: (1) how many attributes of a municipal corporation does the entity possess and (2) in the light thereof, what is the particular purpose for the determination. <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation District Commission v. Smith, </em>193 Va. 371, 68 S.E.2d 497, 500 (1952). When the Sanitary Commission here is examined with respect to the elements necessary to constitute a municipal corporation, see 1 <em>E. McQuillin, Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 2.07 (b) (3rd ed. 1971), a most crucial element is lacking, that is, the power of local self-government. Without that element, it does not meet the definition of a municipal corporation. In considering the second suggested factor, the particular purpose for the determination whether the Sanitary Commission is a municipal corporation concerns the applicability of a penal statute. It is firmly established that a penal statute must be strictly construed in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the defendant. <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 617, 224 A. 2d 677, 682 (1966). The State concedes that the Sanitary Commission is not a municipal corporation \u201c. .. using the term in its strict sense . ..\u201d, but urges that it is a \u201cquasi-municipal corporation\u201d and that this is sufficient to bring it within Art. 27, \u00a7 23. In the light of the rule of strict construction, we cannot accept the view that a \u201cquasi-municipal corporation\u201d satisfies the classification of \u201cmunicipal corporation\u201d used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We hold that the Sanitary Commission is not a municipality, municipal corporation, or political subdivision of this State within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">\n<em>THE CRIMINAL INFORMATIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">As we have seen, each of the criminal informations filed against Canova charged a violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 23 and alleged that a named bribee was \u201can employee of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, a municipality or other political subdivision of the State.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We have determined that the Sanitary Commission is not a municipality or other political subdivision of the State. This presents the question of the effect of the incorrect designation of the bribee.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>It is fundamental that a charging document must charge an offense prescribed by common law or by statute. A court exercising criminal jurisdiction has no power to render a verdict or impose a sentence under a charging document which does not charge an offense. <em>See Putnam v. State, </em>234 Md. 537, 540-541, n. 1, 200 A. 2d 59, 61 (1964). Art. 21 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights declares that in all criminal prosecutions, every man has a right to be informed of the accusation against him. \u201c[A] criminal charge must so characterize the crime and describe the particular offense so as to give the accused notice of what he is called upon to defend and to prevent a future prosecution for the same offense.\u201d <em>Corbin v. State, </em>237 Md. 486, 490, 206 A. 2d 809, 811 (1965). It was early noted by this Court that \u201c[c]ertainty to a reasonable extent, is an essential attribute of all pleading, both civil and criminal, but is more especially necessary in the latter, where conviction is followed by penal consequences.\u201d <em>State v. Nutwell, </em>1 Gill 54, 56 (1843). We said in <em>Kearney v. State, </em>48 Md. 16, 23-24 (1877): \u201cThe want of a direct allegation of any thing material in the description of the substance, nature, or manner of the crime, cannot be supplied by intendment, and hence it has always been held, that it is an essential requisite in every indictment that it should allege all matters material to constitute the particular crime charged, with such positiveness and directness, as not to need the aid of intendment or implication.\u201d All facts which make the act complained of a crime are matters of substance in a criminal charge. <em>Corbin v. State, supra, </em>at 489-490, 206 A. 2d at 811. <em>See Imbraguglia v. State, </em>184 Md. 174, 40 A. 2d 329 (1944) and cases therein cited.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> In <em>State v. Lassotovitch, </em>162 Md. 147, 156, 159 A. 362, 366 (1932) we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">\u201cEvery charge or accusation, whether at common law or under statute, must include at least two elements: First, the characterization of the crime; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>and, second, such description of the particular act alleged to have been committed by the accused as will enable him to properly defend against the accusation. In statutory crimes, where the statute includes the elements necessary to constitute a crime, the first of these requirements is gratified by characterizing the offense in the words of the statute; the second requires such definite and specific allegations as reasonably to put the accused on notice of the particular act charged, to enable him to prepare a defense and plead the judgment in any subsequent attempted prosecution.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Even if the charging document employs the statutory words, this does not mean that \u201cit is unnecessary to allege such facts in connection with the commission of the offense as will certainly put the accused on full notice of what he is called upon to defend, and establish such a record as will effectually bar a subsequent prosecution for that identical offense .. . However, it is clear that an indictment which charges the accused with the act prohibited by the statutory language, and does nothing more, would be fatally defective in failing to allege such other facts as would enable the accused to prepare his defense.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 150, 159 A. at 363. The rule regarding the description of a statutory offense in the language of the statute \u201chas reference simply to the definition and characterization in legal terms of the criminal offense to be alleged in the indictment. It does not affect the requirement that the indictment should sufficiently identify the specific charge intended to be preferred.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 154, 159 A. at 365.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The informations here incorrectly designated the Sanitary Commission to be a municipality or other political subdivision. This left the informations silent as to whether the bribees were in fact within one of the classes specified by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the statute. If they were not, no statutory offense was charged. It is not a crime to give an employee of the Sanitary Commission money to influence him in the performance of his official duties unless that employee comes under the statute. An accurate designation of the class of bribee was material in the description of the substance of the crime alleged. These informations lacked the essential requirement that all matters material to constitute the particular crime charged be alleged with such positiveness and directness as not to need the aid of intendment or implication. Canova had the right to stand on the informations. <em>Lassotovitch, </em>162 Md. at 158, 159 A. at 366. Upon the showing on his motion to dismiss that the bribees were not employees of a municipality or other political subdivision of the State, the informations were left without such definite and specific allegations as reasonably to put Canova on full notice of what he was called upon to defend, if, indeed, they were sufficient to charge an offense. The defect in them was a matter of substance, for it was necessary to make the act complained of a crime, and the defect could not be cured by amendment without the consent of the accused. Md. Rule 714 a. The court did not err in dismissing the informations.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The order of the court below dismissed the informations \u201cwith prejudice.\u201d We construe this to apply only to the charging documents dismissed by the court, namely, Criminal Informations Nos. 17491, 17496, 17497 and 17498.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\n<em>Order dismissing Criminal Informations Nos. 17491, 17496, 17497 and 17498 affirmed; costs to be paid by Montgomery County.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-13\">.

The provision'was not adopted without debate. At the proceeding in the Convention on 10 July 1867, \u201cMr. Merrick moved to strike out the entire section. The ordinary penal laws provided for the punishment of the offenses therein named, and this was the first time that it was proposed to put such a provision in the organic law of this State. Was there any necessity for inserting such a provision? ... Mr. Brown said the section was of very great importance. The question was simply this: Shall the ancient honor of the State of Maryland be kept untarnished or not? Because he [Mr. B.] saw that the purity of our institutions was involved, he earnestly advocated the adoption of this section, or something better. In reply to the objection of the gentleman from Howard [Mr. Merrick] he maintained that there was a necessity for this section. He could not prove before a jury that bribery and corruption had of late prevailed in our legislative bodies, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>the charge had been made, not only by the people, but by the press, and with such proofs that he believed it.\u201d <em>Debates of the Maryland Constitutional Convention of 1867 </em>286 (P.

By other Acts, the General Assembly has expanded the common law crime of bribery by including persons who are not public officers or entrusted with a public duty. Md.

Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 23, expressly includes within the class of potential bribees \u201cany officer or employee of the State, or of any county, municipality or other political subdivision of the State . . . .\u201d In light of the sweeping language employed in describing the types of public employees enumerated therein, I believe that the Legislature clearly intended to encompass all Maryland governmental employees, including employees of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. The erroneous legal characterization of the Commission as a \u201cmunicipality or other political subdivision\u201d should have been disregarded as surplusage, and the informations, which fully set forth all of the essential elements of bribery, should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Bribery, as the majority notes, ultimately developed at common law from a limited offense to a rather broad offense embracing \u201cthe giving of any valuable consideration or benefit... to a person performing a public duty .. . with the corrupt intention that he be influenced thereby in the discharge of his legal duty.\u201d R. M. Perkins, <em>Criminal Law </em>469 (2d ed. 1969). The gist of the crime at common law is the \u201ccorrupt payment ... of a private price for official action.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Chief Judge Murphy in <em>Blondes v. State, </em>16 Md. App. 165, 182, 184, 294 A. 2d 661 (1972), pointed out that Art. 27, \u00a7 23, passed in compliance with the mandate of Art. Ill, \u00a7 50 of the Maryland Constitution, is declaratory of the common law. It is clear that at common law the payment of valuable consideration to a public employee performing a public duty, such as an employee of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, to influence his performance of that duty, would constitute the offense of bribery.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Moreover, even if Art. 27, \u00a7 23, were not interpreted to include as potential bribees all Maryland public employees, but rather only to include certain limited categories of public employees, the alleged acts here would still constitute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>crime of bribery. The Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, created by the General Assembly by a public general law and not a public local law, to perform governmental functions in more than one county, is, in my view, a State agency within the meaning of the bribery statute. <em>Cf Pr. George\u2019s Co. v. Md.-Nat\u2019l Cap., </em>269 Md. 202, 306 A. 2d 223, <em>cert. denied, </em>414 U. S. 1068 (1973). Employees of a State agency are a class expressly enumerated in the bribery statute. Thus, employees of the Commission are clearly a potential class of bribees within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In <em>Lank v. State, </em>219 Md. 433, 149 A. 2d 367 (1959), this Court, in considering the adequacy of an allegedly defective indictment, explained the purpose of a charging document as follows (219 Md. at 436):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201c[T]he purpose of a criminal charge \u2014 be it a state warrant, an information or an indictment \u2014 is twofold, that is, the charge must so characterize the crime and describe the particular offense \u2018as to put the accused on notice of what he is called upon to defend and to prevent a future prosecution for the same offense.\u2019 <em>Gray v. State, supra </em>[216 Md. 410]. ... As was pointed out in <em>State v. Wheatley, </em>192 Md. 44, 63 A. 2d 644 (1949), modern courts disregard extremely technical rules and require only that an indictment shall fully allege the essential elements of the offense charged. See also <em>Shelton v. State, </em>198 Md. 405, 84 A. 2d 76 (1951).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">And as stated in <em>State v. Lassotovitch, </em>162 Md. 147, 150, cited by the majority, the charging document must allege \u201csuch ... facts as would enable the accused to prepare his defense.\u201d The critical issue is whether the informations in the instant case sufficiently characterize the crime of bribery and allege such facts so as to put Canova on notice of the offenses with which he is charged and to prevent a future prosecution for the same offenses. I believe that they do.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The informations charge Joseph Canova with both attempted bribery and bribery of two employees of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission. More specifically, the informations allege that on specified dates Canova either gave or offered named employees of the Commission forty dollars \u201cin order to influence said employee[s] of said Commission in the performance of ... [their] official duties in violation of Article 27, Section 23.\u201d Under the tests set forth in <em>Lank v. State, supra, </em>and <em>State v. Lassotovitch, supra, </em>these informations are clearly sufficient. They allege all the essential elements of the crimes, namely giving or offering an employee of a public agency valuable consideration to influence that employee in the performance of his official duties. And the informations set forth such facts in sufficient detail to put the accused on notice of the precise offenses with which he is charged and to prevent a second prosecution for the offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The majority states that \u201c[i]t may be that by the very breadth of the classes of bribees specified the Legislature intended to include all public officers and all public employees so that, under the statute, no public officer and no public employee is excluded as a bribee with respect to the performance of his official duties.\u201d The Court\u2019s opinion goes on to state, however, that it is unnecessary to reach this issue because Canova is charged with bribing an employee of \u201ca municipality or other political subdivision of the State.\u201d The majority concludes that because this is an improper characterization of the government agency involved, the informations are defective, as \u201can accurate designation of the class of bribee\u201d was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">If Art. 27, \u00a7 23, does include all Maryland public employees as I believe, and as the majority assumes, the informations are sufficient. The erroneous legal characterization of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission as a \u201cmunicipality or other political subdivision of the State\u201d is an unnecessary averment and should be treated as surplusage. Where an indictment contains unnecessary language which does not mislead the accused, that language may be treated as surplusage. If, disregarding the surplusage, the indictment otherwise states sufficient facts so as to allege an offense and prevent a second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>prosecution for the same offense, the indictment will not be rendered defective by the inclusion of the surplusage. <em>Archer v. State, </em>145 Md. 128, 144, 147-148, 125 A. 744 (1924) (holding that the recital of an erroneous legal characterization of facts did not render an indictment defective). <em>See also Marks v. State, 230 </em>Md. 108, 185 A. 2d 909 (1962), <em>cert. denied, </em>373 U. S. 918 (1963); Wharton, <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 265 (12th ed. 1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The majority holds that without a proper categorization of the legal status of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission, the informations failed to put Canova on notice of the charge which he was to defend. I cannot believe that informations which alleged that the accused, on a specific date, offered or gave to an employee of a governmental agency a sum of money to influence that employee in his official duties failed to adequately inform Canova that he was charged with bribing a public employee, an offense punishable under Art. 27, \u00a7 23. These allegations are clearly \u201csufficient to meet the practical needs which an indictment is intended to supply .. ..\u201d <em>State v. Coblentz, </em>167 Md. 523, 529, 175 A. 340 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">Affirmance of the order dismissing the informations constitutes an adherence to the \u201cextremely technical rules\u201d regarding indictments which this Court long ago abandoned. <em>State v. Wheatley, </em>192 Md. 44, 63 A. 2d 644 (1949). I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Chief Judge Murphy has authorized me to state that he joins in the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
