Appellant (the juvenile), then 15 years of age, approached the private car of a Baltimore City police officer, then on duty in plain clothes, and offered to perform normal sexual intercourse for $25.00. Following their conversation, they drove to a nearby motel. As they approached the lobby the police officer identified himself and placed the juvenile under arrest. Under Code (1974,1975 Cum. Supp.) \u00a7 3-801 (J) Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (in effect at the time of the act in question) a delinquent child was defined as \u201ca child who has committed a delinquent act and requires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d Section 3-801 (I) defined a delinquent act as \u201can act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\u201d A child is defined by \u00a7 3-801 (C) as \u201ca person under the age of 18 years.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She was found to be a delinquent child by the Circuit Court of Baltimore City, Division for Juvenile Causes. In an effort to avoid such a judgment, her attorneys presented the interesting and esoteric argument in the trial court and again here that \u201cthe crime of solicitation requires the inducement of another to commit a crime\u201d and that she \u201cwas not engaged in activity which constituted the solicitation of another to commit prostitution.\u201d \u201cProstitution\u201d is defined by Art. 27, \u00a7 16 as \u201cthe offering or receiving of the body for sexual intercourse for hire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The juvenile cites <em>Cherry v. State, </em>18 Md. App. 252, 306 A. 2d 634 (1973). The defendant there had been convicted of soliciting for the \u201cpurpose of prostitution, lewdness and assignation\u201d in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 15 (e). The court had before it two constitutional attacks upon the conviction, one based upon an abridgment of the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and one based on vagueness and over-breadth under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. In the process of the opinion the court said that \u201c[t]he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>inchoate crimes generally are of recent vintage in the history of the common law [,] [t]he latest and least of these [being] solicitation.\u201d It then went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-5\">\u201cIts first formulation, as something distinct from a mere aspect in the law of attempts, was in <em>Rex v. Higgins </em>in 1801, 2 East 5, 102 Eng. Rep. 269. As persuasively declarative of pre-existing common law, <em>Rex v. Higgins </em>was followed by landmark decisions in <em>State v. Avery, </em>7 Conn. 266, 18 Am. Dec. 105 (1828), and <em>Commonwealth v. Flagg, </em>135 Mass. 545 (1883). Solicitation is now universally recognized in the United States as a part of Anglo-American common law. In Clark and Marshall, <em>Law of Crimes </em>(7th ed., 1967), its characteristics are well set out, at 219-223:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">\u2018Solicitation is a distinct common-law misdemeanor in which the act forbidden consists of the accused person\u2019s parol or written efforts to activate another to commit a criminal offense. It is immaterial whether the solicitation is of any effect and whether the crime solicited is in fact committed. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-8\">\u2018The gist of this offense is incitement. In brief, the gravamen of this common-law misdemeanor lay in counselling, enticing, or inducing another to commit a crime. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">\u2018Inciting or soliciting another to commit a crime is the act of the least magnitude which is punishable by the common law. In such offenses the actor does nothing himself but he urges others to violate the law. The necessity for punishing such persons is obvious, and such conduct is generally punished as a substantive crime, notwithstanding the solicitation does not move the party solicited to commit the offense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257-58. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">The juvenile argues that since \u201ca person can only be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>convicted of solicitation under \u00a7 15 (e) if the person being solicited . . . could be found guilty of committing the crimes of prostitution, lewdness, or assignation,\u201d and by accepting the offer the officer would not be engaging in the crime of prostitution, she does not come within the purview of the statute because she has not incited or solicited anyone to commit a crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">We recently observed in <em>Howell v. State, </em>278 Md. 389, 364 A. 2d 797 (1976), that one of \u201cthe cardinal rule[s] of statutory construction is to ascertain and carry out the real legislative intent and in ascertaining that intent the court considers the language of an enactment in its natural and ordinary signification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">As we see it there are three reasons for concluding that the juvenile is in error in her contentions: the use by the General Assembly of the word \u201csolicit\u201d in other statutes, the views of courts in other states, and the common meaning assigned to the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.) Art. 2B, \u00a7 115 (a) makes it a crime for a \u201cretail dealer ... to employ any solicitor ... for the purpose of soliciting, outside of the licensed place of business, orders for the sale of any alcoholic beverages within this State . . . .\u201d Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol.) Art. 10, \u00a7 25 prohibits an attorney from \u201chabitually go[ing] to the several jails, station houses and other places of criminal punishment with the view of soliciting the clientage of persons confined therein awaiting trial, without having been first sent for by such persons or by their friends . . . .\u201d It also makes it unlawful to \u201csolicit such clientage through sheriffs, constables, jailors or professional lawbreakers . . . .\u201d Code (1957) Art. 27, \u00a7 13 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201cWhoever, for his own gain, and having no existing relationship or interest in the issue, directly or indirectly, solicits another to sue at law or in equity...; or whoever, being an attorney at law, directly or indirectly, agrees to procure another to be employed as an expert witness, or otherwise, or procures another to be so employed in consideration of his so soliciting litigious business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>or undertaking to solicit it . . . shall, upon conviction thereof, be punished by a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment in jail for not more than three months, or by both. Any solicitation as aforesaid shall be prima facie evidence that the person so soliciting is doing so for gain.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Code (1957, 1976 Repl. Vol. ) Art. 27, \u00a7 415 specifies that \u201c[n]o person who may accompany or who may be in charge of, or who may have the custody of any musical instrument or device, shall solicit or accept any money or thing of value from any person upon any highway . . . or in any ordinary, saloon, tavern, restaurant, ... or any other public place . . . unless such person shall solicit aid for purely charitable purposes.\u201d As used in each of those statutes the word \u201csolicit\u201d is used in its common, ordinary meaning and not with reference to the common law crime of solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In <em>Williams v. United States, </em>110 F. 2d 554 (D. C. Cir. 1940), the court referred to the District of Columbia statute which \u201cforbids \u2018any person to invite . . . any person ... in or upon any avenue, street, road, highway, open space, alley, public square, or enclosure in the District of Columbia, to accompany . . . her ... for the purpose of prostitution, or any other immoral or lewd purpose.\u2019 \u201d The court said this statute \u201ccondemns solicitation in places of certain sorts.\u201d In <em>Bailey v. United States, </em>98 F. 2d 306 (D. C. Cir. 1938), the same statute was before the court. It said that the appellant there \u201cwas convicted ... of the offense of soliciting prostitution.\u201d It observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201cAlthough this case was argued on the theory that appellant was charged with the offense of common prostitution, the fact is otherwise. She is charged under a statute which makes it an offense to invite, entice, or persuade a person in or upon a public street in the District of Columbia to accompany her to her residence for the purpose of prostitution or any other immoral or lewd purpose. She is not charged with the offense of prostitution. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Perhaps a more common designation of the offense charged would be \u2018street-walking,\u2019 which is ordinarily punished as disorderly conduct or indecent behavior on the public highway.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 307.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">\u201cIn the present case the statute condemns only solicitation on the streets, as an act of public immorality, and has no reference to the doing of any other illicit or immoral act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\"><em>Morgan v. City of Detroit, </em>389 F. Supp. 922 (E.D. Mich. 1975), concerned a civil rights action brought by operators and employees of a massage parlor and a nude photographic studio challenging a Detroit ordinance. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-8\">\u201cThe City of Detroit accosting and soliciting ordinance states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-9\">It shall be unlawful for any person to accost, solicit or invite another in any public place or in or from any building or vehicle by word, gesture or any other means to commit or afford an opportunity to commit fornication or prostitution or to do any other lewd immoral act. It shall be unlawful for any male person to engage or offer to engage the services of a female person for the purposes of prostitution, lewdness or assignation, by the payment in money or other forms of consideration. It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in a house of ill fame or prostitution or place where prostitution or lewdness is practiced, encouraged or allowed. [Section 39-1-52 Ordinances of the City of Detroit.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 926.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">The plaintiffs there claimed \u201cthat they [were] being denied their First Amendment right of freedom of speech because the accosting and soliciting law impinges on pure communication. They point[ed] out that there is no crime of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>prostitution in either the City of Detroit or the State of Michigan.\u201d The court said that \u201c[t]he question posed [was] whether the First Amendment prohibits criminal prosecution for soliciting someone to perform an act which is itself not criminal.\u201d In rejecting this contention it observed that \u201c[a] further reason for not according the speech incident to accosting and soliciting First Amendment protection is that it is essentially commercial in nature. Whatever else one might say about the act of accosting and soliciting, it is doubtlessly intended to sell a product.\u201d An equal protection argument was mounted on the ground \u201cthat because only the prostitute is arrested for accosting and soliciting and not the customer, there is a denial of the Equal Protection Clause based on sex,\u201d an argument which was rejected. In discussing the claim of the plaintiffs \u201cthat the ordinance [was] so vague and overbroad as to be violative of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d the court observed that \u201c[t]he terms \u2018accosting and soliciting,\u2019 \u2018prostitution,\u2019 and \u2018fornication\u2019 are on their face precise and give fair notice of what conduct is forbidden.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><em>In re Carey, </em>57 Cal. App. 297, 207 P. 271 (3d App. D. 1922) concerned a San Francisco ordinance making it \u201cunlawful for any person on any public street or highway or elsewhere to solicit ... for the purpose of prostitution.\u201d The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201cThe specific charge against the petitioner is not that of carrying on the business of prostitution, but of soliciting for prostitution. She insists that a man, as readily as a woman, may commit this offense, and that, therefore, no discrimination in punishment can be tolerated. Even if this premise were sound, we are far from conceding the soundness of her conclusion. But the premise is not sound. The ordinance, it is true, applies to \u2018every person.\u2019 For the offense, if he could commit it, he would be sent to jail. In her case she might be committed to the farm for purposes of reformation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>But a man can no more commit the offense of soliciting for prostitution than that of carrying on the business of prostitution. In one sense, possibly, it may be spid that a man who acts as a \u2018capper\u2019 for a house of prostitution is guilty of the crime of soliciting for it. But the crime committed by others than the principal is known as \u2018pandering\u2019 and the offender is known as a panderer, pimp, or procurer. His punishment is provided for in section 318 of the Penal Code. The words \u2018soliciting for prostitution\u2019 have a well understood and distinct meaning. They are held to mean the act of a fallen woman in hailing passers-by and soliciting them to patronize her business. They are so understood by police officers and all others who are called upon to labor with this class of people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306-07.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">An Illinois statute making it unlawful to \u201csolicit to prostitution in any street, alley, park or other place in any city, village, or incorporated town in th[at] State\u201d was before the court in <em>The People v. Rice, </em>383 Ill. 584, 50 N.E.2d 711 (1943). The court said that the persons there involved were charged \u201cwith the offense of soliciting for prostitution.\u201d It described \u201c[t]he first count in each indictment [as] charging] the defendant with lewdly soliciting sexual intercourse and prostitution \u2018upon the public streets or other place of the City of Champaign.\u2019 \u201d One of the contentions presented to the court was \u201cthat as the statute under which the indictments were drawn merely namefd] \u2018solicitation,\u2019 without defining the term, and since th[e] [Illinois] court ha[d] never defined it, it was incumbent on the People to describe fully the offense.\u201d The court responded to this contention by quoting definitions in Webster\u2019s International Dictionary and then saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cThe definitions of \u2018solicit\u2019 and \u2018prostitution\u2019 are so well and universally understood as to require no further definition in the statute or charge to set forth the elements necessary to constitute the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>offense intended to be punished. Defendants in error\u2019s contention that the language of the statute is not broad enough to apprise them of the particular offense charged is without merit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 588.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">We regard it as significant that although these various decisions and the statutes with which they are concerned have mentioned \u201csolicitation,\u201d \u201csolicit,\u201d and \u201csoliciting,\u201d with reference to acts similar to that committed by the juvenile here, not one has spoken in terms of the common law crime of solicitation. When to that is added the use made by the General Assembly in other statutes of similar words concerning other crimes which, in the context used, appear not to refer to the common law crime of solicitation, it becomes rather obvious that the common law crime of solicitation was not what the General Assembly had in mind when it enacted \u00a7 15 (e). If one had any lingering doubt on that subject it would be rapidly dissipated by reference to dictionary definitions. For example, the term \u201csolicit\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language (2d Ed. unabridged 1959) as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201c8. To tempt (a person); to lure on, esp. into evil; to attempt to seduce; <em>specif., of a woman, to accost (a man) for immoral purposes. </em>\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (Unabridged ed. 1967) says of the term:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201c4. to accost or lure (someone) with immoral intentions, as by or on behalf of a prostitute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">It is interesting to note the definition of \u201csolicitation\u201d found in Funk &amp; Wagnalls New Standard Dictionary of the English Language (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">\u201c3. <em>Law. </em>... (2) The inviting another to commit adultery or fornication.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">This view is confirmed by examination of the word \u201csolicit\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>and its history in the Oxford English Dictionary (Compact ed. 1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">\u201c4. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201cd. Of women: To accost and importune (men) for immoral purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201c1710 Steele <em>Tatler </em>No. 201 P 1 There are those [women] who betray the Innocent of their own Sex, and solicit the Lewd of ours. 1869 E. A. Parres <em>Pract. Hygiene </em>(ed. 3) 498 Means could easily be adopted to prevent soldiers being solicited by women. 1887 <em>Spectator </em>9 July 919/2 She was arrested by a constable, accused of soliciting gentlemen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We hold that when the word \u201csolicit\u201d was used in the Maryland statute here under consideration it was not used with reference to the common law crime of solicitation, but in the common, ordinary meaning of the word as understood and used by the general public.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed; appellant ta pay the costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\">.
