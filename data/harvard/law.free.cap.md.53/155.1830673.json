E. EL, wife of A. EL, owned in her own right, certain United States five-twenty coupon bonds, and certain certificates of indebtedness of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, termed Baltimore City Stock, and died so possessed on the 13th November, 1877, intestate and without issue. Her husband survived her, and died intestate on the 16th May, 1878. After M. E. H\u2019s death, none of the coupons on the bonds were cut off and delivered to A. H. When the wife died the bonds were, and had been since the 15th December, 1871, on special deposit for safe-keeping in the Safe Deposit Co., where they had been deposited, as shown by the Co\u2019s receipt, \u201c through A. H., and subject to the order of either.\u201d At her death this receipt and the stock certificates were in possession of her brother, who, on the 9th April, 1878, delivered them to A. H., taking his receipt therefor. A. H. was then sick and unable to leave his house, up to the time of his death. His son applied to the City Register to transfer the stock from the name of the wife, to that of A. H., but was refused, unless A. H. applied in person, which he never did. His son also applied to the treasurer of the Safe Deposit Co., presented the receipt, and requested delivery of the bonds for A. H., but was refused unless A. H. appeared in person, or executed a power of attorney to withdraw the bonds, neither of which he ever did. On the 3nd June, 1878, the Co. delivered the bonds to the appellants as A. H\u2019s administrators, on the return of the receipt. The appellee was appointed administrator of M. E. H., after A. H\u2019s death.

Some of these are commonly known as public debts, and are nothing else than loans of money for long periods, at fixed rates of interest, usually evidenced by bonds or other certificates of indebtedness. They have all the requisite elements of contracts of loan, and the certificates therefor are usually under seal, and are properly treated by the law as <em>choses in action. </em>See 1 <em>Schouler\u2019s Pers.

Independently of the statute law, the things in action of the wife must, during the coverture, he reduced to possession of the husband hy some positive, unequivocal and effectual act on his part. In case he survive her, the statute gives to him <em>jure mariti, </em>and without formality of administration, the right to her <em>dioses in action </em>if reduced hy him to possession in his life-time. Mere intention to reduce is not sufficient, and nothing on his behalf is to he presumed or inferred.. So long as anything remains which can he done hy him to acquire a better possession, the reduction is not complete. Debts due to the wife, legacies, distributive shares, arrears of rent, outstanding loans, promissory notes, and property <em>ejusdem generis, </em>are her <em>dioses in </em>action, and must be actually reduced hy the husband if he would assert a title thereto. 2 <em>Bl.

Hamill died intestate and without issue \u25a0on the 13th of November, 1877, leaving her husband, Alexander Hamill, surviving her, and on the 16th of May, 1878, he also died intestate. Letters of administration were then granted upon the estates of each, the appellants being the administrators of the husband, and the appellee the administrator of the wife. \u2022 At the time of her death Mrs. Hamill owned in her own right five $1000 United States five-twenty coupon bonds, and $1100 of what is termed Baltimore City Stock. On the 28th of February, 1879,. the administrator of the wife brought an action of trover against the appellants for the \u25a0conversion of these bonds and this stock. The plea was not guilty, and the case was tried before the Court without the intervention of a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">By the Code, Art. 45, sec. 2, the \u201c personal property\u201d \u2022of the wife in case she dies intestate and leaving no children, is vested in the husband absolutely, but by Art. 93, sec. 32, it is provided: \u201cIf the intestate be a married woman, it shall not he necessary for her husband to take out administration, but all her <em>choses in action </em>shall devolve on her husband, in the same manner as if he had taken out such administration; <em>Provided, </em>that if he shall not in his life-time reduce the said <em>choses in action </em>into possession, or'obtained judgment .thereon, the said <em>\u25a0choses in action </em>shall devolve on her representatives, and administration may be granted accordingly.\u201d It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>not necessary to notice the addition to this section by the Act of 1818, ch. 268, because it has no bearing upon the present case. These two sections of the Code were construed in the case of <em>Stockett vs. Bird, </em>18 <em>Md., </em>484, and it was there decided they were both operative, and that the latter merely created an <em>exception </em>to the <em>general </em>provisions of the former. In the case now before us there are two main questions which we shall consider in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">1st. Are these bonds and stock <em>dioses in action </em>within the contemplation of the section of the Code above referred to ?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">2nd. If they are <em>dioses in action </em>did the husband in his-life-time, and after the death of his wife, reduce them into his possession ?</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">1st. As to the city stock but little need be said. TheOity of Baltimore negotiated loans, and issued to the-lenders certificates acknowledging its <em>indebtedness </em>to them respectively for the several amounts borrowed, to be paid at a fixed future day, with interest at a fixed rate payable quarterly or semi-annually. These certificates are transferable only at the Mayor\u2019s office in person or by attorney, and on delivery of the certificate to the transferee. At her death, Mrs. Hamill held and owned two of these certificates, one for $800, and the other for $300. Certificates thus evidencing the debts or obligations of a municipal corporation are unquestionably <em>dioses in action. </em>They fall within the strictest definition of those terms, have been so regarded by every text writer, and so adjudged by all the authorities in which the question has arisen.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">It has been argued that the five-twenty bonds are not<em>dioses in action </em>because no suit upon them can be brought against the United States. But if they are not <em>dioses in action </em>what are they, and under what description of property or rights known to the law do they come ? It is clear that whatever other qualities they may have, they are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>money or currency. They are widely different from legal tender notes. These latter are simply promises to pay on demand, hear no interest, were made to circulate as money, as they do in fact, and so far as Congress had power, were made a legal tender at their face value for all debts public and private, except duties on imports and interest on the <em>public debt. </em>But these bonds were authorized by a different law, subserved a different purpose, and in fact constitute part of the interest-bearing <em>public debt, </em>the interest on which is payable in coin. The substance of the obligation expressed on their face is that the United States are \u201c <em>indebted to the bearer,\u201d </em>in the sum specified, redeemable, at the pleasure of the United States after <em>five, </em>and payable at <em>twenty </em>years from the 1st of July, 1865, with interest at six per cent, payable semi-annually, and they have interest coupons attached. Being payable to holder or hearer and having a long time to run, it has been decided they have become by the necessities of modern usage negotiable paper with all the protection that belongs to that class of obligations. <em>Vermilye &amp; Co. vs. Adams Express Co., </em>21 <em>Wall., </em>138. We shall not stop to inquire whether, under the legislation of Congress establishing the Court of Claims and defining its jurisdiction, a suit could be brought in that Court against the United States for default in payment of these bonds at maturity, because we do not deem it material. The public debt of G-reat Britain is redeemable only at the pleasure of the Government, and holders of that debt can therefore never bring an action against the debtor to recover it, not only because of the immunity of the Government from suit, but because by the terms of the obligations themselves they are not payable at any definite time. Stock or money in \u201cthe funds,\u201d as they are designated in the English authorities, is merely a right in the holder to receive certain annuities hy half-yearly dividends as they become due, subject to the right of the Government to redeem such \u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>annuities on payment of a stipulated sum; thus \u00a3100 three per cent, consolidated hank annuities, or three percent. <em>\u201c </em>consols \u201d as they are shortly termed, is a right to-receive three pounds per annum forever, subject to the right of the Government to redeem this annuity on payment of \u00a3100 sterling. Notwithstanding the absolute-inability of the creditor to sue for them, moneys invested in these public stocks or funds have uniformly been treated by the English Courts as <em>dioses in action. </em>In <em>Williams on Ex\u2019rs (7th Eng. Ed.) </em>846, and in <em>Roper on Husband &amp; Wife, </em>204, the learned authors include \u201c money in the funds,\u201d as falling under the description of <em>dioses in action-</em>of the wife which survive to her in case the husband fails to reduce them into possession during coverture, and the authorities cited by these eminent text writers fully sustain the position. In <em>Dundas vs. Duteus, </em>1 <em>Ves., Jr., </em>196, a sum of \u00a31000 in the three per cents, was declared by Lord Eldon to be a <em>chose in action, </em>and the same thing-was said by the Master of the Rolls, Sir Wm. Grant, in <em>Scawen vs. Blunt, </em>7 <em>Ves., </em>294, where the money in the-funds was held to survive to the wife. In <em>Wildman vs. Wildman, </em>9 <em>Ves., </em>174, a large sum in the three per cent, consolidated annuities was transferred to the name of a. married woman as next of kin of an intestate, and this upon the death of the husband without having done any act with reference to it, except signing partial transfers of' it by her, was held to survive to the wife. It is unnecessary to cite other authorities upon this point. If, then, the rights belonging to holders of the public debt of Great. Britain, which is redeemable at the pleasure of the debtor, and where by no possibility can a right of action accrue to the creditor, are nevertheless <em>dioses in action, </em>it would seem <em>afortioo\u00f1 </em>that the bonds in question which are payable to bearer and at a fixed future day, which pass by delivery and have become in fact negotiable securities, must be so-regarded. The truth is that this species of property was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>unknown to the common law. The public debt of England, as well as that of the United States, has been created in comparatively modern times, and when the Courts came to deal with shares, or rights, or investments in it, they necessarily classified them with <em>dioses in addon </em>as contra-distinguished from <em>dioses in \u00a1possession </em>which in ancient times consisted entirely of movable goods, visible and tangible in their nature. In this country no case has been cited, and we have found none, in which the question has directly arisen, hut in <em>Hutchins vs. State </em>Bank, 12 <em>Metcalfe, </em>421, Chief Justice Shaw, in delivering the opinion of the Court, said: \u201cA State bond or note, a certificate of a sum due from the State or United States, and ordinarily called <em>\u2018 </em>stock,\u2019 is a <em>chose in action </em>and an evidence of debt though no action lies for it.\u201d It is true this was a <em>dictum </em>in the case hut it is the <em>dictum </em>of an able and distinguished jurist speaking for a Court of high authority. We adopt it and pronounce these bonds as well as the certificates of city stock <em>dioses in action </em>of the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">2nd. The question whether the surviving husband during his life, and after the death of his wife, reduced them into his possession is equally free from difficulty. When Mrs. Hamill died the bonds were on special deposit in the Safe Deposit Company, where they had remained so on deposit since the 15th of December, 1871. The receipt given by the treasurer of that company on the last mentioned day, shows that Mrs. Hamill had deposited the bonds for safe-keeping \u201c through Alex. Hamill and subject to order of either.\u201d At her death this <em>receipt </em>and the <em>certificates </em>for the city stock, were in the possession of her brother Mr. Bokee, and he, after her death, on the 9th of April, 1878, delivered them to her surviving husband, (taking his receipt therefor) who was then sick and infirm and remained unable to leave his house up to the time of his death. After the 9th of April, 1878, his son James, at his request, applied to Mr. Robb,\u2019 the City Register, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>transfer the stock from the name of his wife to his own name, hut Mr. Robh declined to do this unless Mr. Hamill came to the office in person for that purpose. The son also at the request of his father, went to the Safe Deposit Company and there presented to Mr. Wisong, its treasurer, the <em>receipt </em>for the bonds, and requested delivery of them to him, and said he would surrender the receipt therefor, hut Wisong declined so to do, unless the father should appear in person, or execute a power of attorney to withdraw the bonds. Wisong then went to the residence of Mr. Hamill and was asked to go up to his chamber and receive a proper authority to deliver the bonds to hi\u00b0s son, which he declined to do, and in a few days thereafter Mr. Hamill, who was then very infirm, died. At that time he was paralyzed but down to the time of his death was of sound mind, and might have made his mark at any time if he was so inclined. On the second of June, 1878, after his death the bonds were delivered by the Company to the defendants, as his administrators, on the return of the receipt. After the death of his wife none of the coupons on the bonds were ever cut off and delivered to Mr. Hamill during his life. '</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We do not mean to say what ought to have been done by the husband, or what acts on his part would have been sufficient to effect a reduction of these <em>dioses in action </em>into his possession, but simply to decide that what was done in this case was wholly insufficient for that purpose. He never obtained manual possession of the bonds, (though we do not mean to say that would have been enough,) nor did he effect a transfer of the city stock into his own name. There is nothing to show he was not able at some time after the death of his wife, and before the 9th of April, 1878, to go in person to the Company\u2019s office, obtain the bonds and assign them for a valuable consideration, or sell them, or exchange them for other securities, and also to the Mayor\u2019s office and have the transfer of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>city stock to himself duly made. It may have been, and doubtless was, his misfortune that he became unable to do so after the 9th of April, 1878, or such inability may have continued from his wife\u2019s death, hut this will not justify the Court in relaxing the law for his benefit, or that of his representatives, and in depriving the wife\u2019s next of kin of the benefit which the law gives them in case no <em>acts </em>have been done sufficient to defeat the survivorship. The authorities are all one way on this subject, and it is clearly settled that a mere intention to reduce a wife\u2019s <em>dioses in action </em>into possession will not he sufficient; the acts to effect that purpose must he such as to change the property in them, or, in other words, must he something to devest the wife\u2019s property and to make that of the husband absolute. 1 <em>Bright on Husband and Wife, </em>48 ; <em>Roper on Husband and </em>Wife, 208; 1 <em>Williams on Ex\u2019rs, </em>857. There must he some decisive and unequivocal act on the part of the husband, not only showing an intention to devest the property of the wife hut which does in fact defeat such property. 3 <em>Redfield on </em>Wills, 189. The cases referred to by these writers, show that the mere pledge of his wife\u2019s <em>chose in action </em>by the husband, as security for his own debt, or the receipt by him of interest thereon, or even a part of the principal, will not defeat her right of suvivorship. Here no <em>act </em>whatever was done to devest the title of the wife, or her representatives. Some reliance was placed upon the terms in the receipt given by the Safe Deposit Company, to the effect that the bonds were subject to the order of \u201c either \u201d the wife or the husband, hut it was admitted the bonds belonged to her and that she owned them in \u201cher own right\u201d when the deposit was made, and it is clear she did not part with the legal dominion and control over them by accepting a receipt in these terms. <em>Murray vs. Cannon, </em>41 <em>Md., </em>466. The custody of them by the Company, after her death, was a continuance of the custody and deposit made by the wife, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>and was never actually, or legally, or constructively, terminated by the husband during his life.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b184-9\">(Decided 10th March, 1880.]</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">3rd. It was further argued that <em>trover </em>will not lie for the certificates of city stock, and that no recovery should he had on account thereof, because the stock still stands in the name of the wife on the hooks of the City Register and her administrator now owns it, if it does not belong to the husband\u2019s representatives. But by the terms of the certificates themselves, the stock can only he transferred at the Mayor\u2019s office upon their return and delivery,, and the defendants have refused to deliver them up on demand of the plaintiff. As was said in the case of <em>Hutchins vs. State Bank, </em>before referred to, a certificate of stock is a muniment of title of the same nature with the note or 'bond'of a private person, ordinarily called a <em>chose in action, </em>and it has heen decided hy this Court that <em>trover </em>may he maintained for the conversion of a promissory note or other <em>chose in action, </em>as well as for other personal property. <em>Winner vs. Penniman, </em>35 <em>Md., </em>163. Besides judgment in this action against the defendants, and payment of it will vest in them the legal title to this stock as well as to the bonds. We, therefore, see no error in allowing a recovery on account of these certificates. .</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">It follows there was no error in the rulings of the Court below upon the several prayers, and the judgment must he affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
