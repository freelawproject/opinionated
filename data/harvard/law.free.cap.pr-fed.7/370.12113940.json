Exceptions have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-16\">Barri\u00f3la &amp; Company had themselves leased a piece of land and they secured for the central a right of way over this and possibly some other land, and, in consideration of that, apparently the central increased its rent by $300 a year. This is a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>for $180, being one-balf year\u2019s payment and a month or two additional.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Tbe question is, Was this an operating expense before tbe receivership or was it a purchase or securing of a right of way, a matter analogous to original construction?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The question, if new, might not be entirely free from doubt, but it seems to the court that, under the rule in the case of the Fajardo Sugar Company\u2019s claim in this receivership, it should sustain the master. It would seem as though this is rather' an expense of construction. The rent was increased as a consideration for what Barri\u00f3la &amp; Company had done in the way of getting an increase of facilities for the central, and not so much as an operating expense paid to Barri\u00f3la &amp; Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The report of the master is confirmed and the exceptions overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
