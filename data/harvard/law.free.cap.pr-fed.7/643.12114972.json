A. O\u2019Neill, filed certain reports of his administration dated January 31, 1914, June 30, 1914, and December 31, 1914, showing his operations during those periods. The reports were certified by Sparrow, Harvey, &amp; Company, regular certified accountants. These reports were referred to the master for examination and the master, on March 5, 1915, files a report recommending that the accounts be \u201capproved unless some party having a proper interest files an exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-13\">1. The master\u2019s report is excepted to, apparently on the ground that the receiver\u2019s reports are not correct in form, as they are statements made by a firm of accountants to the receiver, and are not signed or verified by the receiver. In his accounts the receiver should state his receipts and disburse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>ments, and in the report which accompanies them he should describe the condition of the estate when he received it and the changes which have taken place since. Foster, Fed. Pr. 5th ed. \u00a7 321. Such accounts are referred to the master for examination, and the master acts in the place of the court in a- judicial, not a ministerial, capacity. Cowdrey v. Railroad Co. 1 Woods, 331, 334, Fed. Cas. No. 3,293. Any exception to a receiver\u2019s account should be taken at the time of the examination before the master. The object of this is to afford the master an opportunity to reconsider the point, and to enable the receiver to bring in additional evidence or make explanation. The practice perhaps resembles more that before a referee in bankruptcy than an ordinary reference to a master. The best way to call the court\u2019s attention to any error of the master is by filing a petition. High, Receivers, 4th ed. \u00a7 800. This was the English rule, but here an exception might be regarded as in the nature of a petition and passed on by the court. The review by the court upon such a petition is not by examining the items of the account in detail, or the evidence, but reviewing the principles adopted by the master. Ibid. The court can in its discretion direct an account to be reformed for manifest error (High, Receivers, \u00a7 801; Gunn v. Ewan, 35 C. C. A. 213, 93 Fed. 80), but this is putting an unnecessary burden upon the court and is not the best practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">It would seem in this case the accounts filed are not in the proper form for accounts by a receiver, and consist rather in a report by accountants of an auditing of his books. This has an advantage as giving information to the court and parties, but cannot be treated as a formal account by the receiver, either partial or final. A receiver is not entitled to an order of refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ence to examine and pass upon his accounts until he has presented a full and definite statement, itemizing various matters and verifying the account under oath. High, Eeceivers, \u00a7 801.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">2. A receiver should account annually, unless accounts at shorter intervals are required. Foster, Fed. Pr., \u00a7 321. It would seem that the receiver in this case should conform to this rule and file a report of all receipts and disbursements for his first year. It is not necessary that an order or process be had for that purpose. High, Eeceivers, \u00a7 797. In no other way can the parties to a cause be informed as to their rights, or the court act finderstandingly. If a receiver does not do this of his own accord, any party to the cause may move for such an account. High, Eeceivers, \u00a7 802.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">3. The form of the master\u2019s report is not proper. The receiver\u2019s reports are referred to him for examination and report. Hnder the wording of his report, if any exception is filed (as there has been), there is no recommendation by him, or indeed any definite report. There would be nothing gained by a reference to the master under such circumstances. In the case at bar it makes no practical difference, however, because the account is not strictly a receiver\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The exception is overruled in the shape in which the matter comes up. The receiver will doubtless, without any special order, make a full report of his first year\u2019s operations, so that his accounts may be passed in accordance with the above opinion. It seems unnecessary to take any further action in the matter at this time.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
