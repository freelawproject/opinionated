Stat. 1913, \u00a7 1591.. The opinion of the court expressed several times as to general demurrers, and which I may repeat briefly now, is that the conformity section of the Revised Statutes, \u00a7 914, Comp. Stat. 1913, \u00a7 1537, requires the Federal court, as far as may be, to follow the local practice, but where there is a Federal statute-which covers the subject, the Federal statute is superior. 2' Foster, Fed. Pr. 5th ed. \u00b6 455. And that is the construction which this court has put upon \u00a7 954. ..It is looking to other-matters, but it incidentally refers, \u201cin cases of demurrer (to-what) the party demurring specially sets down, together with his demurrer, as the cause thereof.\u201d This seems to show that the policy of the Federal practice is that, wherever there is a demurrer, the ground must be specially set out, and that is the basis of the opinions I have rendered several times. And unless counsel can show me that I am wrong in this construction of \u00a7 954, it would not make much difference what the local regulation is. I will be glad to look at the citations, but with a Very strong prepossession. If this is such a general demurrer,, I should have to overrule it. As to how counsel could later bring up the point would be a matter for him to determine. It might be possible to raise it in the answer, I do not know. But the point right now is that counsel has filed what may be ai general demurrer, and it is a question whether I can under the; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>previous rulings of the court go into the matter; hut I will he glad to have further citations on it. The case then is submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">N. B. \u2014 The demurrer was overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
