The referee disallowed the priority under \u00a7 64 of the bankruptcy act. Whereupon the creditor filed a petition for review and the matter has been certified up by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-13\">The bankruptcy law, \u00a7 64 (5), expressly recognizes priority and orders payment of (5) \u201cdebts owing to any person who, by the laws of the states or the United States, is entitled to priority.\u201d The Porto Rico Civil Code in \u00a7 1823 (7) provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>\u201cwith regard to specified personal property of tbe debtor tbe following are preferred: . . . (7) Credits for rents and leases for one year with regard to tbe personal property of tbe lessee existing on tbe estate leased and on tbe fruits thereof.\u201d Tbe referee refuses to allow a priority of payment to tbe claim of Fernandez, on tbe ground that while this section provided for such preference, tbe whole title in which it is found, on tbe \u201cConcurrence and Preference of Credits,\u201d relates to bankruptcy, and is superseded by tbe national bankruptcy act.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">There is no question that tbe national bankruptcy act supersedes all local bankruptcy provisions, but chapter 2, entitled \u201cClassification of Credits,\u201d is not necessarily connected with tbe bankruptcy provisions. Some of these provisions may be enforced when there is no actual bankruptcy, and there is no reason why there should not be in Porto Eico an order of payment of debts as in tbe states of tbe Union. Under tbe Foraker or organic act, \u00a7 8, tbe local laws of Porto Eico are continued in full force and effect, and they may be amended by tbe legislative authority provided for Porto Eico. Tbe provision in question giving priority to rents is not in conflict with tbe bankruptcy law, and will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Tbe court is unable to order payment because the other claims and thus priority are not before it. Tbe matter is therefore remanded to tbe referee in. bankruptcy for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
