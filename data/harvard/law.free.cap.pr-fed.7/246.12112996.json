It will he necessary first to discuss the method by which this result is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">1. It is a general rule of practice that a motion or petition is proper to secure the correction of any clerical error made during the term. Equity Rule Ho. 72; 2 Roster, Red. Pr. 1392. A petition for a rehearing is the proper method of correcting before enrolment errors in a decree which are not evidently clerical or accidental. 2 Roster, Red. Pr. 1395. A hill of review is proper when the remedy sought is the reversal or modification of a decree that has been signed and enrolled, where the error is one of law apparent upon the face of the decree, or one of fact shown by the discovery of new evidence. 2 Foster, Fed. Pr. 1402; Mitford &amp; T. Eq. Pl. &amp; Pr. 483, 486; 2 Bates, Fed. Eq. Proc. 756, 757. The error alleged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>the previous (enrolled) decree of this court is one of law, not of fact, and it would therefore appear that a motion is not the proper method of securing the relief sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">2. Solicitors for the present motion, however, allege that the order attacked is interlocutory and can he varied even at a subsequent term. Street, Fed. Eq. Pr. \u00a7\u00a7 1935, 2069. Supposing, therefore, the method of attack is correct, let us consider 'the order. The action of the court in allowing the claims, and preference in question was not interlocutory. As to one, a claim of the complainant was involved, and as to the other an intervening petition. Where, in a receivership case, an intervening creditor, by leave of court, files a petition of intervention, claiming an interest in or lien upon the property, and the court makes a decree fully determining the claim, this decree is a final decree and cannot be vacated by the court after expiration of the term. Where the amount is sufficient, as it is,, in the case at bar, an appeal will lie from the decree. 1 Foster,. Fed. Pr. \u00a7 259; 2 Bates, Fed. Eq. Proc. \u00a7 630; Fosdick v. Schall, 99 U. S. 235, 25 L. ed. 339; Rouse v. Letcher, 156 U. S. 47, 39 L. ed. 341, 15 Sup. Ct. Rep. 266; Virginia <em>&amp; </em>A. Coal Co. v. Central R. <em>&amp; </em>Bkg. Co. 170 U. S. 355, 42 L. ed. 1068, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep 657. The eases upon which this point has arisen are largely railroad receivership cases, but the principle is one. of .equity procedure applied to railroads, and not of railroads administered in equity, and is not at all controlled by this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">It would jseem, therefore, that the decrees now attacked' were final decrees entered and enrolled at a previous term,, and are not now subject to revision in this court. \u2022 , '</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">3. It is further contended that the petitioner has no standing in court, he not being an original party to the suit or a. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>party at the time of the intervention petition in question, and' not having leave of court to make this application. A court of' equity would he inclined to grant leave to any party in interest to raise a question material in a case, and will look beyond the mere matter of form. But from the considerations mentioned above it would not appear to be proper to grant leave-to the petitioner. The court feels itself unable to reconsider the merits of the order now attacked.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">It follows that the motion must be denied; and it is so-ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
