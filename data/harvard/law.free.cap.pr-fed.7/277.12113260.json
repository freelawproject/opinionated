The rule is absolute in its terms, and a similar practice obtains in other jurisdictions in equity. Poster, Fed. Pr. 5th ed. \u00a7 425. There would seem to be no reason why the same principle should not apply at common law, in accordance with the rule of this court. The reason of the rule is found not entirely in the presence or absence of property, but also in the protection of residents. No authority is cited for making a distinction between nonresidents with or without property, and the court sees no reason to construe the rule except according to its terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The motion therefore is granted. In all such cases, however, the clerk will see to it that the bonds are reasonable in amount.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
