W. Durfey, a real estate agent at Canton, Miss., and J. W. Davidson, a real estate agent at Dan-ville, Illinois, negotiated a deal between one John M. Hankey and James M. Tinsley whereby Hankey conveyed to Tinsley 120 acres of land, situated in Vermilion county, Illinois, for one-half interest in 2,200 acres of land situated in the State of Mississippi. Tinsley agreed to pay to Durfey and Davidson \u00a72,000 for their services, and in accordance with such agreement, executed and delivered to them the following written contract:</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-6\" pgmap=\"267\">\u201c This contract, made this twentieth day of December, 1897, by and between J. M. Tinsley, of Canton, Miss., party of the first part, and R. W. Durfey, of Canton, Miss., and J. A. Davidson, of Danville, Illinois, parties of the second part, witnesseth, the party of the first part agrees to pay the party of the second part $2,000 when the following described lands are sold or transferred, viz., south half of northeast quarter and the southeast quarter of northwest quarter of section thirty-one (31), in township twenty (20) north, range eleven (11) west' 2nd P. M., one hundred and twenty acres, more or less, situated in county of Vermilion, State of Illinois, out of the money received in sale of said land, providing said land sells for $75 per acre or over, and it is hereby understood between the parties that if the said land is sold for less than $75 per acre, the second parties are to receive $1,500 out of the sale or transfer for their commission in a certain deal between the party of first part and John M. Hankey of Danville, Illinois. It is further understood between these parties and the first party does hereby agree to place the above described lands in the hands of the second parties for sale, and that he will give them the exclusive control of the sale of said lands at whatever price the first party may place thereon. It is further agreed that when any portion of the above described land is sold, either of the above sums then becomes due and payable, said which sum is dependent upon the price paid per acre for said portion.</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-17\" pgmap=\"267\">Dated at Canton, Mississippi, this twentieth day of December, 1897.\u00b0</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b267-18\" pgmap=\"267\">J.

Within a few weeks afterward, Tinsley incumbered the lands with two mortgages and refused to give Durfey and Davidson exclusive control of the sale of the land, or fix a price for their sale. Thereupon, Durfey and Davidson presented to the Circuit Court of Vermilion County a bill in equity, claiming a lien upon the lands to the extent of $2,000, and asking a foreclosure of the same. Upon a hearing, the Circuit Court found the issues for the complainants, declared a lien in their favor to the amount of $2,000, and decreed a sale of the premises unless that sum should be paid them within thirty days.</p><attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-5\" pgmap=\"268\">Wm.

Upon the disputed question of facts, the testimony supports the findings of the master and the court.</p> <p id=\"b268-9\" pgmap=\"268(150) 269(17)\">Tinsley owed the complainants $2,000, for negotiating the trade between him and Hankey. Having failed to pay in cash and refusing to convey to Durfey so that.he could hold the title to the land as security for the debt, as he had promised, he executed a contract by which he agreed to give them the exclusive control of the sale of the land and to pay them out of the proceeds of such sale. In the event of sale, unquestionably, the contract gave complainants a lien upon the proceeds. While it allowed Tinsley the right to fix the price, it contemplated, and the law inferred that he should fix a reasonable price and that the sale should be made within a reasonable time. Equity treats that as done which ought to be done, and as Tinsley had refused to fix a price and had incumbered the title with mortgages, it follows as a logical sequence that complainants\u2019 debt became due and a lien on the land attached.</p> <p id=\"b269-4\" pgmap=\"269\">The form of the agreement Avhich shall create a lien is not very material, for equity looks at the intent and purpose rather than at the form; and so it has been held that an agreement in writing, Avhereby the contracting party indicates an intention to make some particular property, or the fund arising from the sale of it, security for a debt or other obligation, creates an equitable lien upon the property so indicated. 3 Pomeroy\u2019s Equity, Secs. 1235, 1236; Near v. Donnelly, 80 Mich. 130.</p> <p id=\"b269-6\" pgmap=\"269\">An agreement that certain claims shall be paid out of certain property is held to be an equitable mortgage. Seymour v. Freer, 8 Wallace, 202; Wylie v. Coxe, 15 Howard 415; Ketchem v. St. Louis, 101 U. S. 306; Donald v. Hewitt, 33 Ala. 534; Pinch v. Anthony, 8 Allen (Mass.) 536.</p> <p id=\"b269-9\" pgmap=\"269\">It is vigorously argued that complainants have an adequate remedy at 1-aAv, and can not, therefore, call to their aid a court of equity to enforce collection of the debt. The fact that they have a remedy in a court of law and could maintain an action of assumpsit and might proceed by attachment is no answer to an application to enforce an equitable lien. An equitable lien is one which a court of chancery recognizes as distinct from strictly legal rights, and is always open to enforce it, regardless of what right the applicant may have to proceedings in a court of law.</p> <p id=\"b269-17\" pgmap=\"269\">To the contention that the court erred in approving the master\u2019s report of sale because it fails to show that the land was offered in separate parcels, and because it was sold before the time within which the defendant was to pay the money, by the terms of the decree, had expired, it is only necessary to say that no motion to set aside the sale Avas made below, or any objection whatever raised to the master\u2019s report. The regularity of the sale is not properly before us; in fact, it does not appear from the abstract that any of the defects urged to the report exist. Decree affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b270-5\" pgmap=\"270\">Harker, P. J., dissenting:</p> <p id=\"b270-6\" pgmap=\"270\">The foregoing opinion expresses the views of a majority of the court. As I am unable to concur with my associates as to the written contract creating an equitable lien upon the land in question, I dissent.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
