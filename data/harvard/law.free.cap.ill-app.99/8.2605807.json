The Inland Printer Company is a corporation engaged in publishing a trade journal known as Inland Printer, circulated among the newspapers of the country. Henry O. Shepard is the president, the principal stockholder and the active manager of the Inland Printer Co.</p><p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b35-12\" pgmap=\"35\">The evidence showed that he was personally responsible for the publication in the Inland Printer of the article complained of and made the basis of this suit. The article is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-4\" pgmap=\"36\">\u201c Half-tone Humbugs. \u2014 Several inquiries have been received for an opinion regarding t.he \u2018 Fantastical \u2019 Half-Tone Supply Company of Baltimore, Maryland. This concern offers for $25 a complete half-tone outfit, including material and instructions so that a boy of fifteen can make half-tones at a cost much less than others can buy the copper on which to engrave them. Here is just one of the propositions of this concern : In the elaborate circulars with which they have flooded the newspapers, they show some single column half-tone proofs. The cost of materials for engraving these single column half-tones, they claim, is but three cents; they offer them to those receiving their circulars at fifty cents, \u2018 one-fifth the regular price \u2019\" charged for such work. In brief, this concern offers to sell for fifty cents half-tones which cost them, for material, only three cents, and for which other photo-engravers charge $2.50. Just think of the possibilities of money-making here. All this Baltimore company need do is to establish one of their $25 outfits in each of the principal cities and they could soon control the half-tone engraving of the country, up to 4x5 inches in size. Greater wealth than that of the Klondike would be theirs in time. But with a philanthropy as commendable as it is rare, this company offers an v one an opportunity to make a fortune. From one of their letters at hand they agree to send their complete outfit, materials and instructions, on receipt of five dollars, and for two dollars they will supply enough materials to keep your photoengraving establishment running two weeks. According to their circulars, a boy of fifteen can make six by 4^-half-tones in three hours, or eighteen per day. In two wrneks he would make 252 half-tones containing 15f square inches each, which, according to their circular, he can get eighteen cents per square inch for, or $714.42 in two weeks on an investment of seven dollars. This scheme leaves no field for the \u2018 gold brick \u2019 or \u2018 green goods \u2019 people. It also injures the business of the concerns,who advertise a complete printing outfit, \u2018 Every man his own printer,\u2019 for $1.50, or the easy-running dynamo for one dollar. It should be hardly necessary to warn people against these concerns, but they are likely to do Business while that saving of the experienced P. T. Barnum holds true, that \u2018 There is a fool born every minute.\u2019 \u201d</p><p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-5\" pgmap=\"36\">The narr., in two counts, sets up the foregoing article as a false, malicious and libelous publication. One of the pleas filed by appellant avers:</p><p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-4\" pgmap=\"37\">\u201c That the Inland Printer is published in the interests of those engaged in the printing business and all that relates thereto; that in the year 1898 the plaintiff distributed circulars as follows :</p><p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4\" pgmap=\"37\">(a) That half-tone making is a secret process, and gave a rough summary of its process.</p><p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"pAa\" pgmap=\"37\">(I&gt;) That with a day or so practice, in accordance with printed directions, any young person of moderate intelligence, for instance, a bright boy of fifteen, could learn to make half-tones as good as sample shown, 6 which have a far better printing quality than those formerly used.5</p><p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-8\" pgmap=\"37\">(e) That it would furnish for $25 its entire outfit, the right to use it and the printed instructions, which it designated as \u2018 a simplified and secret method,\u2019 so. that one of moderate intelligence, but without experience, could produce in three hours, at a cost for material of about three cents each, six half-tones, such as plaintiff\u2019s said circular, taken as a whole, represents to be the latest improvement ' in half-tones.</p><p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-9\" pgmap=\"37\">(d) That plaintiff\u2019s outfit would place one of moderate intelligence, but without experience, on a level footing with any firm -engaged in the business of making halftones.</p><p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-10\" pgmap=\"37\">(e) That plaintiff had perfected an invention which it describes as \u2018 a mechanism to automatically perform the difficult parts of the work, and to put the process within the reach of any one of moderate intelligence:\u2019</p><p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\" pgmap=\"37\">(f) That it is the very first means ever offered by which one can make local illustrations of any value whatever to any paper.</p><p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-12\" pgmap=\"37\">(g) That the profit is so large,6 fortunes are being made at it.5</p><p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-13\" pgmap=\"37\">And divers and sundry other untrue and misleading statements and representations. That plaintiff made such statements and representations knowing them to be untrue and misleading, as in fact they are, with the intent and purpose of inducing the public, by such false and misleading statements, etc., to purchase its said outfit and instructions in the belief that creditable and merchantable half-tones could be easily and cheaply produced (at about one-fifth the usual cost) by persons described by plaintiff, and thus enabled to compete with the regular trade and make large profits. (Copies of circulars are then set out in full.)</p><p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-14\" pgmap=\"37(18) 38(112)\">Wherefore defendants admit publication of article in controversy, and allege it was lawful for them to so publish it, as they were justified in so doing in the interest of and for the protection of those engaged in the printing business and all that relates thereto; that they published the same with good motives and for justifiable ends; that the said several words therein, and all proper and just intendments therefrom to be deduced, are true in substance and in fact; that the wares offered for sale by plaintiff in said circulars will not, in fact, enable the persons therein named to obtain the results therein promised, and the plaintiff was guilty thereby of false, fraudulent and misleading representations and statements in endeavoring to sell the same.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-4\" pgmap=\"38\">Another plea avers, in substance, the same facts as set up in plea above noted, except that it states, \u201c and the material and apparatus so made and sold by the plaintiff were humbugs and are worthless and unfitted for practical use in the production of half-tone pictures,\u201d etc.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\" pgmap=\"38\">The circular referred to in the alleged libelous article and by the pleas, is in part as follows :</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\" pgmap=\"38\">\u201c A New Facts.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\" pgmap=\"38\">ILLUSTRATION IS THE LIFE OF JOURNALISM.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ah3\" pgmap=\"38\">The latest -improvement in half-tones now used by the great metropolitan dailies is the form of illustration best adapted to newspapers.</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\" pgmap=\"38\">It does away with all the previous objections to halftone for newspaper purposes.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-10\" pgmap=\"38\">The only drawback now to its general use is the expense of making half-tones, which is higher than ever, owing to the large and expensive mechanical plants used, and the increase in the wage scale obtained by the Process Engraver\u2019s Association.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-11\" pgmap=\"38\">Also, half-tone making is a secret process, hedged about with restrictions (each shop only allowed to teach a very few apprentices) and so intricate and complicated that it takes years to perfect a workman, and then he usually understands only one branch.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-12\" pgmap=\"38\">It occurred to us that, although these were formidable difficulties to overcome, yet, after an expert had once overcome them, it was very practical for him to construct a mechanism to automatically perform the difficult parts of the work, and so to put the process within the reach of any one of moderate intelligence.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-13\" pgmap=\"38(21) 39(19)\">The next thing to accomplish was the making of said mechanism at a low price. It has required long and hard study to reduce the process to a simple system and mechanism, but finally we have been entirely successful.</p><p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-4\" pgmap=\"39\">We have just perfected the invention and protected our rights, and now for the first time offer the right to use the same.</p><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-5\" pgmap=\"39\">IT WILL OPEN A NEW ERA IN NEWSPAPER METHODS</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-6\" pgmap=\"39\">Because it is the very first means ever offered by which you can make local illustrations, which are the only illustrations of any value whatever to any paper.</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-7\" pgmap=\"39\">We have exhibited it to numbers, including many newspaper men, and the verdict has invariably been one of outspoken admiration of the results, and of the ease and cheapness of producing them.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-8\" pgmap=\"39\">We expect to see it in use in every newspaper office in the land.</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-9\" pgmap=\"39\">The invention consists in a camera of novel construction and with certain attachments peculiar to itself.</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b39-10\" pgmap=\"39\">Also an accompanying outfit of accessory apparatus, and our printed, simplified and secret method of operating the entire combined camera, outfit and process, from the copy to the half-tone ready for the printing press.

But on cuts under 4 x 5, we will charge you the full rate, because you can make them yourself, and it is to your interest that you should do so. This puts you on a level footing with any firm, because your customers need not know that you can make only 4x5 cuts.</p><p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-5\" pgmap=\"40\">Our terms are, for the entire outfit, the right to use it and our printed instructions, twenty-five dollars.</p><p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-6\" pgmap=\"40\">We ship all orders with sight draft attached to bill of lading.

Once it is known that you are illustrating, you will be flooded with photographs, drawings, eic.,</p><p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AcY\" pgmap=\"40\">of all sorts of local, attractive stuff, and all you will have to do will be to stick it up in front of the camera.</p><p data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Av\" pgmap=\"40\">In these stirring times especially, illustrating takes on a new value and opens new opportunities. For the job office work, you can make buildings, portraits, reproductions of lithographed letter heads, checks, original designs, catalogue illustrations and the thousand and one things that are always coming into a job office and needing illustration.</p><p data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-11\" pgmap=\"40\">And, besides all the profit, it is a beautiful and fascinating art.

The chances are that he will want to take up the process himself and illustrate your paper for you. At any rate, we are willing to rest our ca.se upon his judgment.</p><p data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-13\" pgmap=\"40\">Following is a detailed list of the articles comprising the outfit:</p><p data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-14\" pgmap=\"40\">One camera, without patent rigid slide channel, etc.</p><p data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-15\" pgmap=\"40\">SUPPLIES FOB YOUR FUTURE WOBK.</p><p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-16\" pgmap=\"40(56) 41(40)\">We shall be pleased to furnish you with the supplies you will need in the future, and will do so as cheaply and satisfactorily as any others.

To which question, over objection of appellant, the witness was permitted to answer, \u201c I do not.\u201d To this ruling of the court appellant preserved its exception. Witnesses called as experts testified that the prints made by appellee\u2019s device were not \u201c acceptable.\u201d In cross-examination, prints in half-tone used in copies of Chicago daily papers were shown to the witnesses and they were asked if such prints were, in their opinion, acceptable. The prints thus used were admitted in evidence. The appellant objected thereto and perserved exception. Much evidence was presented upon the truth or falsity of the various representations made by the circular issued by appellee.</p><p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-13\" pgmap=\"41\">The narr. charged special damage in the loss of one customer named. Appellant objected to evidence of a general falling off in appellee\u2019s sales, upon the ground that no other specific instances of loss were alleged in the narr. save the one.</p><p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-4\" pgmap=\"42\">The court overruled this objection and appellant excepted to the ruling.</p><p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\" pgmap=\"42\">Upon the trial the issues were submitted to a jury and a verdict was returned finding the appellant guilty and assessing appellee\u2019s damages at $5,000.</p><p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\" pgmap=\"42\">From judgment thereon this appeal is prosecuted.</p><attorneys data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-7\" pgmap=\"42\">James Hibben, attorney for appellants.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b42-8\" pgmap=\"42\">Ritchie, Esher &amp; Knobel, attorneys for appellee.</attorneys> <opinion data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b42-9\" pgmap=\"42\">Mr. Justice Sears</author> <p id=\"An\" pgmap=\"42\">delivered the opinion of the court. It is contended by appellant that \u201c the verdict and judgment are contrary to and not supported by the evidence or law,\u201d and upon this ground, among others, it is urged that the judgment should be reversed. To this contention we can not assent. The alleged libel charges, and the pleas of justification reiterate, in effect, that the appellee\u2019s wares are \u201c a humbug\u201d and are worthless and unfitted for practical use in the production of half-tone pictures. These statements of the publication were based upon an examination of a circular issued by the appellee commending its wares, and not upon examination of or experience with the apparatus offered for sale. If the statements are false and were maliciously made, a cause of action exists for any damage resulting.</p> <p id=\"b42-11\" pgmap=\"42\">The publisher of a trade journal may doubtless make any fair and reasonable discussion of the wares of a merchant or manufacturer who solicits public patronage, and may publish an honest expression of opinion upon the merits of such wares. But, under the guise of expressing an opinion upon' such _waresya-\u2019-publisher is not privileged to maliciously make any false statement of any material fact in relation to said wares; nor to maliciously make_any false statement of fact which shall impute to suchmereha-nt or manufacturer a want of integrity^in. his business.</p> <p id=\"b42-12\" pgmap=\"42(29) 43(382) 44(38)\">The issue of fact presented in this cause was as to whether the statements of the publication were false. That the appellants were responsible for the publication, that if false it was also malicious, and that some damage resulted, co\u00fcliTTi\u00e1rdryF\u00e9^considered as controverted in this record. Appellants pleaded the truth of the statements in justification of them. The question of fact presented was as to the sufficiency of the evidence to support such plea. This was a question for the jury, and we can not say that upon the evidence they might not have properly found, as they did, that the statements were in substance false. Appellants attempted to support their plea by proving that certain of the representations made by the circular were false. This, we think, they had a right to do. The publication was based upon an examination and criticism of the circular. The plea sets up the circular as false in justification. An issue was formed on replication to this plea. Therefore it was competent to show that the various statements of the circular were false. In this behalf, appellant undertook to establish that the process of half-tone making was not a secret process; that the process adopted by appellee did not operate automatically, and did not dispense with the use of poisons; that the process was not invented by appellee\u2019s employe and agent, but was known long before this device was put upon the market, and had been described in books upon the subject;' and that the representation to the effect that an inexperienced person could make half-tone cuts of commercial value by use of the device, was a false representation. But while this line of evidence was com-j \u25a0petent, yet the establishing of The\" falsity- of any one orb more of these various representations- of the \u2022 circular will j not q\u00ed itself and as a matter of law be conclusive against a | recovery by appellee. The publication and the plea of justification gO-beyond the mere assertion of the falsity of these -various statements of the circular. It is charged that the device -is_a \u201chmh'6ug.&gt;\u2019 and worthless, unfitted for making half-tone pictures of value, and in effect that appelleeis dishonest in the vending of the device. It was for the-jury to determine from all the evidence whether the plea was sustained, i. &lt;?., whether the evidence established that the device was a \u201c humbug,\u201d worthless and unfitted for use, and therefore that the appellee was dishonest in advertising and selling it. The evidence is conflicting, and we can not say that the determination of the jury, as expressed in the verdict-, is without support in the evidence.</p> <p id=\"b44-5\" pgmap=\"44\">We are of opinion that there was no error in admitting in evidence the prints in half-tone as contained in the Chicago daily papers, which were exhibited to the witnesses on cross-examination. These witnesses had testified as experts that the prints made by appellee\u2019s device were not commercially acceptable. To test their credibility as experts they were asked if the prints in the Chicago papers were, in their opinions, acceptable, and to explain why they were regarded by them as acceptable, while the prints made by appellee\u2019s process were not. The prints, having been thus, used in cross-examination, were admitted in evidence. We can not say that the court erred in admitting this cross-examination. Greater latitude is allowed in the going outside of facts in evidence for the purpose of cross-examining experts than is allowed in the examination of other witnesses, and the extent of such latitude is a matter resting largely on the sound discretion of the trial judge. 2 Jones on Evidence, 391.</p> <p id=\"b44-6\" pgmap=\"44\">We can not say that the learned trial court erred in the extent to which this cross-examination was permitted. We are of the opinion that there was no error in allowing appellee to show loss in the falling off of its sales after the publication. Whether such loss was attributable to the. publication was for the jury to determine from all the evidence. If it had been attempted to show the loss of specific-customers, and such loss was not alleged specially in the declaration, the ground of' objection urged by counsel would be good. But such objection does not apply to proving a general decrease of the business. '</p> <p id=\"b44-7\" pgmap=\"44\">There remains one other question of procedure to be considered, and we consider it as controlling of the- appeal. The manager of the appellee company, when testifying for appellee, was asked in relation to the falling off of appellee\u2019s sales:</p> <blockquote id=\"b45-3\" pgmap=\"45\">\u201c Do you know of any reason except this libelous article in the Inland Printer to which to assign the fact that since then you have sold so few?\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b45-4\" pgmap=\"45\">This question was objected to by counsel for appellant upon the ground, among others, that it called for the conclusion of the witness. The objection was overruled, to which appellant preserved its exception. The witness answered, \u201c I do not.\u201d In this ruling we think there was error. It permitted the witness to usurp the function of the jury, to canvass the evidence and to determine from it all that the only reason for the loss was the libel. The jury might well have rested upon this evidence, given to them as competent, and have based their measurement of the damages thereon, without attempting to determine from all the facts whether the opinion and conclusion of the witness was correct or not. In a case where the evidence is conflicting, and where the damages assessed by the jury are large, we can not disregard this error, or view it as any other than reversible. It is altogether too likely that it influenced the jury to the prejudice of appellant. Having objected to the admission of this evidence, and having preserved an exception to the ruling of the court in overruling the objection, appellant urged this as one of the grounds for a new trial, and now presents it as one of its assignments of error.</p> <p id=\"b45-5\" pgmap=\"45\">For the error thus assigned the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p> <p id=\"b45-6\" pgmap=\"45\">We find no other error in procedure. Eeversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
