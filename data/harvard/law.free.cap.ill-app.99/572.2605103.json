From a judgment against him there rendered the defendant appealed to the County Court and from the judgment of that court appealed to this court, where the judgment of the County Court was reversed because the case had been prematurely placed and tried upon the short cause calendar. (87 Ill. App. 590.)</p><p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b598-15\" pgmap=\"598\">The cause having been remanded to the County Court, appellant objected to its being re-docketed and moved that it be stricken from the short cause calendar. The objection was overruled and the motion denied.</p><p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b598-16\" pgmap=\"598\">The plaintiff served on defendant a notice as provided by statute to place the cause on the short cause calendar, and it was, despite defendant\u2019s strenuous objections, so placed, and thereafter tried, defendant refusing to appear at the trial.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b598-17\" pgmap=\"598(8) 599(27)\">JSTo evidence save defendant\u2019s note was introduced, whereupon the court gave a written instruction to the jury to find the issues for the plaintiff and assess his damages at \u00a786.77, which the jury did.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b599-4\" pgmap=\"599\">Defendant moved for a new trial and in arrest; these motions were overruled and judgment was entered on the verdict.</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b599-5\" pgmap=\"599\">From this judgment defendant prosecutes this appeal.</p><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-6\" pgmap=\"599\">Czarnecki &amp; Koraleski, attorneys for appellant.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b599-7\" pgmap=\"599\">E.

If it is desired to present rules of the County Court for the consideration of this court, they should be embodied in a bill of exceptions by the certificate of the court that such rules were, at the time, existing.</p> <p id=\"b599-13\" pgmap=\"599(119) 600(67)\">The bill of exceptions in this case is merely that appellant\u2019s attorney made affidavit that there were certain rules. So, too, as to orders of court; they can not be brought before this court by an affidavit that at certain times such orders were made, moved for and denied or entered. Mor can we accept as conclusive the affidavit of appellant\u2019s counsel that \u201c the clerk of the County Court of Cook County \u201d did not, \u201c as by paragraph 14 of an act in regard to practice in courts of record, approved February 22, 1872, is required of him, furnish the judge of the court and the bar at each of said terms (December, 1899, January, February, March, April nor May of the year 1900) with a copy of the docket of causes pending in the County Court of Cook County in which should be set down all law cases in order according to the date of the commencement,\u201d or the conclusion of the affiant that the clerk had not complied with paragraphs 15 and 16 of the act of February 22, 1872.</p> <p id=\"b600-4\" pgmap=\"600\">We find fastened to the record printed pamphlets purporting to be, one a calendar of cases in and the other rules of the County Court; but no certificate of the judge that they are or ever were such.</p> <p id=\"b600-5\" pgmap=\"600\">In the motion for new trial it is said, \u201c The court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial instanter.\u201d Presuming that thereby is meant that the court erred in instantly overruling the motion for a new trial, we find no error in this regard.</p> <p id=\"b600-6\" pgmap=\"600\">Finding no error requiring a reversal of the judgment it is affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
