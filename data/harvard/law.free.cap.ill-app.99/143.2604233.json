A declaration was first filed February 23, 1898.</p><p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-8\" pgmap=\"170\">The declaration avers that appellee fell upon this sidewalk, whereby she suffered a severe laceration of one of her kidneys and sustained a shock to her spine and nervous system, and other \u201c injuries, hurts and bruises, external and internal,\u201d and is permanently injured, and has suffered great and constant pain since her injury.</p><p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-9\" pgmap=\"170\">An amendment filed March 21, 1900, is as follows:</p><p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-10\" pgmap=\"170\">\u201cAnd plaintiff, Annie Doolan, then and there sustained severe and permanent dislocation and injuries to her uterus or womb, which made it impossible, or very improbable that she be able, at any time during her life, to bear children, and said injuries then and there sustained have caused her to become insane, which condition is permanent and incurable, and which has necessitated her confinement in a State asylum for the insane.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-11\" pgmap=\"170(34) 171(26)\">A plea of the general issue was filed to said declaration, and a trial had in the Superior Court, which resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee for the sum of $9,000, to reverse which judgment this appeal is taken. On the trial appellee did not testify, being at that time confined in a State asylum for the insane.</p><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b171-4\" pgmap=\"171\">Andrew J.

The answers of the jury under the head of family history contains the following: \u201cPrevious attack. First time</p> <p id=\"b171-11\" pgmap=\"171\">she was ever affected. Assigned cause, womb trouble. Present attack started three weeks ago.\u201d The verdict declares that her disease is of three weeks\u2019 duration; that the cause is unknown. She was ordered to be confined at Kankakee and was there at the time of the trial.</p> <p id=\"b171-12\" pgmap=\"171\">Under the evidence there is a good deal of doubt as to whether the injury to her was permanent, or her insanity caused thereby.</p> <p id=\"b171-13\" pgmap=\"171(30) 172(25)\">The case was tried upon the part of the plaintiff upon the theory that her insanity is permanent. Under the circumstances developed by the evidence we regard the judgment of $9,000 as excessive. The action brought was not for a solatium to her husband or other kin, but for damage by her sustained.</p> <p id=\"b172-5\" pgmap=\"172\">If the husband has sustained damages by reason of the injury to his wife they can not be recovered in this action.</p> <p id=\"b172-6\" pgmap=\"172\">If the plaintiff shall within ten days remit from the judgment all in excess of $5,000 it will be affirmed for that sum, otherwise it will be reversed and the cause remanded. Affirmed on remittitur.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
