While in a general way it denies tbe contract as set forth in tbe plaintiff\u2019s statement and alleges defective performance of tbe work done, it particularly relies on tbe item as follows: \u201cAmount paid to tbe plaintiff by tbe defendant was 3~3,d\u00a75-\u201d This statement is so ambiguous that it is impossible to interpret this meaning as fixing any payment of any sum of money. For this reason alone, tbe court was warranted in making tbe order complained of. Tbe affidavit of defense should state tbe facts specifically, and with sufficient detail to enable tbe court to say whether or not they amount to a defense; and it is bad <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>for uncertainty when the averment of a fact or of an inference of law from particular facts is not clearly set forth: Superior National Bank v.
