There is no evidence before the court to show a revival of the claim by- an acknowledgment of the defendant orally or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The assignments of error challenge that action of the court. No printed argument was filed by appellee, nor have we been referred to any authorities sustaining the order made.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">The Act of June 20, 1919, P. L. 515, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AG-\">\u201cExcept as modified by this act or by its own rules duly adopted by a majority of the judges, the practice and procedure in the municipal court shall be the same as the practice and procedure in the Courts of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County as fixed by the acts of assembly heretofore or hereafter enacted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">The Practice Act of 1915, P. L. 483 (Sections 3 and 4) abolished pleas and demurrers and provided that \u201cQuestions of law heretofore raised by demurrer shall be raised in the affidavit of defense, as provided in section twenty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">The defense of the statute of limitations was not raised by a demurrer prior to the adoption of the rule of court. \u201cThe statute of limitations is a defense upon facts, and must be pleaded. It cannot be made by a demurrer which raises only an issue of law. It is not a defense absolute of which the court will take judicial notice on the plaintiff\u2019s presentation of his case, either in his declaration or at the trial, for if the defendant does not chose to make it, it is not a part of the case at all......\u201d: Barclay v. Barclay, 206 Pa. 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">We find no legal insufficiency in the- statement of claim. The judgment is reversed and the record remitted to the court below for further proceedings-.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
