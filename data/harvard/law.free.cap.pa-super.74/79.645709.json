Before Finletter, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-9\">From the record it appeared that four shipments of tobacco were consigned to the plaintiffs in Philadelphia from points in North Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia. The defendant company was the initial carrier as to one of the shipments and the terminal carrier as to the other three. The shipments arrived in Philadelphia on or about September 26,1916, were delivered by the defendant to the driver of a truck, who subsequently stole the property in question. The plaintiffs denied the authority of the driver of the truck to receive the goods in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>their behalf, and made demand of the defendant for the value of the packages which were stolen.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-3\">Verdict for plaintiff for $1,035 and judgment thereon.

Defendant appeals and assigned two errors : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>(1) the refusal of the court to enter judgment n. o. v.; (2) the refusal to grant a new trial. The only exception taken to the charge was to the refusal of binding instructions for defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">(1) Witnesses for defendant testified that the tobacco arrived and was delivered to a drayman; and the verdict determines that the delivery was to an unauthorized person. That breach of contract being found, a consequent liability to plaintiffs in some amount arises, and accordingly judgment non obstante can not be entered. Appellant also contends that since the tobacco was shipped on bills of lading describing the shipments as \u201cthe property described below in apparent good order except as noted (contents and condition of contents of packages unknown),\u201d plaintiffs must prove that the tobacco described as shipped was actually delivered to the initial carrier. Plaintiffs concede that. Defendant contended during the trial that the depositions read in evidence by plaintiffs to show that the packages contained the tobacco when delivered to the first carrier, did not show that fact, and plaintiffs met that contention by putting in the affidavit of defense, in which defendant neither had denied specifically nor by necessary implication that the tobacco had been delivered to the first carrier as averred in the statement of claim. The affidavit of defense stated that defendant \u201cadmits that on or about the 12th day of September, 1916, it received ......twenty cases marked \u2018Smoking Tobacco\u2019 for ......delivery to plaintiffs......but that it has no knowledge of the contents nor of the value of the contents of said cases or any of them and demands proof thereof at the trial.\u201d Sections 6 and 8 of the Practice Act of 1915 (P. L. 484) provide that, (with certain inapplicable exceptions) every allegation of fact in plaintiff\u2019s statement of claim \u201cshall be taken to be admitted,\u201d if \u201cnot denied specifically or by necessary implication in the affidavit of defense,\u201d and that it shall not be sufficient merely \u201cto deny generally the allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tions of the statement of claim.\u201d As Judge Finletter said in refusing judgment below: \u201cIt is obvious that an averment of ignorance and a demand for proof are not a \u2018specific denial\u2019 nor the \u2018implication\u2019 of denial. Indeed they are not even a \u2018general denial\u2019 so that if the act means anything the plaintiff\u2019s detailed statement of the contents of the packages must be \u2018taken to be admitted.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\">(2) As no abuse of discretion appears and no argument was made in support of the second assignment, it is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
