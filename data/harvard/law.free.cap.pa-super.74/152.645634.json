Where a lease provided that if the lessor should give one month\u2019s notice previous to the expiration of the term or any extension or renewal thereof, of an intention to change the terms and conditions of a lease, and the lessee should hold over after Such notice, he should he considered lessee under the terms and conditions mentioned in such notice, the lessor may give such notice at any time at leaat a month prior to the expiration of the original term and any renewal thereof, and if the lessee holds over he is bound by the terms of the notice.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b176-7\">2. The privilege to change the terms of the lease is not confined to the original term. The conditions may be changed only once during the original term or only once during any single extension or renewal thereof, but if the tenant holds over after notice of such change, the lease is renewed subject to such changes, with all the privileges reserved to the parties in the written lease, including the provisions relative to notice of change of terms and conditions. No hardship is done the lessee by this construction, for if not satisfied with the change of terms he is not bound to remain. His holding over is equivalent to the acceptance of the new terms and conditions.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b176-8\">Swigert v. Hartzell, 20 Pa.

The lessee held over after such notice, but claimed that it was ineffective to change the rent, on the ground that the lease authorized but one such change.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The authority cited in support of this proposition is the case of Swigert v. Hartzell, 20 Pa. Superior Ct. 56. In that case it was held that a clause in a lease for one year granting the \u201cprivilege of rerenting and remaining on said premises at same rental and conditions for any number of years that\u201d the tenant might desire, was exhausted by a notice renewing the lease for a definite term of one year more; that it was not equivalent to a perpetual leas\u00e9 at the will of the lessee. The lease did not provide that the same privilege should extend to renewals or extensions of the lease, and was held not to contemplate numerous rerentings. As the court said: \u201cNowhere is the lease expressive of an option or privilege to be exercised more than once.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In the lease now under consideration, it is expressly provided that notice of an intention to change the terms and conditions of the lease may be given not only during the original term but during any extension or renewal thereof. The terms and conditions may be changed only once during the original term or only once during any single extension or renewal thereof, but if the tenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>holds over after notice of such change, the lease is renewed subject to such changes, with all the privileges reserved to the parties in the written lease including the provision relative to notice of change of terms and conditions. No hardship is done the lessee by this construction, for if not satisfied with the changed terms he is not bound to remain.' His holding over is equivalent to an acceptance of the new terms and conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The circumstances in the case of Swigert v. Hartzell, were unusual and the previous acts of the parties themselves showed a construction of the lease consonant with that of this court, and inconsistent with an intention to create a perpetual lease at the will of the lessee. While such a lease may be created, (Effinger v. Lewis, 32 Pa. 367), the intention to do so must be clearly expressed in the lease. The question of a perpetual lease does not arise here. Either party may sever the relationship by one month\u2019s notice, and there is no reason for departing from the usual rule that where a tenant remains in possession of the demised premises after the expiration of the term without any new agreement, the presumption is that he holds the premises subject to all such covenants contained in the original lease, as are applicable to his present situation: Phillips v. Monges, 4 Wharton 226; especially so, when, as here, the clause under consideration is expressly stated to apply to any extension or renewal of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It follows that the appellant having held over after \u25a0notice was given that the rent would be raised to $25 per month, was bound to pay the increased rental, and having refused to do so, the appellee was justified in taking the steps to eject him provided for by the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The order of the court below is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
