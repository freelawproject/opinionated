The basic issues at the trial were the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of negligence on the part of the defendant driver and the defendant\u2019s allegations of contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff driver, who was allegedly operating the automobile as the agent of the other plaintiff, the owner of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-12\">Although the plaintiff driver and the plaintiff owner both appealed, only the plaintiff driver submitted a brief. She asserted two claims of error \u2014 \u25a0 that the verdict should have been set aside as against the evidence and that the court erred in its charge concerning the application of \u00a7 14-231 of the General Statutes, which provides that vehicles proceeding in opposite directions should pass to the right of each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>There was ample evidence to support a finding by the jury that the defendant was not negligent or that, if he were, the plaintiff driver, in operating at excessive speed, was contributorily negligent. The verdict was a general one and the presumption is that the jury found all the issues for the defendant. <em>Harry A. Finman &amp; Son, Inc. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Truck &amp; Trailer Service Co., </em>169 Conn. 407, 410, 363 A.2d 86; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Niemann, </em>137 Conn. 81, 83, 74 A.2d 876. The denial of the motion to set aside the verdict as against the evidence was fully justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">We find no error in the court\u2019s charge and even if there were, since it related to the question of the plaintiff driver\u2019s contributory negligence, the general verdict must stand. \u201cIf there is no error in the instructions as to one of two distinct defenses, a general verdict for the defendant should be sustained.\u201d <em>Meglio </em>v. <em>Comeau, </em>137 Conn. 551, 553, 79 A.2d 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
