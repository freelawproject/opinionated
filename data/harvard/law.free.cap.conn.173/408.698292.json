Their appeal was dismissed upon the granting of the defendant\u2019s motion to erase, and from that judgment, upon granting certification, the plaintiffs have appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Pursuant to yi 8-8<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and 8-9<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the General Statutes, the plaintiffs took their appeal to the Court of Common Pleas within fifteen days of the publication of the decision by the defendant commission. The appeal, however, failed to follow \u00a7 8-8 since it contained only a recognizance of an individual, without any surety, that the plaintiffs would prosecute the appeal to effect and pay any costs for which judgment might be rendered against them. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>the filing of the defendant\u2019s motion to erase, grounded, inter alia, upon the failure to comply with \u00a7 8-8, the plaintiffs amended their appeal within the first thirty days after the return day as provided for by \u00a7 52-128 of the General Statutes<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 131<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to include a proper recognizance with surety in accordance with the requirements of \u00a7 8-8.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The defendant commission argues, inter alia, first, that since the statutory requirements for the taking of an appeal were not complied with, the court did not have jurisdiction and the defect could not be cured, and second, that even if such a defect might be corrected pursuant to \u00a7 52-128, the plaintiffs lost their right to amend once the defendant had filed its motion to erase. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">Although the giving of a proper bond or recognizance is an essential element in the taking of an appeal; <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Des Reis, </em>136 Conn. 627, 630, 73 A.2d 327; a statutory provision requiring such a bond is solely for the benefit of the defendant. <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>111 Conn. 112, 113, 149 A. 252; <em>Ormsbee </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>16 Conn. 567, 574. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>tiffs\u2019 failure to provide a proper bond or recognizance was a serious irregularity, but it did not destroy the jurisdiction of the court over the subject matter of the action. <em>Butterfield </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>supra. Since the omission was not fatal to the appeal, it could have been waived by the defendant;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>166 Conn. 102, 107, 347 A.2d 53; <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Rankin, </em>51 Conn. 326, 327; and could have been cured by the plaintiffs by filing a timely amendment. <em>Corden </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>131 Conn. 654, 657-58, 41 A.2d 912; 2 Am. Jur. 2d, Administrative Law, \u00a7 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">The so-called \u201cappeal\u201d to a court from an administrative board or agency \u201cis not an appeal in the sense of a transfer of jurisdiction from one court to another, but simply provides \u2018a process, under the misleading name of appeal, for invoking the judicial power to determine a legal injury complained of, or the legality of an act done by the officers of another department.\u2019 <em>Malmo\u2019s Appeal, </em>72 Conn. 1, 6, 43 Atl. 485.\u201d <em>DeFlumeri </em>v. <em>Sunderland, </em>109 Conn. 583, 585, 145 A. 48; <em>Colonial Beacon Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>128 Conn. 351, 354, 23 A.2d 151; <em>Rommell </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>127 Conn. 16, 22, 15 A.2d 6. Nor may such an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas rightfully be called a \u201ccivil action.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Bank Building &amp; Equipment Corporation </em>v. <em>Architectural Examining Board, </em>153 Conn. 121, 214 A.2d 377; <em>Carbone </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>126 Conn. 602, 13 A.2d 462. The method of initiating judicial review of the decision of a zoning board or commission under \u00a7 8-8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>however, is in the nature of civil process. \u201cIn appeals from administrative agencies, the writ is properly designated as a citation though it serves the same function.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 104 n.; Stephenson, Conn. Civil Proc. \u00a7 18. \u201cA citation is a writ issued out of a court of competent jurisdiction, commanding a person therein named to appear on a day named to do something therein mentioned.\u201d <em>Sheldon </em>v. <em>Sheldon, </em>100 N.J. Eq. 24, 30, 134 A. 904; Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary (3d Ed.); see <em>Johns </em>v. <em>Phoenix National Bank, </em>6 Ariz. 290, 295, 56 P. 725. Similar to the writ used in civil process, the citation is simply a \u201cdirection to the officer to summon the agency whose decision is being appealed.\u201d Stephenson, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">A recognizance for costs must be contained within a writ of civil process, ibid.; and, in appeals brought under \u00a7 8-8, a proper bond or recognizance must similarly be made a part of the citation. Section 52-128 of the General Statutes and Practice Book \u00a7 131 allow a plaintiff to amend as of right any defect, mistake or informality in the writ within the first thirty days after the return day. In the instant case, the plaintiffs\u2019 right to amend the citation in order to remedy their defective bond was likewise authorized by the above provisions. <em>Corden </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra. \u201cOur practice does not favor the termination of proceedings without a determination of the merits of the controversy where that can be brought about with due regard to necessary rules of procedure.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>supra, 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The defendant argues, relying on <em>Village Creek Homeowners Assn. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>148 Conn. 336, 170 A.2d 732, that once its motion to erase had been filed the court was obliged to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>pose of the question of jurisdiction before any motion or pleading of the plaintiffs could be entertained. The present case may be distinguished from <em>Village Creek </em>in that there was no \u201cmotion or pleading\u201d to \u201cbe entertained\u201d by the court in this case because the amendment was as of right under \u00a7 52-128 and Practice Book \u00a7 131 and took effect ab initio. Furthermore, in that case, the plaintiff\u2019s appeal from the decision of the administrative agency was fatally defective in that it contained no citation directing the deputy sheriff to make service upon either the defendant Public Utilities Commission or the defendant Connecticut Light and Power Company and to summon them to appear in court. Id., 338. Without a citation signed by competent authority, the officer to whom it is given for service receives no power or authority to execute its command, and becomes \u201clittle more than a deliveryman.\u201d Id., 339. Since the defect in <em>Village Creek </em>could not be cured by amendment, the trial court was correct in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend and in granting the defendants\u2019 motion to erase. See <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Richard, </em>145 Conn. 24, 138 A.2d 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\">The irregularity in the plaintiffs\u2019 citation is precisely the type of circumstantial defect envisioned by $ 52-128 and Practice Book \u00a7 131. Before the trial court had ruled on the defendant\u2019s motion, the plaintiffs had effectively remedied this defect by amendment as of right within thirty days after the return day. See <em>Felletter </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>133 Conn. 277, 281, 50 A.2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to proceed according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-7\">\u201c[General Statutes] See. 8-8. appeals from board to court, review by supreme court.
