The trial court filed a detailed memorandum of decision. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>34 Conn. Sup. 31, 375 A.2d 1039. After examining the record on appeal, including the plaintiff\u2019s massive attack on the trial court\u2019s finding, and after considering the briefs of the parties and their arguments, we have concluded that there is no error in the judgment from which the appeal was taken and that the memorandum of decision filed by the trial court adequately and properly answered the contentions of the parties. Reference to that decision of the trial court may be had for a detailed discussion of the facts and the applicable law. It would serve no useful purpose to repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
