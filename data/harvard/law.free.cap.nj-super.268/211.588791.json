Bernhard, J.S.C., in his written opinion, reported at 259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>482, 614 A.2d 189 (Law Div.1992). It is clear that <em>N.J.S.A </em>17:28-1.4 was viewed by the Legislature as a necessary part of the reform needed to accomplish its goal of relieving insurers from having to pay non-economic damages to people who are not seriously injured. The Legislature\u2019s action in extending the verbal threshold to certain out-of-state owners operating their vehicles in this state serves many legitimate purposes, only one of which is the providing of Personal Injury Protection coverage to out-of-state drivers at the same level as is provided for New Jersey motorists. In <em>Adams v. Keystone Insurance Co., </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>367, 378, 624 A.2d 1008 (App.Div.1993), we held that such automatic reformation of out-of-state policies issued by insur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ers doing business in New Jersey is justified by a significant and legitimate public purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Further, we are convinced that Judge Bernhard properly applied the holding in <em>Oswin v. Shaw, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>290, 609 A.2d 415 (1992), in determining that plaintiff failed to meet the verbal threshold. Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate any basis for disturbing that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
