Behind the Jacob vehicle and involved in an impact with the Jacob vehicle prior to the impact between the Jacob and Kiss vehicles were automobiles of the defendants, Warnebold and Marold. Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>tiffs<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> instituted suit against the operators of the three succeeding vehicles. A third party complaint was later filed against the operators of the three vehicles, Palacios, Patel, and Agaba which were proceeding in front of the Kiss vehicle. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was also amended to name the operators of these three vehicles. Defendants Marold, Patel, Agaba, and Palacios successfully moved for summary judgment to dismiss the claims against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Immediately prior to trial, plaintiffs settled with defendant Warnebold for her $100,000 insurance policy. At a liability trial against defendant Jacob, the issue of the alleged negligence of both Jacob and Warnebold was submitted to the jury. The jury concluded that Warnebold was negligent, but that her negligence was not a proximate cause of the accident which caused plaintiffs injury. The jury found Jacob 100% at fault for the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Early in the course of discovery, plaintiffs served interrogatories on Jacob\u2019s attorney. Interrogatory # 35 requested information whether photographs existed relevant to this case. Initially, Jacob\u2019s response was \u201cno.\u201d Thereafter, in October and November 1991, representatives of Jacob obtained photographs and videotapes depicting plaintiff engaging in certain activities. By letter of November 22, 1991, Jacob amended his interrogatories to update his answers, including supplemental answers to the questions dealing with, among other matters, any persons with relevant knowledge and photographs. As part of that amendment, Jacob supplied the names and addresses of three individuals (employees of Interprobe, Inc., who had been involved in surveillance of the plaintiff). Interrogatory #35, dealing with photographs, read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Do you or does anyone on your behalf have any photographs of the scene of the accident or the persons involved or of any object involved? If so, state: (a) name and address of person taking such photographs; (b) date photographs were taken; (c) name and address of the person, firm or corporation in whose possession the photographs are at the present time; and (d) description of what each photograph shows.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>The supplemental response supplied in the November 22, 1991 letter stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">Photographs of the vehicles involved in the accident, defendant Warnebold\u2019s vehicle, and plaintiff are in the possession of defendant Jacob\u2019s attorney, and on information and belief, additional photographs are contained in the file of the attorney of the defendant Warnebold. The photographs were taken at various times after the accident. All photographs are available for inspection in the offices of defendant Jacob\u2019s attorney or defendant Warnebold\u2019s attorney on reasonable notice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">For five months between November 22, 1991, and the date of the trial on damages, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney never made any request to see the \u201cphotographs,\u201d nor did he make any inquiry as to the nature of the knowledge possessed by the persons named with relevant knowledge who took the photographs and videotapes. Interrogatory # 35 was the only interrogatory served by plaintiff which, arguably, asked Jacob to provide any information related to photographs. No interrogatory, or other discovery request, made specific reference to videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">After the plaintiffs presented their proofs in the trial on damages, Jacob offered into evidence the testimony of two of the photographers and videographers who took photographs and videotapes of the plaintiff, Joszef Kiss. Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney objected to the testimony of these individuals as well as the introduction into evidence of approximately sixty photographs (marked as a package) and the videotapes, but the trial judge permitted this evidence. The judge ruled that the letter dated November 22, 1991, specifically alerted plaintiffs\u2019 attorney to the fact that photographs and/or videotapes of the plaintiff, Joszef Kiss were in the possession of the attorneys for Jacob.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The jury rendered a verdict in favor of both plaintiffs, against Jacob in the aggregate of $45,000. Joszef Kiss was awarded $37,500 for lost earnings and $5,000 for his injuries. Edith Kiss was awarded $2,500 for her <em>per quod </em>claim. Following the jury\u2019s verdict, Jacob moved to reduce the award based upon personal injury protection (\u201cPIP\u201d) benefits received by Joszef Kiss and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>collateral source set-offs. The judge reduced plaintiffs\u2019 award to $11,500 (the net lost income claim) plus pre-judgment interest of $3,102.29. Plaintiffs then moved for a new trial and/or an additur, which was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Upon appeal, plaintiffs have elected not to order a transcript of the motion for a new trial, nor of any of the trial testimony by plaintiffs, their doctors and other witnesses. Plaintiffs do not appeal from that aspect of the order denying a new trial, but appeal only with respect to the order molding the verdict, and with respect to the trial court\u2019s decision to allow the jury to hear the testimony of the surveillance witnesses and to view the photographs and videotapes. Defendant Jacob cross-appeals from that part of the order molding the jury verdict which allowed some of the lost income award to stand despite <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\u2014I\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Both plaintiffs\u2019 depositions were taken originally on September 6, 1989. At the request of defendant Jacob, plaintiffs activities on October 23, 24, and 25, and November 8 and 20,1991, were videotaped by Robert Andrews and Robert Higgins of Interprobe, Inc. By letter of November 6, 1991, in preparation for the upcoming damages trial, Jacob\u2019s attorney requested that plaintiffs be produced for re-deposition regarding developments since their first deposition. That re-deposition took place on November 20, 1991. By letter of November 22, 1991, Jacob amended his interrogatories to include Higgins and Andrews as witnesses and to amend his answer to # 35 advising plaintiffs that photographs existed of defendant Warnebold\u2019s vehicle and plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">The genesis of a party\u2019s obligation to provide discovery to his adversary inheres not in any general obligation to expose the defenses available to a client, but rather in the Court Rules and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>decisional law interpreting the rules applicable to discovery. An attorney\u2019s primary obligation to his client is to provide the best defense possible within the framework of the law. This is particularly so in this case, where plaintiff alleged an injury and damages claim<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which, if accepted by the jury, would have resulted in a jury verdict exceeding Jacob\u2019s insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">No rule requires a party to provide discovery unless requested to do so. <em>R. </em>4:10-1 provides discovery methods by which one party can obtain information from another party in the form of \u201c[djepositions ...; written interrogatories; production of documents or things; ... and requests for admissions.\u201d Each rule is activated by a request by one party to another to provide discovery. Absent a request, no obligation exists to provide any information to an adversary. Absent a request for expert reports or a written interrogatory requesting information about experts, a party at trial may call any expert who can qualify and whose testimony is relevant to an issue in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument in opposition to the admission of the videotapes at the trial was two-fold: 1) the answers to interrogatories were amended only to reflect the existence of photographs, not videotapes; and 2) plaintiff was unfairly surprised by the existence of videotapes which Jacob was obligated to provide in discovery. In addition, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney says that he misunderstood the answer to mean photographs of \u201cplaintiffs vehicle\u201d and not of \u201cplaintiff\u2019 and, in any event Jacob\u2019s attorney should have \u201cvolunteered\u201d that he was in possession of videotapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>The trial court dealt with the first argument by indicating that two possible definitions existed: (1) the word \u201cphotographs\u201d includes all forms of photographs, including videotapes, or (2) videotapes are separate and distinct from \u201cphotographs.\u201d The trial court properly reasoned that if \u201cphotographs\u201d includes videotapes, the plaintiff was advised by Jacob\u2019s November 22,1991 letter, that \u201cphotographs\u201d (in the general sense) existed. The answer incorporated the term used by plaintiffs in the interrogatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">Likewise, if \u201cphotographs\u201d is considered a specific word excluding, by definition, \u201cvideotapes,\u201d Jacob had no obligation to advise plaintiffs\u2019 attorney of the existence of that for which he did not ask. Neither <em>Balian v. General Motors, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 296 A.2d 317 (App.Div.1972), <em>certif. denied, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>195, 299 A.2d 729 (1973), nor <em>Jenkins v. Rainner, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>50, 350 A.2d 473 (1976), requires a contrary result.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Plaintiffs place particular reliance on <em>Jenkins, </em>wherein the defendant, notwithstanding a discovery request, refused to allow plaintiffs attorney before trial to see movies and question the investigator who took the movies for information regarding the circumstances of the filming. <em>Id. </em>at 52-53, 350 A.2d 473. Defendant argued that the films were protected as \u201cwork product\u201d and plaintiff had not demonstrated either her \u201csubstantial need\u201d for these movies or her inability without undue hardship to obtain their substantial equivalent by other means, as required by <em>R. </em>4:10-2(c). <em>Id. </em>at 54, 350 A.2d 473. The Supreme Court granted leave to appeal and disagreed, holding that the films were discoverable under <em>R. </em>4:10-2. <em>Id. </em>at 54-58, 350 A.2d 473. Those facts are clearly distinguishable from the facts herein. The existence of \u201cphotographs\u201d (the only question asked) was disclosed to plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, but he made no request to see the photographs or to obtain additional information as to the subject matter of the photographs, nor did he inquire regarding the information the new witnesses possessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">In <em>Balian, </em>notwithstanding plaintiffs\u2019 procuring an order requiring defendants to submit to plaintiffs a copy of their expert\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>reports, defendants failed to disclose motion pictures of a reconstructed event or a posed demonstration, which the trial court permitted in evidence. <em>Balian, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 122, 130, 296 A.2d 317. We held that this was reversible error. <em>Id. </em>at 132, 296 A.2d 317. Here, however, there was no request for experts\u2019 reports or videotapes, nor was there a reconstructed event or posed demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Herein, Jacob\u2019s amendment to answers to interrogatories was specific in advising plaintiffs of the existence of photographs taken of plaintiff. Jacob fairly apprised plaintiffs of the information requested, and as such complied with his obligation to provide discovery. Had plaintiffs\u2019 attorney requested the opportunity to view the photographs, the opportunity would have been afforded; had he inquired, and/or viewed the photographs, any request to see videotapes would have been honored or the court would have so ordered. As the trial judge properly noted several times, plaintiffs\u2019 claim of unfair surprise has no merit. If there was surprise, it was not caused by any improper action by Jacob. Furthermore, had the videotapes been excluded, Higgins and Andrews would nevertheless have been permitted to introduce the sixty photographs and to testify concerning their observations of: (1) plaintiffs rental and operation of a standard transmission truck which he allegedly could not drive, for deliveries to New York; (2) plaintiffs participation in the loading and unloading of heavy furniture, televisions, and mattresses at the New York delivery site; and (3) plaintiffs operation of the loaded truck enroute to a second location where he unloaded it and then drove it back to New Jersey. If the court had excluded the videotapes because plaintiffs did not follow up on the amended answers to interrogatories, it would have excluded relevant evidence to Jacob\u2019s prejudice, but still would not have prevented the jury from hearing testimony about plaintiffs activities. Plaintiff conceded at trial that he was the individual depicted in the photographs and videotapes. He was not recalled as a witness to give any explanation of how the videotapes could be reconciled with his trial and deposition testimony, nor did plaintiff claim that the videotapes, photographs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>or the testimony of investigators misrepresented or distorted facts or misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">On appeal, plaintiffs do not challenge the reasonableness of the jury verdict based on the evidence adduced at trial. Plaintiffs decided not to appeal the denial of their motion for a new trial based upon the \u201ccontrary to the weight of the evidence\u201d argument. The judge noted in the <em>Ev.R. </em>8(1) (now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104(a)) hearing that he recalled the plaintiff \u201ctestifying substantially that he really hasn\u2019t done any heavy work since the day of the accident ... [and] that he just can\u2019t use his right arm anymore.\u201d After viewing the videotapes, the judge stated: \u201cI had assumed that, you know, you were going to show me a video where he is lifting drums with his right hand. I am not sure after I see that individual whether it realty (sic) helps the defendant that much, but nevertheless the jury is going to have to make that determination.\u201d We cannot even determine whether plaintiffs suffered any prejudice as a result of the introduction of the videotapes because plaintiffs\u2019 attorney ordered only a partial transcript and has, therefore, waived any argument which depends, in whole or in part, on an analysis of the evidence necessary to determine if any trial ruling constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u2014II\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Plaintiff Joszef Kiss concedes that the court properly reduced his award for lost income from $37,500 to $11,500 because he had received lost income benefits of $26,000 (the policy limits from his PIP carrier). However, plaintiffs argue that the collateral source rule, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97, should not have been applied to eliminate the award of $5,000 for plaintiff Joszef Kiss\u2019 injury and his wife\u2019s <em>per quod </em>award of $2,500. Whereas, defendant Jacob on his cross-appeal contends that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A: 15-97 requires that the entire lost income award be offset by the collateral source payment of $100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The damages award in favor of plaintiffs included $7,500 for pain and suffering and disability, and $11,500 for net lost income, after reduction for PIP benefits received.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-7\">In any civil action brought for personal injury or death, except actions brought pursuant to the provisions of P.L.1972, c. 70 (C. 39:6A-1 <em>et seq.), </em>if a plaintiff receives or is entitled to receive benefits for the injuries allegedly incurred from any other source other than a joint tortfeasor, the benefits, other than workers\u2019 compensation benefits or the proceeds from a life insurance policy, shall be disclosed to the court and the amount thereof which duplicates any benefit contained in the award shall be deducted from any award recovered by the plaintiff, less any premium paid to an insurer directly by the plaintiff or by any member of the plaintiffs family on behalf of the plaintiff for the policy period during which the benefits are payable. Any party to the action shall be permitted to introduce evidence regarding any of the matters described in this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b271-8\">[L. 1987, <em>c. </em>326, \u00a7 1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">N.J.S.A 2A:15-97 modifies the common law collateral source rule for causes of action arising on or after December 18, 1987, such as this one, and applies to benefits received \u201cfrom any other source other than a joint tortfeasor.\u201d Plaintiffs acknowledge that because the accident happened after the statute was adopted they came under this legislative restriction, but they contend that it is incomprehensible that the Legislature intended that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97 would apply to a settlement received from a non-tortfeasor. Rather, they contend that the rationale found in <em>Rogers v. Spady, </em>147 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 371 A.2d 285 (App.Div.1977)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>, should be followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-10\">A joint tortfeasor refers to \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>839 (6th ed. 1990). For the purpose of the Joint Tortfeasors Contribution Law, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A.-53A-1 to -20, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the term \u201cjoint tortfeasors\u201d means \u201ctwo or more persons jointly or severally liable in tort for the same injury to person or property, whether or not judgment has been recovered against all or some of them.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:53A-1; <em>see also Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of New Jersey, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>548, 566, 410 A.2d 674 (1980). To be a joint tortfeasor one must be liable in tort. Warnebold was clearly not a joint tortfeasor, even though she was an alleged joint tortfeasor.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">The Legislature knew the difference between an \u201calleged tortfeasor\u201d and a \u201ctortfeasor\u201d because it eliminated the words \u201calleged tortfeasor\u201d in amending a statute adopted the same day as <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97. <em>See L. </em>1987, c. 324. In fact, in amending <em>N.J.SA </em>59:9-3, the Legislature did not enact that portion of the proposed bill which would have continued referring to \u201calleged tortfeasor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The Legislature is familiar with the meaning of \u201cother than a joint tortfeasor\u201d because it used those words in 1972 when <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:9-2(e) was adopted, and the words were interpreted by us in <em>Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>106, 126-27, 493 A.2d 1314 (App.Div.1985), <em>affd, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557, 612, 525 A.2d 287 (1987). <em>See also Murray v. Nicol, </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>303, 540 A.2d 239 (App.Div.1988). The purpose of that statute, like <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97, \u201cis to prohibit the receipt of duplicate benefits by a claimant....\u201d <em>Id. </em>202 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 126, 493 A.2d 1314 (quoting <em>Comment, N.J.S.A </em>59:9-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">The overriding legislative intent of the Legislature in adopting <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:15-97 was to prevent a claimant from receiving benefits beyond the damages awarded under a judgment entered and to relieve defendants and insurance companies from having to compensate plaintiffs for damages in excess of the total amounts of their losses. The economic impact of the collateral source rule is substantial and certainly, in part, has led to spiral-ling insurance costs for not only commercial enterprises but also the consuming public. Plaintiffs are not generally compensated by the perpetrator of the incident but rather by the insurance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>system itself. In other words, all insureds, not just the defendant, become responsible. The <em>News Release </em>by Governor Thomas H. Kean of December 18, 1987, indicated that the Governor \u201csigned three bills reforming the State\u2019s liability insurance laws by protecting municipalities from paying an unfair share of damages in a liability suit, modifying the so-called \u2018deep pockets\u2019 rule in civil litigation which allowed persons to be forced to pay a much larger share of damages than they were responsible for, and reducing the possibility of \u2018double recoveries\u2019 in civil actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The nature of the subject matter, contextual setting, and statutes in <em>pari materia </em>must all be viewed together in seeking legislative intent. <em>State v. Wright, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>488, 502, 527 A.2d 379 (1987). Therefore, Chapters 324, 325 and 326 of the Laws of 1987 must all be viewed together in seeking legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The Legislature, if it had so decided, could have used the words \u201calleged tortfeasor\u201d or \u201cone claimed to be a joint tortfeasor,\u201d as the State of New York has done.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Purcell v. Doherty, </em>102 Misc.2d 1049, 424 N.Y.S.2d 991 (Sup.Ct.1980), <em>affd, </em>80 A.D.2d 755, 437 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>993 (1981), the court, applying the New York statute, deducted the settlement amount of $150,000 received from a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>found not negligent from the jury verdict of $775,000 against other defendants. For a history of New York\u2019s collateral source rule, General Obligations Laws 15-108, <em>see Williams v. Niske, </em>81 N.Y.2d 437, 599 N.Y.S.2d 519, 615 N.E.2d 1003 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance upon <em>Bandel v. Friedrich, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>235, 242, 584 A.2d 800 (1991), is misplaced because the cause of action therein pre-dated the statute. The body of case law, including <em>Rogers v. Spady, supra, </em>which pre-dates the statute, is overcome by the clear language of the statute. We must assume that the Legislature, in considering and adopting this statute, was aware of and chose the statutory language in light of that case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The inclusion of the phrase \u201cother than a joint tortfeasor\u201d demonstrates that the Legislature intended to exclude payments by other tortfeasors and, at least by inference, intended to include any other payment not otherwise referenced in the statute. The public policy underlying <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97 was to eliminate, to the extent possible, legal rules and principles which allow plaintiffs to receive double recovery for their injuries and damages. One apparent unspoken rationale of this statutory change in the longstanding collateral source rule was to minimize the burden on the insurance industry to the extent an injured party is fully compensated for injuries suffered. Immediately preceding the enactment of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97, the Legislature enacted <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-5.3, limiting a plaintiffs recovery against a joint tortfeasor based upon the tortfeasor\u2019s percentage of responsibility, which was clearly a response to <em>Rogers v. Spady </em>and <em>Cartel Capital Corp. v. Fireco of New Jersey. Cartel </em>held that \u201cthe effect on the plaintiff of a joint tortfeasor\u2019s settlement will depend upon the percentage of fault found against him.\u201d <em>Cartel, supra, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>at 569, 410 A.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The public policy basis for the passage of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-97, reconciling the interests in permitting full compensation to injured parties, fostering settlement, and avoiding the burdens resulting from double compensation, applies with equal force and effect to plaintiffs accident and injuries. The rationale of the collateral source rule is that, if a choice is presented between overcompen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>sating an injured party to the extent of receipt of collateral source benefits or allowing a culpable party, otherwise responsible for the injury, to reap the benefit of that collateral source and avoid personal responsibility for his/her tortious actions, the innocent injured party should receive the benefit. In that respect, the collateral source rule is an exception to the general rule that a successful plaintiff in a tort action is generally entitled to recover only that quantum of damages that will justly compensate him or her for injuries caused by a defendant. The most obvious effect of the collateral source rule is that it enables a plaintiff to reap a double recovery in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The collateral source rule served a legitimate public policy interest when it originated over 138 years ago <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> before the widespread use of insurance, particularly in the field of statutorily-mandated motor vehicle insurance. Now, by virtue of insurance, tortfeasors can effectively be insulated from personal responsibility for the effects of their negligent acts. The public policy considerations which have historically justified the collateral source rule no longer apply, at least in automobile negligence litigation. This case is a good example because the benefits received by plaintiffs, by way of settlement with Warnebold, were paid by the New Jersey Automobile Full Insurance Underwriting Association (NJAFIUA) through its servicing carrier. Jacob is insured for the subject accident by a policy issued by the NJAFIUA through its servicing carrier, Allstate Insurance Company. No legitimate public interest is served in this case, or in many tort cases, in allowing plaintiff to receive double recovery for his or her actual losses and damages and thus compelling the carrier for the tortfeasor to pay benefits more than once. To hold otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>would discourage settlements by co-defendants who go to trial after one or more alleged tortfeasors have settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The trial court denied defendant Jacob\u2019s application to offset plaintiffs entire lost income award, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">I don\u2019t consider that [lost income] to be a benefit from the injury. That is something that he lost, the jury found that he lost, and I\u2019m not going to take it off him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">There is no basis for differentiating between pain and suffering damages and lost income damages. The jury determined that plaintiffs suffered damages totalling $45,000. Plaintiffs have already received $100,000 for those damages from the same source, the NJAFIUA, from whom they seek additional damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">The orders from which plaintiffs appeal are affirmed, except that the judgment in favor of plaintiff Joszef Kiss against defendant Ziv Jacob is reversed and set aside.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b264-8\"> Edith Kiss, wife of Joszef Kiss, filed a <em>per quod </em>claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-8\"> Plaintiff had not returned to work, allegedly as a result of the injuries sustained in the accident.

The court shall deduct the proper amount, as determined pursuant to section 15-108 of the general obligations law, from the award made by the jury (emphasis added). N.Y.Gen.Oblig. 15-108(a) states, in part, that:</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">When a release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce a judgment is given to one of two or more persons liable <em>or claimed to be liable in tort for the same injury, </em>or the same wrongful death it does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms expressly so provide, but it reduces the claim of the releasor against the other tortfeasors to the extent of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid for it, or in the amount of the released tortfeasor\u2019s equitable share of the damages under article fourteen of the civil practice law and rules, whichever is the greatest (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> The collateral source rule first appeared in <em>The Propeller Monticello </em>v. <em>Mollison, </em>58 <em>U.S. </em>(17 <em>How.) </em>152-156, 15 <em>L.Ed. </em>68 (1855), where the Supreme Court stated its belief that it was not inventing a new doctrine but merely applying an old one. <em>Id. </em>58 <em>U.S. </em>at 154, 15 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 70. <em>See </em>Joel K.
