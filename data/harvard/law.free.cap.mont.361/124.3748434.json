We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u00b62 Leonard Brown was hired by the Yellowstone Club as director of retail sales and rentals of ski-related goods. Brown and the Club entered an employment agreement that employed Brown for a term of three years. The agreement also provided that the Club (or Brown) could terminate Brown\u2019s employment at any time, without cause. After about six months, the Club terminated Brown\u2019s employment, without cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\u00b63 Brown brought an action for damages against the Club under the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act, \u00a7\u00a7 39-2-901 to -915, MCA. The District Court granted the Club\u2019s motion to dismiss the Wrongful Discharge action based upon \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA, which exempts from the Act an employee covered by a \u201cwritten contract of employment for a specified term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">\u00b64 The District Court disposed of this case by granting the Club\u2019s motion to dismiss filed in response to the complaint. Upon a motion to dismiss, the complaint is construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and all allegations of fact are taken as true. <em>Snetsinger v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number><em>Montana University System, </em>2004 MT 390, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 148, 104 P.3d 445. A complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>McKinnon v. Western Sugar Co-Op., </em>2010 MT 24, \u00b6 12, 355 Mont. 120, 225 P.3d 1221. A district court\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine whether they are correct. <em>Snetsinger, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b65 The issue on appeal is whether Brown\u2019s employment contract with the Yellowstone Club was a \u201cwritten contract of employment for a specified term\u201d under the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act, \u00a7 39-2-912(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b66 The District Court disposed of this case on the Club\u2019s motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, filed in response to the complaint. The record on appeal is therefore limited, but it appears that on October 28, 2009, Brown and the Club entered a \u201cConfidential and Privileged Employment Agreement\u201d under which Brown was hired to be its Director of Retail and Rental. The Agreement was to run from October 28, 2009 until September 30, 2012 \u201cunless sooner terminated as provided for in this Agreement.\u201d Under the Agreement either party could terminate the employment \u201cwithout cause\u201d upon 30 days written notice. If the Club terminated the employment under that provision, the employee was entitled to three months base salary as severance pay, but only upon execution of a \u201cvalid and enforceable general release of claims in favor of the Company....\u201d The Club could also terminate the employment upon sale of the Club; expiration of the term of the Agreement; and for good cause. The Agreement defined seven categories of good cause, including failure to follow policies, fraud, embezzlement, and conviction of certain crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b67 On April 22,2010, the Club terminated Brown\u2019s employment, with no stated cause, and offered a severance payment as provided in the Agreement. Brown refused to execute a release of claims and filed an action under the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u00b68  The Act was enacted with the purpose to \u201cset forth certain rights and remedies\u201d of employers and employees, and provides the \u201cexclusive remedy for a wrongful discharge from employment,\u201d \u00a7 39-2-902, MCA. The Act preempts all common law tort or contract remedies for wrongful discharge, \u00a7 39-2-913, MCA. After an employee completes a probationary period of employment the employee can only be discharged for good cause. Sections 39-2-903(5) and -904, MCA. Except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>for a probationary employee, Montana no longer recognizes the right of an employer to terminate an employee at will, for no cause. <em>Whidden v. John S. Nerison, Inc., </em>1999 MT 110, \u00b6 21, 294 Mont. 346, 981 P.2d 271. However, the Act expressly does not apply to \u201can employee covered by ... a written contract of employment for a specific term.\u201d Section 39-2-912(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-3\">\u00b69 The issue in this case is whether an employment contract for a specified term (here, three years) that also allows the employer to terminate the employee at will, for no cause, is a contract for a \u201cspecific term\u201d under the exception provided in \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA. Neither the Act nor decisions from this Court provide any specific answer to this issue. The sole case cited by the District Court, <em>Tvedt v. Farmers Ins. Group, </em>2004 MT 125, 321 Mont. 263, 91 P.3d 1, provides no assistance. The Court did not reach the Wrongful Discharge Act issues because of an issue of fact as to whether Tvedt was an employee or an independent contractor. The present case also does not involve the right of an employer to not renew an employment contract which has expired. <em>See e.g. Solle v. Western States Ins. Agency, </em>2000 MT 96, 299 Mont. 237, 999 P.2d 328; <em>Farris v. Hutchinson, </em>254 Mont. 334, 838 P.2d 374 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b610 WTiile the present case involves solely the application of Montana law and particularly \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, decisions from other jurisdictions have considered the effect of employment contracts containing both a definite term and the right to terminate at will. In <em>Cave Hill Corp. v. Hiers, </em>570 S.E. 2d 790 (Va. 2002), the court held that the at-will termination right \u201ctrumped\u201d the definite term of employment and that therefore the employee could be terminated at any time. In <em>Miranda v. Wesley Health System, </em>949 So. 2d 63 (Miss. App. 2006), the court similarly held that an at-will provision in an employment contract for a term resulted in at-will employment.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-5\">A contract for a stated term removes employment from the at-will doctrine only if there is an enforceable right for the employee to remain for that length of time. The period of time must be definite legally; it must be a promise and not just a goal. If what the contract gives in one provision for a set term is taken back in another for discharge at the sole discretion of the employer, there is a legally indefinite term of employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-6\"><em>Miranda, </em>\u00b6 16. In New York, when an employment contract for a term includes a right of the employer to terminate at will, there is a judicially-imposed requirement that the employer must have good cause to terminate. <em>Carter v. Bradlee, </em>280 N.Y.S. 368 (N.Y. App. 1935); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Rothenberg v. Lincoln Farm Camp, </em>755 F.2d 1017 (2nd Cir. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b611  The significance of these cases to the present issue is that they all conclude that the at-will provision of the contract \u201ctrumps\u201d the definite employment term, so that such a contract is construed to not be one for a definite or specific term. We construe the \u201cspecific term\u201d language of \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, the same way. If an employment contract for a specific term also allows the employer to terminate at will (after completion of the probationary period), it is not a \u201cwritten contract for a specific term\u201d under that statute. A discharged employee covered by such a contract is not excluded by \u00a7 39-2-912, MCA, from bringing a claim under the Wrongful Discharge from Employment Act.</p>\n<p id=\"ASN\">\u00b612  Construing the employment agreement in this case as one for a specific term would remove the discharge from the Act; could effectively reinstate at-will employment in Montana, and would leave the discharged employee arguably without remedy. He would not be able to bring an action under the Act, and at the same time would be subject to the employer\u2019s contractual right to discharge at will. Such a result would be contrary to the weight of authority and would undermine the purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b613 The District Court is reversed and this case is remanded for further proceedings in accord with this opinion. We express no opinion on the merits of Brown\u2019s claim or on any defenses that the Club may have under the Act.</p>\n<judges id=\"b154-6\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER, NELSON, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
