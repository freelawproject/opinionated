We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">\u00b62 This case arose over a decade ago when David Lipson, principal of the approximately 10,000-acre Paws Up Angus Ranch and Paws Up Horse Ranch in Missoula County, Montana, engaged DAC to construct buildings, roads and other improvements on the Ranch. Lipson projected that the work would cost approximately $10 million, and when DAC did not get paid for the last approximately $800,000 of billings, it filed a construction lien to secure its claim. DAC commenced a breach of contract and lien foreclosure action in 2001 and has spent the intervening years trying to bring this dispute to a conclusion and to collect the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">\u00b63 David Lipson has been described as a shrewd and experienced businessman. <em>See e.g. Securities and Exchange Comm\u2019n v. Lipson, </em>278 F.3d 656 (7th Cir. 2002). When Lipson engaged DAC for the Paws Up construction project in April, 2000, he entered a written contract with DAC on behalf of Monroe Construction, a limited liability company formed under the laws of Delaware, with a home address in Chicago. Monroe Construction was a shell entity without any on-going assets, while the Ranch itself was owned by another Lipson entity called Monroe Property, an LLC organized under the laws of Nevada. Lipson controlled both entities and testified that his intent was that Monroe Construction would contract with DAC and pay for the cost of the improvements at the Ranch, using money drawn from various sources within the Lipson organization. Monroe Property owned the Paws Up ranch at all relevant times, and when each phase of the construction was substantially completed, Monroe Construction sold that phase to Monroe Property for cost plus a 5% \u201ccontractor\u2019s fee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\u00b64 At the time Lipson entered the construction contract with DAC, there was no written agreement between Monroe Construction and Monroe Property evidencing the arrangement that Monroe Construction would sell the phases of the DAC job as they were completed. In August, 2002, after this litigation was well under way, Monroe Construction and Monroe Property entered a written agreement purporting to memorialize the arrangement. It was \u201cdated as of\u2019 March 9, 2000, and David Lipson signed the document as President of Monroe Property, LLC, and as President of Monroe Construction, LLC and as \u201cmanager\u201d of DEL Investments Corporation. Lipson testified that DEL is the manager of Monroe Property; that Monroe Property is a single-member LLC; that the single member of Monroe Property is Monroe Capital Partners, LLC, and that he is the representative of the manager DEL. He also testified that he was not employed by Monroe Property and that neither it nor Monroe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>Construction has any employees or any ownership interest in the other entity. He testified that Monroe Property operates under the assumed names of Paws Up Angus Ranch, Paws Up Cattle Company and Paws Up Horse Ranch. It is clear that Lipson controlled Monroe Property, Monroe Construction, DEL Investments, and the Paws Up operations.</p>\n<p id=\"ApH\">\u00b65 Neither Lipson nor the Monroe entities presented any explanation for the necessity or utility of the complicated structure of these entities. Whatever the effect of these intertwined entities may have been, one clear result was to isolate David Lipson, individually, and Monroe Property, as the titleholder of the Paws Up property, from direct contracts with contractors such as DAC. Monroe Construction by design had no discernable assets. They admitted in the District Court proceedings that one of the reasons for the structure was to make it judgment proof and to protect the Paws Up land itself from liens. This has been successful for a decade. Nevertheless, the individual that DAC dealt with throughout its project was David Lipson. Lipson had detailed discussions with DAC\u2019s representative leading up to execution of the construction contract. Lipson signed the contract with DAC on behalf of Monroe Construction, and the contract designated the \u201cproject\u201d as \u201cPaws Up Angus Ranch, Greenough, Montana,\u201d the land owned by Monroe Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u00b66 During the construction phase, DAC personnel dealt with Lipson regularly and often. One of the many proceedings that has been held in the effort to conclude the DAC claim was an arbitration that took place in November, 2005 and which included a nine-day evidentiary hearing. The arbitrators in their written decision found that there were never any complete or detailed plans for the work that DAC was to complete, and that the costs of the project were not detailed cost estimates that DAC could rely on but were just budget estimates provided by Lipson. After DAC began work, its representatives warned Lipson about the increase in the estimated costs caused by the absence of complete plans and the \u201cmany changes that were being directed by Lipson.\u201d Lipson and his wife met with DAC representatives weekly to provide directions on what they wanted done, and DAC would direct its crews accordingly. DAC representatives testified that this led to inconsistent and untimely instructions from the Lipsons, and that meeting the Lipsons\u2019 changing expectations resulted in completed work being torn out and reconstructed. The evidence showed that between August, 2000 and March, 2001, Lipson directed 41 changes or additions to the plumbing and 113 pages of changes to the work done on the equestrian center. The arbitration panel found that the \u201cskyrocketing costs\u201d experienced toward the end of the project \u201cwere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>the result of the changes and expansions directed by Dave Lipson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">\u00b67 Monroe Construction paid DAC through the April 30, 2001 invoice, a total of $10,339,223. Monroe did not pay DAC\u2019s June and July, 2001 invoices, which totaled $894,607. In July, 2001 DAC filed a construction lien against the property and in September, 2001 DAC sued Monroe Construction for breach of contract and Monroe Property to foreclose the lien. The Monroe entities responded with several counterclaims for constructive fraud, misrepresentation, negligence and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u00b68 In 2002, the District Court denied Monroe\u2019s motion for summary judgment and upheld the validity of DAC\u2019s construction lien. In May, 2004, the District Court upheld the validity of the lien against further Monroe contentions that it was technically deficient. The District Court also dismissed all of Monroe\u2019s tort-based counterclaims, leaving only the breach of contract counterclaim by Monroe Construction. These rulings have not been appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">\u00b69 The Monroe entities then moved to compel arbitration under the construction contract, and in March, 2005 the District Court ordered that the parties participate in arbitration. The arbitration proceeded with DAC and Monroe Construction only and included the nine-day evidentiary hearing, the only one held in any proceeding connected with this matter. In December, 2005 the arbitrators awarded DAC $802,661 in damages; $309,729 in interest; $33,186 in costs and $331,892 in attorney fees against Monroe Construction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"As1\">\u00b610 DAC returned to District Court and moved for an entry of judgment against Monroe Construction on the arbitration award and for summary judgment against Monroe Property on the foreclosure of the construction lien. The District Court entered two orders on March 16, 2007. The first granted DAC\u2019s motion to confirm the arbitration award in its favor and denied the motion of the Monroe entities to vacate or modify the award. The primary issue regarding the confirmation was the arbitration panel\u2019s award of attorney fees to DAC. In addition, the Monroe entities contended that the panel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>exceeded its authority by making findings and conclusions regarding the construction lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">\u00b611 In the second March 16, 2007 order the District Court granted DAC\u2019s motion for summary judgment against Monroe Property on the construction lien. In doing so the District Court held in favor of DAC on the Monroe entities\u2019 arguments that there were absent necessary parties; that the lien did not properly identify the land at issue; and that the lien did not properly identify the improvements at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b612 In May, 2007, the District Court followed up on the March 16 orders and entered a final judgment against Monroe Construction on the arbitration award in the amount of $1,632,961.14. The District Court also entered a final judgment against Monroe Property foreclosing the lien and ordered that the real property of the Paws Up Ranch be sold to satisfy the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b613 Monroe appealed to this Court, and we affirmed in part and reversed in part. <em>Dick Anderson Const., Inc. v. Monroe Construction, </em>2009 MT 416, 353 Mont. 534, 221 P.3d 675 (DAC <em>I). </em>First, this Court upheld the District Court\u2019s order confirming the amount of the arbitration award against Monroe Construction, including the attorney fees. Next this Court rejected Monroe Property\u2019s argument that it was a third party beneficiary of the Monroe Construction-DAC construction contract so as to be entitled to raise claims and defenses regarding the contract. Finally, this Court reversed the District Court\u2019s order foreclosing the construction lien on the ground that the order improperly relied on the arbitration panel\u2019s advisory findings concerning the lien. This Court concluded that Monroe Property\u2019s \u201cstatutory defenses on the construction lien issue\u201d involving issues of whether the lien was \u201cproperly and timely filed against Monroe Property\"s real property\u201d remained to be litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">\u00b614 On remand to the District Court, in May, 2010 Monroe Property again raised technical issues concerning the validity of the lien by moving for summary judgment against DAC on the issue of the validity of the construction lien. Monroe Property argued that since it was not a party to the construction contract with DAC and was not a third party beneficiary of the construction contract, it was not a \u201ccontracting owner\u201d under \u00a7 71-3-522(4)(a), MCA, against whom the lien could be foreclosed. DAC argued that Monroe Construction was an agent of Monroe Property and that therefore the lien was enforceable. The District Court concluded that Monroe Property and Monroe Construction were separate entities; that DAC \u201cfailed to establish\u201d that Monroe Construction was an agent of Monroe Property; and that the lien was enforceable only as to Monroe Construction\u2019s interest in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>real property, which did not exist. The District Court further held that \u201cDAC\u2019s lien extended only to the improvements it constructed for Monroe Construction, not to the real property owned by Monroe Property.\u201d The District Court then concluded that the construction lien was \u201cinvalid\u201d and unenforceable. The District Court reserved any ruling on DAC\u2019s quantum meriut claim against Monroe Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">\u00b615 DAC appeals. While DAC raises several issues on appeal, we find the issue regarding the existence of an agency relationship between Monroe Property and Monroe Construction to be dispositive, and therefore do not reach the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b616 The District Court disposed of this matter on summary judgment. This Court reviews a district court\u2019s decision on summary judgment de novo, examining whether the decision correctly found that there were no genuine issues of fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. All reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence must be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Talmage v. City of Kalispell, </em>2009 MT 434, \u00b6 12, 354 Mont. 125, 223 P.3d 328. We review legal conclusions reached by a district court to determine whether the court erred. <em>Poole v. Poole, </em>2000 MT 117, \u00b6 13, 299 Mont. 435, 1 P.3d 936.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">\u00b617 Montana law provides \u201cfor the attachment and enforceability of a construction lien against real estate in favor of a person furnishing services or materials under a real estate improvement contract.\u201d Section 71-3-521, MCA. The purpose of the lien is to secure the payment of the contract price for construction work. Section 71-3-523, MCA. \u201cA construction lien extends to the interest of the contracting owner in the real estate, as the interest exists at the commencement of work or is subsequently acquired....\u201d Section 71-3-525, MCA. A \u201ccontracting owner\u201d is a \u201cperson who owns an interest in real estate and who personally or through an agent, enters into an express or implied contract for the improvement of the real estate.\u201d Section 71-3-522(4), MCA. The statutes contain specific requirements for notice, \u00a7\u00a7 71-3-531 and -532, MCA, and for filing, \u00a7\u00a7 71-3-534 and -535, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AgdS\">\u00b618 The procedural requirements of the lien statutes exist to notify the real property owner that a lien has been filed against the property and to protect other parties dealing with the property. <em>Johnston v. Palmer, </em>2007 MT 99, \u00b6 40, 337 Mont. 101, 158 P.3d 998. When the strict requirements of the lien statutes are met, the statutes will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>liberally construed to give effect to their remedial purpose. <em>Gaston Engineering &amp; Surveying v. Oakwood Properties, </em>2011 MT 44, \u00b6 14, 359 Mont. 341, 249 P.3d 75; <em>Swain. v. Battershell, </em>1999 MT 101, \u00b6 26, 294 Mont. 282, 983 P.2d 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">\u00b619 Throughout this litigation, until the order appealed from, the District Court has held that the DAC lien satisfies the strict procedural requirements of the statutes. The issue that Monroe Property raises in this appeal is whether it is a \u201ccontracting owner\u201d under the lien statutes. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\u00b620 Monroe Property argues that it is not a \u201ccontracting owner\u201d under the definition of that term in \u00a7 71-3-522(4)(a), MCA. Monroe Property argues that it was not a contracting owner because it did not enter the construction contract with DAC, but rather that Monroe Construction, a completely \u201cseparate entity,\u201d did so. Monroe Property further asserts that there is \u201cno evidence\u201d of any agency relationship between the two Monroe entities and that Monroe Construction did not act as its agent. The District Court adopted those positions in the summary judgment order underlying this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">\u00b621 An agent is one who represents another, \u00a7 28-10-101, MCA, and agency is either actual or ostensible, \u00a7 28-10-103(1), MCA. An actual agency occurs when the agent is \u201creally employed\u201d by the principal, and is ostensible when the principal \u201cintentionally or by want of ordinary care causes a third person to believe another to be the principal\u2019s agent when that person is not really employed by the principal.\u201d Section 28-10-103(1), MCA. Agency may be created and authority to act conferred by prior authorization or subsequent ratification, and consideration is not required to create an agent\u2019s authority. Sections 28-10-201 and -202, MCA. An agent represents the principal and the rights and liabilities that accrue from the agent\u2019s acts accrue to the principal. Section 28-10-601, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\u00b622 A court may review the record to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of agency, <em>Butler Mfg. Co. v.J &amp; L Implement Co., </em>167 Mont. 519, 523, 540 P.2d 962, 965 (1975), and the existence of agency may be implied from conduct and from all the facts and circumstances of the case. <em>Butler Mfg., </em>167 Mont, at 524, 540 P.2d at 965. When a party contends there is an ostensible agency, the principal must have undertaken some act to lead the other party to believe that an agency existed, even if it did not exist in fact. <em>Miller v. Cascade N. Co., </em>181 Mont. 66, 69, 592 P.2d 156, 158 (1979). A belief in ostensible agency must be reasonable, <em>Larson v. Barry Smith Logging, </em>267 Mont. 444, 447, 884 P.2d 786, 788 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">\u00b623 The facts of this case demonstrate that Monroe Construction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the actual agent of Monroe Property for the purpose of engaging DAC to complete construction work on Monroe Property\u2019s Paws Up Ranch. Monroe Property nominally owns the Paws Up Ranches. David Lipson controls and manages Monroe Property and the Paws Up Ranches. David Lipson created Monroe Construction to facilitate the construction of improvements at the Paws Up Ranches. Lipson\u2019s intent at the time of the DAC contract was that Monroe Construction would be designated as the contracting entity and, upon substantial completion of various portions of the work would pay DAC and in return sell the completed portion of the work to Monroe Property.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b624 The construction contract with DAC recited that Monroe Construction was \u201cthe Owner\u201d and that \u201cthe Project is: Paws Up Angus Ranch, Greenough, Montana.\u201d Lipson signed the contract for Monroe Construction. Throughout the negotiations leading up to the contract and the construction of the projects at the Ranch, DAC dealt personally with Lipson. In 2002, after this litigation began, Monroe Property and Monroe Construction entered a written agreement on the face of which Monroe Construction agreed to sell to Monroe Property the improvements constructed by DAC. David Lipson signed the agreement for both Monroe entities, as president of DEL Investments Corporation, listed as the manager of both entities. A purpose of creating Monroe Construction was to establish an entity to contract with third persons such as DAC, but which entity would have no ongoing assets against which liens or judgments could be levied.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b625 The District Court\u2019s recitation of the \u201cundisputed material facts\u201d was more than sufficient to support the legal conclusion that Monroe Construction was the agent of Monroe Property. The only reasonable conclusion of law to be drawn from the undisputed facts is that Monroe Construction was created to act and did act as the agent of Monroe Property for the purpose of contracting for improvements to the Paws Up Ranch. Monroe Property has not made any compelling argument that there was no agency, instead repeatedly stating that Monroe Construction was a \u201cseparate entity.\u201d It also argues that had Monroe Construction been an agent of Monroe Property, then Monroe Property as the principal would have been allowed to challenge the contract between Monroe Construction and DAC, which this Court disallowed in <em>DAC I, \u00b6 </em>50. The issue considered in that case, however, was whether Monroe Property was a third party beneficiary of the construction contract, and not whether Monroe Construction was an agent of Monroe Property. The third party beneficiary issue was not determinative of agency. Monroe Property acknowledged inDAC <em>I </em>that Monroe Construction served as a general contractor on the Paws Up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>project and hired DAC to improve the property. It is undisputed that this was done for the benefit of Monroe Property and with its approval.</p>\n<p id=\"A-y\">\u00b626 Moreover, it is clear that if the Monroe Property-Monroe Construction arrangement (in which an asset-free shell entity with no title to real property is the contracting entity for real property improvements) were adopted as a model by others, there would be no enforceable construction liens. Monroe tries to refute this issue by contending that all a contractor has to do is to enter a contract with the owner of the real property. Under the Monroe Property-Monroe Construction model, as DAC has found, this can be difficult. The remedial purposes of the construction lien statutes-including providing payment security for contractors who construct improvements to real property-would clearly be frustrated by adopting Monroe Property\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b627  The undisputed facts establish that Monroe Construction was an agent of Monroe Property for the purpose of contracting with DAC to build improvements on Monroe Property\u2019s Paws Up Ranches. Therefore, under \u00a7 71-3-522, MCA, Monroe Property, acting through its agent Monroe Construction, was a \u201ccontracting owner\u201d with regard to the construction contract with DAC. The District Court\u2019s conclusion of law to the contrary was error, and the order on summary judgment is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b628 Monroe Property had the opportunity on remand to the District Court to raise any statutory defenses it had to DAC\u2019s assertion of a construction lien. Monroe Property did so, contending that it was not a contracting owner and that the lien was invalid. Having resolved this issue against Monroe Property and in favor of DAC, no issues remain to be decided as to the validity of the DAC lien.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore reinstate the Final Money Judgment and Final Judgment Foreclosing Construction Lien in favor of DAC and against Monroe Property previously entered in this matter, dated April 30, 2007 and filed May 1, 2007. DAC may foreclose its construction lien in the amounts provided in that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b629 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b64-7\">JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\"> The arbitrators also found against Monroe Construction on its claims for breach of contract and for fraud, concluding that they \u201cwere so totally devoid of merit as to constitute bad faith under the circumstances of this case.
