Hartford\u2019s grievance alleges his employment as a teacher was terminated \u201cwithout just cause\u201d in violation of a collective bargaining agreement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by compelling arbitration of Hartford\u2019s grievance under the collective bargaining </em>agreement?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b63 Hartford was a high school science teacher. Hartford\u2019s employment with the District began in the 1999-2000 school year and continued through the 2007-2008 school year. He was tenured. On May 29, 2008, Hartford and the Board entered into a written contract governing Hartford\u2019s employment for the 2008-2009 school year (the Teacher\u2019s Contract). At that time, Hartford was properly certified as a teacher. He held a teaching certificate valid from July 1, 2003, to June 30, 2008. Paragraph 3 of the Teacher\u2019s Contract provides: \u201cIt is understood that the Teacher either holds a valid teaching certificate under the laws of Montana or will have obtained such certificate before October 1 of the year this contract is executed, otherwise, this contract is voidable at the option of the District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">\u00b64 In effect for school years 2007-2009 was a collective bargaining agreement, entitled \u201cComprehensive Agreement\u201d (CBA), which was entered into between Kalispell School District No. 5 and the Kalispell Education Association (KEA), an affiliate of MEA-MFT. Article 1.1 of the CBA states the agreement is entered into \u201cpursuant to and in compliance with the Montana Public Employees Collective Bargaining Law Title 39, Chapter 31, Revised Codes of Montana, as amended ... to provide the conditions of employment for teachers during the duration of this Agreement with respect to wages, hours, fringe benefits, and other conditions of employment.\u201d Article 2.1 states \u201cthe District recognized the Kalispell Education Association as the Exclusive Representative of the appropriate unit.\u201d Article 2.2 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADs\">Appropriate Unit: The Association shall represent members of the appropriate unit which shall consist of all teachers and long-term substitute teachers of the District who are certificated in Class I, II, IV, or V as in Section 20-4-106, specialists requiring a license under the laws of the State of Montana, and whose positions call for or require such certification ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Article 5 of the CBA is entitled Teacher and Exclusive Representative Rights, and Article 5.6 provides \u201c[n]o teacher shall be disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in rank or compensation, discharged, or deprived of any professional advantage without just cause.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Article 13, as required by \u00a7 39-31-306(5), MCA,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> contains a grievance procedure that culminates in final and binding arbitration of unresolved grievances. A grievance must be submitted in writing to a designee of the District under Article 13.6, and if not first resolved through informal discussion, may be appealed through various levels to the Superintendent of Schools and then the Board of Trustees. CBA, Arts. 13.7.1 through 13.7.3. \u201cIn the event that the parties are unable to resolve a grievance, it may be submitted to arbitration as defined herein,\u201d under Article 13.8.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-3\">\u00b65 On June 30,2008, Hartford\u2019s Montana teaching certificate expired by his inadvertence in failing to renew it. Because no party was aware of the expiration, Hartford began teaching in the fall of 2008 as usual. At some point prior to November 4, 2008, the county superintendent notified the District that Hartford\u2019s teaching certificate had expired. The District\u2019s superintendent notified Hartford of the expiration of his certification and informed him he was no longer eligible to receive compensation under his Teacher\u2019s Contract, pursuant to \u00a7 20-4-202, MCA. Hartford continued to teach at the District as a non-certified substitute teacher, and the Board took no further action on Hartford\u2019s Teacher\u2019s Contract. On December 11, 2008, the high school principal terminated Hartford\u2019s employment. Seven days later, Hartford obtained a new teaching certificate, with a validation date of July 1, 2008, and effective until June 30, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b66 In January 2009 Hartford sought to file a grievance, alleging that he had been terminated \u201cwithout just cause\u201d in violation of Article 5.6 of the CBA. The District superintendent, and later the Board, denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Hartford\u2019s request to grieve the issue, claiming the matter did not constitute a valid grievance under the CBA on grounds that Hartford was not a member of the bargaining unit at any point during his employment in the fall of2008, he was not a \u201cteacher\u201d as defined under Montana law during his employment in the fall of 2008, and he had not validated his employment status as a \u201cteacher\u201d in the fall of 2008 as required by \u00a7 20-4-202, MCA. Hartford and the KEA attempted to advance the grievance process to arbitration pursuant to Article 13.8 of the CBA, but the District refused to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b67 In August 2009 Hartford and the KEA filed a petition to compel arbitration in the District Court. The District opposed the petition and filed a counterclaim for declaratory judgment, followed by a motion for summary judgment, requesting a determination that \u00a7 20-4-201, MCA, prohibits a Montana school district from entering into or maintaining an employment contract with an individual as a teacher when the individual does not possess a valid Montana teaching certificate, and that therefore the Teacher\u2019s Contract became void as a matter of law the moment Hartford ceased to possess his teaching certificate. Hartford and the KEA also sought summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b68 The District Court entered an order granting Hartford and the KEA\u2019s motion and denying the same for the District, reasoning \u201c[t]he School District\u2019s arguments that once Mr. Hartford\u2019s certification expired all previously applicable contracts and rights evaporated is not supported by statute and case law. His employment contract continued without interruption as it had not been voided by the Trustees.\u201d The court reasoned the Teacher\u2019s Contract and the CBA \u201cwere both subject to law which include provisions for those situations where a teacher, qualified by education and training, did not have a current registered certificate.\u201d The court stated that \u201c[ijronically\u201d Hartford had obtained a new certificate seven days after dismissal that was retroactive to July 1, 2008, \u201cthereby vitiating the District\u2019s arguments that he was excluded from the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d The District Court concluded \u201cthe dispute falls under the umbrella of the Comprehensive Agreement,\u201d and ordered the matter submitted to arbitration as provided in the CBA. The District appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">\u00b69 Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>matter of law.\u201d M.

Section 27-5-113, MCA; <em>Missoula Co., </em>259 Mont, at 441, 857 P.2d at 698. Section 27-5-115, MCA, of the Act states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">Proceedings to compel or stay arbitration. (1) On the application of a party showing an agreement described in 27-5-114 and the opposing party\u2019s refusal to arbitrate, the district court shall order the parties to proceed with arbitration; but if the opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to the determination of that issue raised and shall order arbitration if it finds for the applying party or deny the application if it finds for the opposing party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">(5) An order for arbitration may not be refused on the ground that the claim in issue lacks merit or good faith or because no fault or grounds for the claim sought to be arbitrated have been shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">\u201cIt is essential to keep in mind ... that arbitration is a matter of contract ....\u201d <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, Inc., </em>2009 MT 362, \u00b6 25, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881 (citing <em>Solle v. Western States Ins. Agency, </em>2000 MT 96, \u00b6 22, 299 Mont. 237, 999 P.2d 328). When a court is asked to compel arbitration of a dispute, \u201cthe threshold inquiry is whether the parties agreed to arbitrate that dispute.\u201d <em>Woodruff v. Bretz, Inc., </em>2009 MT 329, \u00b6 7, 353 Mont. 6, 218 P.3d 486 (citing <em>Solle, </em>\u00b6 22; <em>State ex rel. Bullock </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>v. Philip Morris, Inc., </em>2009 MT 261, \u00b6 15, 352 Mont. 30, 217 P.3d 475; \u00a7 27-5-115, MCA). The United States Supreme Court has stated as axiom that \u2018\u201carbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed soto submit.\u2019\u201d <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc. v. Communications Workers of America, </em>475 U.S. 643, 648, 106 S. Ct. 1415, 1418 (1986) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. 574, 582, 80 S. Ct. 1347, 1353 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b612 In its opening brief, the District states its issue on appeal as whether the Teacher\u2019s Contract \u201cis void under Montana law,\u201d and argues the \u201c\u2018crux\u2019 of this entire matter\u201d is the \u201cconstruction or validity\u201d of the Teacher\u2019s Contract. \u201cThat threshold question,\u201d the District posits, \u201cinvolves <em>only </em>the application of Montana law and has absolutely nothing to do with the terms of the CBA. In short, the debate here boils down to the legal effect (if any) of that \u2018Teacher\u2019s Contract\u2019 as of the point in time that Mr. Hartford undisputedly ceased to possess a professional teaching certificate ....\u201d (Emphasis in original.) The District argues the Teacher\u2019s Contract became void as a matter of law when Hartford\u2019s certification expired, by virtue of \u00a7 20-4-201(1), MCA, which provides that school district trustees \u201chave the authority to employ any person as a teacher or specialist, but only a person who holds a valid Montana teacher or specialist certificate .... Each teacher or specialist must be employed under written contract ....\u201d The District argues Hartford\u2019s lapse in certification rendered his contract as one \u201cprohibited by statute,\u201d contrary to Montana public policy, and void. The District\u2019s position essentially requires the conclusion that the Teacher\u2019s Contract, which is \u201cvoidable at the option of the District\u201d when a teacher fails to hold certification, conflicts with statute, because at that point the District no longer had the choice or option under the statute to continue employing Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b613 The District seems to switch directions in the middle of briefing, at least in part. Despite its opening argument that the threshold question \u201chas absolutely nothing to do with the terms of the CBA,\u201d but only the void contract, it argues in reply that the case turns on the undisputed fact that Hartford was not certified at the time his employment was terminated and <em>\u201cthe black and white language of the applicable CBA </em>that specifically limits its coverage to individuals who possess a valid Montana teaching certificate.\u201d (Emphasis added, original emphasis omitted.) The District\u2019s arguments well illustrate the difficulty presented in defining the precise issue to be decided under the two contracts at issue, the Teacher\u2019s Contract and the CBA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>and determining whether arbitration is mandated.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-3\">\u00b614 Under its various arguments, the District too narrowly focuses on selected facts, and fails to consider the larger factual record. The District asserts the Teacher\u2019s Contract is \u201cprohibited by statute\u201d on the basis of \u00a7 20-4-201(1), MCA, and \u00a7 28-2-603, MCA, which declares void contracts with an unlawful single object, due to Hartford\u2019s temporary loss of certification. However, it is also undisputed that Hartford\u2019s Teacher\u2019s Contract had a lawful object when it was entered, thus satisfying \u00a7 28-2-602, MCA, which states \u201c[t]he object of the contract must be lawful when the contract is made....\u201d Thus, the District indeed had \u201cthe authority to employ\u201d Hartford, who then held \u201ca valid Montana teacher or specialist certificate.\u201d Section 20-4-201(1), MCA. Further, it is undisputed that Hartford was initially a member of the bargaining unit pursuant to Article 2.2 of the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b615 The lapse in Hartford\u2019s certification occurred after the Teacher\u2019s Contract was entered, and notice of the lapse was given by the county superintendent during the 2008-2009 school year, around November 1, pursuant to \u00a7 20-4-202, MCA. That statute provides that a teacher who fails to register his certificate with the county superintendent \u201cwithin 60 calendar days\u201d after beginning to provide services \u201cis not eligible to receive any further compensation under the contract of employment until the person has registered the certificate,\u201d and that \u201cthe district may not pay any teacher who has not registered the person\u2019s certificate until the county superintendent does notify the district of the registration.\u201d Section 20-4-202(1), MCA. Notably, the statute does not require termination of the teacher\u2019s employment, but rather requires cessation of further compensation under the employment contract <em>until </em>the teacher registers the certificate. Perhaps in recognition of this provision, the District changed Hartford\u2019s status to a non-certified substitute teacher, and he continued to teach. Section 20-4-202, MCA, does not further address the employment contract\u2019s status, particularly its voidability. The Teacher\u2019s Contract, by its own terms, was made \u201cvoidable at the option of the District.\u201d Hartford\u2019s employment was terminated by the high school principal on December 11,2008, and Hartford obtained his new teaching certificate seven days later, with a validation date of July 1, 2008. He attempted to file a grievance asserting the termination of his employment was \u201cwithout just cause\u201d in January 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b616 The CBA does not reference the provisions of 20-4-202, MCA, regarding notice and loss of pay for teachers who fail to register their certificates, nor otherwise address the status of a teacher/unit member <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>who temporarily loses certification during the term of the agreement, and re-obtains it. Article 13.1 of the CBA provides that an arbitrable grievance is <em>\u201ca </em>dispute or disagreement between the teacher and the District as to the interpretation or application of terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b617 For purposes of the judicial determination of arbitrability, the record demonstrates significant questions regarding the status of the Teacher\u2019s Contract and the application of the CBA, and that these questions are intertwined. The continued validity of the Teacher\u2019s Contract and Hartford\u2019s membership under the CBA after he temporarily lost certification and regained it retroactively present questions of interpretation and application of the contracts. The District sought a declaration that Hartford\u2019s Teacher\u2019s Contract was void as a matter of law, and, upon that premise, sought a secondary determination that Hartford retained no further rights under the CBA, thus foreclosing his grievance. But these questions, under these facts, are not that simple; and that bears upon the issue of arbitrability.</p>\n<p id=\"Alo\">\u00b618 The United States Supreme Court has explained that the \u201cpresumption of arbitrability\u201d means that \u201c \u2018[a]n order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u2019 \u201d <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S. Ct. at 1419 (quoting <em>Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co., </em>363 U.S. at 582-83, 80 S. Ct. at 1353). Recently, in <em>Granite Rock Company v. International Brotherhood of </em>Teamsters,_U.S._, 130 S. Ct. 2847, 2858 (2010), the Supreme Court explained that courts determining arbitrability of a dispute should apply the presumption if the arbitration agreement \u201cis ambiguous about whether it covers the dispute at hand.\u201d We have likewise acknowledged that \u201c[s\u00edtate and federal policies generally favor arbitration when a valid arbitration agreement exists between the parties.\u201d <em>Higgins Dev., </em>\u00b6 19 (citing the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16 (2006), and <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S. Ct. at 1419); <em>see also Solle, </em>\u00b6 21. The presumption of arbitrability \u201cis particularly applicable where the clause is as broad\u201d as it was in <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, </em>which provided for arbitration \u201c \u2018of any differences arising with respect to the interpretation of this contract or the performance of any obligation hereunder ....\u2019 \u201d <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S. Ct. at 1419.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b619 Similarly, we have recognized, in the context of exhaustion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>remedies, that the policy of the state of Montana favors resolving labor disputes under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>Klein v. State ex rel. Mont. Dept. of Corrections, </em>2008 MT 189, \u00b6 11, 343 Mont. 520, 185 P.3d 986 (citing <em>Small v. McRae, </em>200 Mont. 497, 503-04, 651 P.2d 982, 986 (1982)). \u201c \"Only... where it is certain that the arbitration clause contained in a collective bargaining agreement is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the dispute is an employee entitled to sidestep the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Klein, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Small, </em>200 Mont, at 504, 651 P.2d at 986).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b620 Further, in deciding whether the parties have agreed to submit a particular grievance to arbitration, \u201ca court is not to rule on the potential merits of the underlying claims.\u201d <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, </em>475 U.S. at 649, 106 S. Ct. at 1419. As previously noted, \u00a7 27-5-115(5), MCA, prohibits a court from refusing an order for arbitration \u201con the ground that the claim in issue lacks merit or good faith or because no fault or grounds for the claim sought to be arbitrated have been shown.\u201d <em>See e.g. Ratchye, </em>\u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b621  As noted above, significant questions have been raised in this record about the status of the Teacher\u2019s Contract and the application of the CBA to Hartford, a teacher/unit member who temporarily lost certification. Under the presumption, arbitration of a grievance \u201cshould not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute,\u201d and doubts are \u201cresolved in favor of coverage.\u201d <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, </em>475 U.S. at 650, 106 S. Ct. at 1419 (internal quotation marks omitted). An arbitrable grievance under Article 13.1 of the CBA consists of \u201ca dispute ... as to the interpretation or application of terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.\u201d We cannot say with \u201cpositive assurance that the arbitration clause is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d We therefore conclude Hartford\u2019s grievance is subject to arbitration under the CBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b622 We conclude the questions raised by this matter are properly submitted to arbitration, and we decline to address the merits of those issues.
