We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that STAB may not assess Puget\u2019s market value in an amount that exceeds the Department\u2019s original assessment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">\u00b64 The Department issued final ad valorem assessments of Puget for the 2005, 2006, and 2007 tax years. Puget petitioned STAB for review of the Department\u2019s assessments. STAB held a hearing over eight days. STAB determined that the Department inaccurately had assessed Puget\u2019s value. STAB assessed Puget\u2019s value in excess of the Department\u2019s original assessment. Puget petitioned the District Court for review. The court concluded that STAB could not adopt an assessment value that exceeded the Department\u2019s original assessment and remanded to STAB. The Department appeals only the court\u2019s determination that STAB improperly had increased Puget\u2019s taxable values.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">\u00b65 The Department\u2019s appraiser, John Cameron, appraised Puget for the tax years 2005, 2006, and 2007. Cameron\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation method valued Puget at $3.76 billion for 2005, $4.09 billion for 2006, and $4.69 billion for 2007. Cameron correlated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>original-cost-les s-depreciation values with the other indicators of value to reach correlated unit values of $3.74 billion for 2005, $4.09 billion for 2006, and $4.66 billion for 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b66 Puget directly petitioned STAB for review of Cameron\u2019s determinations of value. Puget did not request an administrative hearing with the Department\u2019s Office of Dispute Resolution. Puget\u2019s petition to STAB contended that \u201c[t]he Department has over-valued [Puget\u2019s] Montana property for all years at issue. In each case, the assessed value determined by the Department exceeds the fair market value of [Puget\u2019s] Montana properties.\u201d Puget\u2019s pre-hearing brief and post-hearing brief, as well as the agreed-upon pre-hearing conference order, state that Puget had requested that STAB make an \u201cultimate determination of market value\u201d and assess Puget in an amount that reflects market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b67 Puget and the Department each retained expert witnesses for the STAB proceedings. Puget\u2019s expert, John Davis, issued an independent expert appraisal that the parties admitted into evidence as a stipulated exhibit. Davis used an historical-cost-less-depreciation approach to reach values of $3.17 billion for 2005, $3.17 billion for 2006, and $3.34 billion for 2007. Davis calculated correlated unit values of $2.85 billion for 2005, $2.86 billion for 2006, and $3.00 billion for 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b68 The Department\u2019s expert, Brent Eyre, prepared an independent expert appraisal. Puget deposed Eyre regarding his appraisal before the STAB hearing. The parties stipulated to the admissibility of Eyre\u2019s appraisal report. Eyre\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation approach produced values of $3.77 billion for 2005, $4.17 billion for 2006, and $4.69 billion for 2007. Eyre reached correlated unit values of $3.98 billion for 2005, $4.32 billion for 2006, and $4.68 billion for 2007. Puget\u2019s witnesses challenged the validity of Eyre\u2019s calculations. Puget also used Eyre\u2019s calculations to contest the calculations of the Department\u2019s original appraiser, Cameron.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u00b69 STAB informed the parties that it felt \u201csome independent responsibility\u201d to determine the \u201cappropriate value\u201d for Puget. STAB identified several flaws in Cameron\u2019s assessment. STAB discredited Cameron\u2019s assessment due to a number of deficiencies. Cameron never had prepared a utility appraisal before 2005. Cameron did not hold any appraisal designations. Cameron had attended only one workshop before completing the Puget appraisal. The Department had failed to show that it supervised Cameron properly in the preparation of his appraisal. STAB pointed to testimony from Eyre that had identified material mistakes in Cameron\u2019s assessment. STAB concluded that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>could not afford the Department\u2019s appraisal a presumption of correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b610 STAB relied instead on the appraisals prepared and submitted by Eyre and Davis. STAB found Eyre\u2019s independent assessment of market value more credible and persuasive than Davis\u2019s assessment. STAB determined that Eyre\u2019s appraisals most closely comported with the evidence presented during the STAB hearing. STAB adopted Eyre\u2019s values as those that most closely reflected Puget\u2019s market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b611 STAB did not adopt Eyre\u2019s assessments wholesale. STAB disagreed with an adjustment made by Eyre under the original-costless-depreciation method. Eyre believed that Puget\u2019s contract to transport power on Bonneville Power Administration\u2019s (BPA) power lines constituted a beneficial use taxable under \u00a7 15-24-1203, MCA. Section 15-24-1203, MCA, imposes a tax on the possession or beneficial use of electric transmission lines. The Department and Eyre had not included the value of the beneficial use of the BPA\u2019s lines in their original-cost-less-depreciation method. The Department and Eyre both believed that the value of the contract could be taxed separately under \u00a7 15-24-1203, MCA, and added to the Montana allocated value.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b612 Puget argued that this approach constituted double taxation. Puget advocated that STAB incorporate the BPA contract value into the original-cost-less-depreciation indicator of value. This change would decrease Puget\u2019s ultimate tax liability. STAB agreed. STAB reached an original-cost-less-depreciation value of $3.80 billion for 2005, $4.19 billion for 2006, and $4.71 billion for 2007. STAB\u2019s correlated unit value for Puget resulted in a value of $3.98 billion for 2005, $4.33 billion for 2006, and $4.68 billion for 2007. STAB\u2019s adoption of the slightly higher Eyre values, coupled with STAB\u2019s addition for the BPA contract value, resulted in original-cost-less-depreciation indicators and correlated unit values for Puget that exceeded both Cameron\u2019s and Eyre\u2019s assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u00b613 Puget petitioned the District Court for judicial review. Puget argued that STAB lacked the authority to raise the appraised values or adopt an appraised value greater than the Department\u2019s original assessment. The District Court agreed that STAB could not adopt a market value that exceeded the Department\u2019s original assessment. The District Court also remanded several legal issues to STAB for further consideration, explanation, or clarification. The Department appeals only the issue of whether STAB has the authority to determine that Puget\u2019s market value exceeds that of the Department\u2019s original assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b614 We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>PacifiCorp v. State, </em>2011 MT 93, \u00b6 15, 360 Mont. 259, 253 P.3d 847. A district court reviews an administrative decision in a contested case to determine whether the findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether STAB correctly has interpreted the law. <em>Id., O\u2019Neill v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>2002 MT 130, \u00b6 10, 310 Mont. 148, 49 P.3d 43. We apply the same standard of review to an administrative appeal as the district court applies. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b615 Section 15-2-302, MCA, governs direct appeals to STAB from Department appraisals of centrally assessed property. Courts conduct judicial review according to the Montana Administrative Procedures Act (MAPA) and \u00a7 15-2-303, MCA. Section 15-2-302(5), MCA. MAPA sets forth the standard of judicial review in administrative proceedings at \u00a7 2-4-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b616 We defer to STAB\u2019s findings unless they are clearly erroneous, because STAB is particularly suited for settling disputes over the appropriate valuation of property. PacifiCorp, \u00b6 15. A decision of STAB may be affirmed or remanded for further proceedings. Section 2-4-704(2), MCA. A court also may reverse or modify a decision of STAB if STAB\u2019s findings, inferences, or conclusions are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record and prejudices the taxpayer\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b617 <em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that STAB may not assess Puget\u2019s market value in an amount that exceeds the Department\u2019s original assessment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b618 Montana law requires the Department to assess taxable property at 100% of its market value. Section 15-8-111(1), MCA. Section 15-8-lll(2)(a), MCA, defines market value as \u201cthe value at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller.\u201d The Department centrally assessed Puget\u2019s value according to the unit method of valuation. Section 15-23-101, MCA; Admin. R. M. 42.22.102 to 42.22.111. The unit method of valuation calculates the value of a business\u2019s entire operating system as a going concern and as a single entity. Admin. R. M. 42.22.101(32). This calculation includes all tangible and intangible operating assets of the company. Admin. R. M. 42.22.101(33).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-10\">\u00b619 The unit method authorizes the appraiser to consider cost, income, and market approaches to determine a business\u2019s market value. Admin. R. M. 42.22.111(1). The Department calculated five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>separate indicators of value for each of the subject years. Puget argued to the District Court that inaccuracies existed in several of the Department\u2019s indicators of value. The issue before this Court involves only the Department\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation method for calculating value. The original-cost-less-depreciation method derives value by subtracting depreciation from the historic or original cost of the company\u2019s taxable assets. Admin. R. M. 42.22.112(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b620 The Department next correlates the indicators of value into a single value called the correlated unit value. Admin. R. M. 42.22.111(2)-(3). The Department gave Puget\u2019s original-cost-less-depreciation indicator a 70% correlation weight. The Department then multiplied the correlated unit value by an allocation factor that represented the amount of Puget\u2019s property located within the state of Montana. The Department further adjusted the value to reach a final value to be \u201cdistributed to the taxing jurisdictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b621 STAB agreed with Puget that the Department\u2019s original appraisal contained serious flaws. STAB adopted values from Eyre\u2019s independent appraisal even though Eyre\u2019s appraisal contained values that exceeded the Department\u2019s appraisal. The District Court based its conclusion that STAB could not raise Puget\u2019s assessment on the fact that \u00a7\u00a7 15-2-201(l)(d) and -302, MCA, permitted appeals to STAB only by the taxpayer. The court noted that the statutes made no mention of appeals to STAB by the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b622 The court also concluded that STAB\u2019s upward adjustment violated Puget\u2019s right to due process because Puget had no notice that STAB would increase its assessed market value. The court dismissed out of hand the Department\u2019s contention that the mandate for 100% market value assessments in \u00a7 15-8-111(1), MCA, put Puget on notice that STAB could increase the Department\u2019s assessment if the Department\u2019s assessment did not reflect 100% market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">\u00b623 The Department argues that the statutory scheme and case law demonstrate that STAB serves a fact-finding function beyond the appellate function envisioned by the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7\u00a7 15-2-201(l)(d) and -302, MCA. Section 15-2-201(l)(d), MCA, authorizes STAB to \u201chear appeals from decisions of the department of revenue.\u201d Section 15-2-302(l)-(2), MCA, specifically permits corporations to appeal by filing a complaint with STAB. STAB immediately must transmit a copy of the complaint to the Department. Section 15-2-302(2), MCA. The Department must file an answer with STAB within 30 days. Section 15-2-302(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">\u00b624 We agree that the statutory scheme provides no avenue for the Department to appeal its own decisions to STAB. This determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>bears no importance, however, on the issue presented. The Department has not attempted to file a complaint with STAB. The Department has not initiated STAB\u2019s authority to settle the contested valuation of Puget\u2019s property. Puget filed the complaint. Puget brought to STAB the dispute over the market value of its property. The Department has raised in this Court only the issue of whether STAB has authority to reach a market value of Puget\u2019s property that exceeds the Department\u2019s flawed assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b625 The Montana Constitution requires an \u201cindependent appeal procedures for taxpayer grievances about appraisals, assessments, equalization and taxes.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7 7. Section 15-2-201(l)(d), MCA, authorizes STAB to \u201chear appeals from decisions\u201d of the Department in regard to property assessments. The District Court adopted the definition of \u201cappeal\u201d from www.dictionary.com as \u201can application or proceeding for review by a higher tribunal.\u201d The District Court\u2019s reliance on the dictionary definition ignores the statutory scheme governing STAB.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b626 Section 15-2-302, MCA, sets forth the procedure for an appeal from a taxpayer of centrally assessed property. STAB must conduct the direct appeal from the Department\u2019s final decision in accordance with the contested case provisions of MAPA. Section 15-2-302(4), MCA. MAPA provides for \u201cContested Cases\u201d at Title 2, Chapter 4, Part 6. These provisions outline the process for notice, discovery, informal hearings, hearing examiners, hearings rules, records, final orders, and other procedural rules. Sections 2-4-601 to -631, MCA. MAPA\u2019s hearing provision provides for the presentation of evidence in accordance with common law and statutory rules of evidence, the taking of testimony under oath, the opportunity for cross examination, the taking of judicial notice of cognizable facts, and the exercise of STAB\u2019s expertise, technical competence, and specialized knowledge in evaluating the evidence. Section 2-4-612, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b627 In comparison, \u00a7 15-2-301, MCA, provides for STAB\u2019s review of appeals from the County Tax Appeal Boards (CTAB). CTABs hear appeals from taxpayers regarding the tax appraisals of their property. Sections 15-15-101 to -104, MCA. A taxpayer can appeal a determination of the CTAB to STAB. Sections 15-15-104, 15-2-301, MCA. STAB may determine appeals from CTABs \u201con the record\u201d developed in proceedings before the CTAB. Section 15-2-301(2), MCA. STAB can consider \u201cin its discretion\u201d a copy of the CTAB transcript, additional sworn statements, and further testimony. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">\u00b628 STAB\u2019s function differs depending on whether the appeal derives from the CTABs pursuant to \u00a7 15-2-301, MCA, or from a taxpayer on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>direct appeal pursuant to \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA. No provision similar to \u00a7 15-2-302(4), MCA, incorporates the \u201ccontested case provisions\u201d of MAPA when STAB hears and determines an appeal from a decision of CTAB. In fact, the statutory scheme for appeals from CTAB \u201csupersedes\u201d MAPA to the extent that \u00a7 15-2-301, MCA, conflicts with MAPA. Section 15-2-301(4), MCA. Both \u00a7\u00a7 15-2-301 and -302, MCA, use the word \u201cappeal,\u201d but an appeal from a CTAB contemplates STAB serving in a role more like a typical appellate body.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b629 A direct appeal under \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA, like Puget\u2019s, requires STAB to serve a fact-finding function. STAB could not possibly serve as an appellate body over direct appeals under \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA, when no record, like that developed in the CTABs, ever has been created. The legislature would have constructed \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA, similar to \u00a7 15-2-301, MCA, or the judicial review provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 2-4-701 to -711, MCA, had it not intended for STAB to serve as a fact-finding tribunal over direct appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b630 This Court likewise has classified \u201cany appeal to the State Tax Appeal Board from [the Department\u2019s] final determination\u201d as a \u201ctrial de novo.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>173 Mont. 339, 343-44, 567 P.2d 913, 916 (1977); <em>Dept. of Revenue v. Burlington N. Inc., </em>169 Mont. 202, 213-14, 545 P.2d 1083, 1090 (1976). This Court regularly has deferred to STAB\u2019s expertise on taxation matters and has upheld STAB\u2019s decision to affirm the Department\u2019s assessment or reduce the Department\u2019s assessment. <em>PacifiCorp, </em>\u00b6 36; <em>State v. PPL Mont. LLC, </em>2007 MT 310, \u00b6 45, 340 Mont. 124, 172 P.3d 1241; <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b631 The parties have identified only one case, <em>Montana Department of Revenue v. Barron, </em>245 Mont. 100, 799 P.2d 533 (1990), in which this Court has considered a situation where STAB increased the Department\u2019s assessment. Puget argues that <em>Barron </em>stands for the principle that STAB cannot penalize the taxpayer by increasing the Department\u2019s assessment and thereby strip the taxpayer of \u201cthe beneficial fruits of her litigation.\u201d Puget claims that, until its appeal, STAB has refused to increase the Department\u2019s tax assessment pursuant to this <em>Barron </em>principle. Puget acknowledges that <em>Barron </em>and other STAB decisions have involved appeals from CTABs, but argues that <em>Barron\u2019s </em>rationale should be applied to a centrally assessed taxpayer challenging an assessment pursuant to \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b632 The Department in <em>Barron </em>filed an original proceeding in this Court. <em>Barron, </em>245 Mont, at 101-02, 799 P.2d at 534. The Department requested that this Court overturn STAB\u2019s determination that a newly enacted appraisal process violated the Montana Constitution\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>mandate that the State equalize the valuation of all property. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 799 P.2d at <em>535. </em>The taxpayer, Patricia Barron, challenged the Department\u2019s 1990 determination that her property\u2019s taxable value should be raised from $28,019 to $40,325. <em>Id. </em>at 103-04, 799 P.2d at 535. The rise in value resulted from the Department\u2019s new appraisal method that attempted to capture the actual market value of property. <em>Id., </em>799 P.2d at 534-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b633 Barron appealed first to the CTAB. <em>Id. </em>at 104, 799 P.2d at 535. The CTAB denied her appeal based on information that the Department would correct voluntarily its assessment. <em>Id., </em>799 P.2d at 535. Barron then appealed to STAB. <em>Id., </em>799 P.2d at 535. STAB found the Department\u2019s new appraisal process improper, rejected the Department\u2019s $40,325 appraisal, and assessed Barron\u2019s property at its purchase price of $75,000. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 799 P.2d at 541. This Court reversed the increased value assessed by STAB on the grounds that the new appraisal method violated the Montana Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 114, 799 P.2d at 541. The Court added in dicta that Barron deserved \u201cthe beneficial fruits of her litigation\u201d because she brought \u201cto the DOR and this Court the problems arising\u201d out of the newly enacted appraisal process. <em>Id., </em>799 P.2d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\u00b634 <em>Barron </em>has no precedential or persuasive value for the present issue .before the Court. <em>Barron </em>did not discuss STAB\u2019s authority under \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA. <em>Barron </em>did not involve a due process challenge to the procedural provisions governing STAB. Most importantly, <em>Barron </em>did not determine that Patricia Barron\u2019s tax assessment should be returned to its pre-1990 levels simply because she \u201cbore the burden of litigation\u201d or deserves \u201cthe beneficial fruits of her litigation.\u201d The Court in <em>Barron </em>restored the pre-1990 appraisal values because the Department\u2019s newly enacted appraisal method violated constitutional protections for equalized valuations, equal protection, and due process. <em>Id. </em>at 114-15, 799 P.2d at 541-42. We reject Puget\u2019s argument that the \u201cbeneficial fruits\u201d dicta in <em>Barron </em>precludes STAB from raising Puget\u2019s tax assessment to reflect its market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">\u00b635 In contrast to the constitutional claims raised in Barron\u2019s original proceeding action, Puget directly appealed the Department\u2019s assessments pursuant to \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA. STAB heard Puget\u2019s appeal from the Department\u2019s decisions. Section 15-2-201(l)(d), MCA. STAB conducted its proceedings according to the contested case provisions of MAPA as incorporated by \u00a7 15-2-302(4), MCA. No record had been developed outside STAB\u2019s proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b636 STAB afforded the parties \u201can opportunity for hearing after reasonable notice\u201d of the \u201cmatters asserted.\u201d Section 2-4-601, MCA. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>STAB provided the parties with the opportunity \u201cto respond and present evidence and argument on all issues involved.\u201d Section 2-4-612(1), MCA. STAB provided the parties the right to conduct the cross-examinations required for the full disclosure of facts. Section 2-4-612(5), MCA. STAB rendered a final, binding decision over the parties subject to judicial review. Sections 2-4-623,15-2-302(5), MCA. STAB\u2019s compliance with the contested case provisions of MAPA reflect its role as the fact-finding tribunal when a taxpayer raises a direct appeal under \u00a7 15-2-302, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b637  STAB possesses authority to assess a taxpayer\u2019s market value at 100% market value, even if the assessment exceeds the Department\u2019s original assessment. To conclude otherwise would hamstring STAB\u2019s authority to conduct a contested case under MAPA and to reach an independent assessment. The statutory mandate that all property \u201cmust be assessed at 100% of its market value\u201d applies equally to the Department and to STAB. Section 15-8-111(1), MCA. No exception exists for STAB to assess a centrally assessed taxpayer\u2019s property at less than 100% market value simply when the Department may have botched its initial assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b638 We turn to Puget\u2019s due process claim. Puget argues that the Department requested only that its original assessments be affirmed. Puget contends, as a result, that STAB cannot increase Puget\u2019s assessed value by adopting Brent Eyre\u2019s analysis. The District Court relied on <em>DeVoe v. Department of Revenue, </em>263 Mont. 100, 866 P.2d 228 (1993), to conclude that STAB could not reach a taxable market value in excess of the Department\u2019s assessment when the Department\u2019s pleadings had not requested increases in value.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b639 This Court in <em>DeVoe </em>determined that a taxpayer who successfully had challenged an adverse STAB decision could not recover attorney fees because the taxpayer had not notified the Department that he sought fees \u201cin either his petition or his arguments <em>to the District Court.\u201d Id. </em>at 118, 866 P.2d at 239 (emphasis added). Puget makes no claim here that it lacked notice in the District Court proceedings. Puget claims only that it lacked notice in the STAB proceedings that STAB had authority to conclude that Puget\u2019s market value exceeded the Department\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b640 We disagree with Puget that it lacked notice that STAB could increase its assessed value. Puget\u2019s own argument that STAB should add the value of the BPA contract to the original-cost-less-depreciation indicator belies its assertion that STAB could not increase the Department\u2019s assessment values. Further, Puget asserted in its prehearing and post-hearing briefs that STAB must make the \u201cultimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>determination of market value.\u201d The parties agreed in the preconference order that STAB should \u201center an order assessing the ad valorem property tax against [Puget\u2019s] property in an amount that reflects the fair market value of its Montana property.\u201d Puget squarely placed the issue of its market value before STAB for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"Amx\">\u00b641 Puget further had an opportunity to review Brent Eyre\u2019s expert assessment before the STAB hearing. Puget deposed Eyre before the STAB hearing. Puget had notice that Eyre believed that Puget\u2019s value exceeded the Department\u2019s assessment. Puget retained an expert to rebut the Department\u2019s and Eyre\u2019s assessments. Puget filed post-hearing briefs and proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law that criticized Eyre\u2019s analysis, methods, and results.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b642  STAB conducted an eight-day hearing. Puget makes no claim that STAB prevented it from presenting its evidence and argument. Puget had notice and an opportunity to cross-examine all the evidence presented by the Department that assessed its value at a greater value than the Department\u2019s original assessment. Puget has failed to explain how STAB\u2019s determination of Puget\u2019s market value violated its rights to notice and the opportunity to defend. We see no merit in its argument that it did not know STAB could reach an assessment that reflected its market value in compliance with \u00a7 15-8-111(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b643  We reverse the District Court. STAB has the constitutional and statutory duty to hear Puget\u2019s appeal and make an independent determination of Puget\u2019s market value even if STAB\u2019s assessment exceeds the Department\u2019s original assessment. We reject Puget\u2019s argument that it lacked notice or an opportunity to respond to STAB\u2019s determination that Puget\u2019s market value exceeded the Department\u2019s original assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b644 The Department asserted at oral argument that in light of our decision in <em>PacifiCorp </em>we need not remand to the District Court if we concluded that STAB had the authority to raise Puget\u2019s assessment values. We disagree. Puget\u2019s appeal to the District Court may have included issues not addressed in <em>PacifiCorp </em>or by the narrow issue that the Department appealed in this case. We accordingly remand to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion and our decision in <em>PacifiCorp.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b75-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, BAKER, WHEAT, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
