We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b62 We restate Patrick\u2019s issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it denied Patrick\u2019s motion to invalidate the State\u2019s judicial substitution after the sentencing judge recused herself from postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred when it denied Patrick\u2019s request for additional time to file a motion for judicial substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b231-10\">\u00b65 On August 9, 2010, Patrick filed a petition for postconviction relief.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 24, 2010, the Honorable Susan Watters, District Court Judge, who presided over Patrick\u2019s previous trial and sentencing, recused herself and ordered that Patrick\u2019s postconviction proceedings be reassigned. On August 24, 2010, Patrick\u2019s case was transferred to the Honorable Ingrid Gustafson, District Court Judge.</p>\n<p id=\"As_\">\u00b66 On August 27, 2010, the Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s Office filed a motion, pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, to substitute Judge Gustafson. The accompanying certificate of service affirmed that the motion was sent to Patrick at the Yellowstone County Detention Facility. However, Patrick had already been transferred to the regional prison in Shelby, Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">\u00b67 On August 27, the same day the State filed its motion to substitute, the Yellowstone County Clerk of Court filed a notice of substitution, transferring Patrick\u2019s postconviction proceedings to the Honorable Gregory Todd, District Court Judge. The Clerk of Court mailed notice to Patrick at his correct address in Shelby. Patrick received that notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>\u00b68 On September 24, 2010, Patrick filed a motion to invalidate the substitution of Judge Gustafson. He asserted that judicial substitution by right is not allowed in postconviction proceedings, and he was improperly served. The State filed a response asserting that upon Judge Watters\u2019 recusal, substitution was permitted under \u00a7 3-1-804(1) and (8), MCA. On October 13, 2010, Judge Todd issued an order denying Patrick\u2019s motion. On October 15, 2010, two days after the District Court issued its order, Patrick filed a reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">\u00b69 On November 1, 2010, Patrick filed a motion for relief from the District Court\u2019s October 13 order. Patrick asserted that the substitution of Judge Gustafson was invalid, he had not been properly served, and the October 13 order was void because he had not been permitted to file a reply brief. Patrick also raised a number of claims concerning equal protection, and due process. He requested that the substitution be invalidated and he be absolved from his procedural duty to serve the State for the remainder of the postconviction action. Alternatively, he requested 30 days to file his own motion for judicial substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">\u00b610 On December 9,2010, the District Court denied Patrick\u2019s motion. The District Court rejected Patrick\u2019s argument regarding his time to file a reply brief because under Uniform District Court Rule 2(a) reply briefs are discretionary. The District Court acknowledged that the State\u2019s motion to substitute had listed Patrick\u2019s wrong address but pointed out that Patrick had been mailed notice of the substitution on the same day the motion was filed and granted. The District Court concluded that to \u201caccept the voiding of a substitution in this case is to exalt form over function.\u201d With regard to Patrick\u2019s equal protection and due process claims, the District Court concluded that they would be resolved during postconviction proceedings. Finally, the District Court denied Patrick\u2019s request for an additional 30 days to file a motion for judicial substitution, concluding that any motion was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">\u00b611 A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute is a conclusion of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 403, \u00b6 6, 353 Mont. 467, 221 P.3d 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">\u00b612 \u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to substitute a district court judge presents a question of law. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether they are correct.\u201d <em>Eisenhart v. Puffer, </em>2008 MT 58, \u00b6 13, 341 Mont. 508, 178 P.3d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b613 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Patrick\u2019s motion to invalidate the State\u2019s judicial substitution after the sentencing judge recused herself from postconviction proceedings.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b614 Patrick makes three arguments that the substitution of Judge Gustafson was invalid. First, he asserts that there is no right to judicial substitution in postconviction proceedings. Second, he asserts that the State never properly served the motion to substitute. Third, he argues that he was denied due process because the District Court issued its order before he had the opportunity to file a reply brief. We address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\n<em>a. Judicial substitution in postconviction proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Asp\">\u00b615 The general rule in Montana is that each adverse party in a civil action has a statutory right to one judicial substitution in district court. Section 3-1-804(1), MCA; <em>Swan v. State, </em>2006 MT 39, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24, 331 Mont. 188, 130 P.3d 606. Postconviction proceedings are civil in nature. <em>Coleman v. State, </em>194 Mont. 428, 433, 633 P.2d 624, 627 (1981). Section 3-1-804, MCA, provides only three circumstances where judicial substitution is not available: when a district court judge is (1) acting as a water court judge, (2) acting as a workers\u2019 compensation judge, or (3) supervising the distribution of water under \u00a7 85-2-406, MCA. Thus, read alone, \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, permits judicial substitution in postconviction relief proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">\u00b616 However, the interplay between postconviction relief statutes and Title 3, Chapter 1, section 8, results in a denial of the right to judicial substitution in postconviction proceedings. <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont, at 433-34, 633 P.2d at 627-28; <em>State v. Harris, </em>2003 MT 258, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 317 Mont. 406, 77 P.3d 272. A petition for postconviction relief must be filed in \u201cthe court that imposed the sentence.\u201d Section 46-21-101(1), MCA. In <em>Coleman, </em>this Court interpreted \u201cthe court that imposed the sentence\u201d to require that postconviction proceedings occur in front of the same judge who presided over sentencing. <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont, at 434, 633 P.2d at 628. A number of policy reasons underlie such a conclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-8\">1. Reduction of burden on the District Court at the place of confinement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-9\">2. Reduction of costs as most hearing participants are likely to live near the trial court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-10\">3. The convicting court possesses greater familiarity with the facts and circumstances; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b233-11\">4. The goal of postconviction proceedings is to give the court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>made the initial determinations a chance to correct any mistakes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3f\"><em>Id. </em>Additionally, the Court inferred that the Legislature had intended for the sentencing judge to preside over subsequent postconviction proceedings. <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont, at 435, 633 P.3d at 628. Thus, the Court concluded that the specificity of \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, took precedence over the general statutory right to judicial substitution. <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont, at 433, 633 P.3d at 627; \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b617 The State agrees that the policies that govern the fifing of postconviction petitions are sound, but argues that \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, does not address the rare circumstance where the sentencing judge recuses herself from the postconviction proceedings. The State asserts that in such a case, \u00a7 3-1-804(8), MCA, should apply:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">If the presiding judge in any action recuses himself or herself or if a new district judge assumes jurisdiction in any action, the right to move for substitution of a district judge is reinstated, except as to parties who have previously obtained a substitution. The time periods run anew from the date of service of notice or other document identifying the new district judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Before turning to the resolution of this issue, we take this opportunity to recount the history of Montana\u2019s judicial substitution statute. The events surrounding the passage of the statute have been described as \u201cone of the bitterest conflicts of its kind ever waged in the United States.\u201d <em>Helen Fitzpatrick Sanders, A History of Montana </em>vol. 1, 420 (The Lewis Pub. Co. 1913).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">\u00b618 The story begins in 1889, in Butte, Montana, with the arrival of a young surveyor named F. Augustus Heinze. Though an ambitious man, Heinze had neither the wealth of W. A. Clark or Marcus Daly,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> nor their political connections. K. Ross Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>197-98 (U. Okla. Press 1959). However, what Heinze lacked in resources he made up for in a keen understanding of the law governing the ownership of ores within the earth. <em>Id. </em>Prior to Heinze\u2019s arrival, the Silver Bow County Courts had avoided litigation regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>ownership of the ores beneath the richest hill on earth; Heinze singularly changed that. Sanders, <em>A History of Montana </em>vol. 1, 421.</p>\n<p id=\"AAd\">\u00b619 Armed with his favorite legal weapon, the injunction, Heinze commenced filing lawsuits, asserting that various ore bodies reached an apex on his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 423. Generally, under the apex theory, or rule of extra-lateral rights, if an ore vein apexed on a claim, that claim\u2019s owner could chase the vein below ground, without regard to the claim\u2019s above-ground confines. <em>Id. </em>at 422. Heinze was not ashamed to purchase a tiny un-owned swath of land and immediately assert that ore being mined on a neighboring claim actually apexed on his. <em>Id. </em>at 423. Although such conduct might not ultimately prove legally successful, Heinze\u2019s cases had a habit of remaining tied up in the courts for years. Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>198-99. Heinze filed over 100 lawsuits, and between 1901 and 1902 he was involved in 14 separate actions before the Montana Supreme Court. <em>Id. </em>at 201. Furthermore, these lawsuits were not cheap. Heinze was known to have 37 lawyers on staff, and forced his opponents to spend millions on legal fees and associated costs. C. B. Glasscock, <em>The War of the Copper Kings </em>273 (Grosset &amp; Dunlap, 1966); Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>201-02. Moreover, while legal action was pending, Heinze was not above sending his workers into the earth to mine the contested ore, using the proceeds to maintain his expensive legal bills. Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>198-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">\u00b620 However, injunctions alone could not make Heinze rich. Rather, his true power has historically been perceived to have resided in the form of two men: District Court Judges William Clancy and E. W. Harney. Clancy was something of a judge-of-the people, popular with the bartenders, miners and \u201cthe lower level of Butte society.\u201d C. B. Glasscock, <em>The War of the Copper Kings </em>157. A \u201cburlesque of judicial dignity, William Clancy found in Heinze\u2019s favor with monotonous regularity.\u201d Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>199. In one notable case, Clancy determined that three valuable ore veins, the Anaconda, St. Lawrence and Neversweat, apexed in a 75-foot-long triangular sliver of land owned by Heinze. Sanders, A <em>History of Montana </em>vol. 1, 423. Harney, for his part, handed down one of Heinze\u2019s greatest victories, ownership of the disputed Minnie Healy Mine, amidst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>allegations of bribery, and revelation of a clandestine relationship with a public stenographer with ties to Heinze. <em>Id. </em>at 424.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Agd\">\u00b621 Historians disagree over whether Judges Harney and Clancy were corrupt, inept, or merely fiercely loyal to Heinze. <em>See, </em>Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>201, 204-05 (condemning the \u201cegg-bespattered Clancy\u201d but noting the potential that Harney was not corrupt); Sanders, <em>A History of Montana </em>vol. 1, 421-25 (declining to cast aspersions on either jurist); Glasscock, <em>The War of the Copper Kings </em>156 (noting that Clancy often took direct opposition to Heinze\u2019s interests); Malone &amp; Roeder, <em>Montana: A History of Two Centuries </em>172 (indicating that Clancy \u201cgained fame for his unfailing support of Heinze\u201d but noting that rumors of bribery were never proved). However, regardless of their motives, continual rulings in Heinze\u2019s favor invited the antipathy of the Amalgamated Copper Company. By that time a bloated leviathan of a world-wide mining entity, Amalgamated grew increasingly frustrated with its inability to crack Heinze\u2019s hold upon the Silver-Bow judiciary. Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>202. When legal action failed, Amalgamated resorted to bribery, offering Harney $250,000 to sign an affidavit that Heinze had purchased his loyalty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sanders, <em>A History of Montana </em>vol. 1, 425. Even when Amalgamated succeeded in removing Judge Harney from the lawsuit concerning ownership of the Minnie Healy Mine and obtained a new trial, the case was remanded to Judge Clancy, who subsequently ruled in Heinze\u2019s favor. <em>Finlen v. Heinze, </em>28 Mont. 548, 73 P. 123 (1903); <em>Finlen v. Heinze, </em>32 Mont. 354, 80 P. 918 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b622 Amalgamated realized that \u201crecourse\u201d to the law was both costly and unsuccessful and opted for a new approach: \u201cextortion.\u201d Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>206. On October 3,1903, Amalgamated announced a shutdown of all Montana operations, except for the company\u2019s newspapers, casting an estimated four-fifths of Montana wage earners into unemployment. <em>Id. </em>at 206-07. Amalgamated\u2019s demand was simple: the Governor was to call an extraordinary session <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>of the Montana Legislature in order to enact legislation that would put an end to the troublesome Heinze litigation. Sanders, <em>A History of Montana </em>vol. 1, 425; Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>208. On November 10, Governor Toole, \u201cyielding to the exigency of the hour,\u201d called a special session. Laws of Montana 1903, Second Extraordinary Session, p. 7. In response, the Legislature passed the \u201cFair Trial Bill,\u201d and Amalgamated resumed work throughout Montana. Sanders, <em>A History of Montana </em>vol. 1, 425. The new law permitted a party to automatically obtain judicial substitution by filing an affidavit upon the belief that a fair and impartial hearing or trial was not possible before the presiding judge. Laws of Montana 1903, Second Extraordinary Session, Ch. 3, \u00a7 1(4). By the next year, Judges Clancy and Harney were voted from the bench. Sanders, A <em>History ofMontana </em>vol. 1, 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b623 Ultimately, Heinze resists being cabined as angel or villain. Describing the moral conundrum he posed, a contemporaneous magazine explained, \u201c[h]is course has been without moral justification, but not wholly without excuse. Indeed, the most depressing feature of the conflict to an unprejudiced onlooker is the fact that had he been a more scrupulous man, he would long since have been wiped off the slate.\u201d Toole, <em>Montana: An Uncommon Land </em>203. In 1906, Amalgamated did finally erase Heinze. The company purchased his mining interests and secured the dismissal of eighty pending lawsuits. Four years later, he died penniless in New York City. <em>Id. </em>at 209. Despite this ultimate defeat, Augustus Heinze\u2019s short but successful vexation of the all-powerful Amalgamated provided the impetus for a judicial substitution statute that remains in effect over one century later.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b624  Returning to the case at hand, we conclude that when a sentencing judge recuses herself from postconviction proceedings, the parties may move for judicial substitution pursuant to \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA. As explained above, \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, takes precedence over \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, because the specific policies that favor having the sentencing judge preside over postconviction proceedings conflict with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>the general statutory right of judicial substitution. However, once a petition is properly filed in \u201cthe court that imposed the sentence\u201d and the sentencing judge recuses herself, the policies articulated in <em>Coleman </em>are absent.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b625 Any judge who assumes jurisdiction over a postconviction proceeding after recusal of the sentencing judge possesses no greater knowledge of the facts and circumstances than any other judge who might subsequently assume jurisdiction. Likewise, the goal of providing the sentencing judge with an opportunity to correct prior mistakes is obviated once the sentencing judge has ceased to preside over the action. In short, when Judge Watters recused herself from the postconviction proceedings, \u00a7 46-21-101, MCA, ceased to conflict with \u00a7 3-1-804, MCA, and no longer took precedence over the long-held right in Montana to a judicial substitution. The District Court did not err when it concluded that \u00a7 3-1-804(8), MCA, applied, and the \u201cright to move for substitution of a district judge [was] reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A5D\">\n<em>b. Service of the motion to substitute Judge Gustafson</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Adi\">\u00b626 Patrick next argues that the incorrect address on the State\u2019s motion to substitute, resulted in improper service, and the resulting judicial substitution was invalid. The State argues that the notice sent by the Yellowstone County Clerk of Court was sufficient to give Patrick actual notice that Judge Gustafson had been substituted. We agree with the District Court that Patrick\u2019s argument exalts \u201cform over function.\u201d Section 1-3-219, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b627 The Clerk of Court sent Patrick notice of Judge Gustafson\u2019s substitution on the same day that the State filed its motion. Section 3-l-804(2)(b), MCA, requires that \u201cthe moving party shall serve copies of the motion for substitution upon all other parties to the proceeding.\u201d However, judicial substitution occurs automatically upon the filing of a timely motion, precluding any objection until after the substitution has already occurred. Section 3-1-804(5), MCA (\u201cAfter a timely motion has been filed, the substituted district judge does not have power to act on the merits of the case or to decide legal issues in the case, except as provided in subsection (10).\u201d). As a result, any notice sent pursuant to \u00a7 3-l-804(2)(b), MCA, will inevitably be received subsequent to the substitution. Thus, the practical function of requiring service is to provide the other parties with actual notice that a party has exercised the statutory right of judicial substitution. Here, Patrick received such notice when the Clerk of Court sent notice of the substitution to Patrick\u2019s correct address.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\u00b628 Moreover, Patrick\u2019s actual notice of the substitution provided him ample opportunity to be heard. As the record reflects, he filed an objection and briefed the issue. When the District Court ruled against him, Patrick asked the District Court to reconsider, and the District Court again addressed Patrick\u2019s contentions,</p>\n<p id=\"Ahy\">c. <em>Reply brief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b629 Patrick fails to demonstrate that he was denied due process because the District Court issued its order on October 13, 2010, without waiting for his reply brief. Patrick subsequently filed a second motion requesting that the District Court reconsider the October 13 order. In its December 8, 2010 order, the District Court concluded, \u201cthis Court has reviewed all of the arguments of Patrick in his reply brief as well as his motion and brief for relief from order and to quash. All of Patrick\u2019s arguments are either repetitive or unpersuasive.\u201d Thus, Patrick had the opportunity to present all of his contentions to the District Court, and the District Court considered and rejected them.</p>\n<p id=\"A0N\">\u00b630 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Patrick\u2019s request for additional time to file his own motion for judicial substitution.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b631 A party to a civil action must file a motion for substitution \u201cwithin 30 calendar days after the first summons is served or an adverse party has appeared. A motion for substitution by the party served must be filed within 30 calendar days after service has been completed in compliance with M. R. Civ. P. 4.\u201d Section 8-l-804(l)(a), MCA. Patrick did not make a timely request for judicial substitution within 30 days of serving the State with his petition. Rather, he challenged the State\u2019s ability to move for a judicial substitution. Even after the District Court upheld the validity of the State\u2019s motion, Patrick still did not request a judicial substitution. Instead he requested a 30-day extension to file his own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b632  However, we recognize that the legal interplay between \u00a7\u00a73-1-804 and 46-21-101, MCA, was unsettled at the time Patrick objected to the substitution of Judge Gustafson. It would be inequitable to fault Patrick for failing to request a judicial substitution on September 24, 2010, when he filed an objection based upon the non-frivolous belief that the substitution was invalid. By the time the District Court issued its October 13,2010 order upholding the substitution, Patrick\u2019s 30-day window to file a motion had passed. Patrick should have been given the opportunity to file his own motion for judicial substitution. In these specific circumstances, equity dictates that Patrick be given 20 days to move for a judicial substitution, to run from the date of remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\u00b633 Finally, Patrick raises a number of claims that he has been the victim of ongoing due process and equal protection violations at the hands of the Thirteenth Judicial District Court. Rule 12(l)(f) of the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure requires that an Appellant\u2019s argument \u201ccontain the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issue presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d Patrick provides a page- and-a-half of conclusory allegations with no citations to any record or authority. This argument fails to comply with M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f) and we will not address it on appeal. <em>State v.
