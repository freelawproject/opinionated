(Credit Service) pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-717(3), MCA, based on insufficient funds checks written by Crasco to secure three payday loans. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b62 Crasco raises the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b63 <em>Could a collection agency charge bad check penalties under \u00a7 27-1-717(3), MCA (2007), for checks assigned to it from payday lenders when \u00a7 31-1-722(3), MCA (2007), prohibits the payday lenders themselves from charging such penalties?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">\u00b64 Crasco obtained three \u201cdeferred deposit loans\u201d from three different lenders. Section 31-1-703(5), MCA, defines a \u201cdeferred deposit loan\u201d as an arrangement in which a person accepts a check in exchange for a loan and agrees not to cash the check until some future date. Deferred deposit loans are commonly known as payday loans. Payday loans may not have a term that exceeds 31 days. Section 31-1-715(1), MCA. Payday loans can be made only for principal amounts between $50 and $300. Section 31-l-715(2)-(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">\u00b65 Crasco secured the three payday loans at issue with post-dated checks. Crasco used a $345 check dated March 31, 2009, to secure a payday loan from Western Pawnbrokers. Crasco used a $245 check dated April 15, 2009, to secure a payday loan from E-Z Money Check Cashing. Crasco used a $369 check dated May 1, 2009, to secure a payday loan from Money Lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">\u00b66 The payday lenders deposited the checks at the expiration of the loan period. The payor banks returned the checks for insufficient funds. The payday lenders assigned the checks to Credit Service, a collection agency. Credit Service sent demand letters to Crasco in July 2009. The letters demanded payment of the face value of the checks and a $30 service fee per check. The letters also indicated that Credit Service could collect \u201c$100.00 or three times the face amount of the check (not to exceed $500.00) as provided for under Section 27-1-717, MCA (2003).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-13\">\u00b67 Credit Service filed the instant action in August 2009 in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Yellowstone County Justice Court to recover the face value of the checks, a $30 service fee per check, and bad check penalties of $500 per check. Crasco argued that the bad check penalties could not be assessed against the payday loan checks. Crasco counterclaimed to recover $1000 penalty on each check, costs, and fees pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-724(3), MCA, for Credit Service\u2019s allegedly illegal pursuit of the bad check penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">\u00b68 The Yellowstone County Justice Court determined that Crasco must pay to Credit Service the face amount of each check and the $30 service charge on each check. The Justice Court concluded that Credit Service could not collect the bad check penalties. The Justice Court concluded that Crasco could recover damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-724(3), MCA, for Credit Service\u2019s illegal pursuit of the bad check penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b69 Credit Service appealed to the District Court. Credit Service raised two issues in the District Court. Credit Service first argued that the Justice Court incorrectly had concluded that collection agencies could not charge bad check penalties on checks that had been used to secure payday loans. Credit Service also argued that the Justice Court incorrectly had awarded Crasco damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-724, MCA. \u00b610 The District Court reversed. The District Court determined that Credit Service could collect the bad check penalties. The District Court did not address the issue regarding Credit Service\u2019s potential liability for damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-724, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b611 We review to determine whether a district court acting in an appellate capacity reached the correct conclusions under the appropriate standards of review. <em>State v. Finley, </em>2011 MT 89, \u00b6 17, 360 Mont. 173, 252 P.3d 199. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>BNSF Ry. Co. v. Cringle, </em>2010 MT 290, \u00b6 11, 359 Mont. 20, 247 P.3d 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">\u00b612 The Montana legislature enacted the Montana Deferred Deposit Loan Act, \u00a7\u00a7 31-1-701 to -729, MCA, (the Act) in 1999. The Act\u2019s purpose statement provides the legislature\u2019s intent \u201cto protect consumers who enter into short-term, high-rate loans with lenders from abuses that occur in the credit marketplace when the lenders are unregulated.\u201d Section 31-1-702, MCA. The Act applies to \u201cdeferred deposit lenders and to persons who facilitate, enable, or act as a conduit for persons making deferred deposit loans.\u201d Section 31-1-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>704(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b613 The 2009 legislature made amendments to the Act that went into effect October 1,2009. Mont. Sen. 54, L. 2009, Ch. 81, Sec. 6 (March 25, 2009). For example, the 2009 legislature amended \u00a7 31-1-722(3), MCA, to include that \u201cany collection agency acting as an agent of a licensee, as a holder in due course of a licensee, or under an agreement with a licensee\u201d may not collect bad check penalties. <em>Id. </em>Montana voters approved additional proposed changes to \u00a7 31-1-722, MCA, on November 2,2010. Sec. 6,1.M. No. 164 (approved Nov. 2,2010). Crasco received the three payday loans in 2009 before these changes to \u00a7 31-1-722, MCA, went into effect. The parties agree that the 2007 version of \u00a7 31-1-722, MCA, applies. We apply \u00a7 31-1-722, MCA, as it existed when Crasco entered the payday loan agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">\u00b614  The Act prohibits a payday lender from charging any interest, fees, or charges except those specifically provided in \u00a7 31-1-722, MCA. Section 31-1-722(1), MCA. Payday lenders can charge only one fee of $30 for each check returned for insufficient funds. Section 31-1-722(3), MCA (2007). A payday lender may not collect a bad check penalty for an insufficient funds check. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b615  Section 27-1-717, MCA, defines the damages that a party can recover from the drafter of an insufficient funds check. The payee or assignee of a bad check can recover the value of the check, an additional $30 service fee, and, possibly, damages not to exceed $500. Section 27-l-717(2)-(3), MCA. Section 31-1-722(3), MCA, prohibits Crasco\u2019s payday lenders from collecting the bad check penalties. Credit Service nevertheless charged Crasco with the bad check penalties. Credit Service interpreted the Act not to apply to collection agencies to whom payday lenders assign their interests in bad checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b616 Crasco argues that the limitation on bad check penalties in \u00a7 31-1-722(3), MCA (2007), should apply to Credit Service as well. Crasco contends that a collection agency cannot obtain greater rights under the assignment of the debt than that of the payday lender. We agree that payday lenders cannot make an end run around the limitations in \u00a7 31-1-722(3), MCA (2007), simply by assigning the insufficient funds checks to a collection agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">\u00b617 An assignee of contract rights generally stands in the shoes of the assignor. <em>Massey-Ferguson Credit Corp. v. Brown, </em>173 Mont. 253, 256, 567 P.2d 440, 441-42 (1977). The assignee obtains no greater rights against the account debtor than the assignor. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the Act itself restricts a payday lender from using \u201cany device or agreement that would have the effect of charging or collecting more fees, charges, or interest than those allowed\u201d by the Act. Section 31-1-723(6), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>\u00b618 Credit Service argues that a party can assign greater rights than the party possesses. Credit Service provides as examples a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument, a buyer in the ordinary course of business, and a bona fide purchaser for value of real estate. Credit Service cites no legal authority for its assignment of greater rights argument and fails to explain why the Court should adopt the theory based on the three examples provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">\u00b619 We disagree, regardless, that a payday lender can assign greater rights to a collection agency than the payday lender itself can enforce. Section 31-1-715(9), MCA, clearly states that \u201cthe holder or assignee of any check written by a consumer in connection with a deferred deposit loan takes the instrument subject to all claims and defenses of the consumer.\u201d Crasco\u2019s defenses included the protection against bad check penalties when she entered the three payday loan agreements. Section 31-1-722(3), MCA (2007). Credit Service took the payday loan checks subject to Crasco\u2019s defense that bad check penalties could not be assessed against payday loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">\u00b620 Credit Service argues that \u00a7 31-l-704(2)(b), MCA(2007), exempts collection agencies from complying with the Act. Section 31-l-704(2)(b), MCA (2007), states that the Act did not apply to a \u201ccollection agency\u201d that had \u201centered into an agreement\u201d with a payday lender \u201cfor the collection of claims owed or due\u201d the payday lender. The legislature deleted this collection agency exemption in 2009. Section 31-1-704, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b621 Neither party contests that Credit Service constitutes a \u201ccollection agency\u201d that has \u201centered into an agreement\u201d with a payday lender. Credit Service argues that our reading of \u00a7 31-l-704(2)(b), MCA(2007), should end there. Credit Service argues that we should declare the Act wholly inapplicable to collection agencies. We disagree. Credit Service\u2019s interpretation fails to give effect to the remaining words in \u00a7 31-1-704(2)(b), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">\u00b622 Section 31-l-704(2)(b), MCA (2007), exempts only a collection agency that has entered an agreement with a payday lender \u201cfor the collection of claims owed or due or asserted to be owed or due the [payday] lender.\u201d Bad check penalties authorized under \u00a7 27-1-717(3), MCA, may never be \u201cowed or due or asserted to be owed or due\u201d to payday lenders. Section 31-1-722(3), MCA (2007). The exemption for collection agencies contained in \u00a7 31-l-704(2)(b), MCA (2007), extended only to those collection agencies seeking \u201ccollection of claims owed or due\u201d to payday lenders. Credit Service lost its exempt status when it pursued bad check penalties that clearly cannot be collected by a payday lender itself. Section 31-1-722(3), MCA (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>\u00b623 Section 31-l-704(2)(b), MCA (2007), creates a limited exemption \u201cfor the collection of claims owed or due ... the [payday] lender,\u201d not the unqualified exemption desired by Credit Service. This interpretation of the Act\u2019s exemption gives effect to all of its words. <em>Montco v. Simonich, </em>285 Mont. 280, 287, 947 P.2d 1047, 1051 (1997). A collection agency operating within the limitations of the plain language of the exemption continues to benefit from exemption from licensing, fee, and reporting requirements, as well as other regulatory protections, of the Act. A different interpretation would permit a payday lender to circumvent the Act simply by setting up a sister corporation that collects all of its bills under the guise of a separate \u201ccollection agency.\u201d Any broader interpretation fails to give effect to all of the language in the statute and frustrates the Act\u2019s purpose \u201cto protect consumers\u201d who enter into payday loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b624 The Yellowstone Comity Justice Court also granted Crasco penalties, costs, and fees under \u00a7 31-1-724(3), MCA. Section 31-1-724(3), MCA, provides a consumer with remedies against a person who has \u201cintentionally violated\u201d the Act. The remedies apply to licensees and unlicensed persons. Section 31-1-724(1), MCA. The remedies include costs, attorney fees, and a $1000 penalty for each violation. Section 31-1-724(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b625  The District Court did not review the award of penalties, costs, and fees. We remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance whether Credit Service\u2019s illegal pursuit of the bad check penalties constituted an intentional violation of the Act that justifies the Justice Court\u2019s award of penalties, costs, and fees to Crasco. We note that Credit Service\u2019s incorrect interpretation of the exclusion provision, or its hope that this Court would interpret the Act\u2019s provisions in a manner that permitted its illegal collection practices, will not serve as a defense that it did not act intentionally. Ignorance of the law provides no excuse for its violation. <em>Wiard v. Liberty N.W. Ins. Corp., </em>2003 MT 295, \u00b6 32, 318 Mont. 132, 79 P.3d 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">\u00b626 We remand to the District Court to determine whether Credit Service intentionally violated the Act in contravention of \u00a7 31-1-724, MCA. If so, the District Court must determine the amount of penalties, costs, and attorney fees awardable to Crasco.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\u00b627 Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b520-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
