H&amp;B appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">\u00b62 We address the folio-wing issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">\u00b63 Issue 1: <em>Did the District Court properly deny H&amp;B\u2019s summary judgment motion on Patches\u2019 failure to warn claim ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">\u00b64 Issue 2: <em>Did the District Court properly deny H&amp;B\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">\u00b65 Issue 3: <em>Did the District Court properly grant Patches\u2019 motion in limine regarding H&amp;B\u2019s assumption of the risk defense?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-14\">\u00b66 Issue 4: <em>Did the District Court properly instruct the jury?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-15\">\u00b67 Issue 5: <em>Should the verdict be set aside and a new trial granted?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-16\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b268-17\">\u00b68 While pitching in an American Legion baseball game on July 25, 2003, eighteen-year-old Brandon was struck in the head by a batted ball that was hit using H&amp;B\u2019s model CB-13 aluminum bat. Tragically, Brandon died from his injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>\u00b69 In 2006, Brandon\u2019s parents, individually and as representatives of Brandon\u2019s estate, sued H&amp;B in strict products liability<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for survivorship and wrongful death damages, asserting manufacturing and design defect and failure to warn claims. Patches claimed H&amp;B\u2019s model CB-13 aluminum bat was in a defective condition because of the enhanced risks associated with its use: It increased the velocity speed of a batted ball when it left the bat, thus decreasing infielders\u2019 reaction times,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and resulted in a greater number of high energy batted balls in the infield.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\u00b610 Before trial, the District Court granted H&amp;B\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Patches\u2019 manufacturing defect claim, but denied summary judgment on Patches\u2019 design defect and failure to warn claims. The District Court granted Patches\u2019 motion in limine, excluding H&amp;B\u2019s assumption of the risk defense. The matter was tried in October 2009, and Patches\u2019 design defect and failure to warn claims were submitted to the jury. The jury concluded the model CB-13 aluminum bat was not designed defectively, but determined the bat was in a defective condition due to H&amp;B\u2019s failure to warn of the enhanced risks associated with its use and awarded Patches an $850,000 verdict on their failure to warn claim. Post-trial, the District Court denied H&amp;B\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">\u00b611 We review an order granting or denying summary judgment de novo, using the same Montana Rule of Civil Procedure 56 criteria that the district court used. Summary judgment is not appropriate where any genuine issue of material fact exists. The party moving for summary judgment has the burden of demonstrating the absence of genuine issues of material fact. All reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Wood v. Old Trapper Taxi, </em>286 Mont. 18, 23-24, 952 P.2d 1375, 1378-79 (1997).

A court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or so exceeds the bounds of reason as to work a substantial injustice. <em>Malcolm, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">\u00b613 Issue 1: <em>Did the District Court properly deny H&amp;B\u2019s summary judgment motion on Patches\u2019 failure to warn claim?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">\u00b614 The District Court denied H&amp;B\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that failure to warn claims are available to bystanders, such as Brandon.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> H&amp;B concedes that users and consumers may bring failure to warn claims, but argues it is entitled to summary judgment because failure to warn claims are not available to bystanders.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, H&amp;B asserts that only the individual batting (actual user) and the individual who purchased the bat (actual consumer) can assert a failure to warn claim in this case. H&amp;B\u2019s narrow interpretation of the terms user and consumer is contrary to the definition of the terms as contained in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and is incongruent with this Court\u2019s products liability jurisprudence.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">\u00b615 In <em>Brandenburger v. Toyota Motor Sales, </em>162 Mont. 506, 513 P.2d 268 (1973), this Court adopted the theory of strict products liability contained in <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A, which provides that \u201c[o]ne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical harm thereby caused to the ultimate user or consumer <em>....\u2019\u2019Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 402A(1) (1965). Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the drafters did not determine whether \u00a7 402A applied to bystanders,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> they broadly defined the terms consumer and user. For example, they defined the term consumer to \u201cinclude not only those who in fact consume the product, but also those who prepare it for consumption ....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 402A cmt. 1. They reasoned that a consumer does not necessarily have to purchase the product. \u201cHe may be a member of the family of the final purchaser, or his employee, or a guest at his table, or a mere donee from the purchaser.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They also stated that the term user \u201cincludes those who are passively enjoying the benefit of the product, as in the case of passengers in automobiles or airplanes, as well as those who are utilizing it for the purpose of doing work upon it, as in the case of an employee <em>...\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">\u00b616 This Court\u2019s products liability jurisprudence recognizes that a failure to warn claim may be brought by persons who are not actual purchasers or users of a product. For example, in <em>Streich v. Hilton-Davis, </em>defendant Hilton-Davis sold a chemical to Streich, a potato farmer, who applied the product to his seed potatoes. Streich later sold some of his seed potatoes to Williamson and Boorman. All three farmers suffered crop damage and sued Hilton-Davis in products liability for failure to warn. <em>Streich v. Hilton-Davis, </em>214 Mont. 44, 47-48, 692 P.2d 440, 442 (1984). Although Williamson and Boorman had not purchased or used the chemical, they were treated no differently than Streich, and this Court affirmed the jury\u2019s damage award on their failure to warn claims. <em>Id. </em>at 57-58, 696 P.2d at 447; <em>see also Hagen v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>261 Mont. 487, 863 P.2d 413 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">\u00b617  The realities of the game of baseball support the District Court\u2019s decision to submit Patches\u2019 failure to warn claim to the jury. The bat is an indispensible part of the game. The risk of harm accompanying the bat\u2019s use extends beyond the player who holds the bat in his or her hands. A warning of the bat\u2019s risks to only the batter standing at the plate inadequately communicates the potential risk of harm posed by the bat\u2019s increased exit speed. In this context, all of the players, including Brandon, were users or consumers placed at risk by the increased exit speed caused by H&amp;B\u2019s bat. H&amp;B is subject to liability to all players in the game, including Brandon, for the physical harm caused by its bat\u2019s increased exit speed. We conclude the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Court did not err in denying H&amp;B summary judgment and submitting Patches\u2019 failure to warn claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">\u00b618 In addition, H&amp;B argues that summary judgment is appropriate because (1) providing a warning to bystanders is \u201cunworkable,\u201d and (2) Patches could not produce causation evidence establishing that they could have seen, read, and heeded a warning on the bat in a manner to prevent Brandon\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">\u00b619 H&amp;B\u2019s first argument fails because the \u201cworkability\u201d of providing a warning is a jury question. <em>See Macrie v. SDS Biotech </em>Corp., 630 A.2d 805 (N.J. Super. App. Div. 1993). In <em>Macrie, </em>employees of a produce broker were seriously injured after being exposed to a toxic fungicide while they unpacked produce that had been treated with the fungicide by a farmer who had sold the produce to their employer. The employees brought a failure to warn claim against the manufacturer of the fungicide. <em>Id. </em>at 807-08. As H&amp;B does here, the manufacturer argued that it was not feasible, i.e., \u201cworkable,\u201d to warn the employees of the risks associated with the fungicide. <em>Id. </em>at 808. The <em>Macrie </em>court rejected the manufacturer\u2019s argument and concluded that the feasibility of providing warnings is a jury question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-6\">[WJhere a jury could find that plaintiffs foreseeable exposure [to the fungicide] would threaten them with serious physical harm, the jury could also determine that minimizing the danger warranted unusually strenuous efforts to provide them with warnings and instructions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">\u00b620 H&amp;B\u2019s second argument incorrectly limits the scope of the warning by erroneously assuming that placing a warning directly on the bat is the only method to provide a warning. While placing a warning directly on a product is one method of warning, other methods of warning exist, including, but not limited to, issuing oral warnings and placing warnings in advertisements, posters, and media releases. <em>Davis v. Wyeth Laboratories, Inc., </em>399 F.2d 121, 131 (9th Cir. 1968) (\u201c[0]ther means of communication such as advertisements, posters, releases to be read and signed ... or oral warnings ... could easily have been undertaken ....\u201d). Such warnings, if issued by H&amp;B in this case, would have communicated to all players the potential risk of harm associated with H&amp;B\u2019s bat\u2019s increased exit speed. H&amp;B\u2019s false assumption fails to establish the absence of genuine issues of material fact. <em>Wood, </em>286 Mont, at 23-24, 952 P.3d at 1379.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">\u00b621  Because genuine issues of material fact exist regarding the scope of the warning and because the \u201cworkability\u201d of providing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>warning is a jury question, the District Court properly denied H&amp;B summary judgment on its causation argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">\u00b622 Issue 2: <em>Did the District Court properly deny H&amp;B\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b623 H&amp;B argues the District Court erred in applying a \u201cread and heed\u201d inference when it denied H&amp;B\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion for judgment as a matter of law because the adoption of an inference violates our holding in <em>Riley v. American Honda Motor Company, </em>259 Mont. 128, 856 P.2d 196 (1993), and \u00a7 26-1-502, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b624 Judgment as a matter of law is appropriate only when, considering all evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is a complete lack of evidence that would justify submitting an issue to the jury. <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b625 In a failure to warn case, the plaintiff has the burden of proving (1) the product was sold in a defective condition due to the lack of or an inadequate warning, (2) the defect caused the injury, and (3) the defect is traceable to the defendant. <em>Wood, </em>286 Mont, at 28,952 P.2d at 1382. The policy underlying products liability-protecting the consuming public by requiring manufacturers to bear the burden of injuries caused by defective products-requires courts to apply a flexible standard of proof. <em>Brandenburger, </em>162 Mont, at 517, 513 P.2d at 275. The nature and quality of evidence used in products liability cases to demonstrate causation varies, and the death or inability of the plaintiff to testify is one of the factors influencing the requisite standard of proof. <em>Id. </em>at 518, 513 P.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b626 As an initial matter, we decline to address H&amp;B\u2019s \u00a7 26-1-502, MCA, inference upon inference argument because, as we discussed in Issue 1, it is based upon H&amp;B\u2019s incorrect assumption that the only method to provide a warning is directly on the bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\u00b627 H&amp;B disregards our prior approval of a flexible standard of proof in products liability cases and argues the \u201crule\u201d of causation we adopted in <em>Riley </em>is paramount. There, Riley was injured in a motorcycle accident and sued Honda, asserting claims of manufacturing and design defect and failure to warn. The district court dismissed Riley\u2019s failure to warn claim, and he appealed. <em>Riley, </em>259 Mont, at 130, 856 P.2d at 197. On appeal, Riley argued that his testimony relating to his respect for machinery and concern for safety was sufficient evidence from which to infer that he would have operated the motorcycle differently had he been warned of its propensity to wobble. The majority concluded that plaintiffs could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>satisfy the causation element by presenting evidence that a warning would have altered their conduct, but noted Riley had not done so. <em>Id. </em>at 132-33, 856 P.2d at 198-99. The dissent in <em>Riley </em>advocated for the adoption of a rebuttable presumption, reasoning that requiring a plaintiff to testify about whether he or she would have read and heeded a warning was speculative and self-serving and impossible if the plaintiff died. <em>Id. </em>at 136-37, 856 P.2d at 201 (McDonough, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b628 Contrary to H&amp;B\u2019s argument that <em>Riley </em>developed <em>the </em>\u201crule\u201d of causation in failure to warn cases, our decision in <em>Riley </em>was not intended to limit the flexible standard of proof in products liability cases. Subsequent cases citing <em>Riley </em>illustrate that it provides only one method for proving causation. <em>See Emery v. Federated Foods, Inc., </em>262 Mont. 83, 92, 863 P.2d 426, 433 (1993); <em>Wood, </em>286 Mont, at 30, 952 P.2d at 1383. For example, in <em>Emery, </em>we noted causation <em>\u201ccan he </em>satisfied by evidence indicating that a warning would have altered the plaintiffs use of the product or prompted the plaintiff to take precautions to avoid the injury.\u201d <em>Emery, </em>262 Mont, at 92, 863 P.2d at 433 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b629 Further, <em>Riley </em>is distinguishable from Patches\u2019 situation because Brandon is deceased. And, as predicted by the dissent in <em>Riley, </em>it would be unfair and unjust to apply <em>Riley\u2019s </em>self-serving \u201cmagic-words\u201d requirement here. The District Court recognized this and, relying on <em>Schutte v. Celotex Corporation, </em>492 N.W.2d 773 (Mich. App. 1992), properly allowed the jury to infer that Patches would have heeded a warning had one been given. Although <em>Schutte </em>is a negligence case involving failure to warn, we find that its rationale for permitting an inference is applicable to products liability failure to warn claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-6\">In certain situations ... where the consequences ... are severe, the lack of warning is undisputed, and the person ...is dead, the jury may be permitted to infer that a warning would have been heeded and that the failure to warn was a proximate cause of the injury. Not only would it be virtually impossible to prove what the decedent would have done had he been warned, but, as a practical matter, nothing more is added in this case by having a witness merely state that, had the danger been known... he would have acted to avoid the danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b274-7\"><em>Schutte, </em>492 N.W.2d at 777.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">\u00b630 The District Court properly applied a flexible standard of proof and acted in accordance with our precedent, including <em>Riley. </em>H&amp;B\u2019s Rule 50(b) motion was properly denied because there was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>complete lack of evidence to justify withholding the issue from the jury. Testimony that Brandon followed guidelines and that his teammates quit using aluminum bats and switched to wood bats after his death warranted submitting Patches\u2019 failure to warn claim to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b631 Issue 3: <em>Did the District Court properly grant Patches\u2019 motion in limine regarding H&amp;B\u2019s assumption of the risk defense ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">\u00b632 The District Court concluded Brandon\u2019s voluntary participation in the game did not make assumption of the risk applicable. H&amp;B argues that because Brandon had been hit by batted balls before, he knew he could be hit and, therefore, assumed the risk when he continued playing baseball.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b633 Section 27-l-719(5)(a), MCA, permits a manufacturer to assert the affirmative defense of assumption of the risk where \u201c[t]he user or consumer of the product discovered the defect or the defect was open and obvious and the user or consumer unreasonably made use of the product and was injured by it.\u201d We clarified the assumption of the risk defense in <em>Lutz v. National Crane Corporation, </em>where we held the defense is inapplicable as a matter of law without evidence the victim actually knew he or she would suffer serious injury or death, and, knowing that, the victim voluntarily exposed himself or herself to the danger. <em>Lutz v. Natl. Crane Corp., </em>267 Mont. 368, 379-80, 884 P.2d 455, 461-62 (1994). What the victim actually knew is evaluated using a subjective standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b634  Assumption of the risk was not applicable here because there is no evidence that Brandon actually knew he would be seriously injured or killed when pitching to a batter using one of H&amp;B\u2019s model CB-13 aluminum bats. In other words, H&amp;B failed to show that Brandon was aware of the enhanced risks associated with the model CB-13 aluminum bat, and, knowing that, he voluntarily proceeded to pitch to a batter using that bat. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in granting Patches\u2019 motion in limine.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">\u00b635 Issue 4: <em>Did the District Court properly instruct the jury1?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\u00b636 The District Court instructed the jury on failure to warn as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-10\">Instruction No. 15</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-11\">A product may cause injury because of inadequate warning. In order to recover for such injury, the Plaintiff must prove:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-13\">First, that the Defendant manufactured or sold the product in a defective condition because of a failure to adequately warn of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>those dangers which would not be readily recognized by a <em>bystander.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-4\">Second, that the failure to provide adequate warning caused injury to the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">(Emphasis added.) The District Court substituted \u201cbystander\u201d for \u201cordinary user of the product\u201d based upon Montana Pattern Jury Instruction (Second) \u00a7 7.00, which provides that \u201cin cases of injuries to bystanders, the court should modify the \u2018user\u2019 language accordingly.\" \u00b637 H&amp;B argues the substitution of \u201cbystander\u201d is erroneous and, relying on <em>Riley, </em>asserts the court erred in refusing to adopt H&amp;B\u2019s proposed final sentence to Instruction No. 15: \u201cCausation for a failure to warn claim requires proof that a warning would have altered the use of a product or prompted precautions to avoid the injury.\u201d H&amp;B also argues a new trial is required because Instruction No. 15 was inconsistent with the verdict form, which asked: \u201cDid the Defendant fail to adequately warn of those dangers which would not be readily recognized by the ordinary <em>user </em>of the product?\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u00b638 \u201cJury instructions must fully and fairly inform the jury of the law applicable to the case.\u201d <em>Peterson v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2010 MT 187, \u00b6 33, 357 Mont. 293, 239 P.3d 904. Plain, clear, concise, and brief jury instructions promote verdicts consistent with the evidence and the law. <em>Id. </em>The party challenging a jury instruction must demonstrate prejudice. We will not find prejudice where the instructions state the applicable law of the case. <em>McAlpine v. Rhone-Poulenc Ag Co., </em>2000 MT 383, \u00b6 16, 304 Mont. 31, 16 P.3d 1054.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">\u00b639 As a whole, the instructions correctly instructed the jury on the law applicable to this case. Although the District Court replaced \u201cuser\u201d with \u201cbystander,\u201d Instruction No. 15 included a second requirement that \u201cthe failure to provide adequate warning caused injury to the Plaintiff,\u201d and the verdict form focused on the user of the product, rather than a bystander. The jury obviously determined Brandon was a user of the product. As noted in Issue 2, <em>Riley </em>is not the applicable rule of causation here. We find no prejudice in the court\u2019s refusal of H&amp;B\u2019s <em>Riley-based </em>proposed addition to Instruction No. 15. Any inconsistency between the verdict form and Instruction No. 15 is harmless because it did not prejudice H&amp;B\u2019s substantial rights. <em>See State v. Schmidt, </em>2009 MT 450, \u00b6 26, 354 Mont. 280, 224 P.3d 618.</p>\n<p id=\"Ard\">\u00b640 Issue 5: <em>Should the verdict be set aside and a new trial granted?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Ams\">\u00b641 Relying on \u00a7 25-11-102, MCA, H&amp;B argues it is entitled to a new trial because there was not sufficient causation evidence presented to justify the verdict and an error in law occurred at trial when the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>rejected H&amp;B\u2019s <em>Riley </em>argument and adopted an inference. H&amp;B\u2019s current argument re-hashes its arguments raised in Issues 1 and 2. We decline to discuss these arguments any further.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">\u00b642 The District Court properly denied H&amp;B\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Patches\u2019 failure to warn claim because H&amp;B is subject to liability to all players, including Brandon, for the physical harm caused by its bat\u2019s increased exit speed, and genuine issues of material fact existed regarding the causation element of Patches\u2019 claim. <em>Riley </em>is not applicable here, as Brandon is deceased. The District Court appropriately applied a flexible standard of proof in denying H&amp;B Rule 50(b) relief. Further, the District Court correctly prohibited H&amp;B from arguing Brandon assumed the risk and properly instructed the jury on the applicable Montana law. A new trial is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b643 We affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b277-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, BAKER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-7\"> Patches initially asserted negligence, products liability, and breach of warranty claims; however, they amended their complaint to include only products liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b269-8\"> Some studies note that the average time needed for a pitcher to react to a batted ball is .4 seconds.

H&amp;B argues that \u00a7 27-1-719, MCA, limits product liability claims to \u201cusers and' consumers\u201d of the product, and does not extend to bystanders. Because, as the Court reasons, \u201call of the players, including Brandon, were users or consumers\u201d in the context of a baseball game, Opinion, \u00b6 17, the statute is facially broad enough to encompass Patches\u2019 claim under strict products liability law.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u00b645 While I concur that Patches have stated a legally valid claim, I remain troubled by the evidentiary basis for the failure to warn claim. Patches did not articulate specifically what a warning should have contained and what message should have been given. Statements to the effect that the bat would hit balls at unusually fast speeds or unusually far distances are the kind of messages accompanying usual product advertising and are precisely the qualities in a bat which baseball teams and players seek out. Neither did Patches articulate specifically how a warning would have changed the result here, in other words, how the failure to warn caused this accident. During oral argument before this Court, when Patches\u2019 counsel was asked to articulate Patches\u2019 theory of causation-or how a warning would have prevented the accident-he was vague, offering only what the jury may have concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>\u00b646 The closing argument Patches made to the jury seemed to reflect the stretch which they asked the jury to make:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">They don\u2019t have warnings on these bats. There\u2019s nothing said on these bats about what these bats can do. And that your child, whether he\u2019s 15,16,17,18,19-if your child is playing and he\u2019s a pitcher, he could be killed, as what happened here July 25, 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">Now I ask you this-I ask you-all this: If you had a child 17 or 18 years old and he wanted to be a pitcher and the bat that the kid was bringing up to the plate warned-warned-that this bat could kill-Mr. [a]nd Mrs. Patch didn\u2019t have the benefit of any warning.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Patches\u2019 apparent theory, as articulated in closing argument, was that H&amp;B should have advertised that its bat \u201ccould kill,\u201d or that players engaged in the game of baseball \u201ccould be killed\u201d if their bat was used. As alluded to in testimony, the inference which Patches asked the jury to draw in order to establish causation was that, following the publishing of a warning \u201cthat this bat could kill,\u201d they as parents would have, and could have, prohibited Brandon from playing baseball that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b647 As the Court notes, \u201cthe \u2018workability\u2019 of providing a warning is a jury question.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 19, 21. There is no doubt that the jury in this case was given a difficult task. Because the law gives to the jury the duty of determining whether the plaintiff presented a viable theory of warning and causation in this case involving a baseball bat, I defer to the jury\u2019s judgment and likewise affirm their verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
