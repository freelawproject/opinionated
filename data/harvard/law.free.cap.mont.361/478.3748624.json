We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">\u00b62 Edwards raises three issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it denied Edwards\u2019 motion in limine to prevent his wife from testifying at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether Edwards was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AyB\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred when it failed to inquire into Edwards\u2019 motion for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">\u00b66 On April 27, 2009, the State filed an information charging Edwards with the deliberate homicide of Daniel Lavigne. Lavigne had been found shot at his residence in 2002. The State subsequently filed an amended information, adding one count of tampering with physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-14\">\u00b67 On November 2, 2009, prior to trial, Edwards filed a motion in limine to prevent his wife, Sherry Edwards, from testifying based on spousal privilege. Specifically, Edwards sought to exclude Sherry\u2019s testimony concerning (1) observations of Edwards\u2019 conduct at the time Lavigne was shot, and (2) statements made by Edwards to Sherry that were accompanied by threats. Edwards, the State and the District Court all agreed to apply the 2001 versions of \u00a7\u00a7 26-1-802, and 46-16-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>212, MCA, regarding spousal privilege, because the alleged homicide had occurred in 2002. On January 13,2010, the District Court denied Edwards\u2019 motion. The District Court concluded, \u201crelevant evidence of Sherry\u2019s [sic] Edwards\u2019 observations of the alleged homicide together with any relevant communication between spouses regarding the alleged homicide delivered or accompanied by a threat is not excludable as evidence at trial on either a competency or spousal privilege basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b68 At trial, the defense examined Sherry twice, once during cross-examination, and once during Edwards\u2019 case-in-chief. Throughout questioning, the defense sought to portray Sherry as unreliable and repeatedly challenged her credibility as a witness. At the outset of cross-examination, defense counsel explained, \u201cI\u2019ll be kind of winging it, because I wasn\u2019t expecting to actually talk to you until tomorrow.\u201d Defense counsel proceeded to elicit that Sherry had lied to investigating officers, had a shifting memory of details and had made numerous prior inconsistent statements. One exchange provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8M\">[Defense]: And I know this is very difficult. You went through a very long, long series of statements whereby you said he had laid out two to three days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-5\">[Sherry]: Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">[Defense]: And you had even sworn upon your dead father? [Sherry]: Yes, ma\u2019am, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">[Defense]: And your father meant everything to you, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AT5\">[Sherry]: Yes, he did. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">[Defense]: So even upon your dead father, you lied?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">[Sherry]: Yes, Ma\u2019am, I did. And I regret that terribly. I was trying to protect my mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">[Defense]: I\u2019m not asking anything if you could just.... <em>And I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m not as fast or quite as prepared as I had anticipated being. I had honestly not anticipated you testifying until tomorrow. And so I was kind of in pre-prep.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">(Emphasis added.) Following that exchange, Sherry conceded there were many inaccuracies in the written statement she provided to law enforcement personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">\u00b69 During Edwards\u2019 case-in-chief, defense counsel continued to attack Sherry\u2019s credibility, focusing on her inconsistent prior versions of the events surrounding Lavigne\u2019s death. Additionally, defense counsel accused Sherry of bias, asserting she changed her story only after Edwards left her and moved in with another woman. Edwards concedes that defense counsel did a \u201cyeoman\u2019s job\u201d in re-examining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Sherry.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">\u00b610 On March 26, 2010, a jury found Edwards guilty of deliberate homicide and tampering with physical evidence. On April 22, 2010, prior to sentencing and still represented by counsel, Edwards filed a pro se motion entitled \u201cMotion for new counsel and a new trial.\u201d He articulated a number of reasons why he felt trial counsel had been ineffective. The District Court forwarded the motion to both the State and defense, requesting that \u201cdefense counsel review the motion and take such action that counsel deems appropriate.\u201d No further action was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">\u00b611 On June 1,2010, Edwards appeared at a sentencing hearing with the same defense counsel who represented him at trial. He received a 100-year term of incarceration in the Montana State Prison with a 50-year restriction on parole eligibility. Edwards filed a timely appeal to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\u00b612 A district court\u2019s ruling on a motion in limine is an evidentiary ruling that this Court reviews for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Meredith, </em>2010 MT 27, \u00b6 42, 355 Mont. 148, 226 P.3d 571. Where that ruling is based on interpretation of a statute, we review the district court\u2019s interpretation de novo and its application for abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Guill, </em>2010 MT 69, \u00b6 25, 355 Mont. 490, 228 P.3d 1152.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">\u00b613 \u201cIneffective assistance of counsel claims raise mixed questions of law and fact that we review de novo.\u201d <em>State v. Savage, </em>2011 MT 23, \u00b6 20, 359 Mont. 207, 248 P.3d 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">\u00b614 \u201cAbsent an abuse of discretion, this Court will not overrule a district court\u2019s ruling on a request for substitution of counsel, which is within the sound discretion of the district court.\u201d <em>State v. Hendershot, </em>2007 MT 49, \u00b6 19, 336 Mont. 164, 153 P.3d 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">\u00b615 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it denied Edwards\u2019 motion in limine to exclude the testimony of his wife.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">\u00b616 As a threshold matter, we conclude that the District Court should have applied the 2009 version of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, instead of the 2001 version. In criminal actions, Montana has two statutorily-enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>spousal privileges, \u00a7\u00a7 26-1-802 and 46-16-212(l)(a), MCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>State v. Roberts, </em>194 Mont. 189, 192, 633 P.2d 1214, 1216 (1981). A rule of testimonial disqualification that gives a party-spouse the power to grant or withhold consent to another spouse\u2019s testimony is a privilege. <em>Trammel v. United States, </em>445 U.S. 40, 44, 100 S. Ct. 906, 909 (1980). As this Court has previously concluded that the spousal privilege contained in \u00a7 46-16-212, MCA, is procedural, <em>State v. Moore, </em>254 Mont. 241, 247, 836 P.2d 604, 608 (1992), we conclude that \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, is procedural as well. As spousal privileges govern whether a spouse may offer testimony against the other spouse, they concern trial and pre-trial procedure. Procedural statutes \u201cin effect at the time that a case proceeds to trial are the rules that are to be applied to the resolution of that dispute.\u201d <em>Wolfe v. Webb, </em>251 Mont. 217, 227, 824 P.2d 240, 246 (1992); <em>Moore, </em>254 Mont, at 247, 836 P.2d at 608. Edwards filed the motion in limine in November 2009. The District Court should have applied the 2009 version of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA. However, we will uphold a district court that reaches the right result for the wrong reason. <em>State v. Parrish, </em>2010 MT 196, \u00b6 11, 357 Mont. 375, 239 P.3d 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">\u00b617  Applying the 2009 spousal privilege to this case, we conclude that the District Court did not err when it permitted Sherry\u2019s testimony about (1) observations of Edwards\u2019 actions, and (2) Edwards\u2019 marital communications regarding Lavigne\u2019s murder that were accompanied by threats. The 2009 version of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">Neither spouse may, without the consent of the other, testify during or after the marriage concerning any communication made by one to the other during their marriage. The privilege is restricted to communications made during the existence of the marriage relationship and does not extend to communications made prior to the marriage or to communications made after the marriage is dissolved. The privilege does not apply to a civil action or proceeding by one spouse against the other or to a criminal action or proceeding for a crime committed by one spouse against the other or against a child of either spouse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Each spouse has the statutory privilege to withhold consent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>preventing the other spouse from testifying to marital communications. <em>State v. Nettleton, </em>233 Mont. 308, 317, 760 P.2d 733, 739 (1988) (where husband withheld consent, \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, prevented ex-wife from testifying that husband had admitted to homicide while they were married).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">\u00b618 Under the 2009 version of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, it was not error to permit Sherry\u2019s testimony about her observations of Edwards\u2019 actions at the time of Lavigne\u2019s murder. Sherry could testify about observations of Edwards\u2019 actions without his consent, because Edwards\u2019 conduct did not constitute communications. The spousal privilege in \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA, extends to, \u201cany <em>communication </em>made by one [spouse] to the other during their marriage.\u201d Section 26-1-802, MCA (emphasis added). The \u201ccommunication for which privilege is sought must be an utterance or other expression intended to convey a message to the other spouse.\u201d <em>Nettleton, </em>233 Mont, at 314, 760 P.2d at 737. A spouse\u2019s conduct alone does not constitute a \u201ccommunication\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA. <em>Nettleton, </em>233 Mont, at 313, 760 P.2d at 737.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b619  Nor did the District Court err when it determined that spousal privilege did not extend to Edwards\u2019 communications that were accompanied by threats towards Sherry. For a communication between spouses to be privileged, it must be (1) an utterance or other expression intended to convey a message between spouses, and (2) intended to be confidential \u201cin that it was conveyed in reliance on the confidence of the marital relationship.\u201d <em>Nettleton, </em>233 Mont, at 317, 760 P.2d at 739. A spouse does not rely on the confidence of the marital relationship when the purpose of the communication is to \u201cterrify and intimidate\u201d the other spouse. <em>Nettleton, </em>233 Mont, at 317, 760 P.2d at 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b620  Edwards\u2019 threats towards Sherry were not made in reliance of their marital relationship. At the motion in limine hearing, Sherry testified that Edwards \u201cpulled a shotgun and put it in my face and told me if I ever went to the cops, or ever told anyone, that he would kill me, kill my family, and burn my grandmother\u2019s house down.\u201d A husband who attempts to secure the silence of his wife by pointing a gun at her, threatening both her life and home of her grandmother, has failed to communicate in reliance on the confidence of the marital relationship. The District Court did not err when it determined that Edwards\u2019 communications accompanied by threats were not privileged under \u00a7 26-1-802, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b621 <em>Whether Edwards was denied effective assistance of counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b512-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>\u00b622 Edwards asserts he was denied effective assistance because defense counsel twice conceded her lack of preparation in front of the jury: (1) \u201cI\u2019ll be kind of winging it, because I wasn\u2019t expecting to actually talk to you until tomorrow,\u201d and (2) \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m not as fast or quite as prepared as I had anticipated being. I had honestly not anticipated you testifying until tomorrow. And so I was kind of in preprep.\u201d This Court evaluates claims of ineffective assistance of counsel (IAC) based on the two-prong test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 688, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984). <em>Savage, </em>\u00b6 22. To succeed on a claim of IAC, a criminal defendant must demonstrate (1) that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance was prejudicial to the defense. <em>State v. Lindsey, </em>2011 MT 46, \u00b6 43, 359 Mont. 362, 249 P.3d 491. Failure of either prong is fatal to an IAC claim. <em>Lindsey, </em>\u00b6 43. Furthermore, a court need not address the two prongs in any specific order. <em>Becker v. State, </em>2010 MT 93, \u00b6 11, 356 Mont. 161, 232 P.3d 376. Where it is easier to dispose of an IAC claim on the prejudice prong, that course should be followed. <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2069.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b623 We need not pass judgment on whether defense counsel\u2019s conduct was deficient, because Edwards\u2019 allegations fail to establish prejudice. To establish prejudice, a defendant must show a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u2019 \u201d <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 697, 104 S. Ct. at 2068). \u201c \u2018A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u2019 \u201d <em>Becker, </em>\u00b6 11 (quoting, <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\u00b624 Edwards argues he was prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s two admissions of lack of preparation for cross-examination. He asserts that these two statements, made in front of the jury, resulted in irreparable damage to his defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b625 Sherry admitted repeated lies to law enforcement, and confirmed prior inconsistent statements. The substance of Sherry\u2019s cross-examination testimony harmed her credibility as a witness. During Edwards\u2019 case-in-chief, defense counsel again attacked Sherry\u2019s credibility, walking her through the history of her prior inconsistent versions of the events surrounding Lavigne\u2019s death. Furthermore, defense counsel raised the specter that Sherry had only changed her story, accusing Edwards of Lavigne\u2019s murder, after he left her for another woman. Even Edwards concedes that this performance constituted a \u201cyeoman\u2019s job.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>\u00b626 Edwards\u2019 cite to <em>Sechrest v. Ignacio, </em>549 F.3d 789 (9th Cir. <em>2008), </em>misses the mark. In <em>Sechrest, </em>defense counsel\u2019s lack of preparation resulted in prejudice, because \u201csome of the most damaging testimony presented during the penalty phase of trial was elicited by Sechrest\u2019s own counsel, from a witness Sechrest\u2019s counsel had originally selected and could have prevented from testifying.\u201d <em>Sechrest, </em>549 F.3d at 816. In contrast, Edwards voices no complaint with the substance of Sherry\u2019s testimony during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">\u00b627 At its core, Edwards\u2019 argument is that the jury was unable to distinguish between two off-hand comments made by defense counsel, and the actual substance of Sherry\u2019s testimony. Aside from failing to establish prejudice, such an argument amounts to little more than \u201ca lack of confidence in the intelligence and common sense of the average juror.\u201d <em>Lindberg v. Leatham Bros., </em>215 Mont. 11, 22, 693 P.2d 1234, 1241 (1985). Edwards has failed to show prejudice amounting to a reasonable probability of a different outcome sufficient to undermine confidence in his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b628 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it failed to inquire into Edwards\u2019 motion for new counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\u00b629 After the District Court received Edwards\u2019 post-trial motion, it conducted no further investigation. However, despite this error, remand is not necessary. Edwards raised no complaint that communications had broken down or that he feared counsel would fail to effectively represent him going forward to sentencing. When a defendant alleges denial of effective assistance of counsel and requests appointment of new counsel, a district court must conduct an adequate initial inquiry in order to determine whether the allegations are seemingly substantial. <em>State v. Happel, </em>2010 MT 200, \u00b6 14, 357 Mont. 390, 240 P.3d 1016; <em>Hendershot, </em>\u00b6 24. Where a district court fails to conduct \u201ceven a cursory inquiry,\u201d the inquiry is inadequate and remand is justified. <em>Happel, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">\u00b630 \u201cA district court\u2019s failure to investigate a defendant\u2019s timely substitution request is error.\u201d <em>Wilson v. State, </em>1999 MT 271, \u00b6 25, 296 Mont. 465, 989 P.2d 813, <em>overruled on other grounds State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, 19 P.3d 817. However, reversal is only necessitated when the defendant\u2019s conflict with counsel was sufficient to require substitution at the time the request was made. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23,25. In other words, the district court must assess whether an actual conflict exists, when the motion is made, that would preclude the proceedings from moving forward without a new attorney representing the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>\u00b631 Following a conviction, a defendant may allege, as was done in this case, that his attorney made mistakes during the course of the trial. Edwards was solely concerned with prior events: (1) defense counsel was unprepared for Sherry\u2019s testimony, (2) the jury was not informed of certain facts concerning Edwards\u2019 ownership of firearms, (3) an independent pathologist should have been retained, (4) the least experienced investigator was employed, (5) a clear timeline was not presented to the jury, and (6) the prosecution was sitting too close to the jury. Post-trial concerns, based solely on the fact that the defendant was convicted by a jury, are not of a sufficient magnitude to require the substitution of counsel at the time the motion was written.</p>\n<p id=\"Ari\">\u00b632 Only where the conflict between defendant and counsel results in a \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d of the attorney client relationship or ineffective assistance of counsel is new counsel merited. <em>Robinson v. </em>State, 2010 MT 108, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 23, 356 Mont. 282, 232 P.3d 403 (no \u201ccomplete collapse\u201d of relationship where communication breakdown was initiated by client and attorney was able to continue to perform reasonably); <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 20. Furthermore, the burden is on the defendant to present material facts that establish the magnitude of the conflict. <em>State v. Dethman, </em>2010 MT 268, \u00b6 16, 358 Mont. 384, 245 P.3d 30. Bare, unsupported assertions do not suffice. <em>State v. Kaske, </em>2002 MT 106, \u00b6 30, 309 Mont. 445, 47 P.3d 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">\u00b633 Edwards did not allege a conflict that resulted in a total lack of communication, nor did he claim that his attorneys were unable or unwilling to represent him at the sentencing hearing. Consequently, while it was error for the District Court not to conduct an inquiry, under the facts of this case, reversal and remand is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b514-6\">JUSTICES WHEAT, COTTER, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b510-7\"> Section 46-16-212(l)(a), MCA, provides a spousal privilege to withhold consent: \u201cNeither spouse may testify to the communications or conversations between spouses that occur during their marriage unless: (a) consent of the defendant-spouse is obtained.\u201d The District Court correctly analyzed \u00a7 46-16-212, MCA, and that ruling has not been challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
