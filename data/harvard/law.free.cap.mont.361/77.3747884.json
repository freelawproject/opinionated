Cleary, Jr. Trust (Claimants). Those claims were contained in the Water Court\u2019s Temporary Preliminary Decree for the Big Hole River Basin issued on April 6, 2007. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b105-3\">\u00b62 Pursuant to Article IX, Section 3(4) of the Montana Constitution, Montana law provides for an orderly process for adjudicating existing water rights. <em>See generally </em>Title 85, Chapter 2, MCA. Persons who claim water rights that existed prior to July 1,1973, were required to file statements of their claims, which are then compiled and examined by the Department of Natural Resources and Conservation under the direction of the Water Court. The Water Court then issues an interlocutory, temporary preliminary, or preliminary decree of water rights based on the claims, on data from the DNRC, on other information obtained by the water judge, and on water compacts where applicable. Public notice of the decree provides opportunity for interested persons to review and object to the decree for good cause. The Water Court holds hearings on the issues raised by the objections and issues a final decree. Rule 1(b), Water Right Adjudication Rules (W. R. Adj. R.); \u00a7\u00a7 85-2-224 through -235, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b63 On April 6,2007, the Water Court issued a temporary preliminary decree in Basin 41D, the Big Hole River. Pursuant to notice of the decree, MTU filed timely objections to several of the claims of each of the Claimants and requested a hearing. The Claimants moved to dismiss the MTU objections, arguing that MTU lacked standing to object. The Water Court converted the motions to dismiss to motions for summary judgment. MTU and Claimants waived their right to a hearing on summary judgment and stipulated that the Water Court could accept as true the assertions of fact made in their briefs and in the attachments to MTU\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b64 The Water Court determined that the motions involved only issues of law and ultimately granted summary judgment to the Claimants, holding that MTU lacked standing to file objections to the water right claims. In doing so the Water Court expressly incorporated its prior decision on similar standing issues issued in response to motions to dismiss objections filed by the Western Watersheds Project (Water Court Case No. 41D-2).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b65 MTU is a membership conservation organization of anglers dedicated to the conservation, protection and restoration of coldwater fish, including wild and native trout in Montana. MTU has been actively involved in cooperative restoration efforts for arctic grayling and wild trout in the Big Hole River Basin and actively participates in the Big Hole Watershed Committee. MTU has contributed funding to support the implementation of a voluntary drought plan on the Big Hole which seeks to maintain minimum water flows without unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>restricting the interests of diversionary water users. MTU\u2019s efforts on the Big Hole have been directed at improving habitat for the grayling and wild trout, focusing on mitigating the impacts of low stream flows through water conservation and habitat and flow restoration. MTU asserts that unsupported large water right claims could unravel its years of fish restoration and protection on the river and negatively impact the instream water reservations on the Big Hole River held by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b66 The Water Court acknowledged MTU\u2019s \u201chistorical contributions\u201d in Montana\u2019s water adjudication efforts, noting its participation in litigation, the Water Right Adjudication Advisory Committee, legislative hearings, and the Water Court\u2019s rule-making proceedings. The Water Court concluded that MTU \u201ccontributed much to the outcomes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b67 The Water Court decided the motions to dismiss MTU\u2019s objections by first applying \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-6\">(l)(a) For good cause shown ... a hearing must be held before the water judge on any objection to a temporary preliminary or preliminary decree by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">(i) the department [of Natural Resources and Conservation];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-8\">(ii) a person named in the temporary preliminary decree or preliminary decree;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-9\">(iii) any person within the basin entitled to receive notice under 85-2-232(1); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-10\">(iv) any other person who claims rights to the use of water from sources in other basins that are hydrologically connected to the sources within the decreed basin and who would be entitled to receive notice under 85-2-232 if the claim or claims were from sources within the decreed basin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-11\">(b) For the purposes of this subsection (1), \u201cgood cause shown\u201d means a written statement showing that a person has an ownership interest in water or its use that has been affected by the decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">The Water Court held that while MTU was a person entitled to receive notice of the decree, it must also demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d by showing \u201can ownership interest in water or its use that has been affected by the decree\u201d when filing objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-13\">\u00b68 MTU filed a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d to meet the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement. It recited MTU\u2019s participation in the Big Hole River fish and water flow protection and restoration efforts, its interest in promoting and protecting those efforts by insuring that water right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>claims are thoroughly examined and well supported, its interest in fulfilling the instream water reservations of the Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks, and its goal of insuring that its members could continue to fish the river. The Water Court acknowledged that it is \u201cbeyond dispute that <em>all </em>citizens of Montana have public environmental and recreational interests in the natural waters of Montana.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"AxG\">\u00b69 The Water Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-4\">For purposes of the Claimants\u2019 motions for summary judgment, the Court will assume that TU\u2019s statement of interest and the affidavits of its members sufficiently allege <em>personal </em>environmental and recreational interests of the members in the Big Hole River basin, distinct from the public at large, that arguably could be adversely affected by the temporary preliminary decree in the Big Hole River basin.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">Under the broad standing requirements of the Montana Administrative Procedures Act and even broader standing requirements of most federal and Montana environmental protection statutes, such interests may be sufficient for persons to establish either constitutional or statutory standing to challenge the <em>constitutionality </em>of governmental acts or agency decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">However, personal environmental and recreational interests in the water, alone, are not sufficient to establish the \u201cpersonal stake\u201d required for standing to be heard on objections to claims in the present adjudication of existing water rights, unless those interests are <em>coupled with </em>an <em>\u201cownership interest in water or its use </em>.... \u201d [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Water Court determined that the amendments to \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, \u201cover time\u201d demonstrate legislative intent to narrow the scope of objections entitled to be heard to those that are coupled with an ownership interest in water or its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">\u00b610 The Water Court observed that there was no evidence that MTU or any of its members had filed any water right claims in the adjudication process or that they had applied for post-July 1, 1973 certificates or permits to use water. Further, the court determined that under Montana law, only the DNRC and the DFWP are authorized to \u201crepresent the public in the adjudication process.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 85-1-101, - 204, and -223, MCA, and <em>In the Matter of the Missouri River Drainage Area, </em>2002 MT 216, \u00b6 1, 311 Mont. 327, 55 P.3d 396 <em>(Bean Lake III). </em>The Water Court concluded that MTU\u2019s interests in the Big Hole River <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>are related to citizen interests \u201cclaimed and reserved by the DNRC and DFWP\u201d and further that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">Legislature and the Supreme Court have resolved the public policy and legal debate on who represents the public in the adjudication process. As a result, TU does not have standing to champion the public interests either through the filing of claims or through the filing of objections to claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">MTU, therefore, was precluded from filing water claims for public recreational or wildlife purposes, from filing objections to claims or from requesting hearings on objections to claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b611 Last, the Water Court considered MTU\u2019s contention that, in the alternative, it had a \u201clegitimate role to play\u201d in the Big Hole adjudication to insure that DNRC issue remarks were properly resolved. Issue remarks are statements by the DNRC added to its abstracts of water right to \u201cidentify potential factual or legal issues\u201d associated with the claims. Section 85-2-250, MCA. Because the State of Montana owns all water in the state under Article IX, Sec. 3 of the Constitution, the Legislature has established the policy to ensure that valid issues raised during claims examinations are resolved before final decrees are issued. Section 85-2-247, MCA. All DNRC issue remarks that are not resolved through the objection process must be resolved by the Water Court. Section 85-2-247, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b612 The Water Court again recognized the role that MTU has played in the water adjudication process generally and in the habitat restoration and water administration efforts on the Big Hole River in particular. However, the Water Court concluded since MTU\u2019s interests \u201care not coupled with an enforceable ownership interest in the water or its use\u201d acquired under Montana law, its role lies not in filing objections but in \u201cthe myriad other opportunities and programs established by state law that invite and encourage the kind of interests, dedication, and expertise evidenced by TU in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b613 MTU raises issues on appeal that we restate as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">\u00b614 Issue 1. Whether the Water Court erred in holding that only the DFWP may represent public recreational and conservation interests in water adjudication proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">\u00b615 Issue 2. Whether the Water Court erred in holding that only water right claimants may request a hearing on their objections in water adjudication proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\">\u00b616 The Water Court decided this case on summary judgment after determining that there were no material facts in dispute and only issues of law. This Court applies the same standards of review to the Water Court as it does to an appeal from a district court. <em>Department of State Lands v. Pettibone, </em>216 Mont. 361, 368, 702 P.2d 948, 952 (1985). This Court reviews a lower court\u2019s conclusions of law concerning the construction of a statute de novo, to determine whether they are correct. <em>Hulstine v. Lennox Ind. Inc., </em>2010 MT 180, \u00b6 16, 357 Mont. 228, 237 P.3d 1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b617 Issue 1. Whether the Water Court erred in holding that only the DFWP may represent the public recreational and conservation interests in water adjudication proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b618 The Water Court noted that at least one of the goals of MTU\u2019s objections to the Claimants\u2019 statements of claim was to insure that water would be available in the Big Hole River for fish habitat, and to fulfill the in-stream water reservation claim by the DFWP. In light of this purpose, the Water Court relied upon \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA, which provides in part that the DFWP \u201cshall exclusively represent the public for purposes of establishing any prior and existing public recreational use in existing [water] right determinations.\u201d The Water Court relied upon this statute, coupled with the statement in <em>Bean Lake III </em>that \u201c[o]nly DFWP can represent citizen interests in the adjudication process\u201d <em>{Bean Lake III, </em>\u00b6 1), to conclude that \u201cTU does not have standing to champion the public interests either through the filing of claims or through the filing of objections to claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b619 This is an erroneously broad application of \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA. On its face the statute assigns an exclusive role to DFWP only in the context of <em>\u201cestablishing </em>any prior and existing public recreational use in existing [water] right determinations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here MTU is not seeking to establish any public recreational right to the use of water in the Big Hole River. To the contrary, the Water Court made it clear that MTU has not made any water right claims in the Big Hole River adjudication process. Section 85-2-223, MCA, does not prohibit an entity other than DFWP from filing an objection with the goal of generally enhancing the amount of water available for fish habitat or recreational use, or for fulfilling in-stream water reservations already claimed by DFWP.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u00b620 Further, the statement in <em>Bean Lake III, </em>in the context of that case, does not support an expansive reading of \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA, that is broader than the statute\u2019s plain words. <em>Bean Lake III </em>involved the validity of claims by DFWP in the water adjudication process to the waters of Bean Lake for public fish, wildlife and recreational uses. In that context, and as provided in \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA, only DFWP can represent the public interest in propounding such claims. The language in <em>Bean Lake III, </em>\u00b6 1, should not be given any broader meaning.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b621 In addition, the Water Court held that \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA, precluded MTU from even filing objections in the water adjudication process. There is no limitation in the water right adjudication statutes, in the water right adjudication rules, or in case law that expressly limits who can file an objection to a temporary preliminary decree. Section 85-2-232, MCA, requires the Water Court to provide wide public notice when it issues a temporary preliminary decree. Objections to claims contained in the decree must be filed within 180 days after entry of the decree, or within such additional time as the Water Court grants. Section 85-2-233(2), MCA. Objections must specify the findings and conclusions to which an objection is made, and must state the grounds and evidence relied upon. Section 85-2-233(4), MCA. At the close of the period for filing objections, the Water Court must notify each water right claimant whose claim received an objection and allow that claimant to file a counter-objection. Section 85-2-233(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">\u00b622 When the time for filing objections and counter-objections has expired, the Water Court \u201cshall fix a day when all parties who wish to participate in future proceedings are required to appear or file a statement. The water judge shall then set a date for a hearing.\u201d Section 85-2-233(5), MCA. Similarly the Water Right Adjudication Rules state that objections must comply with \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, and must also designate the findings and conclusions with which the objector disagrees, the elements of the claim that the objector believes should be modified, and the grounds and evidence upon which the objection is based. Rule 5(a), W. R. Adj. R. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 85-2-308(3), MCA, describing persons who have \u201cstanding to file an objection\u201d to an application for a post-July 1, 1973 water use permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">\u00b623  In summary, there is no statutory or regulatory restriction on who is entitled to file an objection to a claim of water right contained in a temporary preliminary decree, and the Water Court\u2019s holding to the contrary was in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>\u00b624 Issue 2. Whether the Water Court erred in holding that only water right claimants may request a hearing on their objections in water adjudication proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-3\">\u00b625 The Water Court held that under \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, only persons who previously claimed existing water rights were entitled to request hearings on objections in the water adjudication proceedings. Since MTU did not claim any existing water right, the Water Court precluded it from obtaining a hearing on its objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b626 Section 85-2-233, MCA, provides that \u201c[f]or good cause shown\u201d the Water Court must hold a hearing on objections to water right claims. Good cause shown is defined to mean \u201ca written statement that a person has an ownership interest in water or its use that has been affected by the decree.\u201d Section 85-2-233(l)(b), MCA. The Water Court construed the good cause requirement to mean ownership of a water right claim in the adjudication, and thereby disqualified MTU as a person entitled to a hearing. In the context of the water adjudication proceedings, this is an erroneous construction of the good cause requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b627  While the Water Court dismissed MTU\u2019s objections under \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, its discussion of the issue began with an acknowledgement of the established rules of standing applied by Montana courts. The question of standing is whether a litigant is entitled to have the court determine the merits of a particular dispute. <em>Gryczan v. State, </em>283 Mont. 433, 442, 942 P.2d 112, 118 (1997). Standing resolves the issue of whether the litigant is a proper party to seek adjudication of a particular issue, not whether the issue is justiciable. <em>Helena Parents Comm. v. Lewis and Clark County, </em>277 Mont. 367, 371, 922 P.2d 1140, 1142 (1996). The test of standing is that the complaining party must clearly allege past, present or threatened injury to a property or civil right, and the alleged injury must be distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, but it need not be exclusive to the complaining party. <em>Stewart v. Board of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>175 Mont. 197, 201, 573 P.2d 184, 186 (1977); <em>Aspen Trails Ranch v. Simmons, </em>2010 MT 79, \u00b6 37, 356 Mont. 41, 230 P.3d 808. This Court has upheld the standing of citizen organizations to challenge governmental actions. <em>MEIC v. DEQ, </em>1999 MT 248, 296 Mont. 207, 988 P.2d 1236; <em>In the Matter of the Dearborn Drainage, </em>234 Mont. 331, 766 P.2d 228 (1988) <em>(Bean Lake I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">\u00b628 The Water Court applied the common law rules of standing and concluded that MTU had sufficiently alleged environmental and recreational interests of its members in the Big Hole River basin that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>were distinct from those of the public at large, and that could be adversely affected by the temporary preliminary decree. The Water Court held that this was sufficient only to allow MTU to challenge the constitutionality of governmental acts or agency decisions. It was not, however, sufficient to demonstrate a \u201cpersonal stake\u201d in the water adjudication process because MTU lacked ownership of a water right claim. We have found no support for this rule applied by the Water Court that a person or entity with standing under the common law rules noted above only has standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute or governmental action. The cases cited by the Water Court in support of this proposition contain no such holding. <em>See Clark Fort Coalition v. DEQ, </em>2008 MT 407, 347 Mont. 197, 197 P.3d 482; <em>Bitterroot River Protective Association v. Bitterroot Conservation District, </em>2008 MT 377, 346 Mont. 507, 198 P.3d 219; <em>Mont. Envir. Info. Center v. DEQ, </em>1999 MT 248, 296 Mont. 207, 988 P.2d 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">\u00b629 All waters in Montana are the property of the State of Montana for the use of its people. Montana Constitution, Art. IX, Sec. 3. Under the Montana Constitution and the public trust doctrine, the public owns an instream, non-diversionary right to the recreational use of the State\u2019s navigable surface waters. <em>Bean Lake III, </em>\u00b6 30. The State of Montana became trustee of the public trust over the navigable streambeds and the waters of this State upon achieving statehood, and the Constitution and public trust \u201cdo not permit a private party to interfere with the public\u2019s right to recreational use of the surface of the State\u2019s waters.\u201d <em>Montana Coalition for Stream Access v. Curran, </em>210 Mont. 38, 52, 682 P.2d 163, 170 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">\u00b630 The State holds title to the surface waters of Montana for the benefit of its citizens, including the Claimants and the members of MTU. This is reflected in Montana law. Montana Constitution, Art. IX, Sec. 3 (all waters within the state are the property of the state for the use of its people); \u00a7 75-5-303, MCA (existing water uses and the level of water quality necessary to protect those uses must be maintained and protected, including existing and anticipated uses); \u00a7 75-5-101, MCA (it is the public policy of the state to conserve water by protecting, maintaining and improving water quality for public water supplies, wildlife, fish, aquatic life, agriculture, industry, recreation and other beneficial uses); \u00a7 85-1-101, MCA (water resources must be protected and conserved to assure adequate supply for recreation and for the conservation of wildlife and aquatic life); \u00a7 85-2-101, MCA (any use of water is a public use and the water within the state is the property of the state for the use of its people); \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA (DFWP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>must represent the public for purposes of establishing prior and existing public recreational right to use water); \u00a7 87-5-501, MCA (it is the policy of the state that its fishing waters are to be protected and preserved to the end that they will be available for all time); \u00a7 23-2-302, MCA (all surface waters capable of recreational use may be used by the public without regard of the ownership of the land underlying the waters).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-3\">\u00b631 This Court will harmonize statutes relating to the same subject in order to give effect to each. <em>State v. Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448. We also must view the statute within the context of the meaning and purpose of water rights adjudication in Montana. Section 85-2-101(1), MCA, establishes that \u201cany use [of water] is a public use,\u201d supporting the \u201clong-standing underlying policy ... that water is a public resource that cannot be owned by the individual users.\u201d <em>See </em>Albert W. Stone, <em>Montana Water Law, </em>70 (State Bar of Montana 1994). <em>See also Paradise Rainbow v. Fish and Game Commission, </em>148 Mont. 412, 421 P.2d 717 (1966). \u201cOwnership\u201d is not defined within Title 85, but, as Stone explains, a water right \u201cis \u2018usuiructory,\u2019 i.e., it is a right to make a use of waters owned by the state-a water right confers no ownership in those waters.\u201d Stone continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-4\">Terminology can affect how people think about the subject. The words \u201cproperty right\u201d draw to themselves and connote a bundle of old, sacred, absolute, and inviolate ideas of exclusivity, possession and permanence. Although these concepts are not alien to water law, they are not the language of water law ... because water law does not deal with these things, but with uses, re-uses, sharing, and priorities rather than exclusivity, possession or even permanence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">Stone at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u00b632 Since inception of the water rights adjudication process, the Legislature has acknowledged these concepts in the doctrine of exchange and efficient use requirements. Stone at 61, 71; <em>see also </em>\u00a7\u00a7 85-2-114 and -413, MCA. Claimants contend that a claim for a water right is the only method of establishing an \u201cownership interest\u201d in the use of water. However, Claimants\u2019 contention is inconsistent with the construction of a water right as a usuiructory right, which does not confer any actual physical ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u00b633  A fundamental aspect of the present case is that the Water Court found that MTU, or more properly its members, had demonstrated personal environmental and recreational interests in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>Big Hole River basin; that these interests were distinct from those of the public at large; and that these interests could be adversely affected by the temporary preliminary decree. This finding has not been challenged on appeal and, but for the Water Court\u2019s application of the \u201cgood cause\u201d definition in \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, MTU clearly has standing to litigate its objections in the Big Hole River basin water right adjudication. <em>MEIC v. DEQ, </em>\u00b6 45. Thus, MTU has met the common law standing requirements by demonstrating a particularized interest in the adjudication of the Big Hole watershed; MTU complied with the statutory requirement of requesting notice of the preliminary decree; and MTU objected to specific claims in the basin because DNRC placed issue remarks on those claims indicating over-statement of historic irrigation uses. We will not interpret \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, to deny a party\u2019s ability to be heard where that party has met all common law and statutory requirements for standing to object to a preliminary decree and has shown that its interest in the use of water \u201chas been affected by the decree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b634  We conclude, based upon the State\u2019s ownership of the waters of Montana which it holds in public trust for the benefit of its people, and the undisputed specific interests of the members of MTU in the Big Hole River basin that MTU-under the facts of this case-has a sufficient ownership interest in water or its use to demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d to require the Water Court to hold a hearing or hearings on its objections under \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b635 Our interpretation of \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, does not render the word \u201cownership\u201d meaningless or expand the right to be heard on an objection to a preliminary decree to every person in the State of Montana. Rather, it is consistent with the statute as a whole and with the intent of the Legislature in developing a comprehensive water rights adjudication process.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u00b636 The water right adjudication statutes begin with the broad requirement that all persons claiming water rights that arose before July 1, 1973, file notices of their claims. Section 85-2-212, MCA. The statutes direct the Water Court to consider \u201call relevant evidence in the determination and interpretation of existing water rights\u201d and \u201cany additional data\u201d when compiling a temporary preliminary decree. Sections 85-2-227(2) and -231(2), MCA. The water judge must provide broad notice of a temporary preliminary decree. Section 85-2-232(1), MCA. As previously discussed, there are no stated limits on who can file objections to claims in temporary preliminary decrees, and hearings on those objections must be held upon a showing of good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>cause. Section 85-2-233, MCA. There are broad rights to appeal from decrees of the Water Court. Section 85-2-235, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-3\">\u00b637 The Water Right Adjudication Rules reflect the broad reach of the statutes. Rule 1(b), W. R. Adj. R., describes the adjudication process, including notices of decrees; the \u201copportunity for interested persons to review and object... for good cause;\u201d hearings by the Water Court on \u201cissues raised in these proceedings;\u201d and \u201cthe opportunity for interested parties to review and appeal the final decree.... \u201d Rule 5, W. R. Adj. R., specifies the content of objections and the time within which they must be filed, but does not otherwise restrict the persons who can file objections. Rule 9, W. R. Adj. R., requires the Water Court, after compilation of all objections to claims, to set the date when \u201cpersons other than the claimants, objectors, or counter-objectors to a particular claim shall file a notice of intent to appear ....\u201d Rule 9(b), W. R. Adj. R., further describes these notices of intent to appear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-4\">Any person other than the claimant or objector who intends to appear and participate in further proceedings for any claims or issues included on the objection list must file a notice of intent to appear in compliance with \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA.... The person filing a notice of intent to appear shall specify the claim number and include a statement of the appearing person\u2019s legal rights that might be affected by the resolution of the objections or issues involving the specified claim, and the purposes for which further participation is sought. Persons who file notices of intent to appear as provided in this rule shall receive notice of all future proceedings involving the claims specified in their notice and are entitled to participate in the resolution of the issues associated with those claims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">It is incongruous, at least, to exclude MTU from substantively participating in the adjudication of the Big Hole River, but to allow any other person to file a notice of intent to appear and to participate without meeting the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement of \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AeP\">\u00b638 Prior decisions of the Water Court also reflect a broad approach to participation in the adjudication process. In its 2002 opinion approving the Chippewa Cree Tribe Water Compact, 2002 ML 4232, Case No. WC 2000-01, the Water Court adopted an express \u201cbroad tent\u201d policy with respect to considering objections to water compacts. As long as the objections are not arbitrary, irrational, unreasonable, or irrelevant then only a \u201cminimal claim or interest in land or water that could feasibly be adversely affected\u201d is sufficient to constitute \u201cgood cause.\u201d The Water Court allowed objectors to the compact to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>participate even though the remoteness of the potential harm stretched even the broad tent policy. The Water Court allowed participation by these objectors, however, because the objections should be considered \u201cin the interest of resolving all potential disputes that could arise.\u201d While the Water Court in the present case distinguished the Chippewa Cree Water Compact case on the ground that each of the objectors there had some interest in land or water within one of the affected basins, the decision to allow broad participation was not based on that ground, but upon the desirability of allowing even remotely affected and interested persons the opportunity to participate. It is again incongruous to stretch an already broad tent to allow participation by objectors in that case and to deny it to MTU, with its demonstrated interest, in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">\u00b639 In the <em>Bean Lake </em>cases, which involved the issue of whether DFWP held a valid pre-1973 public recreational appropriation right for fish and wildlife, the Water Court recognized the importance of the issue, gave wide notice, and invited participation by interested persons who were \u201callowed the equivalent of objections.\u201d <em>Bean Lake I, </em>234 Mont, at 334, 766 P.2d at 230. Over 50 individuals and organizations accepted the Water Court\u2019s invitation and objected to DFWP\u2019s claimed public recreational use right. When the DFWP contested the standing of the Montana Stockgrowers Association to object because there were only two actual appropriators from the water source and neither was represented by the Association, the Water Court held that the Association had standing to proceed as a party on behalf of its members because they \u201ccould be affected\u201d by the outcome of the case. <em>Bean Lake I, </em>234 Mont at 336, 766 P.2d at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\u00b640 The Water Court in a subsequent proceeding held that because of the significance of the issue of recreational water rights, the DFWP should be required to \u201cbear all the costs\u201d of the Stockgrowers Association\u2019s participation in the case. Shifting the burden of attorney fees was, in the view of the Water Court, necessary to \u201censure full presentation of all public interests\u201d and, without such funding, \u201ccertain viewpoints may not be presented and as a result the overall integrity and effectiveness of the adjudication process may be diminished.\u201d <em>Bean Lake II, </em>240 Mont, at 41-42, 782 P.2d at 899 (wherein this Court reversed the award of attorney fees on the ground that the recreational use claim by DFWP, even though unsuccessful at that time, had been made in good faith and in accord with constitutional and statutory mandates). The Water Court\u2019s view of <em>Bean Lake </em>and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Stockgrowers, again, stands in contrast to the dismissal of MTU\u2019s participation in the Big Hole River adjudication in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"AlQ\">\u00b641 Decisions from this Court are similarly reflective of the importance of broad rather than narrow rights of participation in water adjudications. In In <em>the Matter of Adjudication of Rights in the Yellowstone River, 253 </em>Mont. 167, 832 P.2d 1210 (1992), which dealt primarily with the issue of abandoned water rights, the Court stated that \u201ccomprehensive participation, extinguishing duplicative and exaggerated rights, and ridding local records of stale, unused water claims\u201d are \u201call necessary to meet the objective of adjudicating Montana\u2019s water <em>.\u2019\u2019Adjudication of Rights in the Yellowstone River, </em>253 Mont, at 179-80, 832 P.2d at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-3\">\u00b642 The Montana Water Use Act anticipates that there will be disagreements over the use of water among varying interests and \u201cthe integrity of Montana\u2019s adjudication process depends upon the assertion and ultimate resolution of these varying interests. The provisions of the Act charge all water users with the duty of asserting and defending their interests.\u201d <em>Bean Lake II, </em>240 Mont, at 42, 782 P.2d at 900. This Court has recognized the importance of an adjudication process to firmly establish existing water rights and the necessity of \u201ccomprehensive participation, extinguishing duplicative and exaggerated rights, and ridding local records of stale, unused water claims.\u201d <em>Adjudication of Rights in the Yellowstone River, </em>253 Mont, at 179-80, 832 P.2d at 1217.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">\u00b643 The Water Court expressed concern in its opinions on this issue about the consequences of allowing MTU to litigate its objections to the Claimants\u2019 claims. The Court expressed concern in the Western Watersheds opinion over using the public trust doctrine as a \u201ctrump card to rearrange the ladder of appropriation priorities in any water source ....\u201d This is not an issue in the MTU case. Neither MTU nor any other participant has advocated using the public trust doctrine to rearrange appropriation priorities. The Water Court also expressed concern that if any person making recreational use of water has a property interest in the water rights adjudication, then they have not been receiving notice and the effort to adjudicate Montana\u2019s water rights \u201cwould be for naught.\u201d It appears from the record that the Water Court has been scrupulously following the public notice requirements of the water adjudication statutes, including providing notice to all persons who request notice of decrees. Section 85-2-232, MCA. In addition, the present case is the first one noted in which the Water Court has narrowed, rather than expanded, the scope of participation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number><em>See e.g. Bean Lake I. </em>There is no showing that allowing MTU to be heard on its objections would jeopardize 31 years of water adjudications.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">\u00b644 Last, the Water Court expressed concern that allowing MTU to be heard would \u201copen the process to a multitude of objections\u201d that would overwhelm the process. First, this is contrary to past cases such as <em>Bean Lake I </em>in which the Water Court <em>invited </em>all interested persons to participate as objectors. At that time participation by public interest groups like the Montana Stockgrowers Association was expressly viewed as a benefit to the adjudication process. Second, the Water Court, as a court, has sufficient procedural tools and powers to ensure that its proceedings do not get bogged down with the presentation of repetitive or immaterial evidence, or dilatory tactics. This includes, for example, the power to consider \u201crelevant evidence\u201d (\u00a7 85-2-227, MCA); the power to appoint water masters (\u00a7\u00a7 3-7-301 and -311, MCA); and the power to require mediated settlement conferences (\u00a7 85-2-233(5)(b), MCA). Montana courts often confront similar issues in multi-party cases and we are confident that the Water Court can do the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">\u00b645 The decision of the Water Court is reversed and this matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b118-6\">JUSTICES BAKER, WHEAT, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b118-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahc\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Axd\">\u00b646 I concur in the narrow result of the Court\u2019s decision, holding that MTU has standing in the Water Court vis-a-vis the Big Hole River basin water rights adjudication. Respectfully, however, I dissent from two facets of the Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">\u00b647 First, while I agree that justiciability requirements (standing, in particular) apply to the Water Court, I do not agree that this is a matter of \u201ccommon law.\u201d Second, while I agree that MTU has standing under the governing statutes, I do not agree with the breadth of standing the Court has construed those statutes to accord. I address these two points in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Justiciability</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">\u00b648 The Supreme Court has held that courts created under Article III of the United States Constitution are limited in their exercise of judicial power to the adjudication of \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d <em>Flast v. Cohen, </em>392 U.S. 83, 94-95, 88 S. Ct. 1942, 1949-50 (1968). This Court has held that courts created under Article VII of the Montana Constitution are subject to the same limitation. <em>Greater Missoula Area Fedn. of Early Childhood Educators v. Child Start, Inc., </em>2009 MT 362, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>\u00b6 22, 353 Mont. 201, 219 P.3d 881; <em>Olson v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>223 Mont. 464, 469-70, 726 P.2d 1162, 1166 (1986). The so-called \u201ccommon law rules of standing\u201d to which the Court refers in today\u2019s Opinion are, in reality, criteria designed to enforce this case-or-controversy limitation. <em>Heffeman v. Missoula City Council, </em>2011 MT 91, \u00b6\u00b6 29-33, 360 Mont. 207, 255 P.3d 80; <em>Summers v. Earth Island Inst., </em>555 U.S. 488, 129 S. Ct. 1142, 1148-49 (2009). Ripeness, mootness, advisory opinion, and political question are other such justiciability doctrines which serve to assure that the court has before it a proper \u201ccase\u201d or \u201ccontroversy.\u201d <em>Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Flast, </em>392 U.S. at 95, 88 S. Ct. at 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-3\">\u00b649 Why the Water Court is a court to which the justiciability doctrines apply is a threshold question left unaddressed by the Court\u2019s Opinion. Simply being denominated a \u201ccourt\u201d does not automatically bind a tribunal to the case-or-controversy restrictions. An example of this can be seen in the District of Columbia Superior Court and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (which are distinct from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit). Congress created these two \u201cArticle I courts\u201d pursuant to Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United States Constitution. Although they exercise federal judicial power with respect to local laws, the District of Columbia courts are not bound by the strictures of Article III. <em>Palmore v. United States, </em>411 U.S. 389, 93 S. Ct. 1670 (1973); <em>McIntosh v. Washington, </em>395 A.2d 744, 749 n. 10 (D.C. 1978). That includes the case-or-controversy limitation. <em>Lee v. Dist. of Columbia Bd. of Appeals and Review, </em>423 A.2d 210, 216 n. 13 (D.C. 1980). Thus, while these courts have applied justiciability requirements for policy reasons, <em>Atchison v. Dist. of Columbia, </em>585 A.2d 150, 153 (D.C. 1991), they have understood that those requirements may be legislatively overridden, <em>Grayson v. AT&amp;T Corp., </em>15 A.3d 219 (D.C. 2011) (addressing whether amendments to the D.C. Code eliminated the court\u2019s self-imposed standing requirement).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>\u00b650 The fact that the Water Court performs an adjudicatory function is also not dispositive. In Montana, there are various agencies that exercise a \u201cquasi-judicial\u201d function, which means \u201can adjudicatory function... involving the exercise of judgment and discretion in making determinations in controversies.\u201d Section 2-15-102(10), MCA; <em>see e.g. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2-15-1704(5) (Board of Labor Appeals), -1706(3) (Human Rights Commission), -1819(5)(a) (Board of Research and Commercialization Technology), -2029(l)(a) (Public Safety Officer Standards and Training Council), -2502(8) (Transportation Commission), -3105(4) (Board of Milk Control), -3303(4) (Board of Oil and Gas Conservation), -3402(5) (Fish, Wildlife, and Parks Commission), MCA. These bodies hold hearings; evaluate and pass on facts; interpret, apply, and enforce existing rules and laws; grant or deny privileges, rights, or benefits; award compensation; and order action or abatement of action. Section 2-15-102(10), MCA. Yet, while these proceedings are \u201cjudicial\u201d and \u201cadjudicatory\u201d in nature, I am aware of no case in which we have required the parties participating in the proceedings to satisfy the criteria of constitutional standing, ripeness, mootness, and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"A_F\">\u00b651 The error in the Court\u2019s Opinion, therefore, is the suggestion that our justiciability doctrines are based in common law. This poses the danger of importing these doctrines wholesale into contexts for which they were not intended, or the risk of misapplying the doctrines due to a lack of understanding of their function and purpose. Standing requirements, such as the showing of an injury to a property or civil right (Opinion, \u00b6 27), were adopted to enforce the case-or-controversy limitation on a particular class of courts. Hence, the applicability of those requirements depends, obviously, on whether the given tribunal is limited, by the constitutional or statutory provision establishing it, to entertaining only \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b120-4\">\u00b652 Unlike Article III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution, there is no provision in the Montana Constitution limiting the judicial power of the state to specific classes of \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d The only express case-or-controversy limitation is in the grant of jurisdiction to the district courts under Article VII, Section 4. <em>See Olson, </em>223 Mont, at 469-70,726 P.2d at 1166 (observing that the language \u201call civil matters and cases at law and in equity\u201d in Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>VII, Section 4(1) \u201chas been interpreted as embodying the same limitations as are imposed by federal courts under the Article 3 \u2018case or controversy\u2019 provision of the United States Constitution\u201d). This Court is not expressly limited to hearing only \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2(1). Nor are the justice courts, which have \u201csuch original jurisdiction as may be provided by law\u201d (except trial jurisdiction in felony cases). Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 5(2). The Constitution allows for the creation of \u201cother courts as may be provided by law.\u201d Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 1. But these courts are also not expressly limited to hearing only \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d Accordingly, if such a limitation applies to all Montana courts-and we have suggested this on several occasions, <em>see Greater Missoula, </em>\u00b6 22, and cases cited therein-then it must be implicit in the term \u201cjudicial power\u201d as that term is used in Article VII, Section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-3\">\u00b653 I need not delve into that issue here, however, as it is apparent from the statutes establishing the water divisions and the water judges that the Water Court was set up as a specialized version of the district courts. There are four water divisions established to adjudicate water rights. Sections 3-7-101, -102, MCA. The boundaries of the four water divisions are formed by the natural divides between drainages within the state. Section 3-7-102, MCA. Each water division is presided over by a water judge. Section 3-7-101, MCA. Each water judge must be a district court judge or a retired district court judge of a judicial district wholly or partly within the water division. Section 3-7-201(1), MCA. \u201cA water judge, when presiding over a water division, presides as district court judge in and for each judicial district wholly or partly within the water division.\u201d Section 3-7-201(3), MCA. The activities of the water judges are supervised by this Court. Section 3-7-204(1), MCA; <em>cf. </em>Mont. Const, art. VII, \u00a7 2(2) (\u201c[The supreme court] has general supervisory control over all other courts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">\u00b654 If the Water Court is effectively a specialized district court assigned to make water right determinations within its jurisdiction-and, in light of the foregoing statutes, I conclude that it is-then it follows that the Water Court is limited, like district courts, to adjudicating only cases and controversies. As such, MTU must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>satisfy constitutional standing requirements (a past, present, or threatened injury to a property or civil right that would be alleviated by successfully maintaining the action) and prudential standing requirements (an injury that is distinguishable from the injury to the public generally, though not necessarily exclusive to the plaintiff).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Heffernan, </em>\u00b6 33. In this regard, I note that MTU alleges that Claimants\u2019 water right claims, as set forth in the decree, will injure not only MTU itself, but also its members. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 33. In other words, MTU asserts the rights of its members. <em>See Heffernan, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-46 (discussing the doctrine of associational standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\u00b655 For the sake of brevity, I will not engage in an analysis of how MTU has satisfied the foregoing standing criteria. I agree with the result of the Court\u2019s decision on this point, as well as much of the Court\u2019s rationale. The purpose of this discussion is not to address whether MTU has met constitutional and prudential standing requirements. It is to explain, rather, why MTU must meet those requirements in the first place. As discussed, the reason is not due to generally applicable \u201ccommon law rules\u201d as the Court suggests, but because the Water Court is subject to the same case-or-controversy limitations as the district courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">\u00b656 Besides the case-or-controversy requirements, there are statutory restrictions on who may appear before the Water Court. MTU contends that to the extent the statutory standing rules preclude it and its members from obtaining a remedy for alleged injuries, the statutes violate Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution. Since I conclude that MTU has standing under the statutes, however, I do not reach that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\u00b657 At the outset, I agree with the Court\u2019s holding (under Issue 1) regarding the Water Court\u2019s application of \u00a7 85-2-223, MCA. In addition, I agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion (also under Issue 1) that while the Legislature has expressly identified the persons who have standing to file an objection to an application for a <em>new </em>water right, \u00a7 85-2-308(3), MCA, there is no statutory restriction on who is entitled to file an objection to a claim of an <em>existing </em>water right. Accordingly, I focus below on my disagreement with the Court\u2019s interpretation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>(under Issue 2) of \u00a7 85-2-233, MCA, which identifies the persons entitled to a hearing on an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-3\">\u00b658 Section 85-2-233(l)(a)(iii), MCA, states, in relevant part, that \u201c[flor good cause shown ..., a hearing must be held before the water judge on any objection to a temporary preliminary decree or preliminary decree by ... any person within the basin entitled to receive notice under 85-2-232(1).\u201d The persons entitled to receive notice include any \u201cinterested persons who request service of the notice from the water judge.\u201d Section 85-2-232(l)(f)(iii), MCA. \u201cGood cause shown\u201d means \u201ca written statement showing that a person has an ownership interest in water or its use that has been affected by the decree.\u201d Section 85-2-233(l)(b), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">\u00b659 At issue here is the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement. The Court reasons that because the State owns the waters of Montana and holds them in public trust for the benefit of its people, and because MTU\u2019s members have \u201cpersonal environmental and recreational interests\u201d in the Big Hole River basin, MTU therefore has a sufficient \u201cownership interest\u201d in water or its use to demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d for a hearing on MTU\u2019s objections. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34. In so doing, the Court effectively reads the \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement out of the statutory scheme. The Court holds that where a party has met all \u201ccommon law\u201d standing requirements and has satisfied the minimal statutory requirements of requesting notice and filing an objection, that is sufficient and the party is entitled to a hearing. The Court rejects the notion that such party must make any further showing. The statutory requirement of \u201cgood cause\u201d either is not at issue or is simply subsumed into the party\u2019s request for notice and filing of an objection. I do not believe this approach is faithful to the intent of the statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARa\">\u00b660 The Court has used the fact that \u201c[t]he State holds title to the surface waters of Montana for the benefit of its citizens\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 30) to drain the term \u201cownership\u201d in the statute of any force or relevance. Indeed, according to the Court\u2019s reasoning in \u00b6 34, a person has a \u201csufficient ownership interest\u201d if (1) he or she is a citizen of Montana and (2) he or she alleges a personal environmental and recreational interest in the particular water basin. While the Court claims this approach does not render the word \u201cownership\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>meaningless or expand the right to be heard on an objection to every person in the state (Opinion, \u00b6 35), it is difficult to perceive any real parameters on the Court\u2019s construction. And the Court, pointedly, chooses not to set any sideboards on the language it uses. Arguably, a resident of Libby planning a fishing trip to the Big Hole River has a personal environmental and recreational interest in that basin. So does a resident of Wolf Point who is planning a camping trip to the area. Likewise, high school students in Broadus who intend to study insect life along the shores of Montana\u2019s streams have a personal environmental and recreational interest in the river. And since the State holds the river\u2019s water in trust for all of these individuals, it appears they are all entitled to hearings on their objections. In effect, the Court has transformed the adjudication of water rights into a broad public participation process-a result not contemplated by the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">\u00b661 In my view, \u201cthe State\u2019s ownership of the waters of Montana\u201d (Opinion, \u00b6 34) is beside the point. The statute refers to \u201can ownership <em>interest </em>in water or its use.\u201d Section 85-2-233(l)(b), MCA (emphasis added). While it is not immediately clear what this means, what is clear is that the Legislature could not have meant an ownership interest premised on the fact that the State owns the waters on behalf of its citizens. Otherwise, there would have been no need to use the modifier \u201cownership\u201d; the Legislature could have simply referred to any Montana citizen who has \u201can interest in water or its use\u201d and omitted the term \u201cownership.\u201d Surely, however, the Legislature recognized that the State owns the waters as a matter of constitutional decree and that citizens only \u201cappropriat[e]\u201d the waters for beneficial uses. Mont. Const, art. IX, \u00a7 3(3). Hence, it is evident that \u201cownership interest\u201d must refer to something other than \u201cthe State\u2019s ownership of the waters of Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">\u00b662 Indeed, MTU concedes that \u201can ownership interest in water\u201d refers to \u201ca water right claim.\u201d The question, therefore, is what \u201cor its use\u201d refers to. Addressing this question, MTU points out that because a water right is a usufructuary right-i.e., \u201c[a] right for a certain period <em>to use and enjoy </em>the fruits of another\u2019s property without damaging or diminishing it, but allowing for any natural deterioration in the property over time,\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1684 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., Thomson Reuters 2009) (emphasis added)-it would be redundant for the statute to mean \u201can ownership interest in water or [an ownership interest in] its use,\u201d as these two clauses mean the same thing. Being usufructuary, an ownership interest in water <em>is </em>an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>ownership interest in its use. Thus, MTU posits that \u201cor its use\u201d has independent meaning in light of the statutory context and refers to an interest in the use of water not premised on a water right claim. I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-3\">\u00b663 The Water Court is required to provide notice of a temporary preliminary decree or preliminary decree not only to each person who has filed a claim of existing water right within the decreed basin, but also to any \u201cother interested persons who request service of the notice.\u201d Section 85-2-232(l)(b), (f)(iii), MCA. Clearly, participation in the adjudication at the preliminary decree stage by persons besides those claiming water rights is contemplated. Indeed, why would \u201cother interested persons\u201d be entitled to notice if they did not also have the corresponding right to participate meaningfully in the adjudication and be heard on objections? Moreover, \u201cany party who is affected by the decision and who participated in the matter\u201d is allowed to appeal an interlocutory ruling by the Water Court on a question of law. Section 85-2-235(3), MCA. Again, the statutory scheme contemplates the involvement of individuals besides the water right claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">\u00b664 It seems to me that the critical limiting language of the statute is to be found in the phrase \u201cthat has been affected by the decree.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 85-2-233(l)(b), MCA (\u201c \u00a3[G]ood cause shown\u2019 means a written statement showing that a person has an ownership interest in water or its use <em>that has been affected by the decree.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)). In context, this language indicates a personal and concrete (rather than conjectural) injury flowing from the decree. This interpretation is consistent with the aforementioned appeal statute, which refers to parties who are \u201caffected\u201d by the court\u2019s decision. Section 85-2-235(3), MCA. It is also consistent with the statutory counterparts governing <em>new </em>water rights (as opposed to <em>existing </em>water rights, which are at issue here). These statutes provide that \u201c[a] person has standing to file an objection ... if the property, water rights, or interests of the objector would be <em>adversely affected </em>by the proposed appropriation,\u201d \u00a7 85-2-308(3), MCA (emphasis added), and that a contested case hearing shall be held on valid objections, \u00a7 85-2-309(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\u00b665 In light of the foregoing, I would hold that a demonstrated interest in the use of the water, coupled with a personal and concrete injury resulting from the decree, is necessary to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d tmder the statute. Here, MTU has met this requirement in light of the organization\u2019s restoration efforts and accomplishments in the Big Hole River basin, its expenditures to achieve those ends, and the specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>and concrete harms that will result from unsupported large water right claims. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">\u00b666 In sum, I agree that the decision of the Water Court must be reversed. MTU has satisfied constitutional, prudential, and statutory standing requirements. But I disagree with the notion of \u201ccommon law rules of standing,\u201d and I also disagree with the Court\u2019s broad construction of \u00a7 85-2-233(l)(b), MCA. The net result of the Court\u2019s analysis is to expand the recognized parameters of standing beyond sustainable limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\u00b667 For the reasons set forth, I concur in the result of the Court\u2019s decision but dissent from the Court\u2019s analysis under Issue 2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b119-4\"> The Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence on the subject of non-Article III courts and administrative agencies that exercise the federal judicial power has been characterized aptly as \u201cnot admit[ting] of easy synthesis,\u201d <em>N. Pipeline Constr. Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., </em>458 U.S. 50, <em>91, 102 S. Ct. 2858, </em>2881 (1982) (Rehnquist &amp; O\u2019Connor, JJ., concurring in the judgment), and \u201cone of the most confusing and controversial areas of constitutional law,\u201d id. at 93,102 S. Ct. at 2883 (White, J., Burger, C.J., &amp; Powell, J., dissenting). Insightful discussions of this subject are provided in Paul M. Bator, <em>The Constitution as Architecture: Legislative and Administrative Courts Under Article III, </em>65 Ind. L. J. 233 (1990), and James B. Pfander, <em>Article I Tribunals, Article III Courts, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>and, the Judicial Power of the United States, </em>118 Harv. L. Rev. 643 (2004). The ability of the Montana Legislature to vest judicial power in non-Article VII tribunals and agencies presents an equally difficult question. I do not reach that question here, however, as it is not necessary to do so for reasons that will become clear.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-5\"> There was an \u201call cases at law and in equity\u201d provision in the 1889 Constitution concerning the jurisdiction not only of the district courts, but also of the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>Mont. Const, art. VIII, \u00a7\u00a7 3, 11 (1889). Thus, some of our cases under the 1889 Constitution state that this Court was likewise limited to cases and controversies. <em>See e.g. Chovanak v. Matthews, </em>120 Mont. 520, 525-26, 188 P.2d 582, 584-85 (1948).

Yet, though these authorities may be evidence of what <em>the Judiciary </em>believes is good policy, they are not evidence of what <em>the Legislature </em>intends.

Opinion, \u00b6 36. The Court concludes that MTU \u201chas a sufficient ownership interest in water or its use\u201d under \u00a7 85-2-233(l)(b), MCA, to have a right to a hearing on its objections. Opinion, \u00b6 34. I disagree with the Court\u2019s statutory interpretations and the conclusions reached thereby. I would affirm the Water Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">\u00b669 That there are \u201cno limits on who can file objections\u201d is true only in a most technical sense, for the statutes clearly impose a limitation upon objections which may proceed to hearing. Section 85-2-233(l)(a), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-9\">For good cause shown and subject to the provisions of subsection (9), <em>a hearing must be held before the water judge on any objection to a temporary preliminary decree or preliminary decree by :</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-10\">(i) the department;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-11\">(ii) a person named in the temporary preliminary decree or preliminary decree;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-12\">(iii) any person within the basin entitled to receive notice under 85-2-232(1); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-13\">(iv) any other person who claims rights to the use of water from sources in other basins that are hydrologically connected to the sources within the decreed basin and who would be entitled to receive notice under 85-2-232 if the claim or claims were from sources within the decreed basin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b127-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>(Emphasis added.) Only those included on this list are eligible to have a hearing by right. Any others are not and, therefore, a limitation upon actionable objections is inherent within the statutory structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-3\">\u00b670 MTU is included on this list of eligible objectors because it requested service of notice of the temporary preliminary decree from the Water Court, under \u00a7 85-2-232(l)(f)(iii), MCA, which any interested person can do.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, merely requesting notice of the decree does not create the right to proceed to a hearing on an objection. Only those parties who can demonstrate \u201cgood cause\u201d are entitled to a hearing, which is defined by \u00a7 85-2-233(l)(b), MCA, as \u201cshowing that a person has an ownership interest in water or its use that has been affected by the decree.\u201d MTU and others have offered various interpretations of this provision and policy rationales to paint the statute as ambiguous, but I believe the wording and the meaning are straightforward and that contortions are unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">\u00b671 First, \u201cperson\u201d is defined as \u201can individual, association, partnership, corporation, state agency, political subdivision, the United States or any agency of the United States, or any other entity.\u201d Section 85-2-102(18), MCA. \u201cPolitical subdivision\u201d is further defined as, inter alia, a \u201cpublic body of the state empowered to appropriate water.\u201d Section 85-2-102(19)(a), MCA. Then, a person must have \u201can ownership interest in water or its use.\u201d The key term is \u201cownership interest.\u201d Good cause thus requires a person to have an ownership interest, either in the water (a \u201cstate agency\u201d or a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d representing the state), or in the water\u2019s use (parties who hold a water right). The statutory definition of good cause perfectly reflects the tenets of our longstanding water law: the water is owned by the state; water rights are property rights, usufructory in nature, extending to the use of the water. Water right holders thus have an ownership interest in the water\u2019s use. This plain wording application of the good cause provision also comports with the nature of water right adjudication as <em>in rem </em>proceedings, <em>Nev. v. United States, </em>463 U.S. 110, 144, 103 S. Ct. 2906, 2925 (1983) (\u201cwater adjudications are more in the nature of <em>in rem </em>proceedings\u201d), which determine <em>inter sese </em>the rights among the holders.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">\u00b672 Therefore, the conclusion that MTU \u201chas a sufficient ownership interest\u201d in either the water or its use is incorrect. Opinion, \u00b6 34. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Indeed, MTU does not even claim to have an ownership interest, but rather argues for interpretations of the statute which alleviate the requirement for ownership. Alternatively, MTU argues that, even if it has no right to a hearing, the Water Court may discretionarily grant it a hearing, as the statute \u201cdoes not limit the Water Court\u2019s power to allow parties to participate ....\u201d With this I agree. While the statute limits the parties who are entitled to a hearing as a matter of right, it does not limit the Water Court\u2019s discretion to conduct additional hearings, and the court\u2019s discretion would well be moved to give airing to the concerns of MTU, given its long and active involvement in the basin.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">\u00b673 I agree with Justice Nelson\u2019s analysis that the Court has erred by importing common law standing concepts to this case. As he notes, the Water Court is a legislative creation, a specialized court created to perform a specialized function. In creating the Water Court, the Legislature specifically crafted the process to be followed by the court, including the standing requirements. I would enforce them as enacted and intended. While MTU makes several references to constitutional provisions within its arguments, it does not mount a constitutional challenge to the statutes governing the Water Court. I further agree with Justice Nelson that the Court has broadly opened the Water Court to a public participation process which was not intended under the statutes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\"> MTU and the non-owner objectors within the companion case, Western Watersheds Project and Laurence D.
