Plaintiff asks this Court to exercise supervisory control, pursuant to M. R. App. P. 14, over the Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court, and to conclude the District Court\u2019s order of March 17,2011, granting Defendant Ford Motor Company\u2019s Motion in Limine, was in error. The underlying case arises from a motor vehicle accident in which Peter Carter was killed during an ensuing rollover. Plaintiff Dennis Stokes, as Personal Representative of Carter\u2019s Estate (\u201cStokes\u201d), filed a wrongful death and survival action against three defendants: the vehicle manufacturer, Ford; the auto rental company, Overland West, Inc. (\u201cOverland\u201d); and the other driver involved in the accident, Todd Durham.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\u00b62 Stokes alleged Durham was negligent in the operation of his vehicle for causing the initial crash, which Durham subsequently admitted. Stokes\u2019s claims against the other two defendants were premised on the theory that the initial impact caused only minor injuries, but the seatbelt in the vehicle slackened and spooled out during the rollover, allowing Carter to be partially ejected from the vehicle and causing his fatal head injury. Stokes alleged negligence in Ford\u2019s design, development and testing of its occupant restraint system, and asserted a claim based in strict products liability for Ford\u2019s defective design of the system. He alleged Overland was negligent for failing to maintain the vehicle in a safe condition, and strictly liable for placing the defective vehicle in the stream of commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">\u00b63 Following the reasoning in <em>Chapman v. Mazda Motor Co. of </em>Am., 7 F. Supp. 2d 1123 (D. Mont. 1998), the District Court ruled that \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, did not prohibit evidence of seatbelt use or nonuse in products liability claims, but did prohibit such evidence in negligence claims. The court concluded that it would be too confusing for the jury to admit the evidence on the products liability claims but exclude it on the negligence claims, even with an appropriate limiting instruction. The court thus informed Stokes that if he planned on using evidence of seatbelt use or nonuse in his strict liability claims against Ford and Overland, he would be required to drop his negligence claims against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>all three defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\">\u00b64 Stokes petitioned this Court for supervisory control on the basis that the District Court was proceeding based on a mistake of law, thereby causing a substantial injustice, for which he has an inadequate remedy on appeal. M. R. App. P. 14. We ordered the District Court and/or the defendants to respond to Stokes\u2019s petition. Ford and Overland filed responses. We thereafter classified the matter for oral argument and directed the parties to file supplemental briefs. We heard oral argument on June 28, 2011, and the matter is now ripe for disposition. We address two questions in resolving this petition: whether this is an appropriate case for exercise of supervisory control and whether the District Court erred in granting Ford\u2019s motion in limine. The latter inquiry turns on whether \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, precludes evidence of seatbelt use in the trial of Stokes\u2019s negligence or products liability claims, or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">1. <em>Propriety of Supervisory Control</em></p>\n<p id=\"Auy\">\u00b65 Article VII, Section 2(2) of the Montana Constitution grants this Court \u201cgeneral supervisory control over all other courts.\u201d Supervisory control is an extraordinary remedy, reserved for extraordinary circumstances. <em>Hegwood v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2003 MT 200, \u00b6 6, 317 Mont. 30, 75 P.3d 308. We will assume supervisory control over a district court to direct the course of litigation if the court is proceeding based on a mistake of law, which if uncorrected, would cause significant injustice for which appeal is an inadequate remedy. <em>Simms v. Mont. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2003 MT 89, \u00b6 18, 315 Mont. 135, 68 P.3d 678. Whether supervisory control is appropriate is a case-by-case decision. <em>Id. </em>Acceptance of supervisory control is limited to cases involving purely legal questions, in which the district court is proceeding under a mistake of law causing a gross injustice or constitutional issues of statewide importance are involved. M. R. App. P. 14(3); <em>Plumb v. Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>279 Mont. 363, 369, 927 P.2d 1011, 1015 (1996) (superseded on other grounds). \u201cJudicial economy and inevitable procedural entanglements [have been] cited as appropriate reasons for this Court to issue a writ of supervisory control.\u201d <em>Truman v. Mont. Eleventh Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2003 MT 91, \u00b6 15, 315 Mont. 165, 68 P.3d 654. In such an instance, \u201cthe denial of a speedy remedy by supervisory control would be a denial of justice.\u201d <em>Plumb </em>at 370, 927 P.2d at 1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">\u00b66 In <em>Truman, </em>we accepted supervisory control to determine whether a defendant could present evidence of a subsequent accident with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>non-party to disprove the defendant\u2019s liability for damages. We cited <em>Plumb, </em>where we held that were the case to proceed to trial under the claimed mistake of law, \u201cthe course of discovery, the cost of preparation, and the trial itself would be adversely affected.\u201d <em>Truman, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>Plumb </em>at 370, 927 P.2d at 1015-16). In both cases, we noted the additional time and expense for resolution of the controlling issues on appeal and the \u201cinevitable\u201d subsequent litigation. <em>Plumb </em>at 370, 927 P.2d at 1016; <em>Truman, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">\u00b67 While we exercise supervisory control \u201conly in extraordinary circumstances,\u201d <em>Safeco v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Court, </em>2000 MT 153, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 123, 2 P.3d 834, we conclude such circumstances are present in the instant case. Stokes presents a purely legal question: whether \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, bars evidence of seatbelt use in his claims alleging defects in the Ford Explorer\u2019s seatbelt system. This is a question of first impression, limited to construction of the statute, and the answer will govern whether the trial proceeds on one or both of Stokes\u2019s legal theories. If the District Court is affirmed, Stokes requests an order allowing bifurcated trials of his negligence and products liability claims. Ford, on the other hand, seeks a ruling barring evidence of seatbelt use altogether or affirming the trial court\u2019s order requiring Stokes to elect between his two legal theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">\u00b68  If the District Court is reversed and both theories are allowed to advance, preparation and presentation of the case will be significantly affected. Unlike the run-of-the-mill evidentiary ruling, <em>e.g. Sluggett v. Phillips, </em>2006 Mont. LEXIS 370, this is not an issue that may be judged in the hindsight of trial to determine prejudice to a party\u2019s substantive rights. Rather, the ruling may determine whether the Plaintiffs combined claims will be tried at all, alone or together. The course of litigation will be dramatically altered depending on resolution of the question here presented. \u201cIf incorrect, the [district] court\u2019s conclusions will impact all aspects of the proceeding from preparation for trial to settlement negotiations and the trial itself.\u201d <em>Truman, </em>\u00b6 16. An appeal would be an inadequate remedy given the costs and delay associated with the full re-trial almost certain to result if the district court\u2019s interpretation of the statute is set aside. Denial of a speedy remedy by supervisory control on the straightforward legal issue presented in the present case would amount to a substantial injustice. We therefore grant Stokes\u2019s petition and exercise supervisory control.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">\n<em>2. Admissibility of Seatbelt Use or Nonuse Under \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">\u00b69 The Montana Seatbelt Use Act, passed in 1987, prohibits a driver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>from operating a motor vehicle upon a highway of the State of Montana \u201cunless each occupant of a designated seating position is wearing a properly adjusted and fastened seatbelt.\u201d Section 61-13-103(1), MCA. Section 61-13-106, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-3\">Evidence of compliance or failure to comply with 61-13-103 is not admissible in any civil action for personal injury or property damage resulting from the use or operation of a motor vehicle, and failure to comply with 61-13-103 does not constitute negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">\u00b610 Ford contends <em>all </em>evidence of seatbelt use or nonuse should be excluded in civil actions, as such evidence is prohibited by the plain language of \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA. In the alternative, Ford contends this Court should affirm the District Court\u2019s order allowing such evidence in products liability claims but disallowing it in negligence claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A8F\">\u00b611 Stokes contends the statute is designed to apply only in instances where seatbelt use or nonuse is admitted to show comparative negligence-the so-called \u201cseatbelt defense\u201d wherein a defendant alleges the plaintiffs nonuse of a seatbelt caused or contributed to his or her injuries. The District Court charted a course in between the parties\u2019 principal contentions, in accord with <em>Chapman. </em>The <em>Chapman </em>court rejected an auto manufacturer\u2019s arguments that \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, applied \u201cacross the board\u201d in civil actions to preclude all evidence of seatbelt use or nonuse. <em>Chapman, </em>7 F. Supp. 2d at 1126. The court observed that the statute\u2019s intent was not to foreclose \u201ccrashworthiness\u201d products liability actions where \u201cthe condition of the car... is at issue, not the conduct of the seat belt users.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1126-27. The court concluded, \u201cwhen a defective or inoperable restraint system is at issue in a design case, \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, does not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1127. Thus, the court reasoned, the statute \u201cbars proof of seat belts in a claim for negligence,\u201d where the focus is on the parties\u2019 conduct, but \u201cdoes not apply to product liability claims,\u201d where the focus is on the condition of the product. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\u00b612 In light of this ruling, the <em>Chapman </em>court concluded that plaintiff \u201cmust elect her theory of liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If Chapman elected to proceed with her negligence claims, the Court would preclude evidence of seatbelt use. If she elected to proceed with a products liability design defect crashworthiness case, the evidence would be allowed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">\u00b613 Mirroring the <em>Chapman </em>court\u2019s conclusions, the District Court\u2019s order rej ected Ford\u2019s argument in part, ruling that the statute does not apply in the products liability context, but agreed that it does preclude evidence relating to seatbelt use or nonuse in negligence actions. The District Court then forced Stokes to choose between his products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>liability and negligence claims. For the reasons that follow, we now hold that \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, does not prohibit the introduction of seatbelt use or nonuse evidence in a damages claim for injuries arising from the condition of the vehicle\u2019s occupant restraint system, whether that claim sounds in negligence or in strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">\u00b614 <em>Chapman </em>recognized that it would be inappropriate to apply the statute to crashworthiness claims, as those were not the claims to which the statute was addressed-rather, the statute was intended to prohibit use of seatbelt evidence in showing comparative or contributory fault in negligence actions. Despite this recognition, the court applied the statute\u2019s bar to a claim of negligent design of the passenger compartment because, in order to prove negligence, a plaintiff must prove she was not at fault, and that is the very issue for which the statute prohibits seatbelt evidence. <em>Chapman </em>at 1127. We agree with <em>Chapman\u2019s </em>conclusion that \u201cwhen a defective or inoperable restraint system is at issue in a design case, \u00a7 61-13-106, [MCA,] does not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do not, however, confine this conclusion to products liability claims when, as here, \u201cit is the condition of the [occupant restraint system] that is at issue\u201d in the case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">\u00b615 The statute prohibits the introduction of seatbelt use or nonuse \u201cin any civil action for personal injury or property damage resulting from the use or operation of a motor vehicle.\u201d Section 61-13-106, MCA. Our purpose in construing the statute is to ascertain the legislative intent and give effect to the legislative will. Section 1-2-102, MCA. In our interpretation of a statute, \u201c \u2018we must view it as a part of a whole statutory scheme and construe it so as to forward the purpose of that scheme.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wright v. Ace Am. Ins. Co., </em>2011 MT 43, \u00b6 24, 359 Mont. 332, 249 P.3d 485 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u00b616 The purpose of the Seatbelt Use Act is to encourage seatbelt use and to impose a legal requirement on the driver to ensure all occupants of the vehicle are properly belted. Section 61-13-103(1), MCA. The Act \u201cexpressly clarifies that the sole legal sanction for the failure to wear a seat belt is the [$20] fine imposed by the Act and that a person will not be penalized in a civil proceeding by connotations of fault for choosing not to wear a seat belt.\u201d <em>C.f. Bishop v. Takata Corp., </em>12 P.3d 459, 466 (Okla. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\u00b617  In this case, Stokes alleges injuries <em>resulting from the condition of the vehicle\u2019s occupant restraint system. </em>As seatbelts are the <em>sine qua non </em>of a vehicle\u2019s occupant restraint system, where that system has been placed directly at issue, evidence relating to seatbelt use or nonuse must be allowed. Ford\u2019s interpretation of the statute to prohibit seatbelt evidence in such a case is \u201cdemonstrably at odds with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>the intentions of its drafters\u201d and must be rejected. <em>S.L.H. v. State Compen. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 362, \u00b6 31, 303 Mont. 364, 15 P.3d 948 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Ron Pair Enter., </em>489 U.S. 235, 242, 109 S. Ct. 1026, 1031 (1989)). The situation presented here today is not one contemplated by the statute-the conduct of the drivers is not at issue in the seatbelt claims and the evidence is not offered to attribute comparative negligence or contributory fault in hopes of influencing Stokes\u2019s recovery of damages. <em>E.g. DePaepe v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>33 F.3d 737, 744-46 (7th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\">\u00b618 Most courts considering similar statutes have ruled that evidence of seatbelt use or nonuse is admissible in cases raising the defective design or condition of the seatbelt. <em>See e.g. Bridgestone/Firestone, Inc. v. Glyn-Jones, </em>878 S.W.2d 132 (Tex. 1994); <em>Bishop, </em>12 P.3d at 462 n. 13, 466 (citing cases). After the Minnesota Supreme Court\u2019s contrary ruling in <em>Olson v. Ford Motor Co., </em>558 N.W.2d 491 (Minn. 1997), the Minnesota legislature amended its statute to clarify expressly that seatbelt evidence is admissible in products liability actions. 1999 Minn. Laws 106 (codified at Minn. Stat. \u00a7 169.685 subdiv. 4).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">\u00b619 We are not persuaded that Ford will suffer prejudice from the introduction of evidence that Carter was wearing a seatbelt. Since the spooling out of the belt is a primary focus of Stokes\u2019s claim, the jury would inescapably become aware of the fact of seatbelt use. All photos of the crash scene clearly depict the seatbelt in use. <em>See DePaepe </em>at 746 n. 11 (\u201cthe jury knew [that DePaepe was not belted] anyway ... [w]e therefore cannot agree that the seat belt evidence was excessively prejudicial.\u201d). We also find unconvincing Ford\u2019s argument that allowing evidence of use or nonuse of a seatbelt when the occupant restraint system is at issue will create a \u201cone-way street.\u201d The case law does not support Ford\u2019s claim that, in practice, such a ruling \u201cwould always exclude seatbelt nonuse from evidence but always admit seatbelt use,\u201d as \u201ca vehicle occupant who was not wearing a seatbelt would obviously never claim the seatbelt was defective.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">\u00b620 For example, where a plaintiff brought an action against an auto manufacturer for negligent design of the seat back in her vehicle, the Delaware Supreme Court allowed the manufacturer\u2019s affirmative defense that plaintiffs injuries were caused in part by her failure to wear a seatbelt, despite a Delaware seatbelt use law very similar to Montana\u2019s. <em>Gen. Motors Corp. v. Wolhar, </em>686 A.2d 170 (Del. 1996). Rejecting Wolhar\u2019s request to exclude evidence of her seatbelt nonuse, the Delaware Supreme Court noted that the nature of Wolhar\u2019s allegations \u201cchallenge[d] the \u2018crashworthiness\u2019 \u201c of her vehicle, and consequently, the concerns addressed by the statute were \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>implicated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">\u00b621 Similarly, in <em>Clark v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>68 P.3d 207 (Okla. 2003), the auto manufacturer, Mazda, sought to introduce evidence that the plaintiff, Clark, was not wearing her seatbelt at the time of an accident, when Clark claimed that her vehicle\u2019s seat back and/or seat design was defective. Observing that Clark\u2019s theory \u201ccall[ed] into question the design of the seat\u2019s occupant restraint system,\u201d the court allowed the evidence, concluding that it was directly related to her claim of insufficient crashworthiness. <em>Id. </em>at 209. Nor was application of the rule limited to plaintiffs in <em>Gardner v. Chrysler Corp., </em>89 F.3d 729, 732 (10th Cir. 1996), where, along the same lines as in <em>Clark, </em>the manufacturer successfully introduced evidence of seatbelt nonuse to rebut plaintiffs claims of a defective restraint system. <em>See also Sims v. Great Am. Life Ins. Co., </em>469 F.3d 870, 886 (10th Cir. 2006) (manufacturer sought to introduce evidence of seatbelt nonuse, notwithstanding seatbelt statute, for purposes of showing plaintiffs state of mind: \u201cGreat American does not ... insinuate fault for [plaintiffs failure to wear a seat belt]... [i]t argues he was suicidal.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A9k\">\u00b622 Consistent with the majority of courts to have considered the issue, we find no indication the legislature intended to abrogate a claim arising from defective design or condition of a vehicle\u2019s occupant restraint system. We decide only the issues before us in this case, and conclude that when the plaintiffs injuries are alleged to result from a defect in the vehicle\u2019s occupant restraint system, whether the claim sounds in negligence or strict liability, \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, does not preclude evidence of seatbelt use or nonuse. We additionally hold that where, as here, the plaintiffs claim is combined with a claim against the driver of another vehicle involved in the crash, a limiting instruction must be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">\u00b623 We disagree with Ford that a limiting instruction to clarify the allowable purposes to which the evidence could be put will necessarily confuse the jury. Other courts have approved limiting instructions in similar cases. The court in <em>DePaepe </em>approved the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANv\">You may consider the fact that plaintiffs 1984 Buick Regal was equipped with functional seat belts in accordance with federal and Illinois law for the purpose of determining whether the overall design of the vehicle was reasonably crashworthy. However, you may not consider plaintiffs use or non-use of seat belts in determining, one, whether the plaintiff was at fault for his own injuries and/or, two, whether plaintiffs use or non-use of his seat belt caused his injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\"><em>DePaepe, </em>33 F.3d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The court in <em>Wolhar </em>similarly directed the trial court to instruct the jury \u201cthat the seat belt evidence may only be considered for the limited purpose of determining whether negligently defective vehicular design was the proximate cause of Mrs. Wolhar\u2019s enhanced injuries.\u201d <em>Wolhar, </em>686 A.2d at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\">\u00b624 We conclude an appropriate limiting instruction may be fashioned in the circumstances of this case without substantial risk of jury confusion. Our ruling today will facilitate the accurate presentation of the defective seatbelt allegations to the jury while also ensuring that all parties whose conduct may have contributed to Carter\u2019s injuries are brought before the court in order for the jury properly to apportion liability, in the event Stokes prevails on his negligence claim at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"ANLN\">\u00b625  In sum, we conclude that evidence relating to Carter\u2019s use of a seatbelt is not prohibited by \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA, under the facts and legal theories presented by this case. Such evidence shall be admissible as it bears on the condition of the vehicle\u2019s occupant restraint system. On remand, the District Court shall fashion an appropriate jury instruction to ensure the evidence is used only for this purpose, and not as is prohibited by \u00a7 61-13-106, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b626 IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Petition for Writ of Supervisory Control is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b627 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the District Court\u2019s Order of March 17, 2011, granting defendant\u2019s Motion in Limine, is REVERSED.
