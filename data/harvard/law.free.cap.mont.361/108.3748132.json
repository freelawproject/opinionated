We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u00b62 Levens and Ballard own adjoining properties in Grizzly Gulch, a mountainous area south of Helena, Montana. Levens live on their property which lies south of Ballard\u2019s property, where he operates a gold mine. Ballard\u2019s gold mine is an open pit dug with heavy equipment alongside the county road in Grizzly Gulch, and near or to the boundary with Levens\u2019 property on the south end. Ballard digs earth and rocks (\u201cmaterial\u201d) out of the pit and processes it to extract gold. Ballard can expand his pit only to a limited surface area because of the country road, Levens\u2019 property, and his five-acre limit as a \u201csmall miner\u201d under State law (\u00a7\u00a7 82-4-303(16) and -305, MCA). One of the consequences of this is that Ballard tends to dig down rather than \u201cout\u201d to recover material for processing. A consequence of digging down is that the steep sides of the pit tend to collapse into the pit. Ballard removes this material for gold processing.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">\u00b63 In 2003, Lewis &amp; Clark County allowed Ballard to relocate the county road that had formerly separated the Levens and Ballard tracts. Levens and Ballard could not agree upon the location of the boundaries of their properties, but in August 2005 they entered a written agreement defining their boundary according to a draft survey completed the prior year. One provision of the agreement moved a portion of Levens\u2019 property boundary 30 feet to the south, giving Ballard title to a 30-foot strip between the two properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">\u00b64 In return, Ballard agreed \u201cthat to protect the lateral support of Levens\u2019 property, no excavating will occur within 30 feet of Levens\u2019 real property.\u201d The parties also agreed to share the cost of a new survey and to execute all documents required to accomplish the boundary relocation. Disputes quickly arose after Ballard occupied the area between the two properties and refused to sign the new certificate of survey.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">\u00b65 Levens brought an action against Ballard to enforce the agreement and for an injunction. The evidence in that proceeding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>showed that Ballard refused to sign the new survey and had \u201cbladed a road,\u201d drilled a water well, and placed heavy equipment on Levens\u2019 property or property that would belong to Levens under the agreement. In October, 2005, the District Court enjoined Ballard from \u201cexcavating, mining, bull dozing ... or in any manner changing the disputed property\u201d or trespassing on Levens\u2019 property. In April, 2006, the District Court issued a Memorandum and Order determining that the agreement was \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d and granting Levens\u2019 motion for summary judgment. In a judgment filed April 24, 2006, the District Court ordered that the August, 2005 agreement between Levens and Ballard was valid and enforceable; that Ballard was required to sign the new certificate of survey; that Ballard was required to execute all documents necessary to accomplish the boundary relocation; and that Ballard was \u201cpermanently enjoined from excavating within 30 feet of the property boundary of the Plaintiffs, Russell and Melissa Levens.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b66 Less than a month later, in May, 2006, Ballard moved the District Court to \u201cclarify\u201d the judgment because another dispute had arisen over the well that Ballard had drilled on land belonging to Levens. Ballard wanted access to the well and the right to use the road he bladed across the property he recently acquired from Levens. Ballard\u2019s motion argued that the intent of the 2005 agreement was that he \u201cnot mine within thirty feet of the [Levens] property therefore insuring lateral support.\u201d Ballard contended that the agreement \u201conly addresses excavation <em>as it affects lateral support.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) He asked the District Court to order that the prior judgment did not prevent him from drilling a new water well or excavating a road on the 30-foot strip that he now owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b67 Ballard\u2019s attorney filed an affidavit in support of the motion, asserting that the intent of the 2005 agreement with Levens was \u201cmeant to include only <em>the loss of lateral support </em>through Mr. Ballard\u2019s actual excavation, mining, digging, or enlarging the pit.\u201d (Emphasis added.) A draft order attached to Ballard\u2019s motion provided that the intent of the 2005 agreement was to prohibit \u201cdigging in the pit in such a manner that it <em>enlarges the pit to within 30 feet of the property line, </em>thereby diminishing the lateral support to the Levens Property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Ballard also filed an affidavit in support of that motion in which he requested that the \u201cexcavation\u201d covered by the judgment be declared to be \u201cstrictly for the purpose of lateral support\u201d for Levens\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b68 In August, 2006, the District Court denied Ballard\u2019s motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>clarification, holding again that the 2005 agreement \u201cis clear and unambiguous and prohibits <em>any type of excavating </em>within 30 feet of the property boundary.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b69 In June, 2009, Levens filed a motion for contempt against Ballard for failure to abide by the April, 2006 judgment entered against him. The Hon. Tom Honzel presided over the case prior to this time, but he had retired by the time the June, 2009 motion was filed and the Hon. Kathy Seeley assumed jurisdiction. Levens sought an order requiring Ballard to \u201cfully and adequately remediate the excavation, sloughing, and ground cracking that has occurred within 30 feet\u201d of their property and to compensate them for all damages incurred as a result of Ballard\u2019s violation of the permanent injunction in the judgment. In July, 2009 the District Court held two days of evidentiary hearing on Levens\u2019 motion and conducted a site visit. In July, 2009, the District Court denied Levens\u2019 motion for contempt, finding that while there had been \u201cslumping of material along the edge\u201d of Ballard\u2019s pit, he had not actually excavated within 30 feet of the property line. In September 2010, the District Court entered an order awarding attorney fees to Ballard under the 2005 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\u00b610 Review of a district court\u2019s interpretation of a judgment presents an issue of law, and this Court reviews the district court\u2019s interpretation to determine whether it is correct. <em>Harland v. Anderson Ranch Co., </em>2004 MT 132, \u00b6 20, 321 Mont. 338, 92 P. 3d 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u00b611 <em>Issue: Did the District Court err in denying Levens\u2019 motion to have Ballard held in contempt for violation of the prior judgment ? </em>Levens filed a motion with the District Court requesting an order holding Ballard in contempt of court pursuant to \u00a7 3-l-501(l)(e), MCA. That section provides that disobedience of any lawful judgment of the court constitutes contempt of court. Levens\u2019 motion was based upon their contention that Ballard violated the District Court\u2019s April 24, 2006 judgment, and particularly the portion that permanently enjoined Ballard from excavating within 30 feet of their property line. Levens further sought the District Court\u2019s order to require Ballard to \u201cfully and adequately remediate the excavation, sloughing and ground cracking\u201d that occurred within 30 feet of their property line, and sought compensation for all damages they had incurred as a result of Ballard\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u00b612 On July 31, 2009, following a hearing and a site visit, the District Court entered an order denying the motion for contempt, finding that the issue was resolved by the language of the 2005 agreement between Levens and Ballard; particularly the provision that prohibited Ballard from \u201cexcavating\u201d within 30 feet of Levens\u2019 property line. The District Court found that \u201cwhile there has been and will be slumping of material along the edge of the area where excavating has occurred, there has been no excavating within 30 feet of the property line.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b613 The District Court\u2019s order can only be fully understood in the context of the testimony presented at the hearing. Ballard\u2019s contention at the hearing, and now on appeal, is that the word \u201cexcavating\u201d as used in the 2005 agreement with Levens and in the District Court\u2019s 2006 judgment, only prohibits him from moving any portion of his excavating equipment into the 30-foot buffer strip in front of Levens\u2019 property. Ballard, his expert Earl Griffith and his employee Gerry Kelly testified that while they did not measure or survey the pit, in their estimation no part of Ballard\u2019s excavating equipment intruded into the 30-foot strip. Ballard\u2019s contention is that he can dig as deeply into his pit as he wants and allow the pit walls to collapse as long as no portion of his equipment crosses the plane of the 30-foot boundary in front of Levens\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b614 According to Ballard\u2019s expert Griffith, the natural and expected consequence of Ballard\u2019s excavation of his pit up to the edge of the 30-foot boundary is that the \u201cmaterial\u201d (earth and rocks) above the steep headwall slumps (i.e., slides or falls) into the pit. Griffith testified that the slumping into the pit will continue as long as the wall of the pit fails to provide sufficient lateral support to keep it in place. This slumping has progressed as a result of Ballard\u2019s excavation to the point that the earth from Levens\u2019 side of the 30-foot boundary has begun sliding into Ballard\u2019s pit. This is the \u201cslumping\u201d referred to in the District Court\u2019s order. Both Levens and Ballard agree that this has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b615 The loss of lateral support caused by Ballard\u2019s steep-sided excavation has also caused cracking in the remaining earth surface within the 30-foot strip. According to Ballard\u2019s expert Griffith, this is an indication that the cracked earth will eventually also slide into the pit. At the time of the hearing in 2009, the cracks in the earth had progressed across the 30-foot strip and, according to Griffith, were already within a few feet of Levens\u2019 property boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b616 Griffith further testified that as Ballard continues to excavate deeper into the pit and to remove the material that slumps into it from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>the 30-foot strip bordering Levens\u2019 property, the 30-foot strip of earth itself will eventually disappear into the pit, as the earth will no longer hold together and seeks its \u201cangle of repose.\u201d That is the angle at which the loose earth will remain in place without further sliding or slumping. Griffith opined that Ballard should be allowed to excavate from his pit until the earth from the entire 30-foot strip slumps into the pit.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b617 Ballard\u2019s contention in the District Court and on appeal is that there is a legally significant difference between \u201cexcavating\u201d and \u201cexcavation.\u201d He contends that when he sends heavy equipment into the pit and moves earth as described by Griffith, he is \u201cexcavating.\u201d Ballard argues that the result of excavating is an \u201cexcavation\u201d and that neither the 2005 agreement nor the 2006 judgment prohibit him from creating an excavation. Ballard contends that if his excavating causes or results in an excavation that extends into the 30-foot buffer zone with Levens, then that is only a natural geologic event and is not prohibited by the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b618 The District Court apparently agreed with Ballard\u2019s contention that there were no restrictions on the size of his excavation (the outer limits of the pit) as long as no part of his heavy equipment came within 30 feet of Levens\u2019 property line. The District Court was in error because it construed the judgment too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b619 First, it is clear that an express primary purpose of the 2005 Levens-Ballard agreement was to secure for Levens a buffer of earth 30 feet wide between them and Ballard\u2019s pit to provide \u201clateral support\u201d for Levens\u2019 property. In other words, the purpose was to keep Ballard\u2019s pit far enough away from Levens\u2019 property line to insure that Levens\u2019 property did not fall into Ballard\u2019s pit. Therefore, the word \u201cexcavating\u201d in the agreement and in the judgment must be read in the context of insuring lateral support for Levens\u2019 property. Allowing Ballard to excavate in his pit so that the earth from the 30-foot buffer strip falls into the pit does not insure that Levens will have lateral support.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b620 Further, it is clear that in 2006 Ballard similarly understood that the judgment\u2019s injunction against his excavating within 30 feet of Levens\u2019 property was meant to insure that the 30-foot buffer strip remain intact. Shortly after the entry of the judgment Ballard wanted to use the buffer strip for a graded road and a water well. He moved to clarify or amend the judgment, contending that the 2005 agreement was only intended to prevent \u201cdigging in the pit in such a manner that it enlarges the pit to within 30 feet of the property line, thereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>diminishing the lateral support for the Levens Property.\u201d Ballard\u2019s attorney submitted an affidavit in support of the motion, asserting that he had negotiated the 2005 agreement and that it was \u201cmeant to include only the loss of lateral support through Mr. Ballard\u2019s actual excavation, mining, digging, or enlarging the pit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b621 This recognition of the importance of lateral support to the Levens, and that the agreement prevented \u201cenlarging\u201d the pit are directly at odds with Ballard\u2019s position in the present appeal. Given the express language in the 2005 agreement linking lateral support for the Levens\u2019 property to the 30-foot buffer strip, it is clear that the intent of the 2006 judgment was to prohibit Ballard from excavating in such a way that the pit was extended into the strip. This was expressly Ballard\u2019s understanding of the judgment in 2006 and is consistent with the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">\u00b622 Second, we find no justification in law or in the facts of this case to make the distinction between \u201cexcavation\u201d and \u201cexcavating\u201d that Ballard now promotes. Excavating naturally and necessarily creates an excavation. Ballard provides no substantial support for his contention that, with regard to his relationship with Levens, he can excavate without regard to the effects of the resulting excavation. Such an interpretation would effectively nullify the express recognition in the 2005 agreement (and in Ballard\u2019s 2006 court filings) of the importance of maintaining lateral support for the edge of Levens\u2019 property. There is no support in the record for Ballard\u2019s position in the current proceeding that he can, consistently with the 2005 agreement and 2006 judgment, cause the earth in front of Levens\u2019 property to fall away into his pit right up to the property line.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u00b623  Therefore, we conclude that the 2006 judgment in this case must be construed to prevent Ballard from excavating in his pit in such a way that the pit excavation intrudes, by sloughing, slumping, subsidence or otherwise, into the 30-foot buffer strip at the edge of Levens\u2019 property. Levens are entitled under the agreement and the judgment to have the 30-foot buffer strip remain intact.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\u00b624 The District Court\u2019s orders denying the motion for contempt and awarding attorney fees to Ballard are reversed. This case is remanded to the District Court to conduct such other proceedings, and enter such other orders as may be required to address Levens\u2019 motion for contempt, consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b140-8\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS, WHEAT, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
