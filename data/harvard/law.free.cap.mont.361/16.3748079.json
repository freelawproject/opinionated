We reverse. J.A. raises one issue on appeal, restated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">\u00b62 <em>Did the Youth Court err in denying </em>J.A.\u2019s <em>motion for release from custody for lack of jurisdiction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">\u00b63 When he was 17, J.A. was charged in district court with burglary by common scheme, a felony, and theft by common scheme, a misdemeanor. After a hearing, the district court transferred jurisdiction to Youth Court. On February 15, 2008, J.A., then 18, entered admissions to the charges. The Youth Court declared J.A. delinquent and placed him on probation until February 15,2009, upon terms and conditions that included payment of restitution in the amount of $3,617.69. In December 2008, the State filed a petition to revoke probation and transfer supervision of J.A. to district court. The Youth Court issued a summons and, when J.A. did not appear, the court issued a warrant for his arrest in February 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">\u00b64 J.A., who turned 21 years old in March 2010, was not picked up on the warrant until May 2010 in California. No order had been issued transferring the case to district court. J. A. made his initial appearance in Youth Court in July 2010 and moved for release from custody for lack of jurisdiction. J.A. argued that because the proceeding had not been transferred to district court pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, the Youth Court had lost jurisdiction over him when he turned 21, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-205(1), MCA. After a hearing, the Youth Court denied the motion, reasoning that adopting J.A.\u2019s position would fail to hold him accountable for his probation violations and \u201cencourage youths to abscond.\u201d The court concluded that result was contrary to the purposes of the Youth Court Act and general notions of justice. J.A. appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">\u00b65 \u201cJurisdiction is defined by law.\u201d <em>State v. Evert, </em>2004 MT 178, \u00b6 14, 322 Mont. 105, 93 P.3d 1254. The dispositive issue here concerns interpretation of the Montana Youth Court Act\u2019s provisions on jurisdiction of a youth court. \u201cThis Court reviews a youth court\u2019s interpretation and application of the Youth Court Act for correctness.\u201d <em>In re Cascade Co. Dist. Ct., </em>2009 MT 355, \u00b6 10, 353 Mont. 194, 219 P.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>1255 (citing <em>In re K.D.K., </em>2006 MT 187, \u00b6 15, 333 Mont. 100, 141 P.3d 1212).</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">\u00b66 <em>Did the Youth Court err in denying </em>J.A.\u2019s <em>motion for release from custody for lack of jurisdiction?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">\u00b67 J.A. cites the provisions of the Youth Court Act which grant jurisdiction to youth court over individuals who engage in criminal activity while they are under the age of 18, but terminate jurisdiction when the individual reaches age 21, absent a transfer of the case to district court. J.A. argues the Youth Court lost jurisdiction over him because he admitted to and was adjudicated of committing unlawful activity while under 18, and the Youth Court failed to transfer his case to district court prior to his 21st birthday. J.A. further argues upholding the Youth Court\u2019s denial of his motion for release would deny him due process of law as protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution. The State replies that J.A.\u2019s argument would lead to the absurd result of rewarding a youth who absconds, be contrary to the purposes of the Youth Court Act, and allow J.A. to escape his plea agreement obligations after he reaped its benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">\u00b68 \u201cThe Montana Youth Court Act provides that youth courts have original jurisdiction over cases involving persons under the age of 18.\u201d <em>State v. </em>Andersen-Conway, 2007 MT 281, \u00b6 15, 339 Mont. 439, 171 P.3d 678 (citing \u00a7 41-5-203(1), MCA); <em>Cascade </em>Co., \u00b6 20. Section 41-5-203(1), MCA, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-9\">(1) Except as provided in subsection (2) and for cases filed in the district court under 41-5-206, the [youth] court has exclusive original jurisdiction of all proceedings under the Montana Youth Court Act in which a youth is alleged to be a delinquent youth or a youth in need of intervention or concerning any person under 21 years of age charged with having violated any law of the state or any ordinance of a city or town... prior to having become 18 years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">\u00b69 We have explained that \u201c[generally, a youth court\u2019s jurisdiction over a delinquent youth ceases when the youth reaches the age of twenty-one.\u201d <em>In re N.V., </em>2004 MT 80, \u00b6 28, 320 Mont. 442, 87 P.3d 510 (citing \u00a7 41-5-205(1), MCA (2001)). Section 41-5-205(l)-(3), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-11\">(1) The court may dismiss a petition or otherwise terminate jurisdiction on its own motion or on the motion or petition of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>interested party at any time. Unless terminated by the court and except as provided in subsections (2) and (3), <em>the jurisdiction of the court continues until the individual becomes 21 years of age.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-4\">(2) <em>Court jurisdiction terminates when:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">(a) the proceedings are transferred to district court under 41-5-208 or an information is filed concerning the offense in district court pursuant to 41-5-206;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-6\">(b) the youth is discharged by the department; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-7\">(c) execution of a sentence is ordered under 41-5-1605(2)(b)(iii) and the supervisory responsibilities are transferred to the district court under 41-5-1605.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-8\">(3) The jurisdiction of the court over an extended jurisdiction juvenile, with respect to the offense for which the youth was convicted as an extended jurisdiction juvenile, extends until the offender becomes 25 years of age unless the court terminates jurisdiction before that date. [Emphases added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">\u00b610 After a youth is adjudicated, the youth court is authorized by \u00a7 41-5-208(1), MCA, upon motion of the youth or the county attorney, to \u201ctransfer jurisdiction to the district court and order the transfer of supervisory responsibility from juvenile probation services to adult probation services.\u201d Section 41-5-208(1), <em>MCA;Andersen-Conway, </em>\u00b6 15. The transfer \u201cmay be made at any time after a youth reaches 18 years of age but before the youth reaches 21 years of age,\u201d \u00a7 41-5-208(1), MCA, and must be preceded by a hearing. Section 41-5-208(2), MCA. The jurisdiction of district court over a case transferred from youth court for supervision purposes \u201cterminates when the youth reaches 25 years of age.\u201d Section 41-5-208(6), MCA; Andersen-Conway, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">\u00b611 J.A. was adjudicated delinquent by the Youth Court for committing unlawful activity prior to turning 18, and placed on probation for one year. Before J.A.\u2019s term of probation ended, the State filed a petition to revoke and transfer the case to district court. However, an order transferring the case was not issued before J.A. turned 21. Because no transfer occurred, the provisions of \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, which would have authorized supervisory jurisdiction in the district court over J.A. until age 25, are inapplicable. Neither was J.A.\u2019s case handled as an \u201cextended jurisdiction juvenile prosecution,\u201d under which jurisdiction is generally placed in the youth court until the youth reaches the age of 25. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 41-5-1602(2) and 41-5-205(3), MCA. Further, while J.A.\u2019s case was initially filed in district court, the case was transferred to the Youth Court and, thus, the jurisdictional provisions of \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, authorizing youths to be tried and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>sentenced in district court as adults, were not implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">\u00b612  Absent transfer from the youth court to the district court by one of these statutory mechanisms, \u00a7 41-5-205(1), MCA, provides that \u201cthe jurisdiction of the [youth] court continues <em>until the individual becomes 21 years of age.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Consistent therewith, \u00a7 41-5-208, MCA, under which transfer was sought in this case, provides that a transfer \u201cmay be made at any time after a youth reaches 18 years of age but before the youth reaches 21 years of age.\u201d Section 41-5-208(1), MCA. Under the plain wording of \u00a7 41-5-205, MCA, the Youth Court lost jurisdiction over J.A. when he turned 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">\u00b613 The State urges that we disregard the plain meaning of the statute to avoid the \u201cabsurd result of rewarding a youth who absconds after failing to comply with his probationary conditions.\u201d The Youth Court accepted the State\u2019s policy arguments, focusing on the implications of holding that jurisdiction was lost:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b46-6\">Under the Youth\u2019s rationale, any youth who has failed to comply with the terms of probation could escape the consequences of his or her wrongdoing by merely failing to show up for a transfer hearing under \u00a7 41-5-208(l)-(3), MCA, hiding out until the youth\u2019s 21st birthday, and then arguing the case must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Such an absurd result is contrary to the purposes of the Montana Youth Court Act, \u00a7 41-5-102, MCA, and general principles of justice, fairness and accountability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS\">Additionally, the court found persuasive the State\u2019s analogy to statutory provisions on adult revocation proceedings. Section 46-18-203(2), MCA, in contrast to the Youth Court Act, provides that \u201c[e]xpiration of the period of suspension or deferral after the petition [for revocation] is filed does not deprive the court of its jurisdiction to rule on the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">\u00b614  While we acknowledge that \u201c[statutory construction should not lead to an absurd result,\u201d <em>In re K.M.G., </em>2010 MT 81, \u00b6 26, 356 Mont. 91, 229 P.3d 1227, we cannot extend youth court jurisdiction beyond what the Legislature has clearly provided. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d); <em>State v. Otten, </em>2011 MT 83, \u00b6 16, 360 Mont. 144, 253 P.3d 834 (\u201cA statute is to be construed according to its plain meaning, and if the language is clear and unambiguous, no further interpretation is required.\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Stiffarm, </em>2011 MT 9, \u00b6 12, 359 Mont. 116, 250 P.3d 300). The Youth Court Act does not provide for continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>jurisdiction in youth court over revocation proceedings after a youth turns 21, even where a petition to transfer has previously been filed. The Legislature may choose to so extend youth court jurisdiction, but that is the province of the Legislature. <em>See e.g. Stiffarm, </em>\u00b6 14 (applying the plain meaning of \u00a7 46-18-203(2), MCA (2009), to require the State to file a petition to revoke an adult suspended or deferred sentence only \u201cduring\u201d the period of suspension or deferral, as stated in the statute at that time). We conclude the Youth Court erred in denying J.A.\u2019s motion. Accordingly, we reverse the Youth Court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AzF\">\u00b615 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b47-4\">JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS, NELSON and BAKER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-5\"> The State\u2019s absurdity argument apparently assumes that the District Court could not exercise jurisdiction over J.A. because a transfer had not taken place. Similarly, the basis for J.A.\u2019s motion to the Youth Court was the language of \u00a7 41-5-203(l), MCA, which provides for \u201cexclusive original jurisdiction\u201d in youth court for youth proceedings. We note that <em>State v. </em>Beach, 217 Mont. 132, 141-44, 705 P.2d 94, 99-102 (1985), and <em>State ex rel. Elliot v. District Court, </em>211 Mont. 1, 684 P.2d 481 (1984), addressed the existence of district corut jurisdiction over youth cases where no adjudication of the youth had occurred in youth court, and are not controlling here on issues raised by the parties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
