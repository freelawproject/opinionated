After trial, Torgerson filed a motion for the return of property seized during the investigation. The Ninth Judicial District Court, Toole County, denied his motion. Torgerson appeals. We affirm, addressing the following issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-25\">\u00b62 <em>Did the District Court err by denying Torgerson\u2019s motion for </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number><em>return of seized property?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b63 In February 2004, the Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (FWP) received information from Daisy Doane (Doane), Torgerson\u2019s former wife, concerning Torgerson\u2019s alleged unlawful killing of four whitetail buck deer over a period of several years. After obtaining warrants, game wardens and other law enforcement officers searched Torgerson\u2019s residence and family business. Two deer head mounts were seized from the business, and a set of velvet deer antlers and a head mount were seized from his residence. Also seized were a golden eagle skull and feathers from his residence, as well as numerous photographs of Torgerson posing with harvested deer. Torgerson was charged with Count I: Possession of Unlawfully Taken Wildlife, a felony, pertaining to the four deer mentioned above; and Count II: Unlawful Possession of Bird Parts, a misdemeanor. The State valued three of the deer at $500 each, pursuant to \u00a7 87-1-111, MCA, and the fourth as a trophy animal valued at $8,000, pursuant to \u00a7 87-1-115, MCA. In July 2006, a jury found Torgerson guilty of two misdemeanors: Possession of Unlawfully Killed Wildlife valued at $500.00;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Unlawful Possession of Bird Parts. The District Court sentenced Torgerson to consecutive six month suspended sentences on each of the two offenses, subject to conditions. Torgerson appealed and we affirmed, concluding, inter alia, that the evidence \u201cwould allow a rational trier of fact to find Torgerson guilty of unlawful possession of wildlife, beyond a reasonable doubt, of each of the four deer.\u201d <em>State v. Torgerson (Torgerson I), </em>2008 MT 303, \u00b6 55, 345 Mont. 532, 192 P.3d 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">\u00b64 After trial, Torgerson moved for the return of items seized during the investigation. The District Court ordered the return of all Torgerson\u2019s property which had <em>not </em>been introduced into evidence at trial. After Torgerson\u2019s appeal was initiated, the District Court concluded it had lost jurisdiction to rule on Torgerson\u2019s motion as to the property in evidence and ordered such property held by the clerk of court until further order by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">\u00b65 After Torgerson\u2019s convictions were affirmed, the State petitioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>the District Court for an order releasing trial exhibits 31-36 to the State. Exhibit 31 is a set of deer antlers in velvet, exhibits 32-34 are deer mounts, exhibit 35 consists of eagle feathers, and exhibit 36 is an eagle skull. The State claimed that the exhibits were parts of animals unlawfully taken. The District Court ordered all the exhibits released to the State, and FWP took possession of them. Torgerson had not been notified of the State\u2019s petition, and he filed a Notice of Pending Motion, seeking a ruling on his earlier filed motion for return of exhibits 31-34. He later sought a hearing. In February 2009, without hearing, the District Court denied Torgerson\u2019s motion for the return of exhibits 31-34. The District Court reasoned that it had already considered the seized evidence during Torgerson\u2019s sentencing and concluded that this Court in <em>Torgerson I </em>had found there was sufficient evidence to convict Torgerson of unlawfully possessing any of the four deer. Torgerson appealed, and this Court vacated the District Court\u2019s order, remanding for a hearing. <em>State v. Torgerson (Torgerson II), </em>2009 MT 402, 353 Mont. 463, 221 P.3d 1182. We reasoned that \u00a7 46-5-312(1), MCA, required a hearing to determine possession when a person claims a right to seized property. <em>Torgerson II, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">\u00b66 After remand, Torgerson filed a motion to join his brother, Aron, and Lloyd Torgerson, Inc. to his Motion for Return of Seized Items, arguing that Aron had legally killed the deer making up Exhibit 32 and that items had been seized from Lloyd Torgerson, Inc. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that while Aron and Lloyd Torgerson, Inc. should receive notice of the hearing, they did not need to be joined as parties because the case was a criminal proceeding against Torgerson only, and they had a right to be heard without becoming parties.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The required hearing was held in August 2010, at which one of the game wardens testified. The District Court again denied Torgerson\u2019s motion for the return of exhibits. Torgerson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">\u00b67 \u201cThe interpretation and construction of a statute is a matter of law which we review de novo to determine whether the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>interpretation and construction of the statute is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>2009 MT 452, \u00b6 6, 354 Mont. 329, 223 P.3d 874 (citations omitted). We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine if they are clearly erroneous. <em>Stevens v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., </em>2010 MT 282, \u00b6 24, 358 Mont. 474, 247 P.3d 244 (citation omitted). \u201cA finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by substantial evidence, the district court misinterpreted the evidence, or if we determine a mistake has been made upon review of the record.\u201d <em>State v. O\u2019Connor, </em>2009 MT 222, \u00b6 8, 351 Mont. 329, 212 P.3d 276 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">\u00b68 Section 46-5-312, MCA, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">(1) A person claiming the right to possession of property seized as evidence may apply to the judge for its return. The judge shall give written notice as the judge considers adequate to the prosecutor and all persons who have or may have an interest in the property and shall hold a hearing to determine the right to possession. (2) If the right to possession is established, the judge shall order the property, other than contraband, returned if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-8\">(a) the property is not needed as evidence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-9\">(b) the property is needed and satisfactory arrangements can be made for its return for subsequent use as evidence; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-10\">(c) all proceedings in which the property might be required have been completed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b254-11\">\u00b69 Applying this statute, the District Court noted that the issue was \u201cwhether a person has a \u2018right to possession of property seized as evidence\u2019 by the State.\u201d Torgerson asserts the District Court erred \u201cby creating a previously unheard of \u2018right to possession standard ....\u2019\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) However, the terms of the statute are clear. \u201c(1) A person claiming the <em>right to possession </em>of property seized as evidence may apply to the judge for its return. The judge ... shall hold a hearing to determine the <em>right to possession. </em>(2) If the <em>right to possession </em>is established....\u201d Section 46-5-312, MCA (emphases added). The statute clearly establishes a requirement that \u201cthe right to possession\u201d of seized evidence be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-12\">\u00b610 Torgerson next argues that the State must bear the burden of establishing that \u201cthe items sought ... should not be returned,\u201d referencing federal authority which has decided similar cases under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See e.g. U.S. v. Kaczynski, </em>416 F.3d 971, 974 (9th Cir. 2005) (a defendant is presumed to the return of seized property once that property is no longer needed as evidence, and the government bears the burden of proving that it has legitimate reason to retain the property). However, as the District Court noted, \u201cright to possession\u201d does not appear in Fed. R. Crim. P. 41(g). Section 46-5-312, MCA, provides a different process than Rule 41(g), and the federal cases decided thereunder are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">\u00b611 The statute provides that: \u201cA person <em>claiming </em>the right to possession of property seized as evidence may apply to the judge for its return.\u201d Section 46-5-312(1), MCA (emphasis added). <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>282 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 9th ed., West 2009) defines \u201cclaim\u201d to include a \u201cdemand for money, property, or a legal remedy to which one asserts a right.\u201d The Commission Comments to \u00a7 46-5-312, MCA, at 120 (2010 Annotations), state: \u201cThis section is intended to assist people whose property has been seized and held for extended periods without any fault on their part. It sets up machinery whereby <em>they can demand </em>and obtain the return of their property.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The clear inference of statutory terms and Commission Comments is that the burden of establishing possession is upon the person claiming the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">\u00b612 Generally, \u201c[t]he initial burden of producing evidence as to a particular fact is on the party who would be defeated if no evidence were given on either side.\u201d Section 26-1-401, MCA. \u201c[A] party has the burden of persuasion as to each fact the existence or nonexistence of which is essential to the claim for relief or defense the party is asserting.\u201d Section 26-1-402, MCA. \u201cUnder \u00a7 26-1-401, MCA, the party asserting a right in any case bears the burden of proving each of the material allegations of his or her cause of action.\u201d <em>Wiley v. Iverson, </em>1999 MT 214, \u00b6 20, 295 Mont. 511, 985 P.2d 1176 (citation omitted), <em>superseded by statute as stated in Wilkes v. Estate of Lawrence R. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number><em>Wilkes, </em>2001 MT 118, \u00b6\u00b6 19-22, 305 Mont. 335, 27 P.3d 433.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Our opinion in <em>Torgerson II </em>suggested that the burden of establishing the right to possession is on the individual requesting the property, as we remanded for \u201c[a] hearing at which Torgerson has an <em>opportunity to establish his right to possession </em>of the seized property....\u201d <em>Torgerson II, </em>\u00b6 13 (emphasis added). We thus conclude that \u00a7 46-5-312, MCA, places the burden of claiming and establishing right to possession of seized property upon the party requesting the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">\u00b613 Torgerson argues that release of the property is mandated by the jury verdict in several ways. He first argues that because the verdict form mentions \u201cwildlife\u201d and does not specify deer, \u201c[i]t is not at all clear that the unlawfully killed wildlife upon which the jury convicted Lin Torgerson was in fact a deer,\u201d raising the possibility that \u201call of the deer mounts would be properly returnable\u201d to him. However, not all of these deer mounts are available to Torgerson. At the hearing, Torgerson requested the return of Exhibits 33 and 34 to him and Exhibit 32 to Aron, but not Exhibit 31. Torgerson\u2019s decision to forego Exhibit 31 was discussed in the District Court\u2019s order, and we do not further entertain any contentions regarding that exhibit.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">\u00b614 Torgerson also asserts that, even if he was convicted of possessing unlawfully killed deer, the jury only \u201cconvicted him of possessing at most one such deer,\u201d due to the value of $500 set by the jury. Torgerson characterizes the jury verdict as failing to convict him on three of the deer mounts, and thus argues \u201c[tjhere is no legal or factual basis for forfeiture\u201d of those mounts. Torgerson further contends that since the jury set the value of animals illegally possessed at $500, he was \u201cacquitted\u201d of unlawfully killing the trophy deer, which would have been a felony and whose value was set by statute at $8,000. (Emphasis omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">\u00b615 While there may be cases in which a criminal verdict would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>conclusive to issues arising under this statute, the verdict here is not. On the Possession of Unlawfully Killed Wildlife charge, the special verdict form asked whether Torgerson was guilty or not guilty, and then only required the jury to determine the value of the illegally possessed animals, without specifying which animal or animals. As we stated in <em>Torgerson I, </em>\u201c[t]he special verdict form did not require the jury to specify the animal or animals as to which it might render a guilty verdict\u201d and \u201cwe cannot determine which animal the jury found Torgerson unlawfully possessed.\u201d <em>Torgerson I, </em>\u00b6 50. Application of the verdict here is a speculative exercise, which we decline to undertake.</p>\n<p id=\"Ace\">\u00b616 Torgerson argues that the District Court \u201cinvaded the province of the jury which had already decided that at least three of the Deer Mounts were lawfully possessed.\u201d (Emphasis omitted.) As indicated above, the criminal verdict is not conclusive as to which animal Torgerson was convicted of unlawfully possessing and, further, the statute provides that a judge will determine these issues. \u201cA person claiming the right to possession of property ... may apply to <em>thejudge </em>for its return,\u201d after which the <em>judge </em>shall give written notice to all those with an interest in the property and \u201cshall hold a hearing to determine the right to possession.\u201d Section 46-5-312(1), MCA (emphasis added). The District Court did not impermissibly invade the province of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">\u00b617 Similarly, Torgerson contends that the District Court improperly reweighed the evidence from trial. In making its decision, the District Court considered the principle that \u201c[i]f the animal is not taken and tagged lawfully its ownership remains in the state,\u201d pursuant to <em>State ex rel. Visser v. State Fish &amp; Game Comm\u2019n, </em>150 Mont. 525, 531, 437 P.2d 373, 376 (1968). The District Court considered all the trial evidence and hearing testimony presented by both Torgerson and the State. The District Court referenced Doane\u2019s testimony<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the Exhibit 32 mount had velvet scraped off its antlers, she witnessed Torgerson wound the deer with a rifle prior to rifle hunting season, she later saw pictures of the deer with an arrow through its neck, and Torgerson told her that he had scraped off the velvet. The District Court noted that the deer was in Torgerson\u2019s possession and he had photographs of it. The District Court accepted Doane\u2019s testimony over Aron\u2019s claims that he shot the deer with a bow. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>found that Exhibit 33 was a deer which Torgerson shot with a rifle while unlawfully using a spotlight before rifle season started-according to both Doane\u2019s testimony and her identification of the deer through photos seized from Torgerson, as well as Torgerson\u2019s admission on a videotape. As to Exhibit 34, the District Court found that this deer was killed by Torgerson with a rifle before rifle season. Doane was with Torgerson when they first spotted it, she saw it dead the next day, and Torgerson posed with it in photographs. The District Court referenced testimony which indicated all the deer had \u201chair not common during the hunting season.\u201d The District Court determined that Doane\u2019s testimony was more credible than Torgerson\u2019s and his family members\u2019 testimony, due to the other evidence which supported the unlawful taking of the deer.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">\u00b618  The District Court concluded that it \u201cheard all the evidence, saw all the exhibits, and finds that the three deer mounts which Defendant seeks were illegally taken and he is not entitled to their possession.\u201d We conclude there was substantial evidence supporting the District Court\u2019s determination that Torgerson had no right of possession to any of the exhibits he seeks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u00b619 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b258-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b252-8\"> The verdict form stated: \u201cTo the charge of Possession of Unlawfully-Killed Wildlife alleged to have been committed April 6, 2004\u201d; to which the jury foreperson wrote \u201cGuilty.\u201d The verdict form then stated: \u201cIf the verdict is \u2018Guilty,\u2019 the total value of the animals illegally possessed is\u201d; after which the jury foreperson wrote \u201c$500.00.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b253-7\"> Aron has also filed a Notice of Appeal, stating he was \u201cthe Defendant in that cause of action filed in the District Court of Toole County....\u201d However, as the District Court noted, Torgerson was the defendant in the criminal proceeding, not Aron. Further, while Torgerson\u2019s briefing references Aron\u2019s asserted involvement in shooting one of the deer, he does not challenge the District Court\u2019s denial of Aron\u2019s motion to be joined as a party.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b255-6\"> Fed.
