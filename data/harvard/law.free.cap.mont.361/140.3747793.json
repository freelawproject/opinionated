We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-14\">\u00b62 We review the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b167-15\">\u00b63 <em>Does the categorical denial of rehabilitation benefits to a workers\u2019 compensation claimant violate equal protection when the basis for denial turns solely on the claimant\u2019s age-based eligibility for social security benefits?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-16\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b167-17\">\u00b64 Harold Caldwell (Caldwell) worked as the Ravalli County airport <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>manager. On November 25,2005, he slipped on an icy airport taxiway, fell, and suffered traumatic head injuries. Caldwell was 77 years old at the time of his accident. The airport\u2019s insurer, MACo, accepted Caldwell\u2019s claim and paid his medical and wage-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b65 Caldwell has worked for 57 years of his life. He stopped working only due to his debilitating injury. Caldwell served in the U.S. Army for 25 years and retired with a full military pension at age 44. Caldwell worked in livestock ranching, resort management, and mining between the ages of 44 and 62. Caldwell began drawing social security retirement benefits at age 62. Caldwell continued working as a mining supervisor until age 74, when he began full-time employment as the Ravalli County airport manager. He earned more than $25,000 per year as the manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b66 Caldwell reached medical stability from his head injuries on February 11, 2008. He asked MACo at that point to initiate rehabilitation services under \u00a7 39-71-1006, MCA. Caldwell sought to gain training that would enable him to re-enter the workforce. MACo denied Caldwell rehabilitation benefits based on \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A1L\">\u00b67 Caldwell challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, on the basis that the statute\u2019s categorical termination of benefits based on a claimant\u2019s eligibility for social security violated equal protection principles. The WCC agreed. The WCC concluded that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, created two similarly situated classes and treated them disparately without being reasonably related to a legitimate government interest. MACo appeals the WCC\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b68 We review for correctness the WCC\u2019s conclusion of law that involves a constitutional issue. <em>Henry v. St. Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>1999 MT 126, \u00b6 10, 294 Mont. 449, 982 P.2d 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">\u00b69 <em>Does the categorical denial of rehabilitation benefits to a workers\u2019 compensation claimant violate equal protection when the basis for denial turns solely on the claimant\u2019s age-based eligibility for social security </em>benefits?</p>\n<p id=\"b168-10\">\u00b610 Section 39-71-710, MCA, deems \u201cretired\u201d any disabled worker eligible for social security retirement benefits. The statute eliminates permanent partial disability benefits, permanent total disability benefits, and rehabilitation benefits for those disabled workers deemed \u201cretired\u201d by operation of the statute. Section 39-71-710, MCA. Injured workers have challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>twice in the last seven years. <em>Reesor v. Mont. St. Fund, </em>2004 MT 370, 325 Mont. 1, 103 P.3d 1019; <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. Co., </em>2009 MT 368, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\">\u00b611 This Court held in <em>Reesor </em>that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, violated equal protection as to claimants who had been denied permanent partial disability benefits based solely on their eligibility for social security benefits. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 25. This Court held in <em>Satterlee, </em>in contrast, that the categorical elimination of permanent total disability benefits passed constitutional review based on the possibility that permanent total disability benefits could transform into a lifetime benefit. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28. Caldwell and MACo now present the Court with an equal protection challenge as to the third kind of benefit-rehabilitation benefits-categorically eliminated by \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b612 A worker injured on the job may recover rehabilitation benefits designed to return the disabled worker to work. Sections 39-71-1006, -1011(4), MCA. The statute limits to 104 weeks a disabled worker\u2019s right to receive rehabilitation benefits at the worker\u2019s temporary total disability rate. Section 39-71-1006(2), MCA. A disabled worker can receive additional costs for tuition, fees, books, and other retraining expenses. Section 39-71-1006(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u00b613 A disabled worker must see a rehabilitation provider and establish a rehabilitation plan in order to determine the worker\u2019s eligibility for rehabilitation benefits and in order to determine the extent of benefits available. Section 39-71-1006(l)(b)-(c), MCA. The disabled worker\u2019s rehabilitation plan must consider the worker\u2019s \u201cage, education, training, work history, residual physical capacities, and vocational interests.\u201d Section 39-71-1006(l)(c), MCA. A disabled worker who seeks rehabilitation benefits must have a rehabilitation provider certify that the disabled worker has \u201creasonable vocational goals and reasonable reemployment opportunity.\u201d Section 39-71-1006(l)(b), MCA. Caldwell would have been entitled to seek rehabilitation benefits subject to the qualifications in \u00a7 39-71-1006, MCA, similar to any younger worker disabled on the job, but for the categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits for older workers in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b614 Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he dignity of the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Equal protection provides a check on governmental action that treats similarly situated persons in an unlike manner. <em>Oberson v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., </em>2007 MT 293, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 339 Mont. 519, 171 P.3d 715; <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 15. We follow a three-step process to analyze an equal protection claim. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>\u00b615 <em>1. Whether the challenged statute creates similarly situated classes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">\u00b616 We first consider whether the governmental action creates classes of similarly situated persons and treats them in an unequal manner. <em>Id. </em>The parties concede, and we agree, that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, creates two similarly situated classes and treats them differently. As the WCC concluded, the classes consist of (1) those vocational rehabilitation eligible claimants who are eligible to receive social security retirement benefits, and (2) those who are not eligible. <em>See Reesor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10, 12; <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">\u00b617 Amicus Montana State Fund (MSF) argues that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, does not create two similarly situated classes. MSF agrees that the statute creates two classes, but argues that those classes consist of persons \u201cin\u201d the workforce and persons \u201cout\u201d of the workforce. MSF argues that those \u201cin\u201d the workforce cannot be situated similarly to those \u201cout\u201d of the workforce. MSF\u2019s argument misses the mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">\u00b618 Caldwell challenges \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, precisely because it deems him \u201cout\u201d of the workforce based solely on his age-defined eligibility for social security benefits. We reject here, as we did in <em>Reesor </em>and <em>Satterlee, </em>amicus MSF\u2019s argument that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, does not create similarly situated classes. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-12; <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 16. Section 39-71-710, MCA, creates two classes out of similarly situated claimants who have suffered work-related injuries, could not return to their former jobs, had permanent physical impairment ratings, and must rely on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as their exclusive remedy. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 16. Caldwell and MACo correctly assess that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, creates two classes out of similarly situated persons, distinguished only by the age-based deemed \u201cretired\u201d provision of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u00b619 We do not operate on a blank slate regarding the appropriate classification for our equal protection analysis. <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 19. We begin by considering \u201cthe statute\u2019s purpose in order to determine the threshold question of whether the statute created a discriminatory classification-i.e. a classification that treats two or more similarly situated groups in an unequal manner.\u201d <em>Oberson, </em>\u00b6 19. As we concluded in Reesor and <em>Satterlee, </em>age represents \u201cthe only identifiable distinguishing factor between the two classes\u201d created by \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 12; <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 16. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d as this Court stated <em>in Reesor, </em>\u201cchronological age and the corresponding eligibility for social security retirement benefits is unrelated to a person\u2019s ability to engage in meaningful employment.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u00b620 <em>2. The appropriate level of constitutional scrutiny.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u00b621 We next determine the level of scrutiny to apply to the challenged legislation. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 13. The parties have not asked the Court to apply a stricter standard of review than rational basis. The parties dispute only the third step of the equal protection analysis which considers whether the challenged governmental action passes constitutional scrutiny, in this case, rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">\u00b622 3. <em>Evaluating this constitutional challenge under rational basis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A4r\">\u00b623 Rational basis requires that \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, bear a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 18. We recently have considered the governmental interests underlying \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, in <em>Reesor </em>and <em>Satterlee. Reesor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17-24; <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u00b624 The claimant in <em>Reesor </em>had turned age 65 and had begun receiving social security retirement benefits about eight months before his work-related injury. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3. The claimant, Dale Reesor, received temporary total disability benefits and an impairment award from his employer\u2019s insurer, MSF. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 4. MSF denied the claimant permanent partial disability benefits, however, based on the categorical elimination of such benefits in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">\u00b625 A permanent partial disability exists if a worker has a permanent impairment of the worker\u2019s ability to work that causes actual wage loss, but does not preclude the worker from returning to work in some capacity. Section 39-71-116(24), MCA. Montana law limits permanent partial disability benefits to a period of 375 weeks and to a percentage of the worker\u2019s lost wages. Section 39-71-703, MCA. Reesor challenged the fact that the statute allows the award of permanent partial disability benefits to younger workers, but denies them to older workers deemed \u201cretired\u201d based on social security eligibility. Reesor claimed that this disparate treatment violated his right to equal protection. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. The Court agreed and concluded that no rational basis existed to award permanent partial disability benefits to a 45-year-old injured worker, but to deny those same benefits to a 65-year-old worker with an identical injury. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\u00b626 The Court stated broadly that \u201cno rational basis\u201d existed \u201cto deny a class of injured workers a category of benefits based upon their age.\u201d <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 23. The Court departed from this broad statement in <em>Satterlee. </em>The Court concluded in <em>Satterlee </em>that the categorical age-based elimination of permanent total disability benefits in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, rationally related to the legitimate governmental interest of providing wage-loss benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u00b627 The claimants in <em>Satterlee </em>had suffered work-related injuries for which they received permanent total disability benefits. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 5. An injured worker has a permanent total disability if the worker\u2019s injury has foreclosed the worker\u2019s reasonable prospect of physically performing regular employment. Section 39-71-116(25), MCA. A worker with a permanent total disability must be paid permanent total disability benefits for the duration of the worker\u2019s permanent total disability. Section 39-71-702(1), MCA. The <em>Satterlee </em>claimants\u2019 award of benefits terminated upon becoming eligible for social security benefits pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 5. The claimants challenged the categorical elimination of permanent total disability benefits on equal protection grounds. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. The Court concluded that \u201cit is rational for the workers\u2019 compensation system to terminate [permanent total disability] benefits at a time when, statistically, most people\u2019s work-lives have ended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">\u00b628 <em>Reesor </em>concluded that the categorical elimination in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, violated equal protection, while <em>Satterlee </em>concluded that it survived constitutional review. <em>Satterlee </em>did not overrule <em>Reesor </em>or signify some new path upon which this Court would embark in our equal protection jurisprudence. The Court\u2019s dispositions instead turned on the differences between the purposes and entitlement schemes of the varying kinds of benefits. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 27. The Court determined that \u201cPPD benefits and PTD benefits serve very different purposes and employ very different entitlement schemes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court further explained that the \u201cdifference between the timeframes over which PPD and PTD benefits are meant to serve\u201d constituted the critical distinction for purposes of the equal protection analysis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\u00b629 The Court in <em>Satterlee </em>did not even \u201cequate <em>Reesor </em>with the case at bar.\u201d Id. The Court concluded that each class of benefits was \u201csimply too different and serve[s] such divergent purposes that equating\u201d them would be inappropriate. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24. Permanent partial disability benefits serve the purpose of restoring a claimant to a pre-accident wage level by providing wage-loss benefits, but only for 375 weeks. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 23; \u00a7 39-71-703, MCA. Permanent total disability benefits serve to assist a disabled worker who cannot ever return to work for the duration of his or her injury. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 23; \u00a7 39-71-702, MCA. The court focused on the fact that permanent total disability benefits did not \u201cterminate after a limited number of weeks,\u201d but assisted \u201cthe worker over the course of his or her work life.\u201d <em>Satterlee, \u00b6 </em>27. As a result, the Court determined that the age-based categorical elimination in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, constituted a \u201csufficiently rational means of ensuring that PTD benefits [did] not become a lifetime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>benefit.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 27-28. The Court recognized the legitimate governmental interest in not allowing permanent total disability-benefits to \u201crun on until the claimant\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\">\u00b630 Montana law limits a worker\u2019s eligibility for rehabilitation benefits, like the limitation for permanent partial disability benefits, to a set number of weeks. Section 39-71-1006, MCA. A disabled worker can receive rehabilitation benefits for a maximum of 104 weeks. <em>Id. </em>No risk exists that rehabilitation benefits could \u201crun on until the claimant\u2019s death\u201d or transform into a \u201clifetime benefit.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"AlG\">\u00b631 In addition to considering the entitlement scheme of rehabilitation benefits, we must consider the purposes served by rehabilitation benefits. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 27. We already have concluded that \u00a7 39-71-105(3), MCA, provides the policy statement for the state\u2019s interest underlying rehabilitation benefits. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 39. Section 39-71-105(3), MCA, sets forth the policy of the workers\u2019 compensation system \u201cto return a worker to work as soon as possible.\u201d The statute recognizes that a work-related injury \u201chas a negative impact on the worker, the worker\u2019s family, the employer, and the general public.\u201d Section 39-71-105(3), MCA. Rehabilitation benefits advance this stated policy by setting the worker on a rehabilitation plan that assists the worker \u201cin acquiring skills or aptitudes to return to work\u201d and \u201creasonably reduce[] the worker\u2019s actual wage loss.\u201d Section 39-71-1011(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AIq\">\u00b632 Critical differences exist among the entitlement schemes and purposes underlying rehabilitation benefits, permanent partial disability benefits, and permanent total disability benefits. These differences guide our analysis as to whether the categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, violates equal protection. We turn to consider the governmental interests underlying \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, and whether the categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits for older workers rationally relates to those interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">\u00b633 <em>a. Legitimate governmental interests served by \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A00\">\u00b634 Cost containment of the workers\u2019 compensation system presents a legitimate governmental interest. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 29. The legislature often pursues its interest in controlling the costs of the workers\u2019 compensation system. <em>Id. </em>These pursuits lie within constitutional authority so long as the legislature\u2019s attempts to improve the viability of the workers\u2019 compensation system follow rational means and so long as \u201ccost containment is not the sole reason for disparate treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the Court permitted otherwise, \u201ccost containment\u201d alone could justify nearly every legislative enactment without regard for the guarantee for equal protection of the law. <em>Henry, </em>\u00b6 40 (citing <em>Heisler </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number><em>v. Hines Motor Co., </em>282 Mont. 270, 283, 937 P.2d 45, 52 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b635 The Court in <em>Henry </em>recognized that cost-control alone cannot justify disparate treatment that \u201cviolates an individual\u2019s right to equal protection of the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Not surprisingly, discrimination in the form of \u201coffering services to some while excluding others for any arbitrary reason, will <em>always </em>result in lower costs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must scrutinize attempts to disguise violations of equal protection as legislative attempts to \u201ccontain the costs\u201d or \u201cimprove the viability\u201d of the worker\u2019s compensation system. Cost alone does not justify the disparate treatment of similar classes. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b636 The WCC concluded that \u00a7 39-71-105(3), MCA, sets forth the public policy for rehabilitation benefits and that terminating rehabilitation benefits \u201c[flew] in the face of this stated legislative objective.\u201d MACo faults the WCC for focusing solely on the policy statement in \u00a7 39-71-105(3), MCA. We agree insofar as \u00a7 39-71-105(3), MCA, provides the policy statement for providing rehabilitation benefits, as opposed to the policy statement for the elimination of rehabilitation benefits in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. Caldwell has challenged the constitutionality of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. The WCC correctly looked to the policy statement in \u00a7 39-71-105(3), MCA, however, to consider whether the categorical elimination in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, rationally relates to the governmental interests served by rehabilitation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"AdQ\">\u00b637 MACo and amicus MSF argue that several additional legitimate governmental interests, independent of the interest in cost-containment, support the categorical elimination. MACo argues that the legislature has a legitimate interest in (1) creating a wage replacement system, (2) assisting the worker at a reasonable cost to the employer, (3) controlling the costs of the workers\u2019 compensation program in order to continue providing benefits, and (4) avoiding duplication or overlapping of benefits. Amicus MSF adds that the legislature has a legitimate interest in (5) providing wage-loss benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost, (6) creating reasonably constant rates for employers, and (7) tailoring benefit entitlement to need. We address these purported interests in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"AKB\">\u00b638  First we conclude that the governmental interest in creating a wage replacement system bears little relevance in the context of rehabilitation benefits. Section 39-71-105(1), MCA, sets forth the governmental interest in creating a wage replacement system. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6 18. A related legitimate governmental interest exists in providing wage-loss benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual lost wages. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 30-31. Rehabilitation benefits do not replace lost wages, however, and should be distinguished from the wage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>replacement system at issue in <em>Reesor </em>and <em>Satterlee. </em>A disabled worker like Caldwell could receive temporary total disability, permanent total disability, permanent partial disability, or temporary partial disability benefits to replace his or her lost wages. Sections 39-71-701 to -703, - 712, MCA. In contrast, rehabilitation benefits, like medical benefits, disfigurement benefits, or funeral benefits, do not replace lost wages. Sections 39-71-704, -708, -725, MCA. The elimination of rehabilitation benefits cannot be understood as serving, or even relating to, the governmental interest in creating a wage-replacement system that bears a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost. We finally note that MACo accepted and paid Caldwell\u2019s medical and wage-loss benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b639 We similarly reject the notion that the governmental interest in providing reasonably constant rates to employers will be served by the categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits. Section 39-71-105(4), MCA, contains the policy statement about \u201creasonably constant rates.\u201d That policy statement relates to the interest in creating a \u201cprimarily self-administering\u201d workers\u2019 compensation system that \u201cminimize[s] reliance upon lawyers and the courts.\u201d Section 39-71-105(4), MCA. We specifically reject the suggestion that the categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits serves to provide reasonably constant rates. Eliminating rehabilitation benefits for older workers might constantly lower rates, but that interest simply duplicates the cost-containment interest already discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b640 We also have recognized that \u201cassisting the worker at a reasonable cost to the employer\u201d presents a legitimate governmental interest in equal protection claims. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 30. We disagree that eliminating rehabilitation benefits relates to assisting the worker at a reasonable cost to the employer. We particularly reject the argument that \u201creasonable cost to the employer\u201d always means \u201clower cost to the employer.\u201d Such an argument does not constitute a legitimate governmental interest separate from the cost-containment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"ACx\">\u00b641 MACo argues that avoiding the duplication or overlapping of benefits serves as a reasonable and permissive legislative objective. MACo argues that it would be irrational to allow claimants to receive both social security and rehabilitation benefits. We rejected this argument in <em>Reesor </em>when we pointed out that no coordination of benefits exists between the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the social security system. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-24. Caldwell\u2019s social security benefits will not provide him with resources to receive rehabilitation benefits that will return him to work after being disabled on the job as an employee for the Ravalli County airport. The Dissent elevates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>generalized statements of the law from <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>and the Kentucky Supreme Court above decisions of this Court. <em>Dissent, </em>\u00b6 68. We addressed the same \u201cduplication of benefits\u201d argument in <em>Reesor. Reesor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-24.

The Dissent fails to show how a person\u2019s social security income \u201coffset[s]\u201d the categorical denial of rehabilitation benefits for older workers. Moreover, the Dissent makes no effort to explain why rehabilitation benefits should be treated like the permanent total disability benefit in <em>Satterlee </em>rather than the permanent partial disability benefit in <em>Reesor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b643  MACo cites <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln Co., </em>259 Mont. 147, 154, 855 P.2d 506, 511 (1993), for the argument that a legitimate governmental interest exists to control costs <em>in order to </em>continue providing benefits. MACo\u2019s argument misrepresents the actual statements in <em>Stratemeyer </em>that identified \u201ccontrolling the costs of the program and providing benefits\u201d as a legitimate governmental interest. We know of no authority to support the argument that the legislature can eliminate benefits from one class of people <em>in order to </em>continue providing benefits to another class of similarly situated people.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b644 We likewise reject amicus MSF\u2019s \u201ctailoring benefit entitlement to need\u201d argument. MSF cites no authority for its tailoring argument, except two paragraphs out of <em>Satterlee. </em>Those paragraphs do not recognize a \u201ctailoring\u201d interest or any additional legitimate governmental interest not already discussed. We reject the suggestion that the legislature constitutionally can eliminate rehabilitation benefits for older workers so as to \u201ctailor\u201d or provide benefits to those in \u201cneed,\u201d which presumably means younger workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b645 Immediately beneath the surface of MACo\u2019s and MSF\u2019s \u201cbest allocation\u201d and \u201ctailoring\u201d arguments lurks the belief that society should not rehabilitate older people because the return on the investment may not be as high. This bias also permeates the Dissent\u2019s reasoning that the legislature may \u201callocate resources toward those who, statistically speaking, will use them,\u201d <em>Dissent, </em>\u00b6 67, and that \u201cthe legislature may reasonably determine that retraining is most important for those workers with a long work life ahead of them and may channel resources toward that group of workers.\u201d <em>Dissent, </em>\u00b6 71.</p>\n<p id=\"AIf\">\u00b646 The Dissent\u2019s approach would permit the legislature to provide benefits unequally to similarly situated persons so long as \u201cempirical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>evidence\u201d or statistics supported the legislature\u2019s decision. We reject the notion that the legislature acts rationally when it categorically withholds benefits from a similarly situated minority group because, \u201cstatistically speaking,\u201d most people\u2019s work life ends upon eligibility for social security. <em>Dissent, </em>\u00b6 65. The statistical majority holds no monopoly on equal protection guarantees.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b647 The Dissent\u2019s reasoning begs the question of whether the constitutional right to equal protection hinges on the most recent labor statistics of the working elderly or on Congress\u2019s decision to raise the age eligibility of the social security system. Our equal protection analysis does not allow the legislature to violate the equal protection rights of those persons who, statistically speaking, represent the minority of persons who must continue working at ages beyond eligibility for social security because they could not otherwise provide for themselves or their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b648  MACo and MSF have argued that several legitimate governmental interests exist in addition to the legitimate governmental interest in cost-containment of the workers\u2019 compensation system. The other interests they have offered either (1) duplicate the cost-containment interest or (2) bear no relation to the elimination of rehabilitation benefits in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. \u201cCost alone is insufficient to justify the disparate treatment of similar classes.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 29.

We agree that categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits in \u00a739-71-710, MCA, based solely on age-defined eligibility for social security, does not rationally relate to any legitimate governmental interest. <em>Reesor, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 23. Eligibility for social security benefits bears no rational relationship to a worker\u2019s ability or willingness to return to work. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12.

Caldwell served the workforce for 15 years <em>after </em>becoming eligible to draw social security benefits and for 33 years <em>after </em>\u201cretirement\u201d from the U.S. Army. Caldwell\u2019s entitlement to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>rehabilitation benefits will be limited by consideration of his age, residual physical capacities, and vocational interests. Section 39-71-1006(l)(c), MCA. A rational basis does not support the categorical elimination of rehabilitation benefits in \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA. Section 39-71-710, MCA, violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Montana Constitution insofar as it deems disabled workers ineligible to receive rehabilitation benefits based on their eligibility for social security benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b652 We affirm the judgment of the WCC.</p>\n<judges id=\"b178-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b178-6\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"A7F\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b653 I concur in the Court\u2019s Opinion. I write separately to dispel the notion inherent in the cost containment arguments of MACo and amicus MSF that giving older workers the opportunity to receive rehabilitation benefits will lead to an explosion of costs. This concern is largely unwarranted, as the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act has in place a cost containment measure that will account for the age and capacity of the injured worker in determining whether and to what extent such benefits will be available.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b654 As the Court points out at \u00b6 13, a worker is not eligible for rehabilitation benefits unless he or she meets the definition of a disabled worker, and a rehabilitation provider designated by the insurer has certified that the worker has reasonable vocational goals and reasonable reemployment opportunity. Sections 39-71-1006(l)(a)-(b), MCA. A rehabilitation plan must be prepared and agreed to by the parties. It must take account of the worker\u2019s age, education, training, work history, residual physical capacities, and vocational interests. Section 39-71-1006(l)(c), MCA. This system is designed to and does limit the number of persons eligible for rehabilitation benefits and the amount of benefits available. Presumably, the system will continue to function the same way once older workers become eligible for benefits; indeed, there is a likelihood that it will screen a large number of older applicants out of the system if the rehabilitation provider concludes that the older worker-for any or all of the reasons noted above-does not have reasonable reemployment opportunities.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b655 Caldwell and other older workers will not be guaranteed rehabilitation benefits by virtue of our decision; they will simply be guaranteed the same right to seek such benefits as is enjoyed by a younger worker disabled on the job. This is the essence of equal protection. I therefore concur with the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>JUSTICE NELSON joins in the Concurrence of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b179-4\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"ATh\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b656 I concur with the Court\u2019s decision. While the Opinion correctly discusses <em>Satterlee v. Lumberman\u2019s Mut. Cas. </em>Co., 2009 MT 368, 353 Mont. 265, 222 P.3d 566, as the present state of the law, I continue to disagree -with our decision in that case. <em>See Satterlee, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-56 (Morris &amp; Nelson, JJ., dissenting). If nothing else, the Court\u2019s Opinion here points up the unfairness, fallibility, and illogic of \u201cstatistical\u201d retirement ages. <em>See </em>Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b657 In point of fact, workers are living longer, and, of necessity, many have to work past their \u201cstatistical\u201d retirement ages in order to provide the basic necessities of life for themselves and their families. Neither wages nor Social Security has even remotely kept pace with inflation and the rising prices of basic consumer goods, food, and healthcare. Grandparents are raising their grandchildren and may have their own out-of-work children living with them. Defined benefit pension plans are a thing of the past outside government employment, and any notion that ordinary working people can save enough to actually retire without working is a fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">\u00b658 Indeed, given the graying of America, our country\u2019s declining birth rates, and an economy that just never seems to \u201ctrickle down\u201d to ordinary working people,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it is completely illogical and without rational basis to deny an injured worker compensation or benefits on the basis of the person\u2019s \u201cstatistical\u201d retirement age. If the Legislature is sold on statistics, I suggest it is using the wrong ones.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u00b659 As support for its argument, the Dissent cites cases in which we have said that a classification is reasonable if \u201cany reasonably conceivable state of facts\u201d provides a rational basis for it, <em>Kottel v. State, </em>2002 MT 278, \u00b6 55, 312 Mont. 387, 60 P.3d 403, and that the purpose of the challenged legislation may be \u201cany possible purpose of which the court can conceive,\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 34 (internal quotation marks omitted). Admittedly these standards have been in our caselaw for some time now. <em>See e.g. Johnson v. Sullivan, </em>174 Mont. 491, 498-99, 571 P.2d 798, 802 (1977); <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County, </em>259 Mont. 147, 152, 855 P.2d 506, 509-10 (1993). Nevertheless, upon reflection, I cannot agree with the proposition that rational-basis review involves our imagining possible reasons or purposes for an enactment. For one thing, why should <em>we </em>be searching for reasons and purposes to support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the challenged legislation? That is not only arbitrary on our part, but also intrudes upon the Legislature\u2019s duty to craft constitutional laws. Furthermore, this approach does not fulfill rational-basis scrutiny. \u201cRational\u201d means based on correct and valid reasoning and logic. <em>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language </em>1029, 1452 (4th ed., Houghton Mifflin 2000). The legislative classification, in other words, must bear a logical and reasoned relationship to a specific and legitimate purpose. Simply because we might conceive of some purpose that the legislation could theoretically serve under some hypothetical set of facts in no way establishes that the legislation is rationally related to the particular purpose for which it was enacted. In my view, the \u201cany conceivable purpose/reason\u201d approach is flawed and should be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b660 Finally, the Dissent also argues that public policy determinations are the domain of the Legislature and that this Court must give deference to the Legislature\u2019s policy choices. Our deference, however, is not boundless when legislation is challenged as violative of the Constitution. Deference does not mean abdication, and \u201crational-basis scrutiny\u201d is still scrutiny. It is, in point of fact, this Court\u2019s obligation here to review the Legislature\u2019s specific implementation of its policy choices and determine whether the legislation at issue bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. It does not bear that relationship, for the reasons stated in the Court\u2019s Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b661 I accordingly concur in our decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> Although, the benefits and rewards of the economy always seem to percolate up.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b180-6\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"AF\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\u00b662 As we often have observed, every objective in favor of the constitutionality of a state statute must be presumed. In reviewing the constitutionality of state laws, the question is \u201cnot whether it is possible to condemn, but whether it is possible to uphold the legislative action[.]\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Powell v. State Compen. Ins. Fund, </em>2000 MT 321, \u00b6 13, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877). These principles must be honored by the courts even in cases where we may think the legislature could have devised a better system to fulfill its purposes. Particularly when considering an equal protection challenge to legislative enactments of economic and social regulations, courts must give deference to the legislature\u2019s policy choices unless their infirmity is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If there is \u201cany reasonably conceivable state of facts\u201d to support a legislative classification, its decision is entitled to respect. <em>Kottel v. State, </em>2002 MT 278, \u00b6 55, 312 Mont. 387, 60 P.3d 403. The Court\u2019s review is not confined to those purposes espoused by the legislature, litigants, or the district court, but extends to \u201cany possible purpose of which the court can conceive.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 34. This standard reflects the courts\u2019 awareness \u201cthat the drawing of lines that create distinctions is peculiarly a legislative task and an unavoidable one.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, </em>427 U.S. 307, 314, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 2567 (1976) (per curiam). \u201cThe legislature is simply in a better position to develop the direction of economic regulation, social and health issues.\u201d <em>Stratemeyer, </em>259 Mont, at 153, 855 P.2d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b663 We look frequently to the federal courts for guidance in applying the constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal protection of the law. <em>See e.g. Powder River County v. State, </em>2002 MT 259, \u00b6 79, 312 Mont. 198, 60 P.3d 357; <em>Stratemeyer, </em>259 Mont. at 152, 855 P.2d at 509; <em>Butte Community Union v. Lewis, </em>219 Mont. 426, 431, 712 P.2d 1309, 1312 (1986). Age-based distinctions long have been upheld against equal protection challenges where the age classification is rationally related to a legitimate state interest, despite imperfection in the state\u2019s determinations or even empirical evidence that its line-drawing is subject to dispute. \u201cUnder the Fourteenth Amendment, a State may rely on age as a proxy for other qualities, abilities, or characteristics that are relevant to the State\u2019s legitimate interests.\u201d <em>Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 84, 120 S. Ct. 631, 646 (2000). It is not uncommon that such challenges are brought against laws restricting employment opportunities for workers over a certain age. <em>Gregory v. Ashcroft, </em>501 U.S. 452, 111 S. Ct. 2395 (1991); <em>Vance v. Bradley, </em>440 U.S. 93, 99 S. Ct. 939 (1979); <em>Murgia. </em>\u201cOur Constitution permits States to draw lines on the basis of age when they have a rational basis for doing so at a class-based level, <em>even if it \u2018is probably not </em>true\u2019 <em>that those reasons are valid in the majority of </em>cases.\u201d <em>Kimel, </em>528 U.S. at 86, 120 S. Ct. at 647 (emphasis added). Recognizing that \u201ceven improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic process,\u201d Vance, 440 U.S. at 97, 99 S. Ct. at 942, it is not the Court\u2019s province to overturn legislative enactments we believe to be unwise or outdated by evolving societal circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b664 In <em>Satterlee, </em>we relied on the simple truth that \u201cwhen an individual is considered retired, they have, by definition, ended their work life[,]\u201d to uphold the constitutionality of terminating wage-loss benefits intended to bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 27. Despite the presence of illogical and unfair results as applied to some workers, we affirmed the rationality of using eligibility for social security benefits-based primarily on age-as a line of demarcation, in order to target limited workers\u2019 compensation resources toward those who are still considered of working age. We stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>With the statutory intent of \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, in mind, it is rational for the workers\u2019 compensation system to terminate [permanent total disability] benefits at a time when, statistically, most people\u2019s work-lives have ended. While this may not always seem fair, it is not unconstitutional. By acting to terminate benefits as it does, \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, rationally advances the governmental purpose of providing wage-loss benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to actual wages lost.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b665 Our decision today cannot be reconciled with this clear pronouncement of the constitutionality of targeting wage-loss benefits toward those workers who, statistically speaking, are not yet at the end of their work life. The majority states that rehabilitation benefits \u201cdo not replace lost wages[.]\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 38. Clearly, though, vocational rehabilitation benefits are part of the wage-loss benefit provided by the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. By offering a means to facilitate an injured worker\u2019s return to the workforce, vocational rehabilitation benefits serve the objective of reducing overall wage loss. The law specifically defines a vocational rehabilitation plan as a plan that \u201creasonably reduces the worker\u2019s actual wage loss.\u201d Section 39-71-1011(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b666 In drawing a parallel between the temporary <em>availability </em>of vocational rehabilitation benefits and the permanent partial disability benefits at issue in <em>Reesor, </em>the majority misses the mark. As we recognized in <em>Satterlee, </em>the rational basis determination turns on the <em>purpose </em>of the benefits. <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 23. Whatever the duration of the actual payments to the worker, there can be no dispute that rehabilitation benefits, like the benefits upheld in <em>Satterlee, </em>are intended to provide assistance throughout a worker\u2019s full work life-in this case, by training the worker for sustained employment in a new field when injuries have foreclosed continued employment in a previous field. Like education, the real benefits from rehabilitation training begin upon graduation, when the newly-trained student or worker can put his or her new skills to use. In contrast, the permanent partial disability benefits considered in <em>Reesor </em>are designed \u201cto restore the claimant to a pre-accident wage level for a limited amount of time.\u201d <em>Satterlee, </em>\u00b6 23 (citing <em>Rausch v.

This is no more a mere cost-containment measure than our tax code is a mere revenue-generating measure-each unmistakably reflects a wide variety of policy choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b668 \u201cWage-loss legislation is designed to restore to the worker ... wages lost due to the three major causes of wage-loss: physical disability, economic unemployment, and old age.\u201d 9 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, <em>Larson\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law </em>\u00a7 157.01 (rev. ed., Matthew Bender 2000). As such, the constitutionality of state laws like \u00a7 39-71-710, MCA, that offset workers\u2019 compensation by federal social security benefits \u201chas, for the most part, been upheld, as against both equal protection and impairment-of-contract attacks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 157.03[5][b] (citing cases). <em>See generally McDowell v.

Yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>individualized testing is not constitutionally required, even if it would result in a more precise determination of eligibility. <em>Murgia, </em>427 U.S. at 316, 96 S. Ct. at 2568.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b671 The Court does not dispute that age may be a consideration in determining a worker\u2019s eligibility for rehabilitation benefits. Opinion, \u00b6 51 (citing \u00a7 39-71-1006(l)(c), MCA) and \u00b6 54 (Cotter, J., concurring) (same). That acknowledgement answers the rational basis inquiry and requires the statute to be upheld. There is legitimacy in targeting rehabilitation benefits toward those who are, by constitutionally-permissible definition, not retired. That the legislature found additional means to tailor vocational rehabilitation plans to account for age and other factors does not mean its decision to set an age-based limit on such benefits is irrational. Given the unquestioned legitimacy of the State\u2019s interest in providing benefits that bear a reasonable relationship to wage loss, the legislature reasonably may determine that retraining is most important for those workers with a long work life ahead of them and may channel resources toward that group of workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b672 The majority and concurring opinions make a forceful public policy argument for extending benefits to those who continue working after reaching social security eligibility, but that is the domain of a different branch of government. \u201cWhether or not individual judges may agree with [the legislature\u2019s] assessment, it is not for the courts to reject it.\u201d <em>Vance, </em>440 U.S. at 106, 99 S. Ct. at 947. While the statute in question may not survive a more heightened level of scrutiny, our review here is confined to rational basis. Under that test, the statute should be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b673 I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b184-7\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion of JUSTICE BAKER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
