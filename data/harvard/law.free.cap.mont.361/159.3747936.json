We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it terminated J.A.\u2019sparental rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the District Court violated J.A.\u2019s due process rights when the court refused J.A.\u2019s request to cross-examine the guardian ad litem at the termination hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">\u00b65 R.M.T.\u2019s mother, K.T. (Mother), abused or neglected him most of his life. R.M.T.\u2019s biological father, J.A. (Father), left Mother before R.M.T.\u2019s birth. Father lives in Vermont.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">\u00b66 R.M.T. lived in Laurel, Montana, with Mother. Father claims that he did not know that he had a son until 2005 when the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services, Child and Family Services Division (Department) first garnished his wages for child support. R.M.T. was approximately eleven years old at that time. Father continued to pay child support. Father also provided R.M.T. with health insurance from 2005 through 2010 when the District Court terminated his parental rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">\u00b67 Mother called Father in 2007 to tell him R.M.T. had been hospitalized after an accident. Father still had no contact with R.M.T. until the Department began proceedings to adjudicate R.M.T. a youth in need of care in 2008. Father claims that he could not locate R.M.T. until that time. Father also admits, however, that he did not attempt to get any contact information from Mother when she called him in 2007 about R.M.T.\u2019s accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-18\">\u00b68 R.M.T. was fourteen when he first met Father in 2008. R.M.T. and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>Father spent several days together in Montana. Father visited R.M.T. in Montana one other time when he returned in 2010 for the hearing to adjudicate Father\u2019s parental rights. R.M.T. was sixteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The Adjudication of R.M.T. as a \u201cYouth in Need of Care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AA\">\u00b69 The State charged mother with partner or family member assault of R.M.T. in 2007. R.M.T. moved in with Conn and Debra Hellebust (Hellebusts) on a farm outside of Havre while Mother spent time incarcerated. Hellebusts\u2019 son, Kane, had dated Mother. R.M.T. thinks of Kane as his Father. R.M.T. considers Hellebusts his grandparents even though they are not biologically related to him. R.M.T. spent one school year with Hellebusts before returning home to Laurel with Mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b610 R.M.T. went to the Yellowstone County Attorney\u2019s office for help shortly after returning to Mother\u2019s home in Laurel in July of 2008. R.M.T. feared that Mother\u2019s abuse would continue. R.M.T. had just turned fourteen. R.M.T. reported Mother often would return home drunk and that she had hit him in the past. A social worker with the Department confirmed R.M.T.\u2019s allegations. The District Court granted emergency protective services. The Department placed R.M.T. with his maternal uncle in Laurel.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b611 The court also appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-112 and 425(2)(b), MCA. The GAL served as R.M.T.\u2019s attorney in accordance with practice in Yellowstone County. The court assigned counsel to Mother and Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b612 Father\u2019s counsel had not located Father before the initial show cause hearing in August 2008. Father traveled to Montana from Vermont for a subsequent hearing on October 7, 2008. Father indicated at the hearing that he would like the Department to consider him as a potential placement for R.M.T. Father later admitted to smelling of alcohol at the hearing. Father met fourteen-year-old R.M.T. for the first time during this trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">\u00b613 Father stipulated that R.M.T. qualified as a youth in need of care. The District Court adjudicated R.M.T. a youth in need of care and granted the Department temporary legal custody on October 28,2008. The court told Father to work with R.M.T.\u2019s social worker, Joe Gradney (Gradney), in order to establish a relationship with R.M.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b614 The court approved a treatment plan for Father in February of 2009. The treatment plan first required Father to provide a safe, sober, and stable home environment. The plan required Father to attend age-appropriate parenting classes and to develop a relationship with R.M.T. The plan also required Father to complete a psychological evaluation and to maintain monthly contact with Gradney. The plan\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>final goal required Father to write a personal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b615 The Department requested an extension of temporary legal custody in April of 2009. Father had not made any progress on his treatment plan. Father had not maintained regular contact with R.M.T. or Gradney. Father had attempted to call R.M.T. a few times, but claimed that he had been unable to reach R.M.T. Father appeared by phone at the April 2009 hearing and stipulated to an extension of temporary legal custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b616 The Department requested a permanency plan hearing in July of 2009. The court held a hearing on the permanency plan in September of 2009. Father\u2019s counsel sent him notice of the hearing, but counsel had not heard back from Father. The court approved the permanency plan. The Department placed R.M.T. with his friend\u2019s parents in Laurel.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">\u00b617 The court held another hearing for an extension of legal custody in December of 2009. Father\u2019s counsel informed Father of the hearing, but counsel again did not hear from Father. The court granted another extension of temporary legal custody on December 22, 2009. R.M.T. had been in the Department\u2019s custody for approximately fifteen months by that point. Mother informed Gradney that she did not intend to complete her treatment plan. Gradney had minimal contact with Father.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b618 Gradney requested a study of R.M.T.\u2019s placement with Father through the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC). The Vermont Department of Children and Families (VDCF) completed the report in February 2010. The VDCF denied permanent placement with Father because he lacked a permanent residence. The report approved Father for unsupervised visits. The report also indicated that Father had been cited for driving under the influence of alcohol in Vermont in 1995 and in 2008. Father also had been charged with domestic assault of an ex-girlfriend in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">The Termination of J.A.\u2019s Parental Rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b619 The Department petitioned for termination of Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights in June 2010. R.M.T. had been in the Department\u2019s custody for almost two years. Gradney alleged that both parents had failed to comply with their treatment plans. Father had not maintained regular contact with R.M.T. or Gradney. The court held the hearing on the Department\u2019s petition on August 31,2010, and September 3, 2010. Father traveled from Vermont to attend the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">\u00b620 In the meantime R.M.T. had moved to Havre to live with Hellebusts. R.M.T. wanted to remain with Hellebusts. R.M.T. informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the court that he did not care whether the court terminated Father\u2019s parental rights. R.M.T. told the court that he had seen Father only once in the past two years. R.M.T. requested, however, that the Department allow him to continue to develop a relationship with Father. Father agreed that R.M.T. should continue to live with Hellebusts.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b621 Father admitted at the hearing that he had not completed his treatment plan. Father claimed that he had problems accessing his treatment plan. The Department confirmed, however, that Father received a copy of the plan in April of 2009 shortly after he had requested it from his counsel. Gradney and a social worker in Vermont both discussed the treatment plan with Father. Father also discussed the treatment plan with a counselor in Vermont. Father understood the treatment plan. Father admitted that he had decided to \u201ctake a better look at [the] treatment plan\u201d about two to three weeks before the termination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b622 Father ultimately failed to complete many of the tasks on his treatment plan. VDCF reported that Father had not maintained an adequate home. Father testified at the termination hearing that he had obtained permanent housing with his girlfriend and her children since VDCF had filed its report. The District Court stated in its oral ruling that Father had completed this part of the plan\u2019s first goal that required him to provide a stable home. This goal also required Father, however, to maintain a home free of alcohol. The court did not have enough information to determine whether Father\u2019s home remained alcohol free.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b623 The plan\u2019s second goal required Father to attend age-appropriate parenting classes. Father attended no parenting classes. This goal also required Father to develop a relationship with R.M.T. Gradney testified that Father had not satisfied this task. Gradney expressed concerns about Father\u2019s commitment to R.M.T. Father testified that he had gone to great lengths to build a relationship with R.M.T. Father highlighted the fact that he had traveled from Vermont to Montana on two separate occasions despite his limited budget. Father purchased a cell phone for R.M.T. the week before the termination hearing in order to make it easier to communicate. The court considered the telephone calls, however, \u201ca long way from making best efforts to develop a relationship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b624 The plan\u2019s next goal required Father to call Gradney monthly to discuss his progress on the treatment plan. Father had not complied with this task. Father did not return Gradney\u2019s phone calls. Father offered no explanation as to why he had failed to communicate with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>Gradney. Finally, the plan\u2019s final goal required Father to write a personal history. Father failed to write a history. The court noted the relatively simple nature of this task.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b625 The court recognized that Father\u2019s piecemeal attempts to comply with his treatment plan failed to reach the level necessary to complete his treatment plan. The court determined that the termination of Father\u2019s parental rights was in R.M.T.\u2019s best interest. The court terminated both Father\u2019s and Mother\u2019s parental rights. Father appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b626 We review for an abuse of discretion a district court's termination of parental rights. <em>In re J.M., </em>2009 MT 332, \u00b6 12, 353 Mont. 64, 218 P.3d 1213. A district court abuses its discretion when it \u201cacts arbitrarily, without employment of conscientious judgment, or exceeds the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b627 The district court must protect a parent\u2019s fundamental right to the care and custody of a child through fundamentally fair procedures. <em>In re D.B., </em>2007 MT 246, \u00b6 17, 339 Mont. 240, 168 P.3d 691. The State must present clear and convincing evidence that the statutory circumstances allowing the court to terminate parental rights exist. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. The district court must address adequately each applicable statutory requirement before terminating parental rights. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 17. We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the statutory criteria. <em>In re A.J.E., </em>2006 MT 41, \u00b6 21, 331 Mont. 198, 130 P.3d 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">\u00b628 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it terminated J.A.\u2019s parental rights.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\u00b629 A district court may terminate parental rights if (1) the court has adjudicated the child a youth in need of care, (2) the parent has failed to comply with a court ordered treatment plan, and (3) the conduct or condition of the parent rendering the parent unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-609(l)(f), MCA; <em>In re I.B., </em>2011 MT 82, \u00b6 25, 360 Mont. 132, 255 P.3d 56, 2011 Mont. LEXIS 115 (April 20, 2011). Father concedes that the District Court properly adjudicated R.M.T. a youth in need of care and that he failed to complete successfully his treatment plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">\u00b630 Father argues that the court abused its discretion in terminating his parental rights, however, because it failed to address adequately whether \u201cthe conduct or condition of [Father] rendering him unfit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>unlikely to change in a reasonable time.\u201d Section 41-3-609(l)(f)(ii), MCA. Father more specifically argues that the court failed to make the appropriate findings regarding Father\u2019s fitness under \u00a7 41-3-609(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b631 Section 41-3-609(2), MCA, requires the court to make specific findings regarding whether the conduct or condition rendering Father unfit is unlikely to change. The court must find that (1) continuation of the parent-child relationship likely will result in continued abuse or neglect, or (2) the conduct or condition of the parent renders the parent unfit, unable, or unwilling to give the child adequate parental care. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. The court must consider a variety of factors to satisfy \u00a7 41-3-609(2), MCA. These factors include any emotional or mental illnesses that render the parent unable to care for the child, any history of violent behavior by the parent, excessive use of alcohol or drugs, the parent\u2019s incarceration if applicable, and any other relevant evidence. Section 41-3-609(2)(a)-(d), MCA. The statute does not require the court to make specific findings regarding each factor. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b632 The court found that Father had failed to obtain a psychological evaluation that would have provided the Department with information regarding any emotional or mental illnesses. Section 41-3-609(2)(a), MCA. Father\u2019s failure to complete this part of the treatment plan prevented the Department from making any determination about Father\u2019s mental health. The court also discussed evidence of Father\u2019s past violent behavior. Section 41-3-609(b), MCA. The court noted Father\u2019s history of alcohol abuse. Father admitted that he was an alcoholic. Father received his second DUI in 2008. Section 41-3-609(2)(c), MCA. The court properly considered the factors listed in \u00a7 41-3-609(2)(a)-(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b633 The court also specifically found (1) that the conduct or condition of Father is unlikely to change in a reasonable time, (2) that continuation of the parent-child relationship between Father and R.M.T. likely would result in continued abuse or neglect, and (3) that Father\u2019s conduct renders him unfit, unable, or unwilling to provide R.M.T. with adequate parental care. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA. The court made the necessary findings pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-609(2), MCA. \u00b634 Father argues that the court\u2019s findings do not satisfy the statutory requirements, however, because they merely restate the statutory language and lack any fact specific analysis regarding Father\u2019s fitness. The District Court\u2019s findings, to the contrary, extensively discuss Father\u2019s inability to establish a parent-child relationship with R.M.T. and his inability to provide R.M.T. with adequate parental care. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>court found that Father had failed to establish a relationship with R.M.T. Father acknowledged that failing to establish a relationship with R.M.T. would constitute neglectful conduct. Father claimed, however, that he had established a relationship with R.M.T. R.M.T. and Gradney disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b635 R.M.T.\u2019s foster care placements reported to Gradney that Father had not contacted them, despite Father\u2019s representations that he had called and left messages. Father had not returned Gradney\u2019s calls. Father also failed to communicate with his appointed counsel regarding hearings in this matter. Gradney testified that Father\u2019s inability to develop a relationship with R.M.T. constituted neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"AfS\">\u00b636 The District Court telephoned R.M.T. at Havre High School the day of the trial. The court reported that R.M.T. considered Hellebusts his only family. R.M.T. told the court that he had seen Father only once in the past two years-when he came to town for the termination hearing. Father had given R.M.T. a cell phone the week of the termination hearing. The court noted that Father had made an effort, but characterized his effort as \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b637 The court\u2019s findings also indicate that Father proved unable to provide R.M.T. with adequate parental care. Father failed to complete relatively simple tasks-like writing a personal history-in order to prevent the termination of his parental rights. R.M.T. remained in foster care for nearly two years during the pendency of these proceedings. Father admitted that he had decided to take a closer look at the treatment plan only weeks before the termination hearing. Father had not attended any parenting classes. Father suffers from alcoholism and he has committed domestic abuse in the past. Substantial credible evidence in the record supports the District Court\u2019s findings that Father was unable or unwilling to provide R.M.T. with adequate parental care. Section 41-3-609(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b638  Father points out that Gradney conceded on cross-examination that he was unable to say with certainty whether R.M.T. would suffer abuse and neglect if he lived with Father. Gradney added, however, that he did not have enough information to make this determination because Father had failed to communicate with Gradney. Father cannot benefit from his lack of involvement in this matter. The court may consider Father\u2019s past conduct to determine that Father\u2019s conduct likely would not change. <em>In re </em>D.A., 2008 MT 247, \u00b6 23, 344 Mont. 513, 189 P.3d 631. Father had two years to establish that he could provide adequate parental care to R.M.T. Substantial evidence in the record supports the court\u2019s findings that Father\u2019s conduct rendering him unfit is unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Section 41-3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>609(l)(f)(ii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b639 <em>Whether the District Court violated J.A.\u2019s due process rights when the court declined J.A.\u2019s request to cross-examine the guardian ad litem at the termination hearing.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b640 Father sought to remove Judy Williams (Williams), R.M.T.\u2019s GAL, due to Williams\u2019s failure to file a report with the court pursuant to \u00a7 41-3-112, MCA. The court declined to remove Williams as R.M.T.\u2019s GAL. Father later attempted to call Williams as a witness. Williams objected. The court asked Father to make an offer of proof. Father explained that his only question for Williams was whether she had filed a report. The court declined Father\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b641 Williams spent her lunch break that afternoon writing a report for the court. Williams\u2019s two page report discussed her communication with R.M.T. about Father. Williams reported that R.M.T. did not feel as though his Father had attempted to establish a relationship with him, and that R.M.T. wanted Father\u2019s rights terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b642 Father then attempted to call Williams as a witness regarding statements that she had made in her report. Williams objected on the grounds that her role in the proceeding as an attorney made it inappropriate for her to testify under the rules of professional conduct. The court declined to allow Father to cross-examine Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b643 Father argues that Williams filled an investigative role in the proceedings, filed a report, and presented the court with facts. Father claims that he has a due process right to cross-examine Williams under these circumstances. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">\u00b644  This Court consistently has held that parents have a liberty interest in the care and custody of their children. <em>Jacobsen v. Thomas, </em>2004 MT 273, \u00b6 34, 323 Mont. 183, 100 P.3d 106; <em>In re Krause, </em>2001 MT 37, \u00b6 19, 304 Mont. 202, 19 P.3d 811. Due process requires the court to afford parties a meaningful opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 34. A court violates a party\u2019s due process rights if the court relies on a report in a custody proceeding without requiring the author of the report to testify. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Moyer, </em>173 Mont. 208, 211, 567 P.2d 47, 49 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-10\">\u00b645 This Court in <em>Jacobsen </em>considered whether a party had a right to cross-examine an attorney GAL in a domestic relations case. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-39. The GAL had submitted several factual reports to the court. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The district court refused to allow the parties to cross-examine the GAL on the grounds that the rules of professional conduct prohibited attorneys from testifying. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21. This Court reversed. The Court reasoned that the GAL\u2019s statutory role primarily involved aiding the court in determining the best interest of the child, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>rather than serving as an attorney for the child. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b646 <em>Jacobsen </em>addressed the GAL statute in domestic relation cases. Section 40-4-205, MCA. This case involves the GAL statute in abuse and neglect proceedings. Section 41-3-112, MCA. Both statutes list the same general duties that a GAL must fulfill. Section 41-3-425, MCA, also requires the court to appoint an attorney for the child in abuse and neglect proceedings. Williams served as both R.M.T.\u2019s GAL and as R.M.T.\u2019s attorney pursuant to these statutes and the practice in Yellowstone County. Attorneys often serve as a GAL in domestic relations cases. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-39. The Department argues that the role of an attorney GAL in abuse and neglect proceedings differs from the role of an attorney GAL in domestic relations proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b647 The Department contends that the attorney GAL in abuse and neglect proceeding must act primarily as an attorney. The Department argues that the GAL in domestic relations proceedings, by contrast, serves primarily to advise the court regarding the best interest of the child. This distinction evaporates, however, when the attorney GAL submits a written report. Due process requires that a party be allowed to cross-examine the author of a written report presented to the court. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b648  Williams, like the GAL in <em>Jacobsen, </em>submitted a factual report to the District Court. We decline to draw a distinction between the roles of an attorney GAL in domestic proceedings and an attorney GAL in abuse and neglect proceedings when the GAL submits a factual report to the court. Due process requires the court to allow Father to cross-examine the GAL regarding any factual evidence, especially a written report submitted to the court. <em>Jacobsen, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b649 The Court in <em>Jacobsen </em>ultimately concluded that the district court\u2019s decision not to allow the GAL\u2019s testimony constituted harmless error. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 35. The report at issue provided the court no new information. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 36. The court\u2019s exclusion of the GAL\u2019s testimony caused no substantial injustice. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b650  Williams\u2019s two-page report likewise provided no new information to the court. We recognize that the report contained statements that R.M.T. allegedly had made to Williams regarding his relationship with Father. The court telephoned R.M.T., however, in order to learn directly from R.M.T. how R.M.T. felt about the proceeding and his Father. The District Court\u2019s findings rely on no information included in Williams\u2019s report that had not been presented through other witnesses who testified at the hearing. As a result, the exclusion of Williams\u2019s testimony did not cause substantial injustice to Father. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u00b651 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b195-4\">JUSTICES BAKER, COTTER, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b195-5\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"ANs\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b652 While I concur with the Court\u2019s Opinion, my agreement with the Court\u2019s decision on Issue 2 is grounded in the following additional rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">\u00b653 Under the applicable statutes, an attorney who is appointed as Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) for a youth in a termination of parental rights case functions as the youth\u2019s GAL and not the youth\u2019s attorney. The applicable statutes are those found in Title 41, chapter 3, MCA. Section 41-3-112(1), MCA, requires the court to appoint a GAL for any child who is abused or neglected. The GAL \u201cis charged with the representation of the child\u2019s best interests\u201d and with certain \u201cgeneral duties\u201d further delineated by this statute. Section 41-3-112(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AO5\">\u00b654 Separate from the court\u2019s obligation to appoint a GAL for any abused or neglected child, \u00a7 41-3-425(2), MCA, requires the District Court to \u201cimmediately appoint or have counsel assigned for: ...(b) any child or youth involved in a proceeding under a petition filed pursuant to 41-3-422.\u201d (Section 41-3-422, MCA, sets forth the various requirements for petitions involving protecting a child from abuse and neglect, including termination of the parent-child relationship, \u00a7 41-3-422(l)(a)(v), MCA.) Indeed, when the court appoints counsel for the child, it must be accomplished by initially appointing a public defender under the Montana Public Defender Act (Title 47, chapter 1, MCA). Moreover, under \u00a7 41-3-425(3), MCA, the court may appoint counsel <em>for </em>a GAL-obviously apart from the attorney who must be appointed for the child in a parental termination action, \u00a7 41-3-425(2)(b), MCA. Accordingly, reading \u00a7\u00a7 41-3-112 and -425, MCA, together, the plain language of the statutory scheme requires that, where a youth is subject to the termination of his or her parental rights, the trial court must appoint a GAL <em>and </em>an attorney for the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">\u00b655 The question then becomes can the GAL and the child\u2019s attorney be the same person; can one person function in both capacities-GAL and child\u2019s attorney. For the following reasons, I conclude that the GAL may not function as the youth\u2019s attorney-even if the GAL is an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">\u00b656 First, as noted above, the District Court\u2019s obligation to appoint a GAL and an attorney for the child, comes from two different statutes. The GAL can be a lay person or an attorney, \u00a7 41-3-112(3)(g), MCA, so long as the person appointed has \u201cappropriate training that is specifically related to serving as a child\u2019s court-appointed representative,\u201d \u00a7 41-3-112(2), MCA. But, while two different statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>cover the appointment of the GAL and the child\u2019s attorney, there is no specific statutory authorization for combining the \u201cgeneral duties\u201d of the GAL under \u00a7 41-3-112(3), MCA, and those of the child\u2019s attorney (presumably, as grounded in the usual rules and laws pertaining to the attorney-client relationship and the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct) under \u00a7 41-3-425(2)(b), MCA. Additionally, while the GAL only needs to appear and participate in proceedings \u201cto the degree necessary\u201d (\u00a7 41-3-112(3)(e), MCA), an attorney\u2019s professional obligation to represent the child would, necessarily, require his or her appearance and participation in all proceedings. Thus, at the outset, the Legislature\u2019s choice to differentiate the two appointments and the respective duties in the statutory scheme should be respected.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b657 Second, and probably more importantly, under \u00a7 41-3-112(3)(g), MCA, if the GAL is an attorney, she is empowered \u201cto file motions, including but not limited to filing to expedite proceedings or otherwise assert the child\u2019s rights.\u201d The GAL\u2019s power, in this regard, however, is bounded by the overarching statutory charge that the GAL represent \u201cthe child\u2019s <em>best interests.\u201d </em>Section 41-3-112(3), MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"AP2\">\u00b658 Montana law consistently recognizes that there is a difference between what a child may want or \u201cwish\u201d and what is in the child\u2019s best interests. <em>See e.g. Hillard v. Smith (In re Parenting of N.S.), </em>2011 MT 98, \u00b6 21, 360 Mont. 288, 253 P.3d 863 (district court did not abuse its discretion when it concluded that it was in the child\u2019s best interests that he reside primarily with one parent despite his wish to reside with the other); <em>In re Marriage of Merriman, </em>247 Mont. 491, 495, 807 P.2d 1351, 1354 (1991) (children\u2019s express wishes were not determinative of their best interests); <em>In re Marriage of Arrotta, </em>244 Mont. 508, 513, 797 P.2d 940, 943 (1990) (trial court is obligated to award custody of a child based on the child\u2019s best interests, not the child\u2019s preferences); <em>accord In re Marriage of Ulland, </em>251 Mont. 160, 169, 823 P.2d 864, 870 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u00b659 However, the duty of an attorney is to represent the client\u2019s (here the youth\u2019s) wishes-irrespective of whether those \u201cwishes\u201d necessarily coincide with the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d <em>See e.g. In re Mental Health of </em>K.G.F., 2001 MT 140, \u00b6 86, 306 Mont. 1, 29 P.3d 485 (the proper role of the attorney in civil commitment proceedings is to \u201crepresent the perspective of the respondent and to serve as a vigorous advocate for the respondent\u2019s wishes\u201d); <em>State v. Joanna V., </em>94 P.3d 783, 786 (N.M. 2004) (\u201cThe focus of the GAL\u2019s responsibilities is on representing the best interests of the child to the court.... [Counsel\u2019s role] is to advocate zealously for the client\u2019s position. Although counsel may advise the client on counsel\u2019s view of the client\u2019s best interests, counsel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>ultimately required to advance the client\u2019s expressed wishes.\u201d); <em>Gallimore v. Gallimore, </em>1989 Ohio App. LEXIS 1231 at ** 6-7 (Ohio App. 2d Dist. March 30, 1989) (\u201cThe duty of a lawyer to his client and the duty of a guardian ad litem to his ward are not always identical and, in fact, may conflict. The role of guardian ad litem is to investigate the ward\u2019s situation and then to ask the court to do what the guardian feels is in the ward\u2019s best interest. The role of the attorney is to zealously represent his client within the bounds of the law.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b660 Accordingly, and based upon the foregoing, I conclude that even if the GAL happens to be an attorney-and while her attorney skill may improve her ability to perform her \u201cgeneral duties\u201d as a GAL and thus better act as the child\u2019s court-appointed \u201crepresentative\u201d (\u00a7 41-3-112(2) and (3), MCA)-such a GAL does not form an \u201cattorney-client\u201d relationship with the child. Rather, instead of advocating for the child\u2019s wishes and desires, the GAL must advocate for the child\u2019s best interests. Maybe the child\u2019s wishes and best interests will coincide, but that is beside the point. Because the child\u2019s wishes and best interests may not be the same in any given case, the statutory scheme must be followed. The youth in a termination of parental rights proceeding must be appointed a GAL under \u00a7 41-3-112(1), MCA, and, separately, counsel under \u00a7 41-3-425(2)(b), MCA. The former\u2019s duty is to advocate for the child\u2019s best interests; the latter\u2019s duty is to advocate for the child\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b661 Because there is no attorney-client relationship between the GAL and the child and because the GAL\u2019s general duties involve investigations to ascertain facts, interviewing and observing the child, accessing records, making written reports to the court, and making recommendations as to the child\u2019s best interests (\u00a7 41-3-112(3), MCA), I conclude that the GAL may be called as and cross-examined as a witness for the State, the parent, or the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b662 With that additional rationale as to Issue 2, I concur in the Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
