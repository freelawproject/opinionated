The court declared that the common boundary line between the parties\u2019 properties runs in a meander line along the west bank of Flint Creek. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">\u00b62 We review the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-17\">\u00b63 <em>Whether the District Court improperly relied upon extrinsic evidence to determine legal title to the disputed property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-18\">\u00b64 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that the boundary line between the parties\u2019 properties meanders along Flint Creek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-19\">\u00b65 <em>Whether Ethens filed a timely claim for declaratory relief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court failed to join other landowners on Flint Creek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b67 <em>Whether Neighbors gained title to the disputed property through adverse possession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u00b68 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it declined to award attorney fees to Ethens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b69 Ethens purchased property in Granite County in July 2007. Neighbors own properties that border Ethens\u2019 property. James and Mary Mellen (Mellens) originally owned in one common tract Neighbors\u2019 and Ethens\u2019 properties. Mellens\u2019 tract consisted of approximately 125 acres. Flint Creek runs north and south through the property. A county road runs east and west through the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">\u00b610 Mellens conveyed approximately 35 acres to Thelma and Warren Cummins, Sr. in 1960 through a deed titled the \u201cMellen-Cummins Deed.\u201d The deed stated that Mellens intended to convey \u201conly all of the lands which they own [w]est of Flint Creek and [s]outh of the present [c]ounty [r]oad.\u201d Warren Cummins, Sr. quitclaimed Cummins\u2019 parcel to Thelma Cummins Brownell in 1976. The deed excluded a paragraph from the original Mellen-Cummins Deed. The relevant boundary description did not change. Thelma deeded her parcel to Warren Cummins, Jr. (Cummins) in 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b611 Mary Mellen transferred the remainder of the original 125-acre tract that she and James had retained, approximately 90 acres, to her daughter, Frances E. Lane (Lane), in 1963. Lane created the Lane Ranch in 1977. Flint Creek served as the boundary between Cummins\u2019s property (to the west) and the Lane Ranch (to the east). The county road served as Cummins\u2019s north boundary with the Lane Ranch.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u00b612 Charles Lane commissioned surveyor William Bayer (Bayer) in 1982 to create three parcels from the approximately 90-acre parcel known as the Lane Ranch. Bayer created the first recorded certificate of survey (COS 162) involving any of these properties. Bayer referred to the Mellen-Cummins Deed to prepare the survey. Bayer surveyed the west bank of Flint Creek with a compass and set course points along the bank of the creek. Bayer did not set any pins along Flint Creek. Bayer created three parcels-two to the east of Flint Creek, and one to the north of the county road. The diagram below roughly depicts COS 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">\u00b613 James and Deanna Lane sold Parcel 2 of COS 162 to Fischer in 1990. Fischer later commissioned plat 45-M in order to subdivide her property. Bayer prepared plat 45-M in accordance with COS 162 and the Mellen-Cummins Deed. Fischer sold approximately ten acres of Parcel 2 along Flint Creek to Joneses. Fischer retained approximately 20 acres south of Joneses\u2019 parcel along Flint Creek. Cummins owned the parcel to the west of Flint Creek. Cummins eventually sold his parcel to Ethens in 2007. The following diagram roughly depicts the current configuration of the parcels in relation to Flint Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">\u00b614 Ethens\u2019 deed from Cummins describes Ethens\u2019 property by incorporating certificate of survey 521 (COS 521). COS 521 constituted a retracement survey of the property originally created in the Mellen-Cummins Deed. Cummins commissioned COS 521 in order to resolve a dispute regarding the south boundary with a different neighbor. COS 521 incorporates most of the same course points along Flint Creek that Bayer had set forth in COS 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">\u00b615 The parties dispute ownership over a small strip of land west of Flint Creek. The contested area of land consists of .61 acres along the Joneses/Ethens boundary and 1.04 acres along the Fischer/Ethens boundary. The Mellen-Cummins Deed and the subsequent certificates of survey describe the boundary in dispute. The Mellen-Cummins Deed describes the boundary between Ethens\u2019 property and Neighbors\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>properties as running along the west bank of Flint Creek. The narrative descriptions in COS 162, COS 521, and plat 45-M likewise describe the boundary as running along the west bank of Flint Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">\u00b616 COS 162 set forth fixed course points along the west bank of Flint Creek. Bayer mapped the course points in 1982 along the top of the west bank of Flint Creek. The course points now lie slightly west of the west bank of Flint Creek. A subsequent surveyor\u2019s fixing of these course points on the ground has led to the dispute over the acreage just west of Flint Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">\u00b617 Ethens claim that Flint Creek constitutes the property boundary between their property and Neighbors\u2019 properties. They argue that Bayer\u2019s course points in COS 162 created a meandering boundary line along Flint Creek. Ethens rely on the original Mellen-Cummins Deed and the succeeding certificates of survey to support their argument that a meandering boundary along Flint Creek provides landowners on both sides of the creek access to its waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">\u00b618 Cummins advertised the parcel that he sold to Ethens as creek front property. Ethens became aware of the fact that Neighbors disputed the boundary while they negotiated the purchase of the property from Cummins. Ethens decided to purchase the property based on their research and subsequent belief that Cummins\u2019s parcel bordered Flint Creek. Ethens negotiated a reduced purchase price for the property in light of the potential boundary dispute with Neighbors.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">\u00b619 Neighbors commissioned a new survey of their properties shortly after Ethens purchased the property from Cummins. Certificate of survey 788 (COS 788) placed fixed pins on the ground along the west bank of Flint Creek according to the course points in Bayer\u2019s 1982 survey. COS 788 depicts a boundary line that used a straight line to connect the pins, unlike the previous surveys that had drawn the boundary along Flint Creek. The boundary line in COS 788 lies just to the west of Flint Creek. This property boundary excludes Ethens\u2019 access to Flint Creek. Ethens sought declaratory relief to resolve the dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b620 The District Court held a bench trial. The court declined Neighbors\u2019 summary judgment motion that had sought to join to the action other landowners with a property interest in parcel 3. Ty Throop (Throop) purchased parcel 3 of COS 162 from Lanes over twenty years ago. Throop owned parcel 3 at the time of trial. Throop testified on behalf of Neighbors regarding his interpretation of parcel 3\u2019s boundary with Ethens\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"ANb\">\u00b621 The court agreed with Ethens that the Mellen-Cummins Deed and the subsequent certificates of survey, COS 162, COS 521, and plat 45-M, described a meandering boundary line along the west bank of Flint Creek. The parties agreed that Flint Creek qualifies as a non-navigable stream. The court declared, therefore, that Ethens\u2019 property line extended to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>center of Flint Creek. The court also declared that COS 788 constituted an invalid survey and ordered it stricken from the public record.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b622 The court rejected Neighbors\u2019 alternative claim that they had acquired property west of Flint Creek through adverse possession. The court likewise rejected Neighbors\u2019 claims that Ethens had acquiesced to a fixed boundary line west of Flint Creek, that the doctrines of laches and equitable estoppel barred Ethens\u2019 claim, and that Ethens had failed to join an indispensible party. The court declined to award Ethens\u2019 request for attorney fees. Neighbors appeal and Ethens cross-appeal on the issue of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">\u00b623 This Court reviews findings of facts to determine whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Mont. Rail Link v. CUSA PRTS., LLC, </em>2009 MT 432, \u00b6 26, 354 Mont. 101, 222 P.3d 1021. We must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Id. We </em>review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id. </em>We review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to award attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2004 MT 366, \u00b6 20, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b624 <em>Whether the District Court improperly relied upon extrinsic evidence to determine legal title to the disputed property.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-9\">\u00b625 The court must interpret the plain language of an unambiguous deed. <em>Tester v. Tester, </em>2000 MT 130, \u00b6 25, 300 Mont. 5, 3 P.3d 109. The court cannot resort to extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent to interpret an unambiguous deed. <em>Id. </em>The Mellen-Cummins Deed appears in Ethens\u2019 chain of title. Neighbors nevertheless argue that Ethens\u2019 deed from Cummins provides an unambiguous property description, and, therefore, the court improperly considered extrinsic evidence in the form of the Mellen-Cummins Deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-10\">\u00b626 <em>Tester </em>dealt with a boundary dispute similar to the dispute here. The Court in <em>Tester </em>looked first to the parties\u2019 chains of title. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15. The district court had interpreted one of the deeds in the chain of title contrary to the plain language of that deed. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. The deed unambiguously set forth the disputed boundary. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 28. The district court should have limited its analysis to the deed\u2019s unambiguous language. The district court instead improperly considered extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent to locate the boundary that was not included in the language of the deed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-11\">\u00b627 Ethens\u2019 deed from Cummins describes the property as set forth \u201cin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>certificate of survey 521.\u201d A certificate of survey becomes part of the deed when a deed grants land according to an official survey. <em>Olson v. Jude, </em>2003 MT 186, \u00b6 46, 316 Mont. 438, 73 P.3d 809. COS 521 does not constitute extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent. <em>Tester, </em>\u00b6 27. COS 521 constitutes an essential part of Ethens\u2019 deed from Cummins. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 46. The District Court properly examined COS 521. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b628 The parties dispute the meaning of the metes and bounds description in COS 521. COS 521 constituted a retracement survey of Ethens\u2019 parcel that originally had been created in the Mellen-Cummins Deed. Cummins commissioned COS 521 in order to resolve a dispute regarding the parcel\u2019s southern boundary. COS 521 states on its face that the survey serves \u201cto clarify omissions in previous deed transfers for this parcel of land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b629 The surveyor who created COS 521 testified that he had relied on the Mellen-Cummins Deed. In fact all of the surveyors who testified referred to the Mellen-Cummins Deed. Neighbors never objected to any reference to the Mellen-Cummins Deed by the surveyors. The parties also stipulated on the first day of trial that the court should admit any documents that described the parties\u2019 chains of title. The court admitted the parties\u2019 chains of title. Ethens\u2019 chain of title includes the Mellen-Cummins Deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">\u00b630 Neighbors inconsistently argued their position regarding the Mellen-Cummins Deed. Neighbors presented the District Court with the Mellen-Cummins Deed in their first motion for summary judgment on October 22, 2008. Neighbors initially argued that the Mellen-Cummins Deed provided critical evidence relevant to the boundary dispute. They argued in their first summary judgment brief that the Mellen-Cummins Deed unambiguously excluded Ethens\u2019 access to Flint Creek. Neighbors changed course, however, by the time that they had filed their second summary judgment brief on November 25, 2008. They argued instead in their second summary judgment brief that the Mellen-Cummins Deed constituted extrinsic evidence. Neighbors failed to explain their change in position.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\u00b631  The District Court allowed the Mellen-Cummins Deed into evidence. The Mellen-Cummins Deed, prepared before Ethens\u2019 deed from Cummins, provides the first description of the disputed boundary. Ethens\u2019 chain of title includes the Mellen-Cummins Deed. <em>Tester, </em>\u00b6 15. The information contained in the Mellen-Cummins Deed cannot be considered extrinsic evidence under these circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. The District Court simply interpreted the plain language of the Mellen-Cummins Deed, the subsequent certificates of survey, and Ethens\u2019 deed from Cummins. The court properly examined the chains of title to the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>properties in seeking to define the boundary. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b632 <em>Whether the District Court correctly determined that the boundary line between the parties' properties meanders along Flint Creek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b633 Neighbors argue that the District Court incorrectly found that the evidence described the parties\u2019 boundary as a meander line along the west bank of Flint Creek instead of a fixed boundary just west of Flint Creek. The court relied on certificates of survey that describe the boundary, the properties\u2019 chains of title, lay testimony, and expert testimony from several Montana land surveyors. The court sorted through sometimes contradictory evidence to determine whether the disputed boundary constituted a meander line or a fixed and definite boundary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">\u00b634 This Court discussed the definition and purpose of meander lines in <em>Andersen v. Monforton, </em>2005 MT 310, \u00b6\u00b6 17-30, 329 Mont. 460, 125 P.3d 614. A surveyor uses a meander line to show that a body of water serves as the boundary. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. A meander line sets specific measurements on a survey to define the quantity of land for purchase. Meander lines define a boundary as moving with a body of water\u2019s shifting bank, even though meander lines contain specific measurements. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 20. A boundary along a body of water runs to the edge of the body of water. A boundary along a body of water generally does not become definite and fixed unless the grantor explicitly indicates such intent. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21; \u00a7 70-16-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b635 The Mellen-Cummins Deed describes the boundary between Ethens\u2019 property and Neighbors\u2019 properties as the west bank of Flint Creek. The Mellen-Cummins Deed explicitly states its intention \u201cto convey and warrant conveyance only all of the lands which [the Mellens] own [w]est of Flint Creek.\u201d The Mellen-Cummins Deed did not reserve a portion of land west of the west bank of Flint Creek. <em>Andersen, </em>\u00b6 21. The Mellen-Cummins Deed did not set forth any fixed points west of the west bank of Flint Creek. The plain language of the Mellen-Cummins Deed supports the court\u2019s finding. <em>Mont. Rail Link, </em>\u00b6 26. Nothing in the Mellen-Cummins Deed indicates an intent to create a fixed boundary west of the west bank of Flint Creek. Section 70-16-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">\u00b636 COS 162 constitutes the first recorded survey of the disputed properties. COS 162\u2019s narrative describes the boundary between the parties\u2019 properties as running along the west bank of Flint Creek. Bayer prepared COS 162 according to the Mellen-Cummins Deed. Bayer surveyed Flint Creek with a compass and set course points along the west bank of the creek. Bayer set the course points in order to calculate acreage for Lane\u2019s parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">\u00b637 Bayer had intended to create a fixed boundary line along the top of the west bank of Flint Creek. He did not believe, however, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Mellen-Cummins Deed granted Cummins access to Flint Creek. Bayer admitted on cross-examination that the call to the west bank of Flint Creek in the Mellen-Cummins Deed constituted a bound call. Bound calls, according to Bayer, supersede survey data. Montana law confirms Bayer\u2019s testimony. <em>See Bollinger v. Hollingsworth, </em>227 Mont. 454, 457, 739 P.2d 962, 964 (1987) (citing <em>Buckley v. Laird, </em>158 Mont. 483, 492, 493 P.2d 1070, 1075 (1972)). The bound call to Flint Creek in COS 162 therefore would override any set course points, including the course points that Bayer himself had set. <em>Id. </em>Bayer also agreed that the boundary did not create a straight line, but fluctuated along the west bank of Flint Creek. \u00b638 Another Montana surveyor, Barney Hallin (Hallin), testified that the boundary set forth on COS 162 constituted a meandering boundary line along Flint Creek. Hallin interpreted COS 162 in light of the Mellen-Cummins Deed. He also relied on the narrative included in COS 162 that describes the boundary as running along the west bank of Flint Creek. Hallin testified that COS 521 likewise set forth a meandering boundary line.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b639 Cummins commissioned COS 521 to resolve a boundary dispute with his neighbor to the south. The narrative in COS 521 describes Ethens\u2019 eastern boundary as \u201calong the west bank of Flint Creek.\u201d Hans Bohrnsen (Bohrnsen) prepared COS 521. Bohrnsen incorporated Bayer\u2019s course points along the west bank of Flint Creek. Bohrnsen testified, similar to Bayer, that a survey does not require fixed pins if the deed calls to a natural monument creating the boundary. Flint Creek constitutes a natural monument creating the boundary between the parties\u2019 properties. Bohrnsen testified that COS 521 does not set a fixed boundary line. COS 521 set forth a meandering boundary line that fluctuates with the course of Flint Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b640 Tom Moodry, another Montana surveyor, testified for Neighbors that the disputed boundary lies to the west of the west bank of Flint Creek. Moodry based his testimony on a different interpretation of the same certificates of survey and the Mellen-Cummins Deed. He believed that the grantor of the Mellen-Cummins Deed had not intended to convey access to the waters of Flint Creek. He reached this conclusion despite the language in the Mellen-Cummins Deed that the boundary ran \u201calong the west bank of Flint Creek.\u201d Moodry interpreted the phrase \u201calong the west bank of Flint Creek\u201d to mean \u201cclose to, nearby, parallel to, but away from the running water\u201d of Flint Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">\u00b641 The surveyors presented contradictory testimony. The district court determines the credibility of the witnesses and the weight assigned to their respective testimony. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 326, \u00b6 52, 352 Mont. 513, 220 P.3d 595. The District Court agreed with Hallin and Bohrnsen that the evidence established a meandering boundary along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Flint Creek. Bayer did not characterize the boundary line that he had created in COS 162 as a meandering boundary. Bayer testified, however, that he had intended the boundary to run along Flint Creek. Bayer set fixed course points for the purpose of determining acreage. This Court similarly identified a meandering boundary line in <em>Andersen </em>as one that runs along the edge of a creek and serves to quantify acreage. <em>Andersen, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b642 Neighbors also argue that the absence of the term \u201cmeander line\u201d from the relevant deeds and certificates of survey supports the existence of a fixed boundary line. A deed need not specifically characterize the boundary line as a meander line, however, when the narrative description of the land grant clearly indicates that the boundary meanders along a watercourse. <em>Andersen, </em>\u00b6 21. The narrative descriptions in COS 162, COS 521, and plat 45-M all describe the boundary as running along Flint Creek. <em>Id. </em>The surveys also portray a boundary line that runs along Flint Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b643  The District Court based its finding that COS 162, COS 521, and plat 45-M set forth a meandering boundary line along Flint Creek on the exhibits and testimony. Hallin\u2019s testimony and Bohrnsen\u2019s testimony support the District Court\u2019s finding. <em>Id. </em>Other substantial credible evidence in the record, including the Mellen-Cummins Deed, further supports the court\u2019s findings. <em>Mont. Rail Link, </em>\u00b6 26. The court properly characterized the disputed boundary as a meandering line along Flint Creek. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">\u00b644 <em>Whether Ethens filed a timely claim for declaratory relief.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b645 Neighbors make a series of related arguments that Ethens failed to file a timely claim for relief. They argue either that the statute of limitations had run on Ethens\u2019 claim or that the doctrines of laches, equitable estoppel or acquiescence bar Ethens\u2019 claim. Neighbors base these arguments on the premise that Ethens or their predecessors in interest knew that COS 162 and COS 521 set forth a fixed boundary line and did nothing until Neighbors filed COS 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b646 Neighbors commissioned COS 788 after Ethens had purchased their property. Earlier surveys had reflected a meandering boundary line along Flint Creek. COS 788, unlike the previous surveys, placed fixed pins on the ground according to Bayer\u2019s course points from COS 162. The surveyor drew straight lines in order to connect the newly placed pins. COS 788 set forth for the first time a fixed boundary line west of Flint Creek. The pins locate the boundary approximately 20 to 100 feet west of Flint Creek. The fixed boundary in COS 788 runs through the middle of an old building on Ethens\u2019 property. Ethens had no involvement in the preparation or recordation of COS 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>\u00b647  Neighbors filed COS 788 on November 27, 2007. Ethens filed their claim for declaratory relief in response to COS 788 three weeks later on December 19, 2007. Neighbors fail to cite a relevant statute of limitation. Ethens filed their claim less than a month after Neighbors had filed COS 788. The equitable doctrine of laches likewise does not bar Ethens\u2019 claim disputing the fixed boundary set forth in COS 788. The relative alacrity exercised by Ethens cannot qualify as sitting on their rights. <em>Montanans for Just. v. State, </em>2006 MT 277, \u00b6 25, 334 Mont. 237, 146 P.3d 759. The record does not support Neighbors\u2019 claim that Ethens had acquiesced to a fixed boundary. The doctrine of equitable estoppel likewise does not bar Ethens\u2019 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b648 <em>Whether the District Court failed to join other landowners on Flint Creek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">\u00b649 Section 27-8-301, MCA, provides that the court must join any person who has an interest that a declaratory judgment would affect. M. R. Civ. P. 19(a)(1) requires a district court to join a party to an action if complete relief cannot occur in the party\u2019s absence. Complete relief relates to persons already parties, rather than to relief between a party and the absent person. <em>Mt. West Bank v. Mine &amp; Mill Hydraulics, Inc., </em>2003 MT 35, \u00b6 32, 314 Mont. 248, 64 P.3d 1048. The facts and circumstances of each case determine whether a court must join a particular non-party. <em>Id. </em>We will reverse for an abuse of discretion the district court\u2019s decision whether to join a party. <em>Mohl v. Johnson, </em>275 Mont. 167, 169-70, 911 P.2d 217, 219 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b650 The bank in <em>Mt. West Bank </em>brought a foreclosure action against Mine &amp; Mill Hydraulics (Mine &amp; Mill) after Mine &amp; Mill had defaulted on several of its loan obligations. <em>Mt. West Bank, </em>\u00b6 34. The action involved multiple parties all whom had some type of interest in the disputed property. <em>Id. </em>The district court denied the defendant\u2019s request to join Mountain Hydraulics. <em>Id. </em>The former directors of Mine &amp; Mill had created Montana Hydraulics after Mine &amp; Mill had failed. Montana Hydraulics held no legal interest in the disputed property. <em>Id. </em>Montana Hydraulics did not qualify as an indispensable party. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b651 The District Court determined that it could grant meaningful relief without joining other landowners along Flint Creek. The boundary at issue lies between Ethens\u2019 property and Neighbors\u2019 properties. The parties dispute ownership over a strip of acreage west of Flint Creek as described in COS 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b652  Other neighboring landowners hold no legal interest in the disputed acreage at issue in this case. <em>Mt. West Bank, </em>\u00b6 34. In fact, the owner of parcel 3 testified at trial. The owner of parcel 3 had notice of Ethens\u2019 declaratory relief action and elected not to intervene. Other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>landowners may, including the owner of parcel 3, have an interest in the court\u2019s interpretation of the relevant surveys. The only boundary in dispute in this action, however, lies between Ethens\u2019 property and Neighbors\u2019 properties. This decision does not determine the rights of any other landowners along Flint Creek. Section 27-8-301, MCA. We cannot say that the District Court abused its discretion in declining Neighbors\u2019 efforts to join other landowners under these circumstances. <em>Mt. West Bank, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b653 <em>Whether Neighbors gained title to the disputed property through adverse possession.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b654 Neighbors must prove through clear and convincing evidence that their possession qualified as \u201copen, notorious, exclusive, adverse, continuous, and uninterrupted\u201d in order to establish ownership through adverse possession. <em>Meadow Lake Estates Homeowners Assn. v. Shoemaker, </em>2008 MT 41, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37, 341 Mont. 345, 178 P.3d 81. Neighbors presented evidence of their properties\u2019 tax assessments. Neighbors had paid taxes on the disputed acreage and claimed that they exclusively had used property to the west of Flint Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b655  Neighbors maintain that they have used the disputed property west of Flint Creek for recreation and had chosen to leave the land undisturbed. Ethens presented similar testimony. The court found that both parties in fact had used the disputed property to access Flint Creek. Neighbors failed to provide the Court with clear and convincing evidence that their use of the disputed property west of the west bank of Flint Creek qualified as exclusive. <em>Shoemaker, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">\u00b656 <em>Whether the District Court abused its discretion when it declined to award attorney fees to Ethens.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">\u00b657  The district court may award attorney fees at its discretion under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, when equitable considerations support the award. <em>United Natl. Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 38, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260. The District Court identified no equitable considerations that would support an award of attorney fees to Ethens. Both parties genuinely believed that they owned the disputed property. Ethens had negotiated a $130,000 reduced purchase price for their property in light of potential attorney fees that could result from litigation to resolve the boundary dispute. The District Court did not abuse its discretion under these circumstances when it declined to award attorney fees to Ethens. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">\u00b658 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b94-10\">JUSTICES COTTER, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
