We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred when it concluded that State law imposes a 60-year restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b409-12\">\u00b63 On June 4, 2009, Olivares-Coster was charged with one count of Deliberate Homicide, \u00a7 45-5~102(l)(a), MCA, and two counts of Attempted Deliberate Homicide, \u00a7\u00a7 45-5-102(l)(a) and 45-4-103(1), MCA. He was seventeen years old at the time of the alleged offenses. On November 19, 2009, represented by counsel, Olivares-Coster pled guilty to all counts. As part of the plea agreement, the State agreed to refrain from taking any position regarding Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility, leaving that issue to the discretion of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-13\">\u00b64 A sentencing hearing was held on April 2,2010. At the close of the hearing, the District Court pronounced three life-sentences on Olivares-Coster, one for each count. The two life-sentences for the attempted deliberate homicide counts were to run concurrent with each other but consecutive to the life-sentence for the deliberate homicide count. The District Court did not impose any parole restrictions, but concluded \u201cDefendant will be parole eligible in 60 years, if my math is correct.\u201d Later, the District Court explained, \u201cthe reason why I\u2019m not restricting his parole eligibility, first of all, 60 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>down the road is a long time.\u201d She further stated, \u201cI\u2019m considering his youth, the fact that he was under the age of 18 ... I also believe that having parole eligibility in the future will facilitate any possible rehabilitation that he could have .... Just knowing that there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel, that will give him hope, and that will make him a better prison inmate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b65 On July 16, 2010, the District Court issued a written Judgment and Commitment. The Judgment provided that the \u201cdefendant shall be parole eligible after sixty (60) years of incarceration.\u201d Additionally, the Judgment reconfirmed that Olivares-Coster would not receive a discretionary restriction on parole eligibility \u201cin light of the defendant\u2019s youth, to facilitate his rehabilitation and to help effect positive conduct by him in prison.\u201d Olivares-Coster filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b66 \u201cWhere a defendant was sentenced to more than one year of actual incarceration, and therefore is eligible for sentence review, we review the sentence for legality only.\u201d <em>State v. Bullplume, </em>2011 MT 40, \u00b6 10, 359 Mont. 289, 251 P.3d 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b67 <em>Whether the District Court erred when it concluded that State law imposes a 60-year restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility .</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">\u00b68 Olivares-Coster asserts that the District Court incorrectly concluded that his parole eligibility would automatically be restricted for 60 years, because such a restriction is precluded by \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA. He concedes no objection was raised at the trial level, but asserts that this Court can review his claim under <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979). Under <em>Lenihan, </em>an appellate court may \u201creview any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont, at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000; <em>accord State v. Holt, </em>2011 MT 42, \u00b6 35, 359 Mont. 308, 249 P.3d 470. The State agrees that <em>Lenihan </em>applies here. We will review Olivares-Coster\u2019s claim despite his failure to raise it at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-10\">\u00b69 At the outset, the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence is inconsistent with the written Judgment and Commitment. At sentencing, the District Court did not orally impose a 60-year restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility. Rather, the District Court presumed that such a restriction automatically applied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>Probation Officer Lori Moore had testified at the sentencing hearing that if the District Court imposed a life-sentence without any discretionary parole restriction, Olivares-Coster would be eligible for parole in 30 years. Moore\u2019s testimony was premised on \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, which provides, \u201c[a] prisoner serving a life sentence may not be paroled under this section until the prisoner has served 30 years.\u201d The District Court, after discussing whether the sentences on the three counts were to be consecutive or concurrent, concluded, \u201cand the result of that is the Defendant will be parole eligible in 60 years, if my math is correct.\u201d The District Court later explained, \u201cthe reason why I\u2019m not restricting his parole eligibility, first of all, 60 years down the road is a long time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b610 In conflict, the District Court\u2019s written Judgment and Commitment explicitly states, \u201cdefendant shall be parole eligible after sixty (60) years of incarceration.\u201d Where there is a discrepancy between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment, the oral pronouncement controls. State <em>v. Duncan, </em>2008 MT 148, \u00b6 51, 343 Mont. 220, 183 P.3d 111; <em>State v. Rennaker, </em>2007 MT 10, \u00b6 48, 335 Mont. 274, 150 P.3d 960. Thus, the District Court\u2019s oral pronouncement of sentence controls in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b611 The issue here is whether the District Court correctly concluded that Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole would be automatically restricted for 60 years. A district court\u2019s sentencing authority is constrained by statute. <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, 133 P.3d 206. A district court does \u201cnot have the power to impose a sentence unless authorized by a specific grant of statutory authority.\u201d <em>State v. Burch, </em>2008 MT 118, \u00b6 23, 342 Mont. 499, 182 P.3d 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b612 The District Court concluded that \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, automatically restricted Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole. However, as Olivares-Coster points out, \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, conflicts with \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-7\">Exceptions to mandatory minimum sentences, restrictions on deferred imposition and suspended execution of sentence, and restrictions on parole eligibility. Mandatory minimum sentences prescribed by the laws of this state, mandatory life sentences prescribed by 46-18-219, the restrictions on deferred imposition and suspended execution of sentence prescribed by 46-18-201(l)(b), 46-18-205,46-18-221(3), 46-18-224, and 46-18-502(3), and <em>restrictions on parole eligibility do not apply if:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">(1) the offender was <em>less than 18 years of age </em>at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>commission of the offense for which the offender is to be sentenced!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">(Emphasis added.) Olivares-Coster was 17 years old at the time he committed the offenses. Section 46-23-201(4), MCA, constitutes a restriction on parole eligibility. As applied to juveniles, the statutes conflict. Section 46-23-201(4), MCA, generally applies a 30-year restriction on parole eligibility for a life sentence, but \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA, denies the application of such a restriction to offenders under the age of 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b613 The State argues \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA, should be interpreted based upon the statutory scheme and legislative history. However, the language of \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA is clear and unambiguous, and requires no further interpretation. <em>Burch, </em>\u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">\u00b614  We conclude that \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA, is more specific than \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, and controls in this case. \u201cIn situations where general and specific statutes exist and the two cannot be harmonized to give effect to both, the specific statute controls.\u201d <em>State v, Brendal, </em>2009 MT 236, \u00b6 18, 351 Mont. 395, 213 P.3d 448; see <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 62; \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA. Here, the specific language of \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA, referring to offenders who are less than 18 years of age when their offenses are committed, takes precedence over the general restriction on parole eligibility of \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, rendering the 30-year restriction inapplicable to Olivares-Coster. Consequently, the District Court was incorrect when it concluded that Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility would be automatically restricted pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA. As there is no statutory authority for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he defendant will be parole eligible in 60 years,\u201d this portion of Olivares-Coster\u2019s sentence is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">\u00b615 We next turn to the question of the proper remedy. In the past, this Court did not employ a single rule \u201cregarding the appropriate remedy for a partially illegal sentence....\u201d <em>State v. Heafner, </em>2010 MT 87, \u00b6 9, 356 Mont. 128, 231 P.3d 1087. Rather, the Court examined the \u201csentence and record to determine the appropriate remedy.\u201d <em>State v. Heath </em>2004 MT 58, \u00b6 49, 320 Mont. 211, 89 P.3d 947. The Court generally \u201cvacated or remanded with instructions to strike when the illegal portion of a sentence was a condition of a suspended sentence or a sentence enhancement.\u201d <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 49. On the other hand, \u201cremand for re-sentencing was the general practice where an illegal sentencing provision \u2018affected the entire sentence, or where we were unable to determine what sentence the district court would have adopted had it correctly followed the law.\u2019 <em>\u2019\u2019Heafner, </em>\u00b6 10 <em>(quotingHeath, </em>\u00b6 49). These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>were hardly hard-and-fast rules, and the disparate approaches resulted in unpredictable and inconsistent dispositions. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b616 In <em>Heafner, </em>we \u201cdetermined that a consistent approach should be utilized\u201d and articulated a new standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-5\">[W]hen a portion of a sentence is illegal, the better result is to remand to the district court to correct the illegal provision. Remand to give the district court the opportunity to correct the illegal provision should be ordered unless, under the particular circumstances of the case, the illegal portion of the sentence cannot be corrected. If so, the case should be remanded to the district court with instructions to strike the illegal conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A7b\"><em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 11; <em>accord State v. Petersen, </em>2011 MT 22, \u00b6 15, 359 Mont. 200, 247 P.3d 731. This new standard strives for consistency, ultimately asking whether the illegal condition is correctable, without recourse to the more amorphous approaches previously applied. Olivares-Coster argues we should remand with an order to strike the offending language in his written sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">\u00b617 In <em>Heafner, </em>the district court imposed parole conditions without statutory authority. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 6. This Court remanded with an order to strike the illegal conditions. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 13. In <em>Petersen, </em>the district court imposed an unlawful 10-year weapon enhancement. <em>Petersen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 16. This Court remanded with an order to strike, concluding \u201cwe cannot remand for \u2018correction\u2019 of the court\u2019s sentence enhancement, as the enhancement was unlawful under the governing statutes.\u201d <em>Petersen, </em>\u00b6 16. Thus, the determinative factor was that it was impossible to correct a sentence enhancement done in the absence of statutory authority. <em>Petersen, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b618 Regarding, the dissent\u2019s citation to <em>State v. Guill, </em>2011 MT 32, 359 Mont. 225, 248 P.3d 826, the district court had imposed restitution, as authorized by \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, but failed to \u201cspecify the total amount of restitution that the offender shall pay.\u201d <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 52; \u00a7 46-18-244(1), MCA. While the district court had the authority to order restitution, this Court remanded for correction so that the district court could hold further proceedings to reach a specific dollar amount. <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6 52. In contrast, here the District Court lacked statutory authority to apply \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, to Olivares-Coster. Thus, <em>Guill </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b619 The dissent equates \u201ccorrection\u201d with allowing the District Court to consider whether to impose discretionary parole eligibility restrictions. However, the District Court explicitly declined to exercise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>such discretion. Section 46-18-202(2), MCA. We should not speculate whether the District Court would have imposed a discretionary parole restriction when in fact the District Court explicitly declined to do so in the oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b620  Here, a 60-year restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, was expressly prohibited by \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA. As in <em>Heafner </em>and <em>Petersen, </em>remand for correction would be futile, as there is no way to correct unauthorized reliance on \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA. The proper remedy is remand to the District Court with an order to strike the illegal restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 11. Additionally, we decline the State\u2019s invitation to remand for re-sentencing so \u201cthe district court can decide whether to impose a discretionary parole eligibility requirement.\u201d The District Court already explicitly declined to impose any discretionary parole eligibility restriction \"in light of the defendant\u2019s youth, to facilitate his rehabilitation and to help effect positive conduct by him in prison.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b621 As we have held that the 60-year parole eligibility restriction, pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, does not apply, there is no need to address Olivares-Coster\u2019s other arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">\u00b622 The Judgment and Commitment of the District Court is reversed to the extent it provides that the \u201cdefendant shall be parole eligible after sixty (60) years of incarceration.\u201d Upon remand, the District Court shall strike this provision. In all other respects, the sentence is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b414-7\">JUSTICES WHEAT and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b414-8\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AhF\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u00b623 I join the Court\u2019s Opinion, with the following caveat.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">\u00b624 Underlying the District Court\u2019s sentencing decision, and implicit in the arguments in this appeal, is the assumption that the District Court had statutory authority to place a partial parole-eligibility restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s sentence. In my view, this assumption is mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">\u00b625 As the Court states, a district court does not have the power to impose a sentence unless authorized by a specific grant of statutory authority. Opinion, \u00b6 11. As I have argued previously, \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, does not specifically grant a district court authority to place conditions on parole eligibility or, more relevant to the present case, to impose a partial restriction on parole eligibility. <em>State v. Holt, </em>2011 MT 42, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46, 359 Mont. 308, 249 P.3d 470 (Nelson &amp; Cotter, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). There is one-and only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>one-restriction authorized by this statute, as evidenced by the statute\u2019s repeated references to \u201cthe restriction.\u201d And \u201cthe restriction\u201d which the statute authorizes is \u201cthe restriction that the offender is ineligible for parole ... while serving that term [of imprisonment]\u201d-period. Either the offender is deemed ineligible for parole while serving the term of imprisonment, or he is not. For this reason, I would overrule <em>State v. Kirkbride, </em>2008 MT 178, \u00b6 18, 343 Mont. 409, 185 P.3d 340, and <em>State v. Bullman, </em>2009 MT 37, \u00b6 34, 349 Mont. 228, 203 P.3d 768, both of which construed \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA, contrary to its plain language. <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 46 n. 2 (Nelson &amp; Cotter, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b626 In the present case, Olivares-Coster was less than 18 years of age at the time he committed the offenses. As such, he is not subject to restrictions on parole eligibility. Opinion, \u00b6 12; \u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA. Had Olivares-Coster been 18 years of age or older at the time, then the District Court could have imposed the restriction that he would be ineligible for parole <em>for the entire term of his imprisonment. </em>Section 46-18-202(2), MCA. But regardless of Olivares-Coster\u2019s age, the District Court never had express statutory authority to place a partial, 60-year restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s parole eligibility. Under the statutory scheme, a sentencing judge has express authority to say that an inmate will <em>never </em>be parole eligible. Section 46-18-202(2), MCA. But that is the extent of the judge\u2019s authority. If the judge does not impose that restriction, then the decision as to whether, when, and under what conditions an inmate becomes eligible for parole is exclusively the prerogative of the parole board. <em>Holt, </em>\u00b6 64 (Nelson &amp; Cotter, JJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Any suggestion to the contrary is, in my view, incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b627 With the foregoing caveat, I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b415-6\">JUSTICE COTTER joins the Concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b415-7\">JUSTICE BAKER,</author>\n<p id=\"A8Y_\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AEW\">\u00b628 I concur with the Court\u2019s conclusion that the thirty-year parole eligibility restriction for life sentences contained in \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA, does not apply in this case because Olivares-Coster was less than eighteen years of age at the time the offense was committed. Section 46-18-222(1), MCA, creates an explicit exception to statutory restrictions on parole eligibility for offenders under eighteen at the time of the offense. <em>See Graham v. Florida, </em>130 S. Ct. 2011, 2036 (Appendix) and 2049 n. 6 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (2010) (both opinions pointing out that the Montana statute forbids life without parole for juvenile offenders). In my view, the statutes do not conflict; rather, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u00a7 46-18-222(1), MCA, creates an explicit and unambiguous exception from \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA. It is therefore unnecessary to apply the rules of statutory interpretation under which a specific provision controls over a general provision where the two are inconsistent. <em>See Opinion, </em>\u00b6 14; \u00a7 1-2-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b629 While I agree the District Court mistakenly assumed the statute requires a sixty-year parole eligibility restriction in this case, I disagree with the remedy chosen by the Court to correct the error. Consistent with <em>Heafner, </em>I would remand to the District Court to correct the illegal provision of the sentence rather than simply to strike the illegal condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b630 In cases decided since <em>Heafner, </em>we have followed \u201cthe better result\u201d of remanding for the district court to \u201ccorrect the illegal provision\u201d of the sentence. In <em>State v. Guill, </em>2011 MT 32, 359 Mont. 225, 248 P.3d 826, for example, we reversed the court\u2019s imposition of restitution where it had not reduced the obligation to a stated amount and remanded for correction of \u201cthis illegal provision.\u201d We allowed the court, on remand, to conduct \u201csuch further proceedings as it deems appropriate\u201d and to consider the relevant facts and circumstances in determining a specified amount of restitution. <em>Guill, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 52-53. In <em>State v. Lambert, </em>2010 MT 287, 359 Mont. 8, 248 P.3d 295, we noted that remand for resentencing was appropriate because \u201c[s]triking or vacating illegal conditions of a sentence when they could be corrected on remand could eliminate conditions that support important public policies such as protecting crime victims or rehabilitating the criminal.\u201d <em>Lambert, </em>\u00b6 14, <em>quoting Heafner, </em>\u00b6 12. <em>Peterson, </em>in contrast, involved an illegal imposition of a ten-year weapon enhancement, when the State had not included the weapon enhancement charge in the Information. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 13. Because the district court had expressly accepted the parties\u2019 plea agreement, but then erroneously appended the ten-year enhancement, we remanded with instructions to strike the illegal portion of the sentence. <em>Peterson, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b631 In this case, the District Court undoubtedly had authority to impose a parole eligibility restriction. See \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA; <em>State v. Kirkbride, </em>2008 MT 178, \u00b6\u00b6 16-21, 343 Mont. 409, 185 P.3d 340. The restriction the court imposed is illegal because of the court\u2019s erroneous application of \u00a7 46-23-201(4), MCA. That is a provision of the sentence that can be corrected. <em>Heafner, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\u00b632 As the Court observes, the sentencing court\u2019s oral pronouncements control over any discrepancy in the written judgment. <em>See Duncan, </em>\u00b6 51. In explaining its reasons for declining to impose any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>discretionary restriction on Olivares-Coster\u2019s eligibility for parole, the District Court assumed the statutory parole restriction would apply, stating, \u201c60 years down the road is a long time.\u201d Given this explanation, I believe the sentencing court should be given the opportunity to consider whether to impose any parole eligibility restriction at all. To the extent the Court limits the District Court to merely striking the parole eligibility restriction on remand, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-4\">JUSTICE RICE joins in the concurring and dissenting opinion of JUSTICE BAKER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
