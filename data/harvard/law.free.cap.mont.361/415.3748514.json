The elementary school is located in Lodge Pole, Montana, and the high school is located in Hays, Montana. During these years, King became a tenured employee and held positions of elementary school teacher, elementary school principal, and high school principal. In June 2009, after King had served as the high school principal for three school years, the School District Board of Trustees (Board) reassigned her to an elementary school teaching position. She protested and appealed the reassignment. The County Superintendent, and subsequently the State Superintendent, affirmed the Board\u2019s reassignment decision. King appealed to the First Judicial District Court. The District Court reversed the State Superintendent\u2019s ruling. We reverse and remand with instructions to reinstate the State Superintendent\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in concluding that the positions of teacher and principal are not comparable positions of employment under the applicable statutes and in reversing the State Superintendent\u2019s administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">\u00b63 The facts in this case are undisputed. Kang began working for the District in 1975. She taught elementary school in Lodge Pole from 1975 until 1991, at which time she was assigned to the position of elementary school principal in which she served from 1991 until 2001. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>She returned to elementary teaching through the 2005-06 school year. She was then assigned as the high school principal in Hays beginning with the 2006-07 school year and held this position through the 2008-09 school year. Following this three-year period spent as the high school principal, the Board reassigned her to the position of elementary teacher for the 2009-10 school year. The Board did not provide written notice of its intent to reassign King nor did it provide a formal hearing prior to the reassignment. The Board asserted no wrongdoing on King\u2019s part. Under King\u2019s 2009-10 contract as an elementary teacher, her salary was increased by more than $3,000 from her salary as principal and her required hours of work were reduced by 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">\u00b64 King accepted the reassignment under protest and on June 29, 2009, filed an appeal with Carol Elliott, the Blaine County Superintendent of Schools. King protested her reassignment from high school principal to elementary teacher, asserting that the principal position was not eliminated, there was no reduction in force, a levy did not fail, and the Board did not have good cause to reassign her. Elliott, scheduled for imminent retirement, recused herself, and Shirley Isbell, Hill County School Superintendent, presided over King\u2019s appeal. On November 12,2009, Isbell affirmed the Board\u2019s reassignment decision. King appealed Isbell\u2019s ruling to Denise Juneau, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Juneau concluded that the Board did not violate the law in reassigning King because the positions of \u201cteacher\u201d and \u201cprincipal\u201d are comparable positions of employment pursuant to \u00a7 20-4-203, MCA. She therefore affirmed Isbell\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"A5B\">\u00b65 King appealed to the District Court. After conducting a hearing, the District Court issued its Decision and Order. Relying on <em>Sorlie v. School Dist,, </em>205 Mont. 22, 667 P.2d 400 (1983), the District Court held that the Superintendent of Public Instruction erred in ruling that a principal position was comparable to a teaching position. The District Court stated: \u201cAlthough comparable in salary and tenure for purposes of reassignment in financial crisis, the two positions are not comparable for purposes of a reassignment such as the present one which was made for reasons not related to budget deficits.\u201d The court also used the dictionary definition of \u201ccomparable\u201d to conclude that King\u2019s principal position was not comparable to her reassigned teacher position because the jobs were functionally dissimilar. The District Court therefore reversed the Superintendent of Public Instruction and remanded the matter. The Board appeals. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">\u00b66 A district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute is a conclusion of law that we review for correctness. <em>Kulstad v. Maniaci, </em>2009 MT 403, \u00b6 6, 353 Mont. 467, 221 P.3d 127. An agency\u2019s conclusions of law are reviewed to determine if they are correct. This same standard of review is applicable to both the district court\u2019s review of the administrative decision and our subsequent review of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Pennaco Energy, Inc. v. Mont. Bd. of Envtl. Review, </em>2008 MT 425, \u00b6 18, 347 Mont. 415, 199 P.3d 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\u00b67 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that the positions of teacher and principal are not comparable positions of employment under the applicable statute and in reversing the State Superintendent\u2019s administrative decision?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">\u00b68 The Board\u2019s authority to reassign or transfer employees-even against the will of those employees-derives from multiple sources. Article X, Section 8 of the Montana Constitution provides: \u201cThe supervision and control of schools in each school district shall be vested in a board of trustees to be elected as provided by law.\u201d Additionally, \u00a7 20-3-324(1), MCA, states: \u201cAs prescribed elsewhere in this title, the trustees of each district shall: employ or dismiss a teacher, principal, or other assistant upon the recommendation of the district superintendent, the county high school principal, or other principal as the board considers necessary, accepting or rejecting any recommendation as the trustees in their sole discretion determine, in accordance with the provisions of Title 20, chapter 4.\u201d Lastly, \u00a7 39-31-303(2), MCA, allows public employers to operate and manage their affairs in such areas as hiring, promoting, transferring, assigning, and retaining employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">\u00b69 While the Board enjoys this broad authority, teachers and principals enjoy tenure. Tenure is a reward for longevity, among other things, the purpose of which is to provide educators with economic and job security. <em>Holmes v. Bd. of Trustees, </em>243 Mont. 263, 266, 792 P.2d 10, 12-13 (1990) (citing <em>Massey v. Argenbright, </em>211 Mont. 331, 683 P.2d 1332) (1984)); \u00a7 20-4-203(1), MCA. Therefore, when the Board is reassigning tenured employees, the Board must comply with \u00a7 20-4-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">\u00b610 The Board argues on appeal that \u00a7 20-4-203, MCA, allows the Board to reassign a tenured principal into a comparable teaching position providing the Board does it in a manner compliant with \u00a7 20-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>4-203, MCA. The Board asserts it did so in this case. King disagrees. \u00b611 The following statutes are relevant to the parties\u2019 arguments and our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Section 20-1-101(15), MCA, defines \u201cprincipal\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">a person who holds a valid class 3 Montana teacher certificate with an applicable principal\u2019s endorsement that has been issued by the superintendent of public instruction under the provisions of this title and the policies adopted by the board of public education and who has been employed by a district as a principal. For the purposes of this title, any reference to a teacher must be construed as including a principal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">Section 20-1-101(26), MCA, defines \u201cteacher\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-9\">a person, except a district superintendent, who holds a valid Montana teacher certificate that has been issued by the superintendent of public instruction under the provisions of this title and the policies adopted by the board of public education and who is employed by a district as a member of its instructional, supervisory, or administrative staff. This definition of a teacher includes a person for whom an emergency authorization of employment has been issued under the provisions of 20-4-111.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Section 20-4-203(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-11\">Except as provided in 20-4-208, whenever a teacher has been elected by the offer and acceptance of a contract for the fourth consecutive year of employment by a district in a position requiring teacher certification except as a district superintendent or specialist, the teacher is considered to be reelected from year to year as a tenured teacher at the same salary and in the same <em>or a comparable position of employment </em>as that provided by the last-executed contract -with the teacher unless the trustees resolve by majority vote of their membership to terminate the services of the teacher in accordance with the provisions of 20-4-204. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Finally, \u00a7 20-4-205, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-13\">(1) The trustees shall provide written notice by June 1 to all teachers who have been reelected. Any teacher who does not receive notice of reelection or termination is automatically reelected for the ensuing school fiscal year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-14\">(2) Any teacher who receives notification of reelection for the ensuing school fiscal year shall provide the trustees with written acceptance of the conditions of the reelection within 20 days after the receipt of the notice of reelection, and failure to notify the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>trustees within 20 days constitutes conclusive evidence of the teacher\u2019s nonacceptance of the tendered position.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b612 This case revolves around the meaning of the phrase \u201ccomparable position of employment\u201d set forth in \u00a7 20-4-203(1), MCA. King challenges the authority of the Board to reassign her when her principal position still exists, and argues that a teaching position is not comparable to her principal position. To determine if these positions are comparable, we first review the definitions of these positions created by the Legislature. As noted above, the definition of principal expressly includes teachers and the definition of teacher expressly includes administrative staff members. Because both definitions incorporate both positions, we must conclude that the Legislature intended them to be viewed, at least on some level, as comparable and inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b613 Additionally, we have addressed the comparability of teachers and principals in <em>Sorlie </em>and <em>Holmes. </em>In <em>Sorlie, </em>a tenured teacher working as an administrator but reassigned to a teaching position claimed her reassignment violated her tenure rights. Like King, Sorlie argued that the school district was required to reemploy her in the same job at the same pay. <em>Sorlie, </em>205 Mont, at 27, 667 P.2d at 403. However, unlike the case before us, Sorlie\u2019s administrative position was eliminated because of a failed levy and budgetary constraints. <em>Sorlie, </em>205 Mont, at 25, 667 P.2d at 401. Similarly, in <em>Holmes, </em>Holmes was reassigned to teaching when the high school principal position he had held for several years was eliminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b614 In <em>Sorlie, </em>the Court decided that while the two positions were functionally dissimilar, the school district did not violate Sorlie\u2019s tenure rights in reassigning her to the teaching staff based on legitimate financial constraints. The <em>Sorlie </em>Court continued, \u201cWe also hold that if a position similar to that previously held by the reassigned educator is available after program reductions or changes it <em>must </em>be offered to that person.\u201d <em>Sorlie, </em>205 Mont, at 30, 667 P.2d at 404 (emphasis in original). In <em>Holmes, </em>we concluded the positions of principal and teacher were comparable. <em>Holmes, </em>243 Mont, at 267,792 P.2d at 13. While <em>Sorlie </em>and <em>Holmes </em>are factually distinguishable from the case at bar, they nonetheless stand for the premise that under \u00a7 20-4-203(1), MCA, a tenured teacher may be reassigned from a functionally dissimilar administrative position to a teaching position when such reassignments are driven by financial constraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">\u00b615 In the case before us, however, Kang\u2019s position as principal was not eliminated; rather, it was given to someone else. Moreover, School <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>District fiscal or financial constraints were not an issue. We therefore address for the first time the comparability of these two positions in a context not driven by financial decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b616 First, we look to the language in <em>Sorlie </em>that the District Court interpreted to mean that functional similarity must be considered along with salary and tenure status when analyzing a reassignment that \u201cis not a consequence of budget shortages.\u201d We do not agree with the District Court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Sorlie. </em>Nothing in <em>Sorlie </em>suggests that one analysis of comparability of positions must apply in cases where budget shortages are present, and another must apply where budget shortages are not in play. The <em>Sorlie </em>Court did not conclude, as did the District Court in the instant case, that \u201ca comparable position of employment\u201d under the statute includes functional similarity in the positions as well as salary and tenure status when the reassignment is not a consequence of budget shortages. In fact, the <em>Sorlie </em>Court limited its holding to the situation before it, and did not project what might occur if a financial crisis was not present.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b617 We acknowledge, as noted by the District Court, that <em>Sorlie </em>did instruct that if a position similar to that previously held by the plaintiff became available again after program reductions had been completed, it must be offered to her. <em>See </em>\u00b6 14. However, as no explication or analysis whatsoever was offered for this holding, we cannot conclude it was intended to shape or dictate the course of future reassignments of tenured personnel. We decline to expand and extrapolate <em>Sorlie </em>beyond its context, and conclude the District Court erred in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">\u00b618 Our analysis of <em>Sorlie </em>is reinforced by our decision in <em>Massey. </em>Massey, a tenured teacher, was terminated when the department in which he taught experienced a staff reduction. When he sought to be reassigned to another teaching position held by a non-tenured teacher rather than be terminated, the district and the superintendent determined that the two teaching positions-business education and physical education-were not comparable. <em>Massey, </em>211 Mont, at 334, 683 P.2d at 1333. Relying on <em>Sorlie, </em>the district court reversed the superintendent, expressly noting that \u201cthe phrase \u2018comparable position of employment\u2019 cannot be given a broad meaning when a school district wishes to reassign a tenured teacher to another position, as was done in <em>Sorlie, </em>and at the same time be construed narrowly when a district chooses to terminate a tenured employee.\u201d <em>Massey, </em>211 Mont, at 337, 683 P.2d at 1335. We agreed with the district court and are persuaded by this reasoning. It makes no sense to say, nor is there any statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>language to support the notion, that the statutory phrase \u201ccomparable positions of employment\u201d means different things depending upon whether budget shortages are present or absent. For these reasons, we will not say teachers and principals are comparable positions when financial constraints exist but not when reassignment occurs for non-financial reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b619 We now turn to Kang\u2019s argument that under the language of \u00a7 20-4-203, MCA, she was entitled, upon reelection of employment by the District, to the \u201csame position of employment as provided by the last-executed contract or to a comparable position of employment as that provided by the last-executed contract.\u201d She opines that both superintendents ignored the language \u201cas provided by the last-executed contract,\u201d and the District Court properly corrected this oversight. We disagree. Were we to conclude that the statutory phrase \u201clast-executed contract\u201d dictated the outcome in reassignment situations, we would render superfluous the \u201cor a comparable position of employment\u201d language contained in the statute. As we have noted on numerous occasions, in construing a statute we are \u201csimply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to ... omit what has been inserted.\u201d <em>Kessel v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>2007 MT 305, \u00b6 18, 340 Mont. 92, 172 P.3d 599; \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b620  Therefore, construing \u00a7 20-4-203(1), MCA, as a whole, we conclude that reference to the phrase \u201clast-executed contract\u201d merely establishes that the salary and job description held by a tenured employee at the time the contract was executed cannot be ignored by the Board when the employee is subsequently retained or reassigned. The \u201ccomparable position\u201d language, however, allows the School District to retain a tenured employee in the same position at the same salary <em>or </em>to reassign the employee at the same salary to a comparable position to that identified in her last employment contract. As applied to the case before us, under her last-executed contract, King was a high school principal, working 207 days at a salary of $56,650. The Board in accordance with \u00a7 20-4-203(1), MCA, reassigned her to a teaching position. Under her new contract as an elementary teacher, King worked 187 days at a salary as $59,881. King therefore received more than her previous salary and was assigned a comparable position of employment, satisfying the requisites of \u00a7 20-4-203(1), MCA. Based on the applicable statutes and case law, we hold that a teacher position and a principal position are comparable positions under \u00a7 20-4-203(1), MCA, even in situations where one of the positions has not been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>eliminated for financial reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">\u00b621 Finally, we reject King\u2019s due process argument that the Board unlawfully failed to provide her with advance written notice of reassignment and an opportunity for a hearing to challenge her reassignment. Simply put, there are no statutes requiring such action by the Board. The fact that the Legislature expressly incorporated notice and hearing requirements when the Board decides to <em>terminate </em>a tenured employee shows that had the Legislature intended to provide the same protections to a reassigned tenured employee, it could have. Again, under \u00a7 1-2-101, MCA, we will not insert what the Legislature has chosen to omit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u00b622  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court incorrectly concluded that the positions of \u201cteacher\u201d and \u201cprincipal\u201d were not comparable positions in this case. As a result, it erred in reversing the State School Superintendent\u2019s administrative decision. We therefore reverse the District Court and remand this matter with instruction to reinstate the State Superintendent\u2019s decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b451-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
