Burlington Resources Oil &amp; Gas Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>(Burlington) leases the rights to oil and gas beneath Lang\u2019s surface estate. Lang appeals from the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and order of the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Fallon County, determining that Burlington had no obligation to compensate separately Lang for injecting wastewater into pore space beneath a well on Lang\u2019s property. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b62 We restate the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b63 <em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that Burlington could dispose of wastewater in a well on Lang\u2019s property without paying Lang separate compensation for use of the pore space beneath the well?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court incorrectly refuse to defer to witnesses employed by the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation in interpreting the Surface Owner Damage and Disruption Compensation Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\u00b65 Burlington produces oil through its operation of the 24,609-acre East Lookout Butte Unit (ELOB) in Fallon County. The surface estate owned by Lang falls within the boundaries of the ELOB. Burlington reinstated use of an abandoned well on Lang\u2019s property in 2008 for the disposal of wastewater produced in the ELOB operations. Lang asked Burlington to cease development of the wastewater disposal system.</p>\n<p id=\"Aee\">\u00b66 Burlington filed a complaint with the District Court to compel access to Lang\u2019s property. Lang counterclaimed that it had a right to compensation for use of the pore space beneath the abandoned well. The District Court held a two day bench trial. The court concluded that Lang had failed to prove entitlement to damages under the Surface Owner Damage and Disruption Compensation Act (SODDCA), \u00a7\u00a7 82-10-501 to -511, MCA. The court also concluded that Lang had not identified any common law or \u201cother\u201d right to separate compensation for Burlington\u2019s use of the pore space. Lang appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">\u00b67 Lang purchased the surface estate of the subject property from Frederic Votruba on April 10, 2003. Votruba reserved to himself all minerals lying beneath the surface of the property and the rights of removal. Votruba had executed an oil and gas lease (Votruba Lease) in 1992 with Burlington\u2019s predecessor, Meridian Oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">\u00b68 The Votruba Lease granted Meridian Oil the right to use the surface estate as necessary in oil and gas operations. The District Court determined that Votruba had transferred use of the subterranean pore space and the right to unitize the subject surface lands when he executed the Votruba Lease in 1992. The Votruba Lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>remained in effect at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\">\u00b69 Meridian drilled a well identified as #42-25 into the Red River Formation from Votruba\u2019s surface property in 1993. The Red River Formation comprises an oil field that lies between 8,964 feet and 9,240 feet below the surface measured from the Kelly Bushing elevation of 3004 feet above sea level. Meridian compensated Votruba for placing the #42-25 pad site and connected pipeline on his property. The well produced oil until 1995 when it lost pressure. Meridian plugged #42-25 in 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b610 Burlington petitioned the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation (MBOGC) in 1995 to unitize the Red River Formation into the ELOB so that it could extract additional oil and gas with secondary recovery efforts. Unitization required 80% of the owners of mineral interests inside the proposed ELOB to combine their individual mineral rights into a unit that could be operated jointly. Section 82-11-207, MCA (1995). The producers divide proceeds from the unit operation per share among the individual owners of the mineral interest. Section 82-11-202, MCA. Lang\u2019s three individual shareholders each received approximately $78,000 as royalty payments in 2008 for their interest in the ELOB.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b611 Burlington developed a Unit Plan for the ELOB. MBOGC approved unitization of the Red River Formation in 1995. The Unit Plan granted Burlington the \u201cright to use as much of the surface of the land within the Unit Area as may be reasonably necessary for the operation and the development of the Unit Area.\u201d The Unit Plan further incorporated SODDCA for determination of any damages to surface property.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b612 Unitization of the Red River Formation allowed Burlington to use secondary recovery techniques to extract oil from the Red River Formation. Burlington injected water into the Red River Formation to raise its pressure in order to drive oil to wellheads. Burlington began extracting water from the Dakota and Swift Formations through #42-25 in 1997 to inject into the Red River Formation. The Dakota and Swift Formations are non-unitized geologic areas beneath #42-25 that fall within the boundaries of Lang\u2019s surface estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\u00b613 The water injected by Burlington into the Red River Formation increased oil production, but also caused additional water taken up at the wellheads. Burlington produced about three barrels of water for each barrel of oil in 2009 and 2010. Burlington pumped this wastewater into disposal wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">\u00b614 Burlington applied on February 26, 2003, for permission from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>MBOGC to convert #42-25 into a wastewater disposal well. MBOGC approved the application on May 15,2003. Burlington notified Lang in 2008 of its intent to reconstitute #42-25. This change to #42-25 would require Burlington to lay some new pipe to the well and develop a pumping station. Burlington offered Lang $2,600 as SODDCA damages for these surface disruptions. Lang rejected the offer. Burlington began construction on August 5, 2008. Lang approached Burlington\u2019s crew and asked them to stop working and leave the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">\u00b615 Burlington initiated these proceedings to determine its right to use and access #42-25 and to determine the amount owed to Lang for the surface developments on Lang\u2019s property. Lang counterclaimed with a trespass claim and sought separate compensation for Burlington\u2019s use of the well. The court entered a stipulation temporarily enjoining Lang from interfering with Burlington\u2019s development and use of #42-25. Burlington began disposing wastewater into #42-25 as of January 2009. Burlington had disposed of more than two million barrels of wastewater from approximately 150 ELOB wells into #42-25 at the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b616 The District Court determined that disposal of wastewater in #42-25 constituted a reasonably necessary production activity within the unitized Red River Formation. The court concluded that Lang had failed to identify any statutory or common law right to receive separate compensation for Burlington\u2019s injection of wastewater into the pore space beneath #42-25. The court granted Lang $5,500 in SODDCA damages for Burlington\u2019s development of the pipeline and pumping station on the surface estate of Lang\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b617 We review the factual findings of a district court sitting without a jury to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. <em>Eldredge v. Asarco Inc., </em>2011 MT 80, \u00b6 30, 360 Mont. 112, 252 P.3d 182. A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial evidence, if the district court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Id. </em>We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party when determining whether substantial credible evidence supports the district court\u2019s findings. <em>Id. </em>We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\">\u00b618 <em>Did the District Court correctly conclude that Burlington could dispose of wastewater in a well on Lang\u2019s property without paying Lang separate compensation for use of the pore space beneath the well?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b619 Lang argues that the pore space of the Swift and Dakota Formations below #42-25 belongs to his surface estate rather than to the mineral estate leased by Burlington. Lang seeks separate compensation from Burlington for its use of this pore space. We first consider who owns the pore space.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">\u00b620 We analyze the deeds and severance documents to determine who owns the pore space beneath #42-25. Votruba owned title to the subject land in fee simple before 1992. Votruba\u2019s ownership entitled him to everything permanently situated beneath or above the surface of the land. Section 70-16-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b621 Votruba entered an oil and gas lease with Meridian in 1992. The Votruba Lease granted Meridian the \u201cexclusive right for the purpose of mining, exploring by geophysical and other methods, and operating for the producing therefrom oil and all gas.\u201d The Votruba Lease further granted Meridian the right \u201cto pool or unitize\u201d the leasehold estate and the mineral estate with other land or leases in the immediate vicinity \u201cfor the production of oil and gas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">\u00b622 MBOGC and 80% of all the mineral interest owners within the ELOB agreed to unitization of the Red River Formation in 1995. The Unit Plan governing the ELOB granted Burlington the \u201cright to use as much of the surface of the land within the Unit Area as may be reasonably necessary for the operation and the development of the Unit Area.\u201d The Unit Plan granted Burlington the \u201cright to use the unit surface, including roads, rights-of-way, easements, and surfaces leases and facilities, where necessary to conduct unit operations.\u201d The Unit Plan provided that damages to the surface estate would be governed according to SODDCA. The Unit Plan contains no reference to ownership of pore space.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">\u00b623 Votruba\u2019s fee simple estate entitled him to everything permanently situated beneath or above the surface of the land. Section 70-16-101, MCA. When Votruba sold the property to Lang in 2003, he reserved to himself only the right to \u201call of the coal, oil, gas, and other minerals in and under\u201d the surface lands as well as the rights of exploration, mining, and removal. Lang obtained by the 2003 deed all rights to the subject property not reserved to Votruba. The 2003 deed did not reserve to Votruba ownership of the pore space or other non-mineral materials. The 2003 deed reserved only the minerals and the</p>\n<p id=\"b440-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>rights of exploration, mining, and removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">\u00b624 Nothing in the Votruba Lease or the Unit Plan contradicts the extent of the ownership interest transferred to Lang by the 2003 deed. The pore space beneath Lang\u2019s property belongs to Lang\u2019s surface estate in the same manner that all the non-mineral material beneath the physical boundaries of Lang\u2019s property belongs to Lang\u2019s surface estate. <em>See Moser v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>676 S.W.2d 99, 102 (Tex. 1984); <em>Emeny v. U.S., </em>412 F.2d 1319 (Ct. Cl. 1969); <em>Humble Oil &amp; Refining Co. v. West, </em>508 S.W.2d 812, 815 (Tex. 1974); <em>Cassinos v. Union Oil Co., </em>14 Cal. App. 4th 1770, 1782-83 (Cal App. 2nd Dist. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">\u00b625 This conclusion does not end our inquiry. Burlington\u2019s interest in the mineral estate acquired through the 1992 lease provides more than the right to the minerals themselves. The 1992 lease also provides Burlington with the right to use Lang\u2019s estate to facilitate the removal of the minerals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u00b626 Montana law permits the owner of a dominant mineral estate to use reasonably the surface estate in the production of the mineral. <em>Hunter v. Rosebud Co., </em>240 Mont. 194, 198, 783 P.2d 927, 929 (1989); <em>Hurley v. N. Pac. Ry., </em>153 Mont. 199, 202-03, 455 P.2d 321, 323 (1969). The Unit Plan also granted Burlington a right to use Lang\u2019s surface estate where necessary to conduct unit operations, subject to SODDCA damages. The District Court concluded that Burlington\u2019s disposal of wastewater into #42-25 constituted a reasonable use necessary for the production of oil within the ELOB. Lang agrees that Burlington\u2019s use was reasonable. Lang argues, however, that SODDCA and the common law require Burlington to pay separate compensation for use of the pore space.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">\u00b627 Lang argues first that SODDCA requires Burlington to pay a per barrel fee to dispose of wastewater into the pore space. SODDCA requires Burlington to pay Lang for \u201closs of agricultural production and income, lost land value, and lost value of improvements\u201d caused by Burlington\u2019s oil and gas operations. Section 82-10-504(l)(a), MCA. The District Court determined that Lang had failed to provide evidence that Burlington\u2019s use of the pore space affected Lang\u2019s interest in the land value, agricultural production, or value to improvements, as set forth under SODDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">\u00b628  Lang conceded that use of the pore space in the Dakota and Swift Formations did not affect its agricultural production and income. Lang provided no evidence that injecting wastewater into the pore space lessened the value of the land. Lang admitted that it had not lost value in improvements to the land. Finally, Lang offered no evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>that the pore space underlying its land had been degraded, damaged, devalued, or otherwise consumed by Burlington\u2019s use ofthe pore space. The District Court correctly concluded that Lang had failed to offer evidence of separate compensable damages under the elements specifically enumerated in SODDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\">\u00b629 Burlington hired George Luther to appraise damages to Lang1 s property. Luther has over 26 years of appraisal experience and has appraised over 1,000 properties. Luther had never valued, or heard of any other appraiser valuing, pore space. Luther testified that no demonstrable market exists for pore space. Luther opined that Burlington\u2019s development activities of the pipeline and pumping station in 2008 had caused $5,500 in SODDCA damages to the surface of Lang\u2019s property. Lang offered no separate expert appraisal of damages. Lang agreed that Luther\u2019s calculations constituted a fair estimate of lost land value under SODDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">\u00b630 Lang insisted, however, that \u00a7 82-10-501(2)(c), MCA, requires that a landowner be made whole for all impacts upon the surface estate. Section 82-10-501(2)(c), MCA, provides the purpose statement for SODDCA. It provides that \u201cowners of the surface estate should be justly compensated for use of their property and interference with the use of their property due to oil and gas development.\u201d Section 82-10-501(2)(c), MCA. The District Court concluded that the more specific provision for damages at \u00a7 82-10-504(l)(a), MCA, controlled over the broad purpose statement in \u00a7 82-10-501, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\u00b631 We agree, in this instance, that Lang\u2019s broad \u201cmade whole\u201d interpretation of \u00a7 82-10-501(2)(c), MCA, could render meaningless the more explicit provision of damages contained in \u00a7 82-10-504(l)(a), MCA. We recognize that the provision authorizing compensation for \u201clost land value\u201d under \u00a7 82-10-504(l)(a), MCA, could encompass damage sustained by a surface estate owner for the use of pore space. Lang made no claim for \u201clost land value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">\u00b632 Lang instead claimed a right to separate compensation for Burlington\u2019s use of the pore space. Lang points to testimony from seven witnesses before the District Court who testified that other landowners have received a fee for wastewater disposal as a matter of industry custom. SODDCA sets forth no element of compensation to landowners for the use of pore space according to industry custom. SODDCA requires compensation only for \u201closs of agricultural production and income, lost land value, and lost value of improvements.\u201d Lang failed to offer evidence of losses to the surface estate compensable under SODDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>\u00b633 Lang raised a trespass claim in the District Court. Section 82-10-511, MCA, provides that SODDCA does not preclude Lang from seeking other legal remedies. The District Court concluded that Lang had \u201cnot identified any common law or \u2018other\u2019 right to compensation.\u201d We need not consider the viability of any trespass or other common law claims potentially available to Lang as Lang has not explained its trespass claim or other common law claim on appeal. Lang argues that the common law supports its right to compensation, but fails to provide this Court with authority to support its argument. Lang cites only to \u00a7\u00a7 82-10-501(2)(c) and -504(l)(a), MCA, as authority for the argument that a landowner can recover compensation for use of the landowner\u2019s surface estate. We already have determined that Lang failed to establish that it was due separate compensation under those provisions of SODDCA and the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">\u00b634 <em>Did the District Court incorrectly refuse to defer to witnesses employed by the Montana Board of Oil and Gas Conservation in interpreting the Surface Owner Damage and Disruption Compensation Act?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">\u00b635 Lang argues that the District Court should have deferred to the opinion of two witnesses employed by the MBOGC whom Lang deposed before trial. The witnesses testified that Burlington should have compensated Lang for use of the pore space based on their experience in the oil industry and based on their interpretation of the relevant statutes. Lang equates the opinions of these two witnesses with an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">\u00b636 This Court generally grants deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. <em>See e.g. Lewis v. B &amp; B Pawnbrokers, Inc., </em>1998 MT 302, \u00b6 43, 292 Mont. 82, 968 P.2d 1145. The witnesses who provided their opinions here, however, provided opinions in their individual capacities. Their expert opinion does not equate with an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute. Lang cites no authority for the proposition that we should defer to a witness\u2019s interpretation of the statute, expert or otherwise, merely because the witness works for an administrative agency. We decline to search for any such authority. \u00b637 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b442-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
