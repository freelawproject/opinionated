We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">\u00b62 The parties raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">\u00b63 <em>Did Headapohl\u2019s addition of two detached outbuildings to the property constitute increased use of the septic system that violated the Health Code?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">\u00b64 <em>Did the District Court incorrectly rely on information outside the administrative record in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">\u00b65 <em>Does an incinerating toilet constitute a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system\u201d under the Health Code?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b497-14\">\u00b66 Headapohl lives on a 12-acre lot in the floodplain of the Bitterroot River near the confluence with the Clark Fork River. The Department issued a septic permit in 1983 to Headapohl\u2019s predecessor in interest for a septic system that could service a three bedroom trailer house. The Health Code sizes septic systems by the number of bedrooms the septic systems service. The Health Code requires a septic system with 300 gallons of capacity for a 3-bedroom house. The Health Code requires an additional 50 gallons of capacity for every additional bedroom in a structure serviced by the septic system. Floodplain restrictions prohibit expansion of the septic system on the Headapohl property. Headapohl cannot build additional bedrooms consequently onto the residence without a permit or variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-15\">\u00b67 Headapohl purchased the property in 1993. Headapohl replaced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>the three bedroom trailer with a new 2358 square foot house. The Department approved Headapohl\u2019s plan to build the house pursuant to a septic permit that provided Headapohl with the same exemption as the one afforded her predecessor for the trailer house. The permit included a memorandum from a Department employee regarding the sewage system that stated, \u201c[tjhree bedroom use is maximum potential for this lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">\u00b68 Despite the admonition in the permit memorandum, Headapohl moved two buildings from a nearby farm to the floodplain property in 2007. Headapohl sited the buildings approximately 100 feet from the main residence. Headapohl did not obtain permits or inquire about the necessity of permits. Headapohl made no effort to contact the Department or any County entity. The Board claims that Headapohl\u2019s actions in moving the buildings and placing them on concrete pilings required permits from the Public Works/Building Inspector, the Floodplain Administrator, and the Department.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b69 Headapohl remodeled the buildings\u2019 interiors and exteriors, installed wiring and heating systems, and built decks and pathways for the buildings. Headapohl did not directly connect the buildings to the water or septic system of the primary residence. Headapohl installed an incinerating toilet in one of the buildings. One building contains a single room and the other building contains two rooms. The finished buildings look and feel like houses. The finished buildings are suitable for human occupancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">\u00b610 Headapohl uses one of the buildings for yoga, meditation, and prayer. The building contains a harp, drums, and a music system. The other building contains 40 years of accumulated yarn, a large loom, and art supplies. Headapohl uses this building for art projects. Headapohl hosts three to five friends for art project activities in this building. These social art activities previously had taken place in the main house.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">\u00b611 The Department and Floodplain Administrator received inquiries from neighbors who wanted to build in the area. The neighbors pointed to Headapohl\u2019s new buildings in the floodplain as the impetus for their request. The Department had no previous knowledge of the two additional buildings on Headapohl\u2019s property. The Department investigated and issued a Notice of Violation (NOV) to Headapohl on May 12, 2009. The NOV informed Headapohl that the additional buildings violated the Health Code and would require removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b612 Headapohl requested an informal administrative review of the NOV before the Department. The Department held a hearing. Headapohl disclosed the installation of the incinerating toilet. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Headapohl claimed that the buildings contained no beds and that Headapohl did not intend the buildings to serve as bedrooms. The Board asserts that Headapohl admitted at this hearing that the buildings could be used by family and visitors as a place to sleep. The minutes from the meeting indicate that Headapohl acknowledged that the buildings could be used as a place for visitors to \u201cstay.\u201d The Department issued an Amended NOV in light of this information.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">\u00b613 The Amended NOV informed Headapohl that the two structures constituted \u201cincreased use\u201d of the septic system in violation of the Health Code. The Amended NOV informed Headapohl that the structures did not have to be connected physically to the septic system to be \u201cserved\u201d by the septic system. The Amended NOV explained that \u201c[w]hen persons occupy a building or buildings served by a septic system each additional occupant adds sewage load resulting from black-water flows, kitchen flows, bathing flows, bathroom flows, and laundry flows.\u201d The Amended NOV required Headapohl to remove the buildings and the un-permitted incinerating toilet. Headapohl unplugged the incinerating toilet after learning that it violated the Health Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u00b614 The Board held a hearing at Headapohl\u2019s request on August 20, 2009. The Department argued that Headapohl had increased use of the septic system by increasing the number of bedrooms beyond that allowed under Headapohl\u2019s 1983 permit. The Department argued that the Health Code defined bedroom as any room capable of use for sleeping, including unfinished basements. The Department routinely views any room that can be used for sleeping as a bedroom. The Health Code notes that \u201c[a]ny space or room such as a den, study, storage area, or any area that can be easily converted to a bedroom shall be considered an additional bedroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b615 The Department looks at potential use of rooms rather than intended uses because intended uses change with changes in ownership. The Department provided, for example, that it commonly includes bedrooms that are not enclosed or under the roof of the primary structure when it sizes cabins. The Department explained that a building with the septic system can service detached buildings. The Department believed that Headapohl\u2019s addition of the three bedrooms in the two new buildings could increase the effluent flow to Headapohl\u2019s septic system. Headapohl confirmed that when her daughter visited, she could \u201csleep in the buildings or sleep on the lawn or sleep in a tent, that was up to her.\u201d Headapohl maintained, however, that she did not intend to have visitors sleep in the new buildings. The Department argued that even if Headapohl did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>intend to allow others to sleep in the buildings, the buildings could be used as bedrooms for overnight guests by either Headapohl or Headapohl\u2019s successors in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b616 The Board affirmed the Department\u2019s Amended NOV by a 4-1 vote following the parties\u2019 presentations at the August 20, 2009, hearing. Headapohl petitioned for judicial review in the District Court on October 7, 2009. Headapohl argued that the Board incorrectly had applied the Health Code, acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and that the definition of \u201cincreased use\u201d suffered unconstitutional vagueness on its face and as-applied to Headapohl. The Department responded on November 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">\u00b617 The Board meanwhile amended the Health Code\u2019s definition of bedroom specifically to include detached buildings. The Board completed these amendments on October 15, 2009. Headapohl filed a notice with the court that the matter had been \u201cfully briefed\u201d and was \u201cripe for adjudication\u201d on March 23,2010. The court issued an order on June 3, 2010, that stated that the court did \u201cnot appear to have a complete record before it on appeal.\u201d The District Court ordered the Board to provide a copy of the Health Code as amended in 2009, a copy of the 2007 Health Code, and \u201cany discussion, comments or rationalizations\u201d concerning the 2009 amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">\u00b618 The court issued its final decision on July 12, 2010. The court concluded that Headapohl had not violated the Health Code by adding the two buildings, that the contested provisions of the Health Code suffered unconstitutional vagueness as-applied to Headapohl, and that the incinerating toilet did not qualify as a wastewater treatment and disposal system under the Health Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">\u00b619 We review district court orders that review an administrative decision in a contested case under the same standard applied by the district court. <em>Whitehall Wind, LLC v. Mont. Pub. Serv. Commn., </em>2010 MT 2, \u00b6 15, 355 Mont. 15, 223 P.3d 907. We review to determine whether the administrative agency\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the agency correctly has interpreted the law. <em>Id. </em>We review for correctness a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>Plains Grains L.P. v. Bd. of Co. Commrs., </em>2010 MT 155, \u00b6 21, 357 Mont. 61, 238 P.3d 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">\u00b620 <em>Did Headapohl\u2019s addition of two detached outbuildings to the property constitute increased use of the septic system that violated the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number><em>Health Code?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b621 The 2007 Health Code contains a section entitled \u201cIncreased Use, Changes of Use And Enlargement of Structures\u201d that prohibits a person from \u201coperat[ing] an existing system that has increased use.\u201d The 2007 Health Code defines \u201cincreased use\u201d as \u201cthe enlargement or change in use of a structure served by a wastewater treatment and disposal system where the enlargement or change in use would potentially increase the effluent flow from the structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b622 The definition additionally provides that increased use \u201cincludes but is not limited to\u201d enlargement of a residence by adding one or more spaces that can be used as bedrooms. Increased use also includes increasing a room or building\u2019s total square footage in a way that could lead to increased use in the future. Both situations describe physical enlargements to the residence. As a result, the court concluded that the definition of \u201cincreased use\u201d contemplated only physical enlargements or additions to Headapohl\u2019s residence itself. The court\u2019s interpretation fails to give effect to the part of the definition of \u201cincreased use\u201d that includes \u201cchange in use\u201d of a structure served by a wastewater treatment and disposal system that \u201cwould potentially increase the effluent flow from the structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b623 The parties do not dispute that Headapohl did not physically enlarge the three-bedroom residence on the property. Headapohl placed the two buildings at least 100 feet from the three-bedroom residence. Headapohl\u2019s primary residence remains at a total 2358 square feet. The court concluded that a \u201cplain reading\u201d of the 2007 Health Code did not prohibit Headapohl\u2019s \u201cfreestanding buildings.\u201d The court\u2019s \u201cplain reading\u201d of the 2007 Health Code considers, however, only a partial reading of the definition of \u201cincreased use.\u201d \u00b624 The court failed to consider the full definition of \u201cincreased use.\u201d Increased use encompasses \u201cthe enlargement <em>or change in use </em>of a structure.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The definition of \u201cincreased use\u201d plainly states that the concept \u201cincludes but is not limited to the enlargement of a residence.\u201d The District Court\u2019s order fails entirely to address whether Headapohl\u2019s \u201cchange in use\u201d of the structure \u201cwould potentially increase the effluent flow from the structure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u00b625 Headapohl\u2019s modification of the two buildings from agricultural uses to domestic uses in which she engages in activities previously performed in the 2358 square foot residence raises the prospect of an increase in effluent flow. The Department argued to the District Court that the activities taking place in the two additional buildings likely would increase the number of people who would need \u201cto go to the house in order to go to the bathroom, bathe, wash hands, prepare food, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>do laundry and clean.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b626 The Department raises the issue that Headapohl has changed the use of her primary residence by adding two buildings to her property and using those buildings to provide space for storage and functions previously served by her primary residence. Headapohl uses the two buildings as shrines, for meditation and yoga, for storing 40 years of accumulated fiber art projects and supplies, and for knitting, weaving and music. The storage of materials and other activities previously may have taken place in the Headapohl residence. The Department argues that Headapohl\u2019s efforts to outsource her storage and hobby activities by adding the two outbuildings has increased the capacity of Headapohl or her successors in interest to use the property, to host guests and gatherings, and to take in additional occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u00b627 Headapohl has admitted that the social art gatherings in the craft building included three to five guests. Headapohl previously had hosted these activities in the primary residence. Headapohl claims that she does not intend that guests sleep in the buildings, but has acknowledged that the restored, heated, and wired buildings could be used as a place where persons could sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b628  We remand to the District Court to review the administrative record under the complete definition of \u201cincreased use\u201d as defined in the 2007 Health Code. This \u201cincreased use\u201d could take the form of \u201cenlargement\u201d or \u201cchange in use\u201d of a structure. The District Court should have the opportunity in the first instance to determine whether Headapohl\u2019s actions constitute an \u201cincreased use\u201d under either part of the definition that potentially would increase effluent flow to her septic system. <em>McDonald v. Dept. of Envtl. Quality, </em>2009 MT 209, \u00b6 66, 351 Mont. 243, 214 P.3d 749. We need not address the court\u2019s constitutional determinations in light of our decision. <em>Weidow v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2010 MT 292, \u00b6 22, 359 Mont. 77, 246 P.3d 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">\u00b629 <em>Did the District Court incorrectly rely on information outside the administrative record in reviewing the Board\u2019s decision?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u00b630 The Board held the Headapohl hearing on August 20, 2009. The Board followed and applied the version of the Health Code in effect at that time. The Board amended the Health Code on October 15, 2009. The 2009 amendments changed the definition of \u201cbedroom\u201d to include separate buildings that are not attached to the plumbed structure.</p>\n<p id=\"Ako\">\u00b631 Headapohl appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the District Court on October 7,2009. Headapohl argued in her January 28,2010, brief that the Board had amended the definition of \u201cbedroom\u201d on October 15, 2009, because of the vagueness in its definition regarding outbuildings. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>The District Court issued an order on June 3, 2010, that stated the court\u2019s belief that it did not have a complete record before it on appeal. The court ordered the Board to provide a copy of the current Health Code, a copy of the one in effect on the day of the Board\u2019s hearing, and \u201cany discussion, comments or rationalizations\u201d concerning the 2009 amendments to the Health Code. The Board complied without objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">\u00b632 The Board argues that the District Court incorrectly relied on the requested documents. We note that the District Court relied on the additional documents only in its constitutional analysis. We have declined to address the constitutional issues in light of our decision to reverse the District Court\u2019s incomplete interpretation of \u201cincreased use.\u201d Whether the District Court incorrectly relied on the additional 2009 documents does not bear on our conclusion on that issue. The District Court may address the propriety of considering the additional 2009 amendment documents in its review of the administrative record on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b633 <em>Does an incinerating toilet constitute a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system\u201d under the Health Code?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u00b634  The Board appeals the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the incinerating toilet installed by Headapohl does not constitute a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system.\u201d The Health Code defines \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system\u201d as \u201cany wastewater system ... which receives human excreta, liquid waste, or both; treats the effluent; and disposes of the effluent through application into or onto the soil, or into any device, sealed vault, or holding tank.\u201d The toilet installed by Headapohl receives human excreta and liquid waste. The toilet treats the effluent and liquid waste by incinerating the matter into water vapor and ash. The toilet collects the ash in a receptacle that must be emptied with use. We agree with the Board that the incinerating toilet meets the definition of \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b635 Headapohl first argues that the Health Code prohibits only subsurface systems. The Health Code provides, however, that a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system\u201d disposes of effluent \u201cinto or onto the soil, or into any device.\u201d Headapohl\u2019s incinerating toilet disposes of effluent into a device. The Health Code recognizes that wastewater treatment and disposal systems can be \u201cconventional systems\u201d or \u201calternative systems.\u201d The definition of \u201cconventional system\u201d requires that the system be \u201csubsurface\u201d and consist of \u201ca septic tank and a drainfield.\u201d The definition of \u201calternative systems\u201d broadly includes \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal systems <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>approved by the Department to be used in lieu of conventional systems.\u201d Alternative systems include systems used above the surface of the ground. Headapohl\u2019s incinerating toilet constitutes an \u201calternative\u201d system that disposes of waste above the surface of the ground. We reject Headapohl\u2019s argument that the system must dispose of the effluent underground in order to fall within the ambit of the Health Code\u2019s prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">\u00b636 Headapohl next argues that the Health Code allows waterless toilets. We agree that the Health Code allows a waterless toilet as an \u201calternative system\u201d when the installer has obtained the requisite permit. Headapohl has not obtained a permit. Headapohl makes no plausible claim of having the incinerating toilet grandfathered under the 1983 permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">\u00b637 Headapohl finally argues that she fully complied with the Amended NOV by unplugging the toilet before the August 20, 2009, hearing. Headapohl argues that the Board improperly affirmed the Amended NOV\u2019S declaration regarding the toilet in light of her compliance. We disagree with Headapohl\u2019s circular argument that a person can fall in and out of compliance with the Health Code simply by plugging and unplugging an incinerating toilet.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">\u00b638  Headapohl petitioned the Board to review the Department\u2019s Amended NOV. Headapohl may have informed the Board at the August 20, 2009, hearing that the toilet had been unplugged, but Headapohl did not drop the challenge to the Department\u2019s Amended NOV that the toilet did not qualify as a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system.\u201d The Board correctly concluded that Headapohl had installed a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system\u201d in violation of the Health Code. The Board correctly affirmed the Amended NOV even though Headapohl apparently had unplugged the toilet by the August 20, 2009, hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u00b639 We reverse the District Court\u2019s conclusion and judgment that Headapohl had not increased use of the septic system by adding the yoga studio and craft cottage to the floodplain property. The court considered only increased uses caused by physical enlargements to the residence. The court failed to consider increased use caused by a \u201cchange in use\u201d of the structure that potentially would \u201cincrease effluent flow from the structure.\u201d We remand to the District Court to determine whether Headapohl\u2019s changes of use could result in increased effluent flow to the permitted three-bedroom septic system. We further conclude that Headapohl\u2019s incinerating toilet requires a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>permit under the Health Code as a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b505-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES COTTER and BAKER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b505-5\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"ALT\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b640 I would affirm the District Court\u2019s decision in every respect. However, because this case is being remanded, and because the Court has not reached the constitutional issues, Opinion, \u00b6 28, those vagueness issues can again be considered and disposed of on remand. \u00b641 That said, I simply cannot agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion that Headapohl\u2019s incinerating toilet meets the definition of \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 34. This determination is, at best, preposterous. The toilet is electric; it is not plumbed into the sewage disposal system, nor does it empty into the ground. Rather, the toilet disposes of solid and liquid human waste by electrical incineration. The end result of the toilet\u2019s operation is nothing but ash, which is disposed of (according to the toilet\u2019s instructions) by putting the ash into a garbage can. The Court\u2019s conclusion is akin to equating a restroom hand air-dryer with a dispenser of paper towels.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">\u00b642 More to the point, that the administrative regulations at issue here can be interpreted to reach the result that the Court reaches in Issue 3 speaks volumes about vagueness. Penal statutes-and, presumably, administrative regulations-must be written \u201c \u2018with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Knudson, </em>2007 MT 324, \u00b6 18, 340 Mont. 167, 174 P.3d 469 (quoting <em>Kolender v. Lawson, </em>461 U.S. 352, 357, 103 S. Ct. 1855, 1858 (1983)). The administrative regulations at issue in this case fail on both counts. I refuse to believe that any ordinary citizen would conclude that an electric, incinerating toilet violates the Missoula City-County Health Code because it is a \u201cwastewater treatment and disposal system.\u201d Indeed, upon being so advised, I expect that most ordinary citizens would consider themselves to be the butt of a bad joke.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00b643 The District Court got it right, and its decision should be affirmed. I dissent from this Court\u2019s contrary holding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
