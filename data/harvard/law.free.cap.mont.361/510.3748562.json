In addition to the costs of repair, Hop sought \u201cresidual diminished value\u201d (RDV) for his vehicle. RDV is the difference between the value of a vehicle immediately before an accident and the value of the vehicle after post-accident repairs have been made. When Safeco failed to pay RDV, Hop moved the Eighteenth Judicial District Court to certify a class action against the insurer. Hop sought, on behalf of himself and all proposed class members, injunctive and declaratory relief and monetary damages. The District Court granted the motion for class certification. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the dispositive issue on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court abuse its discretion by certifying Hop\u2019s proposed class action?</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">\u00b64 In October 2007, Hop acquired a 2006 Chevrolet Corvette with 4,000 miles on it. Thirty-three days after this acquisition, on November 6, Hop\u2019s vehicle was struck by another vehicle driven by Helen Flath, a Safeco insured. It is undisputed the accident was caused by Flath\u2019s negligence. Damages to Hop\u2019s car totaled approximately $8,222. Safeco paid the costs of the \u201cevident reasonable and necessary repairs\u201d to Hop\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">\u00b65 In addition to the obvious physical damage to his car, Hop claimed that the vehicle sustained residual diminished value. He asserted that the amount Safeco paid to repair his car did not fully compensate him because it did not include damages for RDV. In December 2007, Hop demanded RDV compensation from Safeco. Safeco agreed to investigate Hop\u2019s RDV claim and sent a letter to Hop\u2019s attorney advising him so. Safeco erroneously sent this letter to the wrong law firm and Hop\u2019s attorney never received it. After not hearing from Hop or Hop\u2019s attorney, Safeco closed the file on Hop\u2019s claim in January 2008 without compensating Hop for RDV.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>\u00b66 In March 2008, Hop filed a Class Action Complaint for Declaratory Relief in the District Court. Hop argued that Safeco had a company-wide policy of refusing to investigate RDV claims of third parties whose vehicles were damaged by a Safeco insured. Hop asserted that the many people whose vehicles were damaged by a Safeco insured and who were not paid RDV by Safeco constituted a class for purposes of a class action suit against Safeco. He sought a declaration that Safeco was required to investigate and pay the class members for RDV, certification of class members, an order requiring Safeco to identify and advise each class member of the lawsuit and potential entitlement to further insurance benefits, an order requiring \u201cimmediate payment to each and every Class Member\u201d of the RDV of their vehicle with interest, and costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b67 The District Court found that while Safeco claimed to acknowledge RDV as a possible element of damages in a Montana property damage claim, it does not investigate such claims unless a third party claimant specifically demands compensation for RDV. Furthermore, Safeco has no written procedures for investigating RDV claims. As a result, the court found, Safeco has failed to investigate and pay \u201cvirtually every RDV claim in Montana.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\u00b68 After analysis of M. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and (b), the District Court concluded that the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) were satisfied and certification of the class identified by Hop was appropriate under Rule 23(b)(2). Safeco appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">\u00b69 We review a district court\u2019s decision on a motion for class certification for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gonzales v. Mont. Power Co., </em>2010 MT 117, \u00b6 10, 356 Mont. 351, 233 P.3d 328 (citing <em>Ferguson v. Safeco Ins. Co. of Am., </em>2008 MT 109, \u00b6 10, 342 Mont. 380, 180 P.3d 1164).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">\u00b610 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion by certifying Hop\u2019s proposed class action?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">\u00b611 In his Class Action Complaint, Hop contends that Safeco is violating the Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA), Title 13, chapter 18, MCA. Referencing RDV claims, Hop maintains that Safeco has \u201cwith such frequency as to indicate a general business practice\u201d failed \u201cto adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation of claims arising under insurance policies,\u201d and has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>\u201crefuse[d] to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation based upon all available information.\u201d Section 33-18-201(3) and (4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b612 Safeco counters that Hop may not sue the insurer directly until he has met the applicable statutory requirements. Section 33-18-242(1), MCA, provides that insureds <em>and third parties </em>may bring an independent action against an insurer for violations of certain subsections of \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, including but not limited to \u00a7 33-18-201(4), MCA, i.e., refusal to pay claims without a reasonable investigation. While \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, allows for independent actions, it places some restrictions on these cases. One such restriction applies to Hop\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b613 We glean from the record before us that Hop has filed a complaint against Flath for additional damages but has not yet served her, nor have Hop and Safeco on behalf of Flath reached a settlement of Hop\u2019s underlying claim for RDV damages to his vehicle. Seemingly, this would be a bar to Hop\u2019s present third party UTPA claim because \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, provides that \u201c[a] third-party claimant may not file an action under this section until after the underlying claim has been settled or a judgment entered in favor of the claimant on the underlying claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">\u00b614 Hop, however, argues that the requirements of \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, are inapplicable because he is seeking declaratory relief under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (UDJA), Title 27, chapter 8, MCA. He relies upon <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Natl. Ins. Co., </em>286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987 (1997), for the proposition that he may bring his declaratory judgment action despite the absence of any judgment in or settlement of his underlying claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">\u00b615 In <em>Ridley, </em>Ridley was injured in an automobile accident that was primarily caused by the negligence of the other driver, an insured with Guaranty National Insurance Company. Guaranty acknowledged its liability but refused to pay Ridley\u2019s medical expenses in advance of final settlement of Ridley\u2019s claim. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont, at 328, 951 P.2d at 989. Ridley sued under both UDJA \u00a7\u00a7 27-8-201, -202, MCA, and UTPA \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA, and the district court ruled in favor of Guaranty. This Court reversed, holding that, under \u00a7\u00a7 33-18-201(6) and (13), MCA, of the UTPA, an insurer is obligated to pay an injured third party\u2019s medical expenses before final settlement if liability is reasonably clear. <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont, at 334, 951 P.2d at 992. <em>Ridley </em>subsequently has been interpreted to allow a declaratory judgment proceeding-before an underlying \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>completed-for advance payment of expenses \u201cnot reasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., </em>2000 MT 153, 300 Mont. 123, 2 P.3d 834; <em>DuBray v. Farmers Ins. Exchange, </em>2001 MT 251, 307 Mont. 134, 36 P.3d 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b616 Hop insists that he is not seeking monetary damages in a bad faith action pursuant \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA; rather, he is seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. He asserts that \u201c[t]he <em>Ridley </em>related [sic] relief that [he] and the class seek is but a small portion of the relief\u2019 being sought. Hop\u2019s protests notwithstanding, and acknowledging Hop\u2019s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, the fact remains that Hop is also undeniably seeking monetary damages in the form of RDV for himself and all proposed class members. We therefore must determine whether the type of damages Hop is seeking is akin to the advance payment of expenses not reasonably in dispute, as allowed in <em>Ridley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">\u00b617 We conclude Hop\u2019s reliance on <em>Ridley </em>in an attempt to bypass the provisions of \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA, is misplaced. Hop is seeking money damages that are readily distinguishable from the types of advance damages paid in <em>Ridley, DuBray </em>and <em>Safeco, </em>i.e., medical expenses and lost wages not reasonably in dispute. We reasoned in <em>Ridley </em>that where an insured tortfeasor is clearly at fault and the medical bills and lost wages incurred by the claimant are plainly ascertainable, public policy dictates that mandatory liability insurance pay such expenses in a timely fashion so as not to \u201cdevastat[e] ... a family of average income.\u201d <em>Ridley, </em>286 Mont, at 335. Medical expenses must be promptly paid and wage loss promptly reimbursed so as not to overwhelm an injured accident victim. RDV, on the other hand, is not an indisputable out-of-pocket item of damages; the failure to pay it promptly will neither destroy a person\u2019s credit nor impose financial stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">\u00b618 When considering what type of damages <em>Ridley </em>contemplates as being immediately payable by the insurer, and thus allowable without there first being a third party action resolved by settlement or judgment, <em>DuBray </em>is instructive. DuBray, like Hop, filed a declaratory action in which he also sought damages. We held in <em>DuBray </em>that medical expenses and lost wages are the types of obligations that are \u201cnot reasonably in dispute,\u201d and are therefore payable promptly before settlement or judgment of the underlying claim. <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6 14. However, we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of DuBray\u2019s request for other actual damages such as compensation for pain, discomfort, mental distress, and punitive damages. We said that \u201cthe general and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>punitive damages DuBray sought in his complaint were not authorized pursuant to <em>Ridley.\u201d DuBray, </em>\u00b6 16. Thus, to the extent his complaint for declaratory judgment also sought general damages, we affirmed the decision of the district court to dismiss DuBray\u2019s declaratory action in part \u201con the basis that DuBray\u2019s complaint was effectively a bad faith action barred by \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA.\u201d <em>DuBray, </em>\u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">\u00b619 Similarly, RDV does not qualify as the type of damage that must be paid in advance as \u201cnot reasonably in dispute.\u201d Unlike medical expenses and wage loss, lack of advance payment of RDV will not financially overwhelm an accident victim. Moreover, such claims are wholly subjective in nature and not plainly ascertainable in amount. Furthermore-and again unlike the instance of medical bills and lost wages-this Court has not yet addressed the question of whether insurers in Montana have an obligation to pay RDV claims at all, much less in advance. This being so, <em>Ridley </em>and <em>DuBray </em>do not support Hop\u2019s contention that he may seek RDV under the UDJA without first meeting the requirements of \u00a7 33-18-242(6)(b), MCA. Therefore, Hop\u2019s UTPA claim against Safeco for RDV is not ripe for adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">\u00b620  Returning to M. R. Civ. P. 23(a), one of the requisites of the rule is that the claims of the representative party must be typical of the claims of the class. There cannot be typicality sufficient to satisfy the rule unless the named representative has individual standing to raise the legal claims of the class. <em>Prado-Steiman v. Bush, </em>221 F.3d 1266, 1279-80 (11th Cir. Fla. 2000). As the foregoing discussion demonstrates, Hop has not yet met the requirements of \u00a7 33-18-242(6), MCA. He therefore does not have individual standing to raise his claim, nor does he have the requisite typicality to raise a claim on behalf of the class he purports to represent.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">\u00b621  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court abused its discretion in certifying a class action before Hop had satisfied the statutory requirements to bring an individual third party action against Safeco. We therefore reverse the District Court\u2019s order granting Hop\u2019s motion for certification and remand with instructions to dismiss Hop\u2019s class action without prejudice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b543-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, WHEAT, BAKER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
