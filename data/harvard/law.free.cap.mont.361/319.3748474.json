The two families have lived on their respective properties for more than fifty years. A dispute arose over Hughes\u2019s use of a roadway that crosses Ahlgren\u2019s properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">\u00b65 Dorothea Ahlgren is approximately 81 years old and owns the bulk of Ahlgren\u2019s land. Dorothea\u2019s son, Dan Ahlgren, returned to the family ranch in 1990 after his father died to help Dorothea operate the ranch. John Ahlgren, another relative, owns a small tract of land adjacent to Dorothea\u2019s ranch. The roadway in dispute (hereinafter the disputed roadway) runs through both properties. The disputed roadway connects Highway 87 and a public road (hereinafter the public road).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">\u00b66 Ahlgren\u2019s properties border the eastern side of Highway 87. Hughes\u2019s property lies adjacent to Ahlgren\u2019s properties. The public road provides access directly from Highway 87 to both Hughes\u2019s property and Ahlgren\u2019s properties. The disputed roadway provides an alternative route for Hughes to access the public road and eventually Hughes\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-13\">\u00b67 The parties apparently had been amiable neighbors for years. Hughes had crossed Algren\u2019s properties over the disputed roadway without conflict. The relationship appears to have deteriorated, however, when Dan Ahlgren bid on an expiring lease on state trust land held by Hughes. Hughes retained the lease, but Dan\u2019s bid significantly increased Hughes\u2019s per unit cost for the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-14\">\u00b68 Hughes plowed an old road on his property that Ahlgren had used to access some of her ranch. The parties soon disputed Hughes\u2019s use of the roadway across Ahlgren\u2019s properties. Ahlgren blocked the disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>roadway to prevent Hughes from crossing her property in approximately 2004. Hughes and his predecessors in interest had used the disputed roadway to access his ranch since the 1930s.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">\u00b69 Hughes filed a lawsuit in 2009 under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act (UDJA) in which he alleged that he possessed a prescriptive easement over the disputed roadway. The District Court determined that Ahlgren had given implied consent for Hughes\u2019s use of the disputed roadway before 2004. The court concluded that Hughes had failed to establish the elements for a prescriptive easement. The court awarded attorney fees to Ahlgren under the UDJA pursuant to \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. Hughes appeals only the court\u2019s award of attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b610 This Court reviews for correctness a district court\u2019s decision as to whether legal authority exists to award attorney fees. <em>Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, </em>LLP, 2009 MT 426, \u00b6 42, 354 Mont. 50, 221 P.3d 1230. We review for an abuse of discretion a district court's order granting or denying attorney fees if legal authority exists for the fees. <em>Renville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., </em>2004 MT 366, \u00b6 20, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b347-8\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court properly awarded Ahlgren\u2019s attorney fees in a declaratory judgment action involving a dispute over an easement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">\u00b612 The District Court reasoned that equity required an award of attorney fees in order to make Ahlgren whole. The court noted the fact that Hughes had forced Ahlgren to defend her property rights and that Ahlgren had prevailed. Hughes contends that nothing in the UDJA allows an award of attorney fees solely on the basis that one party prevails over the other, or that one party had to defend property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">\u00b613 Montana generally follows the American Rule that a party may not recover attorney fees in a civil action absent a specific contractual or statutory provision. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 43; <em>Sampson v. Natl. Farmers Union Prop. &amp; Cas. Co., </em>2006 MT 241, \u00b6 12, 333 Mont. 541, 144 P.3d 797. A district court may award attorney fees in an action for declaratory relief under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, if equitable considerations support such an award. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 45. The award of attorney fees also must qualify as necessary and proper. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 43 (citing <em>Martin v. SAIF Corp., </em>2007 MT 234, \u00b6 22, 339 Mont. 167, 167 P.3d 916). The \u201ctangible parameters\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>test determines whether an award of attorney fees qualifies as necessary and proper. <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6 23. The court first must conclude that support for the award rests in equity, however, before the tangible parameters test applies. <em>United Natl. Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Ins. Co., </em>2009 MT 269, \u00b6 38, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260; <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 45. \u00b614 This Court has upheld a district court\u2019s grant of attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA, only once in <em>Renville. </em>A jury awarded Renville damages for injuries that she had suffered as a passenger in a car accident. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 7. Farmers Insurance Exchange (Farmers) withheld payment to Renville on a portion of her award after several appeals to this Court had affirmed the award. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 8-18. Renville sought declaratory relief in order to recover her unpaid damages from Farmers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b615 The district court granted declaratory relief to Renville. The court also awarded Renville her attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. The court reasoned that Renville had accrued a significant amount of attorney fees in order to recover a comparatively small award of damages. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 18, 22; <em>United Natl. Ins., </em>\u00b6 39. We affirmed the district court\u2019s discretionary award of attorney fees. <em>Renville, </em>\u00b6 28. As we noted later in <em>United National Insurance, </em>the award of attorney fees prevented an anomalous result: Renville would have been better off had she never brought the claim in the first place without an award of fees to cover the cost of collecting the disputed damages. <em>United Natl. Ins., </em>\u00b6 38 <em>(citingRenville, </em>\u00b6 28).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b616 Equity generally does not support an award of attorney fees under the UDJA, however, if similarly situated parties genuinely dispute their rights. <em>United Natl. Ins., </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 46. In <em>United Natl. Ins. </em>two insurance companies disputed liability for an accident at a jobsite. <em>United Natl. Ins., \u00b6 </em>10. St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company (St. Paul) paid for injuries to an employee after United National Insurance (United National) refused to tender a defense. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. St. Paul brought a declaratory judgment action to resolve the meaning of an indemnity clause in a contract between the parties. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7. St. Paul ultimately prevailed. The court allowed St. Paul to recover the amount that it had paid for the injuries and awarded attorney fees. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">\u00b617 We reversed the district court\u2019s discretionary award of attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. Equity did not support an award of attorney fees. The case involved two similarly situated parties who were relatively sophisticated insurance companies. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39. The parties had disputed the interpretation of a contract. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 39. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>declined to apply the tangible parameters test in light of the absence of the threshold requirement that equitable considerations would support an award of attorney fees. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\u00b618 We likewise concluded in <em>Mungas </em>that equity did not support an award of attorney fees under the UDJA to similarly situated parties. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 46. In <em>Mungas, </em>\u201crelatively sophisticated, well-educated, well-informed physicians\u201d disputed the meaning of several partnership agreements that they had entered. The physicians operated on equal footing. <em>Id. </em>The equities did not support an award of attorney fees. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 46-47. The Court did not apply the tangible parameters test due to the absence of equitable considerations to support the award. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">\u00b619 Ahlgren and Hughes have operated neighboring ranches for at least fifty years. Ahlgren and Hughes, like the insurance companies in <em>United National Insurance, </em>and the doctors in <em>Mungas, </em>constitute similarly situated parties. <em>United Natl. Ins., </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 46. The parties have dealt with each other over the years, more amicably at times, on relatively equal footing. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">\u00b620  Nothing in the record indicates that Hughes acted in bad faith in bringing the declaratory judgment action. Hughes had used the disputed roadway without a challenge from Ahlgren for decades before this dispute. The District Court determined that Hughes reasonably believed that he had a legal right to use the disputed roadway. The fact that Ahlgren ultimately prevailed in defending private property rights cannot qualify as a sufficiently compelling reason to justify an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 27-8-313, MCA. <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 44; <em>Martin, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25, 28. The record lacks equitable considerations that would support an award of attorney fees to Ahlgren. <em>United Natl. Ins., </em>\u00b6 39; <em>Mungas, </em>\u00b6 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b621 The District Court also summarily concluded that an award of attorney fees to Ahlgren qualified as \u201cnecessary and proper\u201d under this Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Trustees of Indiana University v. Buxbaum, </em>2003 MT 97, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. Ahlgren failed to establish the threshold determination that equitable considerations support the award. As a result, we need not determine whether the award qualified as necessary and proper. <em>United Natl. Ins., </em>\u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\">\u00b622 We reverse the District Court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Ahlgren.</p>\n<judges id=\"b349-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE McGRATH, JUSTICES WHEAT, BAKER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
