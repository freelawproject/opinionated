(Paschal\u2019s Digest, Article 1490; Tardiff v. The State, 23 Texas, 171; Witten v. Poindexter, 25 Texas Sup., 378; Prewitt v. Woods, 1 Texas, 522.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b820-11\">The cause standing, therefore, in this court without a statement of facts, it follows that neither the instructions to the jury, given or refused, nor the rulings of the court upon the admission or rejection of evidence, can be \u00edevised; but on the contrary this court must presume in favor of the correctness of all the rulings of the district court, and of the verdict and judgment rendered. (Fulgham v. Bendy, 23 Texas, 34; Birge v. Wanhop, Ib., 441; Hutchins v. Wade, 20 Texas, 7; Bast v. Alford, 22 Texas, 399; Baldwin v. Dearborn, 21 Texas, 448; Davis v.

By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>an arrangement between Wheeler, Scott and Reid, Wheeler advanced money and paid off Scott\u2019s debt to Reid, upon the understanding that he (Wheeler) should have for the money he advanced the same security of the vendor\u2019s lien which Reid held, and for the money so advanced he took Scott\u2019s notes at longer time, and a mortgage upon the land, in which mortgage Scott fully admits and sets out the nature of the arrangement as above.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b821-6\">Row Scott endeavors to avoid his debt to Wheeler, on the ground that the money Wheeler advanced to pay Reid, and which Reid accepted in satisfaction of the debt, was Confederate money. The court vfery properly instructed the jury that under such a state of facts this defense could not avail Scott, since the consideration for which he gave his notes to Wheeler was the satisfaction of his specie debt due to Reid, and was a valuable consideration; but that if the jury found that the money advanced by Wheeler was a mere.loan to Scott, and was Confederate money, then they should find for the defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b821-7\">There can be no doubt that the ruling of the court in regard to the true consideration of Scott\u2019s notes to Wheeler was correct. The principle is sound in itself, and has recently been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Georgia in at least two cases touching the purchase of slaves, which in that State is declared to be an invalid consideration for a contract. See cases of Dever v., Aiken, and of Grisham v. Morrow, of which synopses are given in \u201c The American Law Register\u201d for October, 1870, page 688, as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b821-8\">\u201cWhen D. was indebted to F. for slaves bought of him, and F. was indebted to T. for land, and by mutual agreement of the three D. gave his note to T.\u2014the amount of the several debts being the same\u2014this is a novation. The debts fiom D. to F., and from F. to T., are at an end by the new contract between D. and T., and the consideration of this contract is, on the part of T., the satisfaction of his debt to F.

Morrow, 39 or 40, Ga.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b822-6\">Walker, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFd8\">On page 99 of the Transcript is the conclusion of what purports to be the charge of the court to the jury who tried the case in the district court. But this part of the' record is not signed by the district judge, nor in any way approved by him. It appears from the record that prior to the war Scott had purchased certain lands from Reid on deferred payments, for which he had given his notes payable in gold. The notes fell due during the war. Reid was an ardent secessionist; advocated Confederate money; and was willing to receive payments from Scott in such currency. Scott had not the Confederate money to pay him ; but Wheeler, who was a merchant, and* having a large amount of Confederate money on hand, was willing to pay Reid \u2022 for Scott, and take Scott\u2019s notes, secured by mortgage upon the land which he had purchased from Reid, to secure the repayment of the money to him, and this was accordingly so arranged between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">How the payment of Reid in Confederate money is in the nature of a contract fully executed, and will not be disturbed by this court. But it does not appear that Wheeler ever agreed to receive Confederate money from Scott; but on the other hand it is claimed it wms to be paid in specie. It was the understanding'of the parties that Reid shoud transfer his vendor\u2019s lien to Wheeler, and it was so stipulated between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Scott made three several promissory notes to Wheeler, calling for three thousand four hundred and sixty-eight dollars and eighty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>four cents each, due in three, four, and five years from date, and bearing eight per cent, interest, payable annually; and this suit is brought to enforce the payment of the notes, and foreclose the mortgage, and is defended upon the ground that the notes were given for Confederate money.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">The defense proceeds upon a clear misconcepti.on of the law. If any one was injured by the transaction, it was Reid who took Confederate money for his debt. Scott certainly lost nothing, for the debt he owed to Reid was payable in coin, and he cannot be affected hv the manner in which it was paid by Wheeler, He received a valuable consideration upon the notes v, hich he gave to Wheeler, which was virtually the laud he purchased from Reid. The defense set up was not maintained by the facts; the instructions of the court to the jury were fair and correct in law, and we discover no error upon the record. The judgment of the district court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">Mr. Justice Ogden, having presided at the trial in the court below, did not sit in this case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
