An indictment for the theft of sundry articles of household furnituie alleged the ownership of them to be in a married woman. The evidence on the trial proved that they belonged -to the community property of the husband and wke, but the wife and other witnesses for the State testified that she had the control of them, and that the husband never-interfered therewith. <em>Held, </em>that it was error to so instruct the jury as to permit them to conclude that the wife could possibly have exclusive possession and control of the articles, or could hold them in her own right so as to sustain the charge in the indictment that she was the owner, and thus warrant a verdict of guilty.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b801-10\">Appeal from Bexar.

The articles stolen were, it is true, community property; but the testimony is conclusive that it was under her \u201c special charge \u201d and control-. (Art. 2381, Paschal\u2019s Digest; Wharton\u2019s Am. Crim. Law, 404 and 1827; Langford v. The State, 8 Texas, 116; Dignowitty v. The State, 17 Texas, 521.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b802-6\">Ogden, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alxq\">The indictment in this case was for a theft from a house, and charged the defendant with stealing the property of Marie Leroux. On the trial it was proven that Marie Leroux was a married woman and the wife of -- Leroux, and that the property charged to have been stolen was the community property of Marie Lc roux and her husband. Under our laws the community property of the husband and wife is under the immediate control and management of the husband, and, excepting the homestead, is subject to sale by him only, and is therefore, during the marriage, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>his to all intents and purposes. An indictment, therefore, for the theft of community property should allege the ownership in the husband, or it will not authorize a conviction. (Wharton\u2019s Am. Crim. Law, p. 1827; 1 Hale, 513; Com. v. Davis, 9 Cush., 283; 12 Pick., 173, and Com. v. Williams, 7 Gray, 337.) In some of the States it has been decided that an indictment for the theft of the separate property of a married woman may allege the ownership in her; but in Massachusetts, in the case of the Com. v. Williams, where the law in relation to the separate property is in some respects similar to our .own, the court held a different doctrine, and in the case of the Com. v. Davis it was decided that the property was properly laid in the husband, who had been absent for three years. It has also been held that when the wife had separated from her husband, and lived upon an income arising from property invested for her sole \u00fcse, an indictment charging the theft of that income should allege the ownership in the husband. '(Archibald\u2019s Crim. PL, p. 29.) In the case now before the court the husband and wife were living together in the house where the theft is charged to have been committed, and at the time of the alleged theft the husband was sleeping in the house. We are not aware of any authority in this State, and see no reason in the evidence of this case, for alleging the property stolen as in the possession of or owned by the wife. We are therefore of the opinion that the court .erred in the fifth charge given to the jury, wherein the jury were permitted to draw the conclusion that under the law the wife could possibly have exclusive possession and control of any community property, or that she could hold any portion of the same in her own right, and that therefore the property might have been stolen from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">3?or the error here indicated the judgment of the district court is reversed; and as the evidence shows that no legal conviction can be had under the indictment the case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Reversed and dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
