H. McDaniel v. The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b431-11\">I. It was error to overrule a motion for a new trial, when the evidence showed that the accused, convicted of horse stealing, took his neighbor\u2019s horse publicly, in the street o\u00ed a town, leaving word that he had done-so, and manifesting an intention to return him after riding him a few miles. The facts repel a felonious intent, and under such proof the conviction cannot be sustained by presumptions of law or fact.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b431-12\">Appeal from Bell. Tried below before the Hon. A. J. Evans.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AH--\">The opinion of the-Court discloses as much of the evidence as is necessary.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>McFarland, <em>Saunders Sf </em>Lowry, for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvF\">argued the case at length, citing Herber v.

The law was properly given to the jury by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\u2022 But the evidence is clearly insufficient to support a verdict for horse stealing, and the court think it incumbent upon us to declare that the law of Texas does not make a man guilty of horse stealing who publicly, in broad day light, from the streets of a populous town, takes his neighbor\u2019s horse, leaving notice that he has done so, and rides him a few miles, with the intention, fairly manifested, of returning the horse to its owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Men have some reason to presume upon the indulgence of a, friend, if they do make free to use his property in a reasonable manner, without an intention to commit a felony. A man cannot commit a felony of this kind without intending to do so; and it will not do to force presumptions of law or fact, to the prejudice of life or liberty. The only error of the court below was in refusing the motion for a new trial. The judgment of the district vsourt is reversed and the cause dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"AEh\">Reversed tod dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
