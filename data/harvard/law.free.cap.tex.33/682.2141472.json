When the transcript filed in this court exhibits exceptions or demurrers filed in the court below, but does not show that any ruling was\u2019mad\u00e9 or action had on them in that court, they will be considered to have been waived. Assertions of counsel, in their briefs, that there was a ruling had in the court below, are o\u00ed no avail.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b694-7\">Error from Parker.

There was a general demurrer filed in the cause below, but the records show no action or ruling of the court on the same; and by repeated decisions of this court it has been held that when the record shows no ruling of the lower court on exceptions or demurrers, they will be considered as having been waived. (Chambers v. Miller, 9 Tex., 286 ; The State v. Thompson, 18 Tex., 527; Myers v. The State, 31 Texas, 178.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-11\">We are, however, of the opinion that if the court did overrule the demurrer, still there was no error. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
