Y. SUPERIOR COURT.</court>\n<parties data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"parties\" id=\"b228-5\">Adrian H. Muller and others agt. Elias S. Higgins.</parties>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b228-7\">\n<em>Special Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Arq\"><em>December, </em>1872.</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b228-6\">On a motion for a new trial on the <em>judge's minutes, </em>no costs as for a <em>motion </em>can be allowed. The prevailing party ts entitled only to a <em>trial fee </em>for the trial of an issue of fact.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-8\">Appeal from the taxation of costs. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b228-9\">On the rendering of the verdict the defendant moved for a new trial upon the judge\u2019s minutes, under section 264 of the code. The motion was denied. Upon the taxation of the plaintiff\u2019s costs, the clerk disallowed any other than a motion , fee for the motion for a new trial, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-10\">Mr. Foster, <em>for appellant.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b228-11\">Mr. Babcock, <em>opposed.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b228-12\">Monell, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ARm\">The construction of this court in <em>Scudder </em>agt. <em>Gori </em>(28 <em>How., </em>155), of the 807th section of the code was, that a motion for a new trial upon a case, although necessarily made at the special term, carried the same costs, as upon an appeal from a judgment which could only be heard at the general term. Such motion for a new trial is \u2022named in express terms in the section, and is given the same costs as upon an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">But a.motion for a new trial made upon the judge\u2019s minutes is not a motion <em>on a </em>case; and although the grounds of the motion are the same, nevertheless, no <em>case </em>is required to be prepared, or settled, or used on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">The construction, therefore, of the section in <em>Scudder </em>agt. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number><em>Gori </em>will not admit of its coming or being extended to any other motion for a new trial, than such as is made upon <em>a case </em>regularly made and settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">Neither in my judgment is the plaintiff entitled to the fee prescribed for the trial of an issue of law. A motion of this character does not seem to me to be within the code\u2019s definition of a trial\u2014namely, <em>\u201c </em>a judicial examination of the <em>issues </em>between the parties \u201d (\u00a7 252).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">But as this court at general term, many years ago, in an opinion which is fortified by several decisions of other courts <em>(Mechanics Banking Ass. </em>agt. Kiersted, 10 <em>How., </em>400), and subsequently sustained in the general term of the supreme court <em>(Place </em>agt. <em>The Butternuts W. &amp; C. Co., </em>28 <em>How., </em>184), held, that a motion for a new trial on a case was a <em>trial </em>within the definition alluded to, I am constrained to apply the principle to a like motion, made upon the judge\u2019s minutes. There is no difference between the motions as respects this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">If one is a trial, the other is equally so.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">I am not aware of any subsequent decision or amendment of the code, which deprives the case referred to of its authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">The plaintiff is entitled to a trial fee for the trial of an issue of fact, but not to any costs as for a motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
