At the time said note was given Cantine &amp; Bliss were the agents of the plaintiff at Syracuse. Mr. Can-tine was sworn for the defendant, and stated that the authority of his firm to act for the plaintiff was in writing; that \u25a0he had power under His employment by the plaintiff to employ examining physicians, subject to plaintiff\u2019s approval.

We have made the note to run six months, and as\"we expect to give our attention to Syracuse for the present, we shall probably cancel the voucher, by medical examinations, in a short time. You will notice that we have stipulated that medical examinations shall cancel the amount of premium. We have, called twice or three times to-day, but found you out. Please return the voucher by the bearer. Yours, &amp;c., Cantine <em>&amp; </em>Bliss, Managers.\u201d Cantine swore that he wrote said letter -without the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>knowledge or authority of the plaintiff and that he had no authority to contract for the plaintiff to take premiums in medical services. The defendant swore that he was employed by Cantine &amp; Bliss as examining physician for the plaintiffs and that he received the letter before he executed the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-5\">The referee, before whom the case was tried found the following conclusions of law; <em>\u201c </em>1st That the said defendant having no notice or knowledge of the actual authority of the said agents had the right to. deal with them as to any matter within the scope of their apparent authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">2d.

That the contract to receive pay for the said note in the services of the said. defendant as medical examiner for said plaintiffs is a valid and binding contract on said plaintiffs, and is a defense to this action.

George A. Cantine and one Bliss were agents for the plaintiff at Syracuse. They had employed the defendant, who is a physician, as an examining physician and surgeon for the plaintiff. The note purports to be payable in cash. The referee however finds upon the evidence that the plaintiff applied to the defendant through their said agents for an insurance upon his life for the benefit of his wife, for the sum of $5,000, and that the defendant then and there entered into a contract with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>plaintiff through their agents aforesaid whereby the plaintiff agreed to insure the life of the defendant for $5,000, and inconsideration thereof the defendant agreed to pay the plaintiff the sum of $284 35 annually for ten years in his fees as a medical examiner for the plaintiff and that upon the said agreement the policy was issued. '</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">He also finds that the note in suit was made by the defendant \"upon the same agreement stated in writing by the plaintiff The fact is, that the agreement was made by the Syracuse agents without the knowledge of the other officers, of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">It was proved that the authority conferred upon the agents was in writing and it was objected that it should be produced or notice to produce it given. The referee, however overruled the objection and the defendant undertook to prove the authority by the parol testimony of Cantine, the agent. On his direct examination he testified that he was authorized to employ an examining physician, subject to the approval of the plaintiff. But on his cross-examination he testified that he was not in anyway authorized by the plaintiff to make such a contract as the referee has found. The policy signed by the president and secretary, and which the referee has found was delivered to the defendant simultaneously with the making of the note, contained a provision that the premiums should be paid in cash and the further provision that the president and secretary of the company are alone authorized to make, alter or discharge contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">The referee has found the contract to be valid and binding on the plaintiff, on the ground that Cantine &amp; Bliss acted as general agents of the company at Syracuse and so held themselves out, with the knowledge and consent of the company and upon the ground that the defendant had no ' notice of any limitation of the agent\u2019s authority. In this we think the referee erred. A party dealing with a general agent has a right to presume, in the absence of any knowledge of his actual powers, that he possesses the ordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>powers of such agent. The contract, which the agents in this case assumed to make, was of an extraordinary character^ not shown to have been customary or within the scope of the powers of such agents and it cannot be presumed to have been a customary contract, usually made by such agents, especially in the face of the direct provisions to the contrary contained in the policy delivered to the defendant as a part of the transaction. The plaintiff has never ratified the contract after a knowledge of its terms, but in fact repudiates it. The judgment for,the defeneant is therefore correct as both the policy and the note are ineffectual and invalid for want of power in the agent, to make such a contract, in the absence of any valid ratification by the principal, and the conclusions of law of the referee that the contract is valid and binding upon the parties, which would give effect to both the policy and the note to pay in medical examinations, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Accordingly the first, second and third conclusions of law of the referee are reversed, but the judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
