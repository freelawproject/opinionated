The insufficiency alleged against the indictment is chiefly that it fails to aver wherein such accounts were unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">There are eleven distinct counts as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">1. For auditing a bill of $50 for rent of town clerks office.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-12\">2. For auditing a similar bill of $131 50, and for filing papers and other services by town clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">3.

For auditing a bill of $77 to a deputized constable.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-16\">6. For auditing a bill of $101 to the defendant without items or oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-17\">7. For auditing O\u2019Brien\u2019s claim of $80 without items or oath.</p>\n<p id=\"AAO\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>8. For auditing bill of New Brighton village of $50 without items, or oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u25a0 9. For auditing Me Carthy\u2019s bill of $15 without items or oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">10. For auditing bill of clerk to highway commissioners for $70. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">11. For auditing bill of Dempsey for repairing two bridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">In the <em>People </em>agt. <em>Stocking, </em>(one of the supervisors, of Erie) the indictment contained averments that the defendant obtained articles \u2022 for his own use and, well knowing the account was not a lawful charge against the county, voted to allow the same, and that it was allowed and paid (50 <em>Barb., </em>575).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Here all the ingredients of an offense are well averred.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Undoubtedly the offense alleged against the defendant in the case at bar would amount to a misdemeanor if proper and sufficient words were used to that end. And the facts constituting an offense must be stated with as much certainty as the nature of the case will admit <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Dord, </em>9 <em>Barb., </em>671).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">The accounts which the defendant aided in auditing are described in the indictment as \u201cunjust, illegal\u201d or as \u201cpretended and extortionate,\u201d but no where does the indictment in any count aver the particular fact which would make the account \u201cunjust, illegal, pretended or extortionate,\u201d and it may very well be that some of the accounts or some portions of the different claims so audited, might not be either illegal or unjust\u2014and it would relieve the indictment of all doubt as to its sufficiency if the particular fact or facts were averred which would put the defendant upon his defense at the trial by a timely and proper apprisal in the indictment of the specific character of the particular act or offense which he is called to defend and to justify <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Gates, </em>13 <em>Wend., </em>317).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-14\">So held in the <em>People </em>agt. <em>Standish, </em>(6 <em>Park, (Crim. R., </em>111) on an indictment for illegal voting.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>The indictment in that case averred that the defendant not being a qualified voter did <em>u </em>wilfully, knowingly and corruptly \u201d vote, &amp;c. \"</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">And, these words of description do not suffice to uphold an indictment without sufficient averments of fact. The language of the court (Wells, <em>J.) </em>in this case is, that the facts which give character to the act and render it criminal should be alleged, otherwise the great object of a pleading that of \u25a0informing a party what he is called upon to answer, will be defeated.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The defendant, on the motion to quash, further objects that the indictment is without proper caption. On a reference to the authorities, it will be seen that it has been held that an indictment taken at the sessions must, in the caption, state that the grand jurors were then and there sworn and charged\u2014the captions should be affixed by the clerk in case it is removed from the sessions to the Oyer and Terminer and in such case and without such captions it has been held bad <em>(The People </em>agt. <em>Guernsey, </em>3 <em>Johns. Cases, </em>265; 3 <em>Wend., </em>314).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The practice involved in this objection will be found very fully discussed and criticised in <em>The People </em>agt. <em>John Bell (Addison Reports, Penn., </em>176-180). The objection ought not to be a good one after a trial on the merits, but where it is made in due form before trial it,is to receive the consideration sanctioned by the courts in that respect. In 1 <em>Whar. Crim. Law, % </em>403, it is said the use of the words <em>\u201c </em>knowingly, wilfully and corruptly \u201d do not make the acts so charged indictable. The following authorities are relied upon by the defendant as sustaining the motion to quash; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Norton, </em>(7 <em>Bart., </em>477), illegally granting license; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Coon, </em>(15 <em>Wend., </em>277); <em>People </em>agt. <em>Brook, </em>(1 <em>Denio </em>457,) Justice refusing to take affit.; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Williams, </em>(4 <em>Hill., </em>9), false pretenses; <em>People </em>agt. <em>Stone, </em>(9 <em>Wend., </em>191); <em>People </em>agt. <em>Thomas, </em>(3 <em>Hill., </em>169).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>The authorities quoted sustain the views here enunciated and hold the objection to be well taken and the decisions indicate it to be the duty of the court. Where motion is made to quash before trial in due time to grant it. Order, that the indictment against the defendant be quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Metcalfe, <em>Co. J. </em>I concur in the above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
