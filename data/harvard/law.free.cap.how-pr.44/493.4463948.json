Where there is collusion, it can make no difference whether the damages are liquidated or not. The power of the court is hot limited to cases where the action is brought for a liquidated sum, but it interposes upon the general principle that it is equitable and right to protect the attorney against a dishonest combination between the parties to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>prive him of the fruits of his labor and services <em>(Rasquin </em>agt. <em>The Knickerbocker Stage Co., </em>12 <em>Abb., </em>329 ; <em>Keenan </em>agt. <em>Durfinger, </em>19 <em>How., </em>153, 12 <em>Abb. </em>327, <em>note </em>; <em>McDowell </em>agt. <em>The Second Av.

That on such trial the defendant could not prove a settlement without Having filed a supplemental answer setting it up, and that the court would allow such an answer, for such a purpose, to be filed only on payment of all the costs of the action up to that time. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">As I am satisfied that the defendants in this case procured the settlement \"with the design to deprive plaintiff\u2019s attorney of his\"costs, I cannot permit them to have the benefit of a discontinuance or of a supplemental answer without payment of the costs of the action up to the present time. The motion is therefore granted, but upon the condition referred to, and unless such condition be complied with within twenty days, the motion is denied with'$10' costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
