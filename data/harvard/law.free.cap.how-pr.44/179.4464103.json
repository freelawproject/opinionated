Photography and lithography being essentially different from oil painting, it may be argued that the publication of James\u2019s copies was no publication of the original pictures. But the thing in which an artist has copyright, is the conception and developement of his ideas; and these it is the boast of photography and lithography exactly to reproduce. A picture is analogous to a manuscript; and an engraving is the same as a book. A lithographic copy more resembles the original painting in every physical circumstance, than does a book the author\u2019s manuscript. But if James\u2019 copies be not a publication, because not a reproduction of the original pictures, then neither .are defendants\u2019 copies a reproduction of the original paintings, and so, are not an infringement of Oertel\u2019s rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b187-7\">XI. By communicating to James the right to multiply and vend an indefinite number of copies of his paintings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>and by assenting to the copying and sale, Oertel abandoned his common law right, and defendants were authorized to make and sell copies of the originals; and, by publishing his lithographs without the protection of a statutory copyright, James dedicated them to the public, and every one is at liberty to reproduce them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-5\">.XII. Oertel had no exclusive right to republish after publication, and he could communicate none to James.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-6\">XIII. Even if defendants had no right to copy from the originals, this injunction cannot stand; because it is not apparent but that defendants reproduced from James\u2019 lithographs ; and <em>that </em>they had an indisputable right to do. The law construes an equivocal act in a legal sense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-7\">Moreover, copying from the originals, if wrongful, would be a violation of Oertel\u2019s exclusive right, and would give no cause of action to James.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-8\">XIV. If defendants had copied from the originals, and in doing so had invaded Oertel\u2019s premises, or violated any trust, or had infringed his possessory or proprietary right in the physical substance of his pictures, then he might have had redress by the appropriate form of remedy. But nothing of the sort is here pretended. The injunction must stand or fall upon the ease presented by the papers, and that ease is simply an alleged infringement of plaintiffs\u2019 common law copyright.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b188-9\">XV.

Moreover, an injunction was there denied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b189-5\">Counsel for plaintiff, in <em>Turner </em>agt. <em>Robinson </em>(10 <em>Irish Ch. </em>121), conceded the principle on which we stand, viz., that a publication is an abandonment of the artist\u2019s right, and the master of the rolls assumed it as an indisputable proposition. The decision proceeded on the assumption that an imperfect\u201d woodcut, inserted in a magazine, was no publication of the original painting\u2014an essentially different case from ours\u2014and on the ground of a breach of trust by defendant in copying contrary to implied restrictions attached to the privilege of seeing the painting.

Plaintiffs may possibly heed the-hint suggested by the editor in his criticism on <em>Crowe </em>agt. <em>Aitken </em>(4 <em>Am. L. Rev.), </em>and may assert a trade-mark right in James\u2019s copies. The claim is invalid, because, first, no trade-mark right in plaintiffs is alleged or exhibited by the papers; secondly, the relief prayed is not to restrain the use of a trade-mark in the sale of defendants\u2019chromos, but to enjoin the reproduction or sale of plaintiffs\u2019 pictures in any style or form of imitation ; thirdly, the 'injunction granted does not purport to inhibit the use of plaintiffs\u2019 trade-mark in connection with defendants\u2019 chromos, but assumes to restrain any reproduction or imitation of plaintiffs\u2019 pictures with or without the pretended . trade-mark 5 fourthly, if there be a trade-mark right in plaintiff, it is infringed by defendants in the sale of only one of their chromos, since to only one of the chromos have they applied the descriptive appellation employed by plaintiffs. But, fifthly, and conclusively, the pretended trade-mark does not indicate origin or ownership, but is merely a printed re presentation of the idea embodied in the picture ; and so, is not, the subject of trade-mark property <em>(Canal Co. </em>agt. <em>Clarke, </em>13 <em>Wall., U.

If any trade-mark be asserted it must consist of the words \u201c Rock of Ages,\u201d inscribed upon the picture and copies. These words constitute part of the title of a hymn, which is found in all the collections of every denomination of the protestant community, and which is a familiar household strain among every sect of Christians.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-6\">This sacred song was written by Thomas Montague Topladv, and was published in the <em>Gospel Magazine </em>of March, 1776, (page 131,) with the title of <em>\u201cA </em>living and dying prayer for the holiest believer in the world\u201d ; but as the hymn grew popular, the first, which is also the penultimate line was substituted as a shorter and more significant name. A Latin version by the right honorable Wm. E. Gladstone, beginning <em>\u201c Jesus pro me perforabas,\u201d </em>was printed by Quaritch in 1861; The idea of the hymn, \u201c Christ, the rock of salvation,\u201d pervades the sacred scriptures, and the identical expression \u201c Rock of Ages\u201d is in the original Hebrew text, rendered in our version, <em>\u201c </em>Everlasting <em>strength\u201d\u2014(Isaiah, </em>26, 4). Oertel\u2019s painting, and tile copies both of plaintiffs and defendants, simply embody with varied accessories of embellishment, the sentiment of the second line in the third verse of Toplady\u2019s hymn, \u201c Simply to thy cross I cling.\u201d The title of the painting is borrowed from the hymn, and is merely expressive of the subject and indicative of the idea. Clearly it is not susceptible of a trade-mark property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b190-7\">XVIH. Plaintiffs claim a monopoly, which the law will not tolerate. They assert an exclusive right to multiply and distribute reproductions of their pictures.
