The right of the respondent, Rachel Ann Pitts, to the moneys secured by this mortgage, was dependent on the issue of the divorce suit. If by the issue of that action her dower was barred, she had no claim to those moneys.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-13\">II. By the issue of the action for divorce the respondent was barred of her dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b304-14\"><em>(a.) \u00a7 </em>48,. <em>Article third, title </em>1., <em>chap. </em>8 <em>part 2 </em>of the Revised Statutes reads thus: \u201cA wife being a defendant in a suit for a divorce . brought by her husband, and <em>convicted </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number><em>of adultery, </em>shall not be entitled to dower in her husband\u2019s real estate or any part thereof,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-5\">The respondent is brought clearly within this provision. She has been convicted of adultery in a suit for divorce brought by her husband. The question arises on the meaning of the word convicted, though that seems plain.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-6\">1. Convict, <em>Latin convinco. </em>To overpower by proving a charge against me; to prove guilty <em>(Worcester\u2019s Dictionary).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-7\"><em>\u25a02. </em>To prove or find guilty of an offence or crime charged, to pronounce guilty as by legal decision <em>(Webster\u2019s Dictionary).</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-8\">3, \u201cBut if the jury find him guilty he is then said to be convicted of the crime whereof he stands indicted, which conviction may accrue two ways\u2014either by his confessing the offense and pleading guilty, or by his being found so by the <em>verdict </em>of his country \u201d <em>(Blackstone\u2019s comm., Book </em>4., 362).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-9\"><em>4. A </em>referee combines in his own person both judge and. jury. His findings of fact stand for the verdict of a jury. Like the verdict of a jury they are conclusive in case of a conflict of evidence <em>(Hoogland </em>agt. Wright, 20 <em>How,, </em>70).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-10\">' 5. The referee found the respondent guilty of an act of adultery. His report was confirmed, and judgment of this court entered upon it. This judgment practically says: The defendant is proved guilty of adultery, but a divorce is denied because the plaintiff has forgiven the offense by cohabitation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b305-11\">6. It is objected that this is not a conviction because the judgment is for a dismisal of the complaint, and does not in terms recite that the defendant was guilty of adultery; but the verdict of a jury, or findings of fact by a referee on which a judgment is rendered, are necessarily parts of the judgment itself. They are the grounds on which the judgment necessarily proceeds, and like the judgment itself, may be pleaded as an estoppel in a second action between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>same parties <em>(Betts </em>agt. <em>Starr, 2 Coms., </em>550; <em>Edwards </em>agt. <em>Stewart, 15 Barb., </em>67).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-5\">III. That this is \u00e1 case for which the statute is intended to provide, is evident from the course of legislation on the subject.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-6\"><em>(a.) </em>The <em>Statute Westm., Second, </em>13 <em>Edw. 1, ch. </em>34, provided that \u201c if a wife willingly leave her husband and go away, and continue with her advouterer, she shall be barred forever of action to demand her dower that she ought to have of her husband\u2019s lands, if she be convicted thereupon, except that her husband willingly and without coercion of the church, reconcile her and suffer her to dwell with him, in which case she shall be restored t\u00f3 her action (2 <em>Inst., </em>433).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-7\">(6.) <em>Sec. </em>7 <em>of Chap. </em>4 <em>of the laws of </em>1787, substantially, and almost <em>in hcec verba, </em>re-enacts this statute, and such the. law remained until the revision of 1830.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b306-8\">(c.)

That adultery of the wife should bar her dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-12\">2. That a decree dissolving the marriage contract on the ground of her adultery should be proof sufficient of such adultery.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-13\">3. That in the absence of such decree such adultery might be proved against her in an action by her to recover hei dower, like any other fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-14\">4. That reconciliation with the husband should restore her dower.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-15\">The legislature changed the old law, and refused to adopt the recommendation of the revisers, but provided:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b307-16\">1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ado\">We think it was clearly the intent of the legislature by the statutory provisions on the subject of dower, to confine the effect of adultery by the wife in barring her claim for dower to cases in which such adultery is established by a judgment of the court. It may well be doubted whether either of those provisions ( 5 N. <em>Y. Stat. at L., 335, \u00a7\u00a7 </em>8-48), apply to a, case which arises after' a divorce has been obtained. Section 8 only applies to a case where the divorce is granted for the misconduct of the wife, and section 48 applies to a case where the defendant is convicted of the adultery in a suit for a divorce brought by the husband, neither applies to adultery committed unless the wife is convicted of the offense. If) upon the trial, the plaintiff fails on account of condonation of the offense, there is xno conviction. Coke says: \u201cIf the wife is pardoned before the death of the husband she shall be endowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">So, also, if she is reconciled to her husband after elope- , meat.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">The effect of condonation restores her right to dower even if forfeited by the adultery, and if such fact is found in the divorce suit the previous adultery works no forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">The order was right, and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">Concurred in by Brady. \u00ab7.
