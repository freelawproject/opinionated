Upon the first question, the 5th sub-division of \u00a7366 of Code, in express terms empowers the county court to allow such amendment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-15\">1st. But such amendment was not essential; for all forms of action were abolished, and the complaint contained all facts necessary to maintain, the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-16\">2d. <em>Quare clausam fregit </em>was the ancient form, because our close is just as effectually broken and entered by defendant\u2019s agent, the element of wrongful waters, as by a crowbar or pick-axe applied to our gateway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b36-17\">3d.

At folio 38 the bill shows evidence not controverted; that defendant, as overseer, was directed by the commissioner of highways of said town not to do the act complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-7\">2d. As matter of\" law, \u201c all the powers of overseers must be taken to be- subordinate to, and under the superior control of the orders of the commissioners, whom they are bound to obey.\u201d <em>(Bartlett </em>agt. <em>Crozier, </em>17 <em>John\u2019s, R., </em>447.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-8\"><em>a. </em>This case is not reversed or criticised, but followed and approved, up to the present time, by the court of appeals. (See <em>Wait\u2019s table of cases, </em>37.) Hence the exceptions referred to assumed an official capacity in defendant to do this act, which the bill concedes did not exist officially, the act being interdicted by defendant\u2019s superior officers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-9\"><em>b. </em>But suppose this was yet an open question, that there was conflict upon it, in evidence, then the request should have been qualified by making provisions for a finding whether the act was interdicted by competent authority.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-10\">Also as to whether the act was reasonable, necessary, and not an abuse of official discretion, if not interdicted by the commissioners. For a request to charge must be in such form that the court may charge in the very terms of the request without qualification. <em>(Carpenter </em>vs. <em>Stilwell, 11 </em>N.Y., 79.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-11\"><em>c. </em>The point here made is not that defendant, as overseer, was \u201cnot ordered\u201d as put in this case in 60 <em>Barb., </em>391, but that lie was ordered not to do the act complained of by the commissioners of highways. This must surely render his attempted justification abortive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-12\">IV. As an officer, aside from the protest of the commissioners, he had no right to turn the waters above the butternut tree sluice upon us. <em>(Thompson on </em>Highways, 152; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>Cook on Highways, </em>113; <em>Plummer </em>agt. <em>Sturtevant, </em>32 <em>Maine, </em>325.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-4\">Nor can defendant excuse himself by saying (as is contemplated by his request), that some other party had increased the flow before he did the act complained of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-5\">He cannot thus visit the sins of another upon this plaintiff. (N<em>ote (a) Martin </em>agt. <em>Riddle, </em>26 <em>Penn., </em>415.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-6\"><em>a. </em>A road must be worked so as not to obstruct the natural flow of water. <em>(People </em>agt. <em>Kingman, </em>24 <em>N. Y., </em>559.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-7\">Conceding that there are many cases of constructing, grading, leveling and repairing highways by officers having lawful -authority in the which an injury occurs from a reasonable exercise of such authority which are <em>damnum absque injuria.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-8\">Yet the courts draw between those cases and this, a sharp, well-deffned line of distinction ; and we assert that no approved case can be found in this, or in any other state, or in England, which confers upon the pettiest officer of a town immunity from action, who diverts from their ancient natural channels either surface or living waters which have been accustomed to flow on his own land from time immemorial, and casts them upon his neighbor\u2019s land to his damage, upon any pretext. But -the converse of this has been held in all countries almost as long as those channels have existed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b38-9\">V. The defendant, as a private person, has no such right.. <em>(Sam\u2019l A. Foot et al, </em>agt. <em>Bronson et al, </em>4 <em>Lansing, </em>47.) Nor to divert waters, which he has a right to turn if commingled with waters he is not .entitled to divert. <em>(Thomas </em>agt. <em>Kenyon, </em>1 <em>Daly, </em>132; <em>Bellows </em>agt. <em>Sackett, </em>15 <em>Barb., </em>97 ; <em>Bellinger </em>agt. <em>N.

The defendant, in his answer, justified the acts complained of upon the ground \u25a0 that he was overseer of the highway, and that such acts were necessary for the benefit of the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-7\">\u2022 The road was a north and south road, and the water flowed northward through the ditch on the west side.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-8\">The evidence showed\" and the court held that in 1862 the public had acquired by user a prescriptive right to have the water flow through this ditch from a point as-far south as a certain butternut tree, and through the sluice which the defendants opened at the time in question upon the plaintiffs meadow where it flowed at the time complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-9\">In 1862 a change was made by filling up the west ditch at a point between the sluice in question and the butternut tree, and another sluice made across the road at that point, which had the effect to turn all the water coming from the south to that point down the south ditch- of an east and west road, which there intersected the north and south road.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-10\">The effect of this had been to make a deep gully on the south side of the east and west road, and to render the road unsafe and dangerous to travelers. To remedy this difficulty and to prevent further injury to the east and west 'road the defendant, as overseer, filled up the new sluice, cleaned out the west ditch on the north and south road, and restored \"it to the condition in which it was at that place prior to 1862.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-11\">He also reopened the sluice, which, it seems, had in the meantime become filled up or closed, so that the water in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>west ditch passed through and upon the plaintiffs land, as it had prior to 1802.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-5\">The court ruled and charged the jury, that if by this last change the defendant had only restored the west ditch and the sluice then reopened, to the same condition in which they were prior to 1862, and no water passed through and upon the plaintiffs land except what came into the ditch between the sluice through which the water passed and the butter-nut tree, the defendant\u2019s acts were justifiable, and the action could not be- maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-6\">There was evidence in the case tending to show, that prior to the time when the new sluice was made and the water turned down the south ditch of the east and west road, there was a sluice just above and south of the butternut tree across this north and south road, by means of which all the water coming through the west ditch south of the butternut tree was carried across the road and down through a natural depression in the surface of the land, upon lands owned by the defendant, and that this sluice was filled up about the time the ditch was filled up, at the intersection of the east and west road, and the sluice there made to carry the water into the ditch of the other road, the effect of which was to bring the water from a distance considerably further south than the butternut tree, and increased the volume and quantity of water in the west ditch at the point of the intersection of the east and west road and at the sluice, by which the water was carried upon the plaintiff\u2019s meadow. It was claimed by the plaintiff and the evidence on his side tended to show that it was this increased volume and quantity of water which occasioned the injury, and that but for this increase no injury would have happened. These facts were controverted by the defendant, who gave evidence tending to show that for more than twenty years prior to 1862 the water had flowed through the west ditch the same distance from the south, and that:no change had been made within that time by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>which the quantity of water flowing through that ditch had been increased.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">These disputed questions the court submitted to the jury, and charged that if the water from the same distance had flowed through the ditch for twenty years, the plaintiff could not recover, but if it had not, and the injury was occasioned by the- increased volume of water from the longer distance, the plaintiff was entitled to recover such damages. The jury found in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant\u2019s counsel excepted to this part of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">The charge, we think, was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">The defendant, doubtless in the discharge of his official duty as overseer, had the right to make such change as he might in the exercise of his judgment deem necessary, not only by way of repair of the road, but by way of preventing further injury, provided that in so doing he did not interfere' with the rights of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">He might for this purpose unquestionably restore the way as it was when the change was made in 1862, and the public to all the rights they then had which had not become forfeited.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\">But if he undertook to restore, he should have restored the way in all respects to the condition it was in at and prior to 1862, and the public to the rights it then had.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">He had no right to leave the sluice, which would carry off water from the ditch to his own land, closed, and open the sluice which would carry the water Which should rightfully pass to his own land upon the land ,of his neighbor. This the jury have found he has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-11\">The court properly refused to charge as requested. by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-12\">The substance of that request was that the defendant had the right to make the change for the benefit of the road if he acted in good faith, even if it had the effect to throw more water upon the plaintiff\u2019s land than had been carried there before, or than would have gone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>there had the entire way been restored to its former condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">This proposition, as we have undertaken to show, cannot be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">It must be obvious to any one that an overseer of highways cannot by any act of his own either confer any new rights upon the public, or impose any new burdens upon individuals to their injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">The judgment, we think, is right, and should be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
