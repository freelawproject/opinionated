In the proceedings to punish for contempt before the county judge, the defendant\u2019s attorneys claimed that defendant had a right thus to employ an attorney, The defendant was adjudged guilty of contempt, by Hon.

It is not contended that the watch was exempt, as an article of property necessary to the defendant\u2019s use in his vocation. The commission of appeals held, in <em>Lynch </em>agt. <em>Johnson </em>(4 <em>Alb. L. J.. </em>243), that the service of the order for examination under secs. 292-294 of the Code, gives the judgment creditor a lien upon the property of the debtor. In this case, the creditor\u2019s lien is prior to that of the attorney, who took the watch, in pay for service to be rendered. The defendant\u2019s contempt was in this\u2014he had property liable to execution, he voluntarily parted with it in defiance of the order of the court, and apparently for the express purpose of putting the property beyond the. creditor\u2019s reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">The Code has abolished creditor\u2019s bills so called, and substituted the remedy which the plaintiff resorted to. The. authority of the court was then set in motion, and the defendant\u2019s voluntary disobedience makes him amenable m the only way by which' such violation can be punished, and the process of the court enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-11\">The order of the county court should be affirmed with $10 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">J.
