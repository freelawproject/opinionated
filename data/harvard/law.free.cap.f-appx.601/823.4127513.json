Following, an Occupational Safety and Health Act (\u201cOSHA\u201d) inspection of one of Copomon\u2019s facilities in 2011, the Secretary issued Co-pomon a citation (\u201cCitation 1\u201d). Among other things, Citation 1 alleged a serious violation of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1048(m)(3)(i) for failing to ensure that containers of formaldehyde \u2014 containing products \u2014 including, but not limited to Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment, Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment Blonde, and Express Blow Out \u2014 contained labels warning of the hazards associated with formaldehyde exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-10\">Copomon contested the citation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties ultimately reached a settlement agreement, which was approved by the ALJ and became part of the Commission\u2019s final order. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Copomon agreed to \u201crevise the labeling on all hair smoothing/hair straightening products at issue in this case to include the language agreed upon by the parties at the April 25, 2012 voluntary mediation in compliance with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910(m)(3)(i).\u201d The language to which the parties agreed was this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-11\">Hazard Warning</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-12\">OSHA Compliant. Product is safe if used as directed. If not used as directed may cause irritation and sensitization of the skin and respiratory system, eye and throat irritation, acute toxicity, and carcinoma per IARC. Physical and health hazard information is readily available at [Company address and phone number] and MSDS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-13\">Following the ALJ\u2019s order, Copomon revised its product labels in compliance with the approved terms of the Settlement Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-14\">A few months later, following another inspection of Copomon\u2019s facilities, the Secretary issued Copomon a second citation (\u201cCitation 2\u201d). Citation 2 alleged a \u201crepeat\u201d violation<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of 29 C.F.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>\u00a7 1910.1048(m)(3)(ii) for failing to \u201censure that the labels of formaldehyde-containing products such as but not limited to Express Blow Out, Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment Blonde and Natural Keratin Smoothing treatment were updated to indicate that the products contained formaldehyde.\u201d Citation 2 noted that Copomon had already been \u201ccited for a violation of this [OSHA] standard or its equivalent standard\u201d in Citation 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">Copomon contested Citation 2. Among other things, Copomon asserted \u2014 based on the final order approving the Settlement Agreement reached about Citation 1 \u2014 that Citation 2 was \u25a0 barred by <em>res judicata. </em>The ALJ granted summary judgment in favor of Copomon, concluding that Citation 2 was precluded.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\"><em>\u201cRes judicata </em>bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Rags-dale, </em>193 F.3d at 1238. A claim is barred by earlier litigation if these four elements are met: \u201c(1) there is a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, are identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[I]f a case arises out of the same nucleus of operative fact, or is based upon the same factual predicate, as a former action, ... the two cases are really the same \u2018claim\u2019 or \u2018cause of action\u2019 for purposes of <em>res judicata.\u201d Id. </em>at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The Commission determined that each of these four elements was met and, as a result, that Citation 2 was barred by <em>res' judicata. </em>We agree. The parties do not dispute that elements (2) and (3) are met. About element (1), the Commission\u2019s order approving the parties\u2019 settlement agreement constituted a final judgment on the merits. <em>See Juris v. Inamed Corp., </em>685 F.3d 1294, 1340 (11th Cir.2012) (\u201cFor purposes of determining <em>res judicata, </em>an order approving a settlement agreement provides a final determination on the merits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-10\">Element (4) is also satisfied. In both cases, the Secretary alleged that Copomon failed to ensure that containers of formaldehyde-containing products (specifically Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment, Natural Keratin Smoothing Treatment Blonde, and Express Blow Out) reflected adequately (1) that the products contained formaldehyde and (2) the hazards of formaldehyde exposure. Thus, both cases arise out of the same nucleus of operative fact and are based upon the same factual predicate. That the Secretary initially categorized Citation 2 as a \u201crepeat\u201d violation based on Copomon\u2019s earlier citation (in Citation 1) of an \u201cequivalent standard\u201d further evidences that both cases involve the same cause of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">On appeal, the Secretary does not challenge the Commission\u2019s determination on the four elements and does not otherwise contend that these four elements have not been shown. Instead, .the Secretary argues that the Commission should have applied a modified <em>res judicata </em>analysis, based on our decision in <em>Norfolk Southern Corp. v. Chevron, </em>371 F.3d 1285 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">In <em>Norfolk Southern, </em>we said that where parties consent to a voluntary dismissal with prejudice under Fed.R.Civ.P. 41, \u201ca somewhat modified form of <em>res judicata </em>applies to the written settlement agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>ment upon which such dismissal is predicated, if one exists.\u201d 371 F.3d at 1291. Under this modified <em>res judicata </em>analysis, we determine whether a claim is precluded' from future litigation by looking at the terms of the settlement agreement itself (as interpreted based on traditional principles of contract law), instead of by looking at the claims in the original complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1289. \u201cIn determining the <em>res judicata </em>effect of an order of dismissal based upon a settlement agreement, we should also attempt to effectuate the parties\u2019 intent. The best evidence of that intent is, of course, the settlement agreement itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Even if we assume \u2014 without deciding \u2014 that a modified <em>res judicata </em>analysis similar to that discussed in <em>Norfolk Southern </em>is appropriate in this case, Citation 2 would still be precluded. Based on the express terms of the settlement agreement, the parties intended \u2014 and agreed\u2014 that the mutually agreed-upon language for Copomon\u2019s revised product labels did, in fact, comply with 29 C.F.R. 1910.1048(m)(3)(i). And, among other things, compliance with 29 C.F.R. 1910.1048(m)(3)(i) required that the product label identify the hazardous chemical that is the subject of the warning (in this case, formaldehyde). <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. 1910.1048(m)(3)(i) (2011) (requiring hazard warning labels to comply with 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1200(f)).</p>\n<p id=\"b849-6\">The crux of Citation 2, meanwhile, is that Copomon\u2019s revised label (which contained the mutually agreed-upon language) failed to identify properly that Copomon\u2019s products (the same three products identified in Citation 1) contained formaldehyde. Because the settlement agreement already established that the agreed-upon label language satisfied the requirement that the hazardous chemical be identified properly, and because the settlement agreement evidences the parties\u2019 intent that the agreement may be used for other OSHA actions, we conclude that Citation 2 is precluded under the modified version of the <em>res judi-cata </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">PETITION DENIED; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-13\">. Because the Commission did not direct review of the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s (\"ALJ\u2019s\u201d) decision granting Copomon's motion for summary judgment, the ALJ\u2019s decision became the final order of the Commission. <em>See </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2200.90(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b847-7\">. The Commission also concluded, in the alternative, that the Secretary's citation was barred by collateral estoppel. Because we conclude that the Secretary\u2019s citation is precluded by <em>res judicata, </em>we do not reach the collateral estoppel issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b847-8\">. Although Copomon contends that its products do not contain formaldehyde in and of themselves, Copomon concedes that the products named in Citation 1 are \"capable of releasing formaldehyde into the air, under reasonably foreseeable conditions of use, at concentrations reaching or exceeding 0.1 ppm\u201d and, thus, are subject to regulation under 29 C.F.R.1910.1048(m) (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b847-16\">.The Secretary later moved successfully to amend the classification of the violation in Citation 2 from \"repeat\u201d to \"other-than-serious,\u201d but did not otherwise alter the alleged violation description.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b848-7\">. The ALJ also denied the Secretary\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The Secretary does not challenge this denial on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b849-18\">. Given the facts of this case-where Copomon revised its product labels in compliance with 29 C.F.R.1910.1048(m)(3)(i) and with the terms of the approved Settlement Agreement-nothing evidences that the application of <em>res judicata </em>to bar Citation 2 restricts improperly the Secretary\u2019s enforcement discretion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
