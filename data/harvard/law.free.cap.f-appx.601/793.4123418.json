Brian Tanner, James D. Durham, Joseph D. Newman, Brian T. Rafferty, Edward J. Tarver, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Savannah, GA, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b817-6\">Daniel Christian Jenkins, Karsman, Mckenzie &amp; Hart, Savannah, GA, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b817-8\">Before HULL, JORDAN and BLACK, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b817-9\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b817-10\">After a jury trial, Demetrious Ervin appeals his convictions and total 168-month sentence for distribution of a controlled substance, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute, also in violation of \u00a7 841(a)(1); possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">On appeal, Ervin argues that at trial the district court erred: (1) by denying Er-vin\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal because the government failed to prove the cocaine Ervin possessed and sold to a confidential source was cocaine hydrochloride, as alleged in his indictment; (2) by allowing the government to introduce evidence of Ervin\u2019s sale of cocaine to the confidential source two days before the charged offenses without providing the 20-day notice required by the district court\u2019s local rules; and (3) by allowing the government to refer to Ervin\u2019s prior drug convictions during closing arguments. Ervin also argues that at sentencing the district court misapplied the official victim adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l), in calculating Ervin\u2019s advisory guidelines range. After review, we affirm Ervin\u2019s convictions and total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-13\">I. MOTION FOR JUDGMENT OF ACQUITTAL</p>\n<p id=\"b817-14\">The district court did not err in denying Ervin\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal. The government presented sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt not only that Ervin knowingly possessed and distributed a controlled substance, but also that the controlled substance was cocaine hydrochloride, as charged in Ervin\u2019s indictment. <em>See United States v. Sanders, </em>668 F.3d 1298, 1309-10 (11th Cir.2012) (explaining that because the specific amount and type of drugs are not elements of a \u00a7 841(a) offense, the government needed only to prove the defendant knew that he possessed a controlled substance, and not the particular kind of controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Specifically, with regard to the type of controlled substance, the government presented the testimony of the agent in charge, Officer Herbert Harley, and the confidential source involved in the undercover operation. Both witnesses testified that Ervin sold the confidential source cocaine on two occasions. The government also introduced taped phone conversations and video recordings corroborating their testimony. As to the form of cocaine, an expert forensic chemist testified that: (1) cocaine hydrochloride is the powder form of cocaine and is a controlled substance; (2) the packages of white-powered substances that Ervin sold to the confidential source and that were found in Ervin\u2019s car and home all tested positive for cocaine; and (3) although the test to confirm the cocaine\u2019s form was not performed, based on appearance, the powder cocaine \u201cappear[ed] to possibly be cocaine hydrochloride,\u201d and not cocaine base or a \u201ccrack-type drug.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the government also introduced for the jury\u2019s inspection the actual cocaine seized by the agents, which was in powder form.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">There is also no merit to Ervin\u2019s argument, made for the first time on appeal, that the district court constructively amended the indictment by allowing the case to go to the jury. The district court charged the jury that, to find Ervin guilty of the \u00a7 841(a) offenses, the jury must find beyond a reasonable doubt that Ervin knowingly and intentionally possessed and distributed cocaine hydrochloride. <em>Cf. United States v. Narog, </em>372 F.3d 1243, 1247-49 (llth Cir.2004) (explaining that where the indictment charges a particular controlled substance, the district court constructively amends the indictment by charging the jury that any controlled substance will suffice). Further, as discussed above, the government\u2019s trial evidence as to the form of the controlled substance\u2014 cocaine hydrochloride \u2014 was consistent with Ervin\u2019s indictment, which charged cocaine hydrochloride. Thus, there was no variance. <em>See id. </em>at 1247 (explaining that there is no variance when the \u201cfacts proved at trial [do] not deviate from the facts alleged in the indictment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">In any event, Ervin\u2019s claims of constructive amendment and/or variance fail under plain error review because Ervin cannot show prejudice. <em>See United States v. Madden, </em>733 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2013) (concluding that traditional plain error review applies where the defendant failed to object to a constructive amendment in the district court); <em>Narog, </em>372 F.3d at 1247 (explaining that \u201cvariance requires reversal only when the defendant can establish that his rights were substantially prejudiced thereby\u201d). All forms of cocaine are a controlled substance for \u00a7 841(a) purposes. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c), Schedule 11(a)(4). The form of the cocaine makes a material difference only for sentencing purposes, with the stiffer sentences reserved for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>\u00a7 841 (b)(l)(A)(ii)(II) &amp; (iii), (b)(l)(B)(ii)(II) &amp; (iii) (distinguishing between \u201ccocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers\u201d and \u201ccocaine base\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) &amp; n. (D) (distinguishing between cocaine and cocaine base, defined as \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number><em>see also United States v. Sloan, </em>97 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (11th Cir.1996) (explaining that the higher penalty provisions for cocaine base apply only to offenses involving \u201cthe rock-like form of cocaine base\u201d and the lesser penalties apply to other cocaine-related substances, such as salts). Because cocaine hydrochloride carries the lower penalties for cocaine offenses, and Ervin does not dispute that the government proved he possessed some form of cocaine, there was no harm to Ervin.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">II. PRIOR COCAINE SALE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of Ervin\u2019s August 17 drug sale to the confidential source two days before the charged August 19 drug sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Specifically, on August 17, 2011, during the undercover investigation, Officer Harley sent the confidential source to make a \u201cbuy-walk\u201d purchase of cocaine from Er-vin. Then, two days later on August 19, 2011, Officer Harley sent the confidential source back to Ervin to make a \u201cbuy-bust\u201d purchase, after which Ervin was arrested. Only the August 19 \u201cbuy-bust\u201d purchase was charged in Ervin\u2019s indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">About four months after Ervin\u2019s arraignment and two weeks before trial, the government provided Ervin with a \u201cNotice of Intrinsic Evidence\u201d that it intended to introduce evidence of Ervin\u2019s August 17 cocaine sale to the confidential source.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">Prior to trial, Ervin sought to exclude evidence of the August 17 \u201cbuy-walk\u201d purchase based solely on Local Rule 16.2, which requires the government to provide the defendant with written notice of its intent to offer evidence of uncharged prior acts \u201cno more than twenty (20) days after the arraignment (unless the Court directs otherwise).... \u201d <em>See </em>S.D. Ga.Crim. R. 16.2. The district court denied Ervin\u2019s motion in limine. The district court found that Er-vin had actual notice of the evidence within the time period provided by Local Rule 16.2 and was not prejudiced by receiving the formal notice two weeks before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">We cannot say the district court abused its discretion in applying Local Rule 16.2. Although Local Rule 16.2 requires the government to provide notice within twenty days of arraignment, it also grants the district court discretion to waive the notice requirement. Given that Ervin does not dispute that he had actual notice of the unindicted August 17 cocaine sale and that Ervin did not contend the evidence was otherwise inadmissible, it was within the district court\u2019s discretion to waive the Local Rule\u2019s formal notice requirement based on a lack of prejudice to Ervin.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-12\">III. PROSECUTOR\u2019S REFERENCE TO PRIOR CONVICTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b819-13\">Before trial, the district court ruled that Ervin\u2019s prior drug trafficking convictions \u2014 a 2007 Georgia conviction for marijuana and cocaine possession and a 2013 Mississippi conviction for \u201cpossession of cocaine with intent\u201d \u2014 were admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). At trial, the government introduced certified copies of these convictions. During closing argument, the prosecutor argued to the jury that Ervin\u2019s prior convictions showed he was an experienced drug dealer who financed his fast lifestyle by \u201cslingfing] cocaine from here to Mississippi.\u201d Ervin did not object to the prosecutor\u2019s comment at the time or later move for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-14\">On appeal, Ervin contends that the prosecutor\u2019s reference to his prior drug convictions during closing argument is reversible error because it was outside the purposes allowed by Rule 404(b) and prejudicial. Because Ervin failed to contemporaneously object to the alleged prosecutorial mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>conduct, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Flanders, </em>752 F.3d 1317, 1332-33 (11th Cir.2014). Under the third prong of the plain error test, the defendant must show that the prosecutor\u2019s alleged misconduct affected his substantial rights, which \u201calmost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1333 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Here, even assuming arguendo that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks about the Rule 404(b) evidence were arguably improper, Ervin cannot show he was prejudiced by them given the overwhelming evidence of his guilt. The uncontested trial testimony of both Officer Harley and the confidential source established that Ervin made a sale of cocaine hydrochloride on August 19, 2011 and was arrested immediately thereafter. This testimony was corroborated by taped phone calls arranging the sale and video surveillance of the transaction. After Ervin\u2019s arrest, officers found more cocaine and drug trafficking paraphernalia in both Ervin\u2019s vehicle and his residence. At the time of his arrest, Ervin was carrying a loaded firearm in his pants pocket and was a convicted felon.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Furthermore, the district court instructed the jury as to the proper uses of Rule 404(b). evidence. <em>See United States v. Duran, </em>596 F.3d 1283, 1300 (11th Cir.2010) (indicating that improper comments by the prosecutor about Rule 404(b) evidence may be cured by the district court\u2019s instruction as to the permissible uses of such evidence). We ordinarily presume the jury followed the district court\u2019s instructions, and Ervin has provided us no basis for disregarding that presumption here. <em>See United States v. Stone, </em>9 F.3d 934, 938 (11th Cir.1993) (requiring an \u201coverwhelming probability\u201d standard to overcome the presumption that the jury follows the court\u2019s instructions).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">In light of the ample independent evidence of Ervin\u2019s guilt and the district court\u2019s Rule 404(b) instruction, Ervin has not met his burden to show the prosecutor\u2019s comments during closing arguments about Ervin\u2019s prior drug convictions affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">IV. OFFICIAL VICTIM ADJUSTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2, a defendant\u2019s offense level is increased by six levels where, during immediate flight, the defendant assaulted a law enforcement officer \u201cin a manner creating a substantial risk of serious bodily injury.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l). The six-level adjustment \u201capplies in circumstances tantamount to aggravated assault,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.2 cmt. n. 4(A), such as when a defendant drives his car in such a manner as to endanger the lives of police officers by causing a collision. <em>See United States v. Stanley, </em>24 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.1994) (applying prior version of \u00a7 3A1.2, which called for a three-level adjustment).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-9\">Here, the six-level official victim adjustment was amply warranted based on the undisputed facts in Ervin\u2019s Presen-tence Investigation Report, as well as the video recordings of Ervin\u2019s arrest, the trial testimony of the officers who participated in Ervin\u2019s arrest, and Officer Harley\u2019s sentencing hearing testimony. In particular, when officers moved in to arrest Ervin immediately after the cocaine sale, Ervin, who was in his car, attempted to flee by repeatedly hitting two police vehicles that had boxed him in. The officers surrounding Ervin\u2019s car had to use a taser, a metal breaching tool, and a police dog to stop Ervin and remove him from his car. During the takedown, one officer had to jump into the bed of the confidential source\u2019s truck when Ervin\u2019s car began swaying left to right. Once outside the car, Ervin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>fought with the officers, causing another officer to suffer a broken hand before Er: vin could be subdued.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We reject Ervin\u2019s argument that \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) applies only if the defendant commits an aggravated assault as defined in the commentary to another guideline in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2A2.2 cmt. n. 1. The commentary to which Ervin refers explicitly states that the definition is only \u201c[f]or purposes of this guideline.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Definitions of general applicability are found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1, and definitions appearing in particular sections of the Sentencing Guidelines \u201care not designed for general applicability.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Given the particular circumstances here, the district court properly found that Er-vin, while attempting to flee, assaulted the officers trying to arrest him and did so in a manner that created a substantial risk of serious bodily injury, which is what \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l) explicitly requires. Accordingly, the district court did not err in applying \u00a7 3A1.2(c)(l)\u2019s six-level adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b818-5\">. For purposes of federal drug offenses, cocaine base refers only to ''crack\u201d cocaine, which is made by processing cocaine hydrochloride and sodium bicarbonate and usually has a lumpy, rock-like appearance, and not to other forms of cocaine base. <em>See United States v. Munoz-Realpe, </em>21 F.3d 375, 377-78 (11th Cir.1994); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c) cmt. n. (D). Cocaine hydrochloride, popularly called cocaine powder, is a salt made by dissolving coca paste in hydrochloric acid and water. <em>United States v. Sloan, </em>97 F.3d 1378, 1381 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
