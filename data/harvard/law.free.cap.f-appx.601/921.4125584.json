Liu argues that the BIA\u2019s determination that he did not file an independent \u2014 one apart from Zhang\u2019s application \u2014 asylum application is not supported by substantial evidence. He also argues that the BIA erred by dismissing his appeal after Zhang, the primary asylum applicant, withdrew her appeal; he says the BIA ought to have remanded the case to the IJ for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax1\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-24\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence test; and we must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if the decision \u201cis supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Delgado v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>487 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir.2007). We review the evidence in the light most favorable to the BIA\u2019s decision, and we draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the decision. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number><em>Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). We only reverse a factual determination if the record compels reversal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Liu did not file a separate asylum application. Zhang\u2019s asylum application was the only application presented to the IJ: Liu as Zhang\u2019s spouse made a derivative claim. During the process, Liu\u2019s counsel confirmed that he did not file an independent application. Liu\u2019s counsel also confirmed that Liu was seeking derivative status from Zhang\u2019s application for asylum. Therefore, we deny Liu\u2019s claim that the BIA lacked substantial evidence to support its determination that he did not file an independent asylum application.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">We review an issue of subject-matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Delgado, </em>487 F.3d at 860. We lack jurisdiction to consider claims that have not been raised before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Liu\u2019s claim that the BIA erred when it failed to remand his case for further proceedings. He never requested that the BIA remand his case to the IJ for further proceedings. Thus, we lack jurisdiction to consider the claim for a remand since he failed to present it to the BIA. <em>See Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1250. Accordingly, we deny Liu\u2019s petition in part and dismiss his petition in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
