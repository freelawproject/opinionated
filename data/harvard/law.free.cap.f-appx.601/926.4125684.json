Zitek, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Tampa, FL, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b949-5\">Beau Diamond, Estill, SC, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b949-7\">Before MARCUS, WILLIAM PRYOR, and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b949-8\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">Beau Diamond, a federal prisoner proceeding pro se, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pro <em>se </em>post-judgment motion challenging the $23,065,090.84 restitution order entered following his 2010 convictions for wire fraud, mail fraud, illegal money transactions, and transportation of stolen property.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Diamond asserts that the order should be vacated because due process prevents ordering a criminal defendant to perform the impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-10\">We are obligated to address the district court\u2019s jurisdiction to issue the ruling we are reviewing on appeal. <em>United States v. Diveroli, </em>729 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir.2013). Jurisdictional issues are reviewed <em>de novo. See United States v. Stossel, </em>348 F.3d 1320, 1321-22 (11th Cir.2003) (reviewing whether a district court had jurisdiction to consider a defendant\u2019s motion to modify his sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">The Mandatory Victims Restitution Act (\u201cMVRA\u201d) requires the district court to order restitution in fraud cases. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(c)(l)(A)(ii). An order of restitution under the MVRA is issued and enforced in accordance with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(d). Before the MVRA, restitution was discretionary and the district court was required to consider the defendant\u2019s ability to pay in determining the amount of restitution owed, but the MVRA eliminated a court\u2019s authority to consider that factor. <em>See United States v. Thayer, </em>204 F.3d 1352, 1357 (2000). Now, under the MVRA, the court must order restitution to each victim in the full amount of each victim\u2019s losses as determined by the court without consideration of the economic circumstances of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(f)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">Courts do not have inherent authority to modify a sentence outside of the framework provided by statutes and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. <em>See United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1317-18 (11th Cir.2002) (citing <em>Carlisle v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 416, 426, 116 S.Ct. 1460, 1466, 134 L.Ed.2d 613 (1996) (providing that, whatever the scope of a district court\u2019s inherent power, it does not include the power to develop rules that circumvent or conflict with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or statutory provisions)). The MVRA provides that an otherwise final order can be: (1) corrected under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35; (2) appealed and modified under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742; (3) amended under 18 U.S.C.. \u00a7 3664(d)(5); or (4) adjusted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3664(k), 3572, or 3613A. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(o )(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>Rule 35(a) permits a district court to correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error within 14 days of orally pronouncing the sentence. Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a)(c). Section 3742 governs direct appeals of sentences. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742. A restitution order can be modified under \u00a7 3664(d)(5) if the victim\u2019s losses are not ascertainable by a date 10 days prior to sentencing or if a victim subsequently discovers further losses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(d)(5). A restitution order can also be adjusted under \u00a7 3664(k) due to a material change in economic circumstances. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664(k). Finally, a court may adjust a payment schedule or take any other action necessary to obtain compliance with an order of restitution upon a finding that the defendant is in default. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613A(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">Diamond argued below that his total sentence could be modified under \u00a7 3742, but that provision only provides for amendments to sentences following appeals, and Diamond directly appealed without challenging his total sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). Moreover, he did not argue that modification was proper under any of the other procedures set forth in \u00a7 3664(o). Without statutory authorization to modify Diamond\u2019s restitution order, the district court lacked jurisdiction to alter its order. <em>See Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d at 1317-18. Accordingly, we construe the district court\u2019s order denying the motion as a dismissal and affirm. <em>Cf. Cani v. United States, </em>331 F.3d 1210, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (construing a dismissal as a denial because the district court possessed subject matter jurisdiction and should have denied the defendant\u2019s motion on the merits).</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b949-12\">. To the extent Diamond also challenges the district court\u2019s ruling on his motion for clarification, we do not have jurisdiction to consider his argument because he did not identify that order in his notice of appeal. Although we construe such notices liberally, \"[t]he general rule in this circuit is that an appellate court has jurisdiction to review only those judgments, orders or portions thereof which are specified in an appellant's notice of appeal.\u201d Ost<em>erneck v. E.T. Barwick Indus., Inc., </em>825 F.2d 1521, 1529 (11th Cir.1987); <em>see also Moton v. Cowart, </em>631 F.3d 1337, 1341 n. 2 (11th Cir.2011) (explaining that when the appellant listed a specific order in his notice of appeal, we lacked jurisdiction to consider claims dismissed in an earlier, unnamed order).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
