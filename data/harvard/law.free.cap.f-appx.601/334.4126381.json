We granted Decker a certificate of appealability (COA) on the issue whether jurists of reason could disagree with the district court\u2019s resolution of his claim that his constitutional rights were infringed insofar as his disciplinary conviction resulted in the loss of good-time credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">\u201c[T]he Due Process Clause does not protect every change in the conditions of confinement which has a substantial adverse effect upon a prisoner.\u201d <em>Madison v. Parker, </em>104 F.3d 765, 767 (5th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483-84, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995)). A prisoner\u2019s liberty interest under the Due Process Clause generally is \u201climited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.\u201d <em>Conner, </em>515 U.S. at 484, 115 S.Ct. 2293 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">There is \u201ca constitutional expectancy of early release,\u201d and thus a \u201cprotected liberty interest,\u201d created by Texas\u2019s mandatory supervision scheme in place before and after September 1, 1996, for earned good-time credits. <em>Teague v. Quarterman, </em>482 F.3d 769, 777 (5th Cir.2007); <em>Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 957-58 (5th Cir.2000). A prisoner who is eligible for mandatory supervision thus has a protected interest in his good-time credits, and the loss of these credits can result in a cognizable \u00a7 2254 claim. <em>Teague, </em>482 F.3d at 777; <em>Malchi, </em>211 F.3d at 957-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-14\">The district court\u2019s adjudication of Decker\u2019s claim concerning his loss of good-time credits was grounded in its conclusion that he was serving a sentence for aggravated kidnaping and thus was ineligible for mandatory supervision. This conclusion is undermined by the record and the parties\u2019 briefs. These items show that Decker has discharged his sentence for his aggravated kidnaping offense and is currently serving a sentence for solicitation of capital murder. Accordingly, that portion of the district court\u2019s judgment concluding that Decker\u2019s constitutional rights were not implicated by the loss of good-time credits because he was ineligible for mandatory supervision is vacated, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-15\">Decker also moves to have Judge Garza recused from these proceedings based on that judge\u2019s actions in a prior case. That motion is denied as moot. In addition, he moves to have Judge Hittner recused from these proceedings based on that judge\u2019s initial adjudication of the claim at issue in this appeal. Because Decker has not shown judicial bias, his motion to recuse Judge Hittner is denied. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), (b)(1); <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-16\">MOTIONS TO RECUSE DENIED; JUDGMENT VACATED IN PART; RE<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>MANDED FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
