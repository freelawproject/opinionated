Souffrant, </em>517 Fed.Appx. 803 (11th Cir.2013), we affirmed appellant Garry Souffrant\u2019s convictions on 46 counts of an indictment charging a \u201cmultimillion dollar mortgage fraud conspiracy\u201d and related substantive offenses that occurred in South Florida in 2009. We also affirmed Souffrant\u2019s sentences, which included an order, entered pursuant to the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (\u201cMVRA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132,' 110 Stat. 1227, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A (2006), requiring him to pay in excess of $4.8 million in restitution to the victims of his offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-16\">On October 19, 2011, the District Court, on the Government\u2019s application and pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205(a), issued a writ of garnishment to the City of Boca Raton Police and Firefighters\u2019 Retirement System (the \u201cRetirement System\u201d) in an effort to satisfy, at least in part, the restitution ordered. The Retirement System, in its response to the writ, stated that Souf-frant\u2019s employee pension fund account had accumulated $46,962,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but, according to Fla. Stat. 175.241, it was not subject to garnishment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Souffrant, responding, claimed that the sums in the pension fund account belonged to the Retirement System. The District Court found no merit in either response. In an order issued on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>March 24, 2014, Doc. 348, the court adopted a Magistrate Judge\u2019s order, Doc. 333, directing the Retirement System to pay $46,962 into the District Court\u2019s registry. Souffrant appeals the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Souffrant argues that the pension fund did not belong to him and thus is not subject to garnishment. The fund is, instead, made up of potential future income, which the District Court expressly addressed in its restitution order. He also argues that seizing the funds may have harmed the rights of his victims by diminishing a potential long-term flow of income.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">Under the MVRA, restitution is mandatory for certain crimes, including offenses committed by fraud, such as those of which Souffrant had been convicted. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A(a)(l), (c)(l)(A)(ii). The government may enforce a restitution order through the procedures available for the enforcement of a civil judgment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3613(a); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3613(f) (\u201c[A]ll provisions of this section are available to the United States for the enforcement of an order of restitution.\u201d). Among those available is a writ of garnishment. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3205.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-7\">A restitution order issued following a conviction for an offense committed by fraud is a lien in favor of the government on all property and rights to property of the defendant \u2014 as if the defendant\u2019s liability were a tax liability assessed under the Internal Revenue Code, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3613(c), 3663A(c)(l)(A)(ii) \u2014 except certain property that is exempt from levy for taxes pursuant to \u00a7 6334(a)(l)-(8), (10), and (12) of the Internal Revenue Code. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3613(a)(1), (f). The Federal Debt Collection Procedures Act of 1990, Pub.L. No. 101-647, 104 Stat. 4789, 4933 (Nov. 29, 1990), codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3001 et seq., preempts state exemptions, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 3003(d), such as the one provided. Therefore, only property rights exempted from levy for taxes are exempt from garnishment to satisfy a restitution order. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3613(a)(1), (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-10\">Under the Internal Revenue Code, \u201call property and rights to property\u201d other than certain exempt property<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> may be levied to collect a tax liability. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331(a). With the exception of exempt property, the broad language indicates Congress\u2019s intent to \u201creach every interest in property that a taxpayer might have.\u201d <em>United States v. Nat\u2019l Bank of Commerce, </em>472 U.S. 713, 719-20, 105 S.Ct. 2919, 2924, 86 L.Ed.2d 565 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-11\">We find no error in the District Court\u2019s ordering the garnishment of Souffrant\u2019s pension plan funds. Under the MVRA, the Government could enforce the restitution order against the same property interests it could reach if Souffrant owed a tax deficiency. Because his pension plan is not one exempt from levy for a tax deficiency, a writ of garnishment could reach his contingent interest in the plan and cash it out plan because Souffrant was entitled to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b906-10\">. $41,788 in Souffrant's contributions, the balance in interest earned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b906-11\">. Fla.

For this reason, Souffrant argues that the court erred in not affording the victims an evidentiary hearing. Souffrant lacked standing to seek an evidentiary hearing on behalf of the victims; hence, his argument is merit-less.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b907-14\">.
