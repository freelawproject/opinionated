During voir dire, the prosecutor exercised a peremptory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>strike and explained his strike in part as follows: \u201cHis favorite magazine is hip hop. I\u2019m familiar with that kind of music, but it has a funkish element to it, rappers and stuff. I\u2019m not particularly fond of that.\u201d Defense counsel responded to this reasoning, \u201c[J]ust ... the type of magazine, a hip hop magazine, doesn\u2019t automatically make it a thuggish magazine.\u201d The prosecutor further elaborated on this particular reason, stating, \u201cIf somebody has a real religious magazine, I would strike them as well as a hip hop magazine. It\u2019s just a personal interest.\u201d The only issue on appeal is whether that peremptory strike violated <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">In <em>Batson, </em>the Supreme Court established a three-step test for evaluating racial discrimination claims in jury selection. <em>United States v. Folk, </em>754 F.3d 905, 912 (11th Cir.2014). First, the defendant must make a <em>prima facie </em>showing that a peremptory challenge has been exercised on the basis of race. <em>Id. </em>at 913. Second, if that showing is made, the prosecution must offer a race-neutral basis for striking the juror in question. <em>Id. </em>Then, third, in light of the parties\u2019 submissions the court determines whether the defendant has established purposeful discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b951-6\">The government and Edwards disagree over whether the requirement of a <em>prima facie </em>showing was moot in this case because the prosecutor offered a reason for striking the juror without prompting from the district court. The parties also disagree over whether we review the district court\u2019s application of the second step of the <em>Batson </em>analysis <em>de novo </em>or only for clear error. However, we need not decide those questions because the prosecutor\u2019s explanation was race-neutral under either standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-7\">Edwards contends that the prosecutor\u2019s explanation for the peremptory strike was not race-neutral. Unless discriminatory intent is inherent in the prosecutor\u2019s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race-neutral. <em>Folk, </em>754 F.3d at 914. Striking a juror because he is a fan of hip-hop music is nondiseriminatory on its face. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[W]e must ask whether the reasons tendered by the prosecution ... are nondiseriminatory on their face.\u201d). Even if Edwards is correct that there is a high correlation between race and hip-hop fandom, such a disparate impact theory cannot be used by itself to invalidate the prosecutor\u2019s stated reasons at step two of the <em>Batson </em>inquiry. <em>United States v. Houston, </em>456 F.3d 1328, 1336 (11th Cir.2006). <em>Batson\u2019s </em>second step \u201cdoes not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible.\u201d <em>Purkett v. Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 767-68, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 1771, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995). Instead, a legitimate reason is one that does not deny equal protection even if it does not make sense. <em>United States v. Steele, </em>178 F.3d 1230, 1235 (11th Cir.1999). Under that standard, the prosecutor\u2019s reason for striking the juror was legitimate.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
