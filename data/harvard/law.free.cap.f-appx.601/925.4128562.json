Baxter, Atlanta, GA, pro se.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b947-19\">Before MARCUS, WILLIAM PRYOR, and ANDERSON, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b947-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b947-21\">Victor Baxter, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his April 2014 motion to reduce his sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and Amendment 599 to the Sentencing Guidelines. After careful review, we affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-22\">Baxter was convicted of distributing at least five grams of cocaine base (crack cocaine), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count 1), and possessing with intent to distribute a mixture containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(C) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (Count 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-23\">The presentence investigation report (PSI) applied the 2002 Sentencing Guidelines to assign Baxter a base offense level of 32 because he was responsible for 83.1 grams of crack cocaine and 491.5 grams of cocaine hydrochloride, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(3). The offense level was increased by 2 because a firearm was possessed, pursuant to \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(2), for an adjusted offense level of 34. However, because Baxter had three prior felony convictions for crimes of violence, he was classified as a career offender, pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Count 1 carried a statutory maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and thus Baxter\u2019s offense level became 37 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>under the career offender guidelines, pursuant to \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(l). The PSI stated that the statutory range for Count 1 was 10 years\u2019 to life imprisonment, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(B), 851, and that the statutory range for Count 5 was 0 to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(C), 851. Based on an offense level of 37 and a criminal history category of VI, Baxter\u2019s guideline range was 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">The district court sentenced Baxter to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment for Count 1 and Count 5, to be served concurrently. We affirmed Baxter\u2019s convictions on appeal. <em>United States v. Baxter, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 471 (11th Cir.2005), <em>vacated by </em>544 U.S. 1013, 125 S.Ct. 1994, 161 L.Ed.2d 847 (2005) (remanding for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)), <em>opinion reinstated and sentence affirmed by </em>152 Fed.Appx. 878 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">In April 2014, Baxter filed the instant <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of his sentence in light of Amendment 599. The district court denied Baxter\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because Amendment 599 did not apply to Baxter\u2019s sentence and because Baxter was sentenced as a career offender and thus his offense level was controlled by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and was not affected by the underlying base offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s legal conclusions about the Sentencing Guidelines and the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1303 (11th Cir.2009). Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a district court may reduce the prison sentence of a \u201cdefendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has <em>subsequently </em>been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l). \u201cThe purpose of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is to give a defendant the benefit of a retroactively applicable amendment to the guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Glover, </em>686 F.3d 1203, 1206 (11th Cir.2012). The grounds upon which a district court may reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) are narrow. <em>United States v. Berry, </em>701 F.3d 374, 376 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Baxter\u2019s motion fails for multiple reasons, but the most glaring is the timing of Amendment 599. Amendment 599 took effect in November 2000, before Baxter was sentenced in December 2003. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C., Amend. 599. Thus, Baxter was not \u201csentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has been subsequently lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Baxter\u2019s remaining claims are not proper in a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding because they do not involve retroactive amendments to the Guidelines. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); <em>Berry, </em>701 F.3d at 376.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
