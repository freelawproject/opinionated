On appeal, Worthy argues that the Appeals Council improperly denied her petition for review based on new evidence because it failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>articulate its rationale or show an adequate evaluation of her new evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After review, we conclude that the Appeals Council adequately explained its reason for denying Worthy\u2019s petition for review and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Appellant Worthy\u2019s application for benefits alleged that she was disabled due to seizures, depression, and anxiety. After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) denied Worthy\u2019s application, applying the three-step sequential analysis used to determine whether a child is disabled. Specifically, at the third step, the ALJ concluded that Worthy\u2019s impairments did not functionally equal an impairment in the Listing of Impairments because Worthy did not have two \u201cmarked\u201d limitations or one \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in the six \u201cdomains\u201d used to evaluate a child\u2019s functional limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">The evidence before the ALJ included, among other things, that (1) in early 2009, after a car accident, Worthy began having seizures and pseudoseizures, sometimes as often as every other day; (2) occasionally Worthy was taken by ambulance to the emergency room, and discharged the same day; (3) Worthy initially was prescribed Depakote, which did not significantly change the frequency of her seizures; (4) because some of the seizures appeared panic-related, Worthy also was prescribed Zoloft; (5) Worthy performed satisfactorily in school, but her grades had declined, and she attended only half day due to afternoon seizures; (6) after Worthy\u2019s neurologist replaced Depakote with Lamictal in late 2010, the frequency of her seizures decreased significantly; (7) as a result, Worthy was able to return to school full time and her grades improved, and (8) a neuropsychological evaluation indicated that Worthy had mild impairments in higher-level language functions, but her nonverbal intellectual functioning was in the average range.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Before the Appeals Council, Worthy\u2019s petition for review submitted new evidence, including a few more medical treatment and billing records relating to Worthy\u2019s seizures, medications, and ambulance trips to the emergency room; a seizure log from 2011 and 2012; and a questionnaire completed by one of Worthy\u2019s middle school teachers. The Appeals Council denied the petition for review. The Appeals Council stated that it had \u201cconsidered the reasons [Worthy] disagree[d] with the decision and the additional evidence\u201d Worthy had submitted. The Appeals Council also \u201cconsidered whether the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s action, findings, or conclusion [was] contrary to the weight of evidence of record,\u201d and \u201cfound that this information does not provide a basis for changing the Administrative Law Judge\u2019s decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AvO\">A. Three-Step Evaluation Process</p>\n<p id=\"b842-11\">The ALJ uses a three-step, sequential evaluation process to determine whether a claimant under the age of 18 is disabled. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924(a); <em>see Wilson v. Apfel, </em>179 F.3d 1276, 1277 n. 1 (11th Cir.1999). Under this process, the ALJ evaluates: (1) whether the child is engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) whether the child has a severe and medically deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>minable impairment or combination of impairments; and (3) whether the child\u2019s impairment or combination of impairments meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the severity of an impairment in the Listing of Impairments. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 416.924(a)-(d); 416.926(a). In doing so, the ALJ considers \u201call relevant information,\u201d including evidence from medical and nonmedical sources, such as the child\u2019s parents and teachers. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(b)(3), (e)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">At step three, to determine whether the child\u2019s impairments \u201cfunctionally equal\u201d a listed impairment, the ALJ looks at whether the child has \u201cmarked\u201d limitations in at least two of six \u201cbroad areas of functioning\u201d called domains, or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one domain. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(a), (b)(1), (d). These six domains are: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) caring for oneself; and (6) health and physical well-being. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). The regulations also provide illustrative lists of examples of limited functioning within each domain. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(i)(3)(i)-(vi), (g)-(O-The regulations explicitly advise that \u201cthe examples do not necessarily describe a \u2018marked\u2019 or \u2018extreme\u2019 limitation,\u201d as defined by the regulations. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l), (g)(3), (h)(3), (i)(3), (j)(3), (k)(3), (i)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">An \u201cextreme\u201d rating is reserved for \u201cthe worst limitations,\u201d ones that interfere \u201cvery seriously\u201d with the child\u2019s ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(3)(i). A child\u2019s limitation is \u201cmarked\u201d if it is \u201cless than extreme,\u201d but \u201cmore than moderate\u201d and \u201cinterferes seriously with [the child\u2019s] ability to independently initiate, sustain, or complete activities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 416.926a(e)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">B. Petition for Review Based on New Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Generally, a claimant may present new evidence at each stage of the administrative process. <em>Ingram v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>496 F.3d 1253, 1261 (11th Cir.2007); 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.900(b). If a claimant presents evidence after the ALJ\u2019s decision, the Appeals Council must consider it if it is new, material, and chronologically relevant. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b). New evidence must not be cumulative of other evidence in the record. <em>See Caulder v. Bowen, </em>791 F.2d 872, 877 (11th Cir.1986). The evidence is material if \u201cthere is a reasonable possibility that the new evidence would change the administrative outcome.\u201d <em>Hyde v. Bowen, </em>823 F.2d 456, 459 (11th Cir.1987). The Appeals Council must grant the petition for review if it finds that the ALJ\u2019s \u201caction, findings, or conclusion is contrary to the weight of the evidence,\u201d including the new evidence. <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1261 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">In <em>Mitchell v. Commissioner, </em>this Court recently concluded that the Appeals Council is not required to provide a detailed explanation of a claimant\u2019s new evidence when it denies a petition for review. <em>Mitchell, </em>771 F.3d 780, 783-85 (11th Cir.2014). The Appeals Council in <em>Mitchell </em>denied review, stating simply that it had considered the additional evidence but \u201cthe information did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 782. This Court explained that the Appeals Council\u2019s statement indicated that it had \u201caccepted Mitchell\u2019s new evidence but denied review because the additional evidence failed to establish error in the ALJ\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 784. This Court determined that the Appeals Council\u2019s explanation was sufficient, emphasizing that the record did not provide a \u201cbasis for doubt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>ing the Appeals Council\u2019s statement that it considered Mitchell\u2019s additional evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 783-84 (distinguishing <em>Epps v. Harris, </em>624 F.2d 1267 (5th Cir.1980), in which the new evidence directly undermined the ALJ\u2019s stated rationale for its decision and thus \u201cprovided us with an affirmative basis for concluding the Appeals Council failed to evaluate the claimant\u2019s new evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">On appeal, \u201cwhen a claimant properly presents new evidence to the Appeals Council [but the Appeals Council denies review], a reviewing court must consider whether that new evidence renders the denial of benefits erroneous.\u201d <em>Ingram, </em>496 F.3d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">C. Appeals Council\u2019s Denial of Worthy\u2019s Petition For Review</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">Here, the Appeals Council denied Worthy\u2019s petition for review, stating, as it did in <em>Mitchell, </em>that it had considered Worthy\u2019s reasons for disagreeing with the ALJ\u2019s decision and her new evidence, but found that the new evidence did not provide a basis for changing the ALJ\u2019s decision. Under <em>Mitchell, </em>no further explanation was required of the Appeals Council. <em>Mitchell, </em>771 F.3d at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Worthy relies upon <em>Epps v. Harris, </em>which required the Appeals Council to show in its decision that it had adequately evaluated the new evidence. <em>Epps, </em>624 F.2d at 1273. As we explained in <em>Mitchell, </em>however, <em>Epps </em>involved an Appeals Council\u2019s affirming the ALJ, and thus <em>Epps </em>does not apply when, as here, the Appeals Council denies a petition for review. <em>Mitchell, </em>771 F.3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Furthermore, nothing in the administrative record provides a basis for concluding that the Appeals Council did not in fact consider Worthy\u2019s new evidence as it stated. <em>See id. </em>at 783-84 (distinguishing <em>Epps </em>further because it was apparent from the record that the Appeals Council had not considered the post-hearing evidence that contradicted the ALJ\u2019s premise for denying benefits). That is, none of Worthy\u2019s new evidence directly undermines the ALJ\u2019s stated rationale for his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">The ALJ, in concluding Worthy did not have impairments that functionally equaled a listed impairment, stressed that the record indicated the right medication and dosage had greatly reduced Worthy\u2019s symptoms. In' fact, the record showed that once Worthy began taking Lamictal, the frequency of her seizures went from as many as twenty seizures a month to one seizure a week or less and that Worthy now is able to attend school for a full day. As to the six domains, the ALJ found that Worthy had a marked limitation in only one domain (health and physical well-being), had a less than marked limitations in four domains (acquiring and using information, attending and completing tasks, interacting and relating with others, caring for herself), and had no limitation in one domain (moving about and manipulating objects).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">With her petition for review, Worthy submitted additional medical records and a seizure log. The medical records showed Worthy continued to be treated for seizures, including taking Lamictal for her seizures and Zoloft for anxiety, and did not show a worsening of her symptoms. The seizure log indicated that Worthy had four seizures per month from July to October 2011 and three seizures per month from November 2011 to February 2012. In other words, Worthy\u2019s new evidence is consistent with the ALJ\u2019s finding that Worthy\u2019s symptoms had improved with proper medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">Worthy also submitted a teacher questionnaire, which indicated that Worthy had \u201cobvious\u201d and \u201cserious\u201d problems with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>some activities, such as comprehending math problems, expressing anger, and providing organized oral explanations. But, these activities only loosely correspond to the examples of limited functioning in each domain listed in the regulations, which themselves \u201cdo not necessarily describe a \u2018marked\u2019 or \u2018extreme\u2019 limitation.\u201d <em>See, e.g., </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(g)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Further, the teacher\u2019s overall evaluation of each domain appears to be consistent with the ALJ\u2019s findings. For example, although the teacher evaluated Worthy as having an \u201cobvious problem\u201d with four activities within the domain of \u201cinteracting and relating with others,\u201d the teacher indicated that Worthy had \u201cno problem\u201d or only a \u201cslight problem\u201d with nine other activities. Thus, the teacher\u2019s evaluation of Worthy\u2019s limitations in this domain does not undermine the ALJ\u2019s finding that Worthy had a \u201cless than marked\u201d limitation in this domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">On appeal, Worthy argues that the teacher evaluation shows \u201cthe equivalent to a marked or extreme impairment\u201d in the domain of \u201cacquiring and using information.\u201d To be sure, the teacher\u2019s ratings indicate that Worthy has the most problems in that domain. Yet, the teacher indicated that Worthy had no or only slight problems with four activities, obvious problems with four activities, and serious problems with only two activities. Moreover, the teacher questionnaire does not explain what distinguishes between slight, obvious, or serious problems or how these designations might correspond to \u201cless than marked;\u201d \u201cmarked,\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d ratings as defined in the regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">For the same reasons, Worthy\u2019s new evidence submitted to the Appeals Council does not render the denial of benefits erroneous. The new evidence is either cumulative of, or consistent with, the evidence that was before the ALJ. The new evidence also is not \u201cmaterial,\u201d in that there is not a \u201creasonable possibility\u201d the ALJ would have made a \u201cmarked\u201d finding in one of the other five domains or made an \u201cextreme\u201d finding in any of the six domains had he seen Worthy\u2019s new evidence. Accordingly, the Appeals Council did not err in denying Worthy\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\">. On appeal, Worthy challenges only the Appeals Council's denial of her petition for review and not the ALJ\u2019s underlying decision. Thus, Worthy has abandoned any claim of error with respect to the ALJ's decision. <em>See Allstate Ins. Co. v. Swann, </em>27 F.3d 1539, 1542 (11th Cir.1994) (explaining that issues not raised on appeal ordinarily are considered abandoned).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
