Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there may have been some error in that regard, Appellants have failed in their initial brief on appeal to identify specific portions of the fee award which would thus constitute error. Broad categories identified by Appellants \u2014 e.g., discovery \u2014 are not sufficient identification, because Appellants fail to explain how or why such categories, or any particular parts thereof, were unrelated to and did not contribute to the success achieved. Similarly, with respect to Appellants\u2019 challenge to fees for work performed after the injunction pending appeal was granted, Appellees would be entitled to fees for work reasonably related to sustaining the injunction which had been obtained. In addition, Appellees would be entitled to fees for work entailed in reasonably calcu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>lat\u00edng, seeking, and defending an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Appellants\u2019 brief on appeal does not identify any portion of the fee award unrelated to such work. Nor does Appellants\u2019 brief explain why the fees the district court awarded for the Appel-lee\u2019s work was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion with respect to the hourly rates. We reject Appellants\u2019 argument that Appellees abandoned their claim for $1283.00 in non-taxable district court costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
