After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b828-17\">A. Municipal Court Criminal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b828-18\">Plaintiff Mathis was one of six \u201corganizers\u201d of a limited liability corporation called Cheerleaders South Sports Caf\u00e9 LLC. The LLC owns a restaurant in the City of Morrow called Cheerleaders Sports Caf\u00e9 (\u201cCheerleaders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b828-19\">On June 20, 2010, Defendant Officer Turner of the Defendant City of Morrow\u2019s Police Department conducted a business inspection at Cheerleaders. Plaintiff Mathis and Cheerleaders\u2019 manager, Tiffiny Donley, were at the restaurant during Defendant Turner\u2019s inspection. Defendant Turner arrested Mathis and Donley and took them to the police station, where he cited them for 23 city-ordinance violations. After spending almost three days in jail, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>Mathis and Donley were released on June 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Arraignment originally was set for August 18, 2010, but was rescheduled multiple times after Mathis and Donley appeared <em>pro se, </em>sought a \u201cformal arraignment,\u201d and made oral motions to dismiss the charges. Eventually, a trial was set for April 18, 2011, but on that date, the municipal court granted the City solicitor\u2019s request to place the case on the dead docket. On November 9, 2012, the criminal case against Mathis and Donley was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">During the protracted municipal court litigation, two municipal court judges re-cused. Throughout, Mathis and Donley maintained, among other things, that City officials (1) knew Mathis and Donley were not the owners, licensees, or lessees with respect to Cheerleaders and thus were not the proper parties to be charged with the city-ordinance violations; and (2) refused to dismiss or delayed dismissing the case against them in order to thwart a future claim of malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-8\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 First Four Complaints</p>\n<p id=\"b829-9\">While the municipal court criminal proceedings were ongoing, Mathis, <em>pro se, </em>and Donley, represented by counsel, filed a civil Complaint and an Amended Complaint in state court. After the Defendants removed the action to federal district court, the Plaintiffs filed a- Second Amended Complaint on October 1, 2012. All three complaints alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>malicious prosecution claims under both \u00a7 1983 and state law against the Defendant City and various officials, including Defendant Officer Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-10\">The district court stayed the Plaintiffs\u2019 federal action pending resolution of the municipal court proceedings. After the municipal charges were dismissed, the district court reopened the \u00a7 1983 case on January 9, 2013. Pursuant to the district court\u2019s order, the Plaintiffs, both now represented by counsel Robert Kenner, Jr., filed a Third Amended Complaint, which is the dispositive complaint for purposes of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-12\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 Third Amended Complaint did not allege a state law claim of malicious prosecution. Instead, the Third Amended Complaint alleged: (1) a \u00a7 1983 claim for denial of the right to self-representation; (2) a \u00a7 1983 claim of municipal liability for failure to implement proper procedures as to a criminal defendant\u2019s right to self-representation; (3) a \u00a7 1983 claim of malicious prosecution; (4) a \u00a7 1983 claim of municipal liability for failure to train the Morrow Police Department as to illegal prosecutions; and (5) a claim for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to \u00a7 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-13\">C. District Court\u2019s Scheduling Order</p>\n<p id=\"b829-14\">After the Defendants filed answers, the parties filed a Joint Preliminary Planning Report and Discovery Plan (\u201cthe Plan\u201d) on March 9, 2013. According to the Plan, the Plaintiffs had notified the Defendant City that they intended to seek leave to amend their Third Amended Complaint to, among other things, add a state-law malicious prosecution claim. The Plan provided, however, that amendments to the pleadings submitted later than thirty days after the Plan was filed, i.e., after April 9, 2013, would not be accepted, unless otherwise permitted by law. The district court entered a scheduling order accepting the Plan\u2019s deadlines and ordering that discovery would last eight months, thus ending on November 8, 2013. The district court warned the parties that deadline extensions were not likely to be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-15\">The deadline for filing amended pleadings expired without the Plaintiffs\u2019 filing a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>fourth amended complaint or asking for an extension of time. Meanwhile, in a series of pretrial orders, the district court dismissed a number of claims and defendants, such that the only remaining claims were: (1) the \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim against the Defendant City and the Defendant Turner in his individual capacity; (2) the \u00a7 1983 failure-to-train claim against the Defendant City; and (3) the \u00a7 1988 claim for attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">D.Mathis\u2019s <em>Pro Se </em>Motion to Amend the Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">On June 19, 2013, Plaintiff Mathis filed a \u201cMotion for Substitution of Counsel.\u201d Mathis notified the district court that he had terminated Kenner as his counsel, that he was a practicing attorney, and that he wished to proceed <em>pro se. </em>In a response, counsel Kenner indicated without elaboration that the attorney-client relationship had deteriorated, and he did not object to Mathis\u2019s motion. Counsel Kenner advised, however, that he continued to represent Plaintiff Donley. On July 9, 2013, the district court granted Plaintiff Mathis\u2019s motion to terminate Kenner as Mathis\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">On October 2, 2013, Plaintiff Mathis filed a <em>pro se </em>motion for leave to file an amended complaint (\u201cOctober motion\u201d), pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2). Mathis attached his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint, which alleged malicious prosecution claims under \u00a7 1983 and state law, and a \u00a7 1988 claim for attorney\u2019s fees. The proposed Fourth Amended Complaint included both Mathis and Donley as named plaintiffs and repeatedly referred to Donley and Mathis together as \u201cthe Plaintiffs,\u201d but was signed only by Mathis. Mathis\u2019s motion noted that the Defendants did not consent to his proposed amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">E. District Court\u2019s Denial of Leave to Amend</p>\n<p id=\"b830-8\">On October 3, 2013, the district court <em>sua sponte </em>denied Mathis\u2019s motion for leave to amend (\u201cthe October order\u201d). The district court pointed out that Mathis had not indicated that Donley joined his motion, which was unlikely given that the motion was not signed by Donley\u2019s attorney, Kenner. The district court further explained that \u201cDonley must join any such motion and the complaint must be filed on behalf of both Plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b830-9\">F. Plaintiff Donley\u2019s Motion to Sever and Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">On November 15, 2013, after the district court ordered the parties to enter mediation to try to settle the case, counsel Ken-ner filed a motion to sever Donley\u2019s case from Mathis\u2019s case. In an affidavit, counsel Kenner averred that he and Mathis could not agree on trial strategy, including \u201chow an Amended Complaint should be drafted.\u201d Mathis opposed severance, and in his own affidavit averred that he, rather than Kenner, had performed most of the legal work for the case. Mathis also attached an affidavit from Donley asking the district court to deny Kenner\u2019s motion to sever filed on her behalf. The district court denied the motion to sever. On November 25, 2013, Donley, with Kenner still representing her, settled Donley\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">G. Mathis\u2019s Second <em>Pro Se </em>Motion to Amend Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">On December 1, 2013, almost eight months after the scheduling order\u2019s deadline for amending the pleadings, Mathis filed a second <em>pro se </em>motion for leave to file an amended complaint, again seeking to allege a state-law malicious prosecution claim (\u201cDecember motion\u201d). Mathis argued that he should be allowed to amend his complaint now that Donley had settled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>her claims. Mathis did not attach a copy of his proposed amended complaint.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">The Defendants opposed Mathis\u2019s December motion for various reasons, including that: (1) Mathis\u2019s proposed amendment was untimely under the district court\u2019s scheduling order and he had not shown \u201cgood cause\u201d to modify .the scheduling order, as required by Federal Rule of Civil 16(b)(4); (2) Defendants would be prejudiced by a late amendment; and (3) Mathis had not attached a copy of his proposed amended complaint to his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">In his reply, Plaintiff Mathis argued that he should be allowed to amend his complaint under Rule 15(a), but did not address the Defendants\u2019 Rule 16(b)(4) argument or explain how he had shown \u201cgood cause\u201d to excuse him from the scheduling order\u2019s April 9, 2018 deadline to amend the pleadings. To his reply brief, Mathis attached a copy of his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">On January 13, 2014, the district court denied Mathis\u2019s December motion. (\u201cJanuary order\u201d). The district court concluded that: (1) Mathis had not shown good cause under Rule 16(b)(4); (2) Mathis\u2019s brief had not mentioned Rule 16(b)(4); (3) Mathis had not diligently pursued the fourth amendment; (4) Mathis\u2019s motion had failed to comply with the procedural requirements for amending his complaint; and Mathis\u2019s reply brief had attached a proposed Fourth Amended Complaint that contained 15 additional pages and 32 additional numbered paragraphs (compared to Mathis\u2019s proposed Fourth Amended Complaint attached to his October motion), of which Defendants appeared to have had no notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-11\">H. Mathis\u2019s 2014 Motion to Alter or Amend the Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b831-12\">On February 2, 2014, Mathis filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, citing Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 59(e) and 60(b). Mathis asked the district court to amend the \u201cjudgment entered on October 3rd, 2013, or in the alternative January 13th, 2014 denying Plaintiffs inclusion of the state claim for malicious prosecution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b831-13\">Mathis claimed that he had been diligent in his attempts to amend his complaint but that his former counsel Kenner refused to amend the complaint. Mathis submitted his affidavit and e-mail exchanges between Mathis and Kenner dating from April 30, 2013 through July 22, 2013.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-14\">The Defendants opposed Mathis\u2019s motion and submitted a deposition of Kenner. Kenner testified that he dropped the state-law malicious prosecution claim from the Third Amended Complaint because the Defendant City had not yet responded to the Plaintiffs\u2019 ante litem notice. As a result, in January 2012, while preparing the Plan, Kenner and Mathis agreed they would amend the complaint to add the state-law malicious prosecution claim after discovery expired and then inserted language in the Plan that they believed would protect their ability do to so.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-15\">In reply, Mathis submitted his and Don-ley\u2019s affidavits disputing Kenner. According to Mathis and Donley, Mathis did not agree to wait until after discovery expired to amend the complaint and repeatedly asked Kenner to amend the complaint in April 2012, before the scheduling order deadline, but was ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>The district court denied Mathis\u2019s \u201cmotion for reconsideration.\u201d The district court concluded that: (1) Rule 59(e) did not apply because neither the October order nor the January order was a \u201cjudgment\u201d; (2) Mathis had not identified which subsection of Rule 60(b) entitled him to relief or cited any authority to support his argument; and (3) Mathis possessed the information about his dispute with Kenner prior to his October and December motions, but failed to explain why he did not include it with these motions or why he did not address Rule 16(b)(4)\u2019s \u201cgood cause\u201d requirement in those motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">I. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">After discovery expired, the Defendants moved for summary judgment on Mathis\u2019s remaining claims. The district court, granted the Defendants\u2019 motions. As to the \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim, the district court concluded that there was no seizure under the Fourth Amendment as a matter of law. Specifically, Mathis was arrested without a warrant and then released, and the subsequent municipal court proceedings against Mathis did not begin until his arraignment. Additionally, Mathis conceded that after his arraignment he was not subject to restrictions in his movement, was not required to report for a pretrial program or drug testing, and did not have to wear an ankle monitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">As to the \u00a7 1983 failure-to-train claim, the district court concluded that because Mathis\u2019s underlying malicious-prosecution claim was meritless, this claim was also meritless. Alternatively, the district court concluded that Mathis had not shown that the Defendant City was deliberately indifferent to his constitutional rights because he had not \u201cidentified a constitutionally deficient training program\u201d or shown that City officials were on notice of pattern of constitutional violations by untrained City employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">Finally, because the Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on Mathis\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims, the district court determined that Mathis was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1988. The Clerk of the Court entered a judgment dismissing Plaintiff Mathis\u2019s action, and ordered that the Defendants recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">The Defendant City then moved to recover attorney\u2019s fees, and Defendant Turner moved for sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b). The district court denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">II. AMENDMENTS TO A COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">A. Federal Rules 15(a) and 16(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b832-12\">Under Rule 15(a), the plaintiff may amend his complaint once as a matter of course within 21 days of serving it or within 21 days after the defendant\u2019s service of either the answer or a motion under Rule 12(b), whichever is earlier. Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(1). After this time has passed, a plaintiff may amend his complaint \u201conly with the opposing party\u2019s written consent or the court\u2019s leave.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2). Rule 15(a)(2) instructs courts to \u201cfreely give leave when justice so requires.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That said, courts may deny a motion for leave to amend on numerous grounds, including undue delay, undue prejudice to the defendants, and futility of amendment. <em>Maynard v. Bd. of Regents, </em>342 F.3d 1281, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-13\">Furthermore, once the district court limits the time to amend pleadings in a scheduling order, the schedule may only be modified for \u201cgood cause\u201d and with the district court\u2019s consent. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(4). Thus, a plaintiff seeking leave to amend his complaint after the scheduling-order deadline must show \u201cgood cause\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>under Rule 16(b). <em>S. Grouts &amp; Mortars, Inc. v. 3M Co., </em>575 F.3d 1235, 1241 (11th Cir.2009). Lack of diligence in pursuing a claim is sufficient to show lack of good cause. <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff lacks diligence when, prior to the scheduling order deadline, he either (1) had full knowledge of the information with which he later sought to amend his complaint, or (2) failed to seek the information he needed to determine whether to amend the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 1241 n. 3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">B. Mathis\u2019s <em>Pro Se </em>Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying either of Mathis\u2019s <em>pro se </em>motions for leave to amend his complaint. With respect to his October motion, Mathis\u2019s proposed Fourth Amended Complaint identified Donley in its caption as a named plaintiff, included Donley as one of the parties, made factual allegations involving her, and referred to the \u201cplaintiffs\u201d in its \u00a7 1983 claim for malicious prosecution. However, neither Don-ley nor her attorney of record signed Mathis\u2019s October motion or his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint. Mathis\u2019s proposed amendments affected Donley\u2019s claims against the City and Turner, and, as Mathis was not representing Donley in the action, Mathis could not amend her complaint without her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Contrary to Mathis\u2019s argument, the district court did not deny his October motion because \u201cany amendment to the complaint by Appellant must include the co-plaintiffs attorney\u2019s joinder.\u201d Rather, the district court denied the October motion because it ostensibly sought to amend the complaint on behalf of both Plaintiffs, but without the consent of either Donley or her counsel. This Mathis could not do.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-11\">In any event, with respect to both the October and December motions, Mathis failed to show good cause for excusing him from the scheduling order\u2019s deadline to amend the pleadings. Mathis\u2019s complaint was filed in August 2012, and by January 9, 2013, his complaint was already amended three times, resulting in the Third Amended Complaint. Under the scheduling order, Mathis had until April 9, 2013, thirty days after the Plan was filed, to seek leave to amend his complaint. But, Mathis did not move to amend his complaint until almost six months after the deadline, on October 2, 2013, and then a second time on December 1, 2013, almost eight months after that deadline. Therefore, Mathis was required under Rule 16(b) to show \u201cgood cause\u201d for each of his motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-12\">Neither of Mathis\u2019s motions demonstrated good cause, however. Indeed, as the district court noted, Mathis\u2019s December motion failed to even mention Rule 16(b). Further, Mathis could not show good cause because he was not diligent in pursuing his state-law malicious prosecution claim. <em>See S. Grouts &amp; Mortars, </em>575 F.3d at 1241 n. 3. Mathis had included the state-law claim in prior complaints, including his Second Amended Complaint, but omitted it from his Third Amended Complaint. He thus knew of the state-law claim and the facts supporting it well before the April 9, 2013 deadline,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but waited until six months after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>the deadline to try to add that state-law claim. Mathis\u2019s arguments \u2014 that he did not act in bad faith and that the Defendants would not have been prejudiced\u2014 ignore Rule 16(b) and do not show diligence or good cause for granting leave to amend many months after the deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">III. DENIAL OF MATHIS\u2019S RULE 60(b) MOTION</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Under Rule 60(b), the district court may relieve a party of a final judgment or order for: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence that could not previously have been discovered with reasonable diligence; (B) fraud, misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party; (4) a void judgment; (5) a judgment that has been satisfied, released or discharged, that is based on an earlier judgment that has been reversed or vacated, or that it would no longer be equitable to apply prospectively; or (6) any other reason that justifies relief. Fed. R.Civ.P. 60(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">Mathis\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion did not identify under which grounds he sought relief. On appeal, Mathis, however, contends he sought relief under the catch-all provision of Rule 60(b)(6). Relief under Rule 60(b)(6), \u201cfor any other reason,\u201d is an extraordinary remedy that may only be invoked upon a showing of exceptional circumstances. <em>Crapp v. City of Miami Beach, </em>242 F.3d 1017, 1020 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The appellant\u2019s burden on appeal from the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion is a heavy one. <em>Cano v. Baker, </em>435 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2006). It is not enough that a grant of the Rule 60(b) motion might have been permissible or warranted; rather, the appellant must show a justification so compelling that the district court was required to vacate its order. <em>Id. </em>When a party attempts to introduce new evidence in a motion for reconsideration, the district court should not grant the motion absent a showing that the evidence was previously unavailable or newly discovered. <em>See Mays v. United States Postal Serv., </em>122 F.3d 43, 46 (11th Cir.1997) (involving Rule 59(e) motion); <em>Willard v. Fairfield S. Co., </em>472 F.3d 817, 821 (11th Cir.2006) (involving Rule 60(b) motion).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-11\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mathis\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion filed in February 2014.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mathis\u2019s 2014 motion blamed his former counsel Kenner for the failure to file a motion to amend before the April 9, 2013 deadline and contended that Mathis tried repeatedly to get Kenner to file such a motion in April, but Kenner ignored him. In support, Mathis\u2019s 2014 motion quoted from email communications between Mathis and Kenner from April to July 2013. Mathis also submitted his affidavit describing his deteriorating relationship with Kenner and the disagreement about amending the complaint. However, Mathis\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion did not explain why he had failed to advance this argument in his October motion and submit the information at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-12\">The record demonstrates that Mathis was fully aware of his dispute with Kenner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>and possessed the email exchanges between them when he filed his October 2013 motion for leave to amend. Given that the information relied upon was neither previously unavailable nor newly discovered, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the Rule 60(b) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">In any event, even considering the new information in Mathis\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, Mathis still failed to show exceptional circumstances justifying relief. Mathis, a practicing attorney, admits he knew in April 2013 that he needed to amend his complaint to add the state-law malicious prosecution claim. Yet, he waited at least another six weeks, until June 19, 2013, to terminate Kenner and file his motion to proceed <em>pro se. </em>Then, Mathis waited another three months, until October 2, 2013, to file his own <em>pro se </em>motion to amend seeking to add the state-law malicious prosecution claim. Under these factual circumstances, we cannot say Mathis was diligent in pursuing amendment to add his state-law malicious prosecution claim. For these reasons, Mathis\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion did not show a justification so compelling that the district court was required to vacate its October order denying leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">IV. SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON \u00a7 1983 MALICIOUS PROSECUTION CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">On appeal, Mathis challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment only as to his \u00a7 1983 claim of malicious prosecution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mathis contends that the district court erred in concluding that the record established as a matter of law that there was no \u201cseizure\u201d of Mathis within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">To establish a malicious prosecution claim under \u00a7 1983, \u201ca plaintiff must prove (1) the elements of the common law tort of malicious prosecution, and (2) violation of [his] Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures.\u201d <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir.2004). Thus, in addition to the common law elements, a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff must prove that he was \u201cseized in relation to the prosecution, in violation of [his] constitutional rights.\u201d Id at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-11\">As this Court expressed in <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>\u201c[t]he plaintiffs arrest cannot serve as the predicate deprivation of liberty because it occurred prior to the time of arraignment, and was not one that arose from malicious prosecution as opposed to false arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). For purposes of a malicious prosecution claim when there is a warrantless arrest, \u201cthe judicial proceeding does not begin until the party is arraigned or indicted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, the normal conditions of pretrial release, such as bond and a summons to appear, do not constitute a seizure, \u201cbarring some significant, ongoing deprivation of liberty, such as a restriction on the defendant\u2019s right to travel interstate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1236 (rejecting the \u201ccontinuing seizure\u201d theory where, one day after her warrantless arrest for DUI, the plaintiff was released on a $1,000 bond, then arraigned, and, during the course of prosecution, travelled twice from New Jersey to Florida to appear in court).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">We agree with the district court that, under our binding precedent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number><em>Kingsland, </em>Mathis did not suffer a Fourth Amendment \u201cseizure\u201d after the judicial proceedings began in the municipal court prosecution. Mathis was arrested without a warrant, but this case is not a false arrest case. This case is a malicious prosecution case, and Mathis\u2019s warrantless arrest cannot serve as the predicate Fourth Amendment seizure for purposes of his \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1235. Moreover, the conditions of his pretrial release did not constitute a seizure, either, given that Mathis was released on signature bond, then arraigned, and travelled from Indiana to Georgia to attend hearings during the municipal court proceedings. <em>See id. </em>at 1236. Under these undisputed facts, the municipal court prosecution did not subject Mathis to any significant deprivation of liberty, and thus he was not seized under the Fourth Amendment during the municipal court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Mathis argues that being forced to appear at his arraignment at the Morrow City Hall was a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. <em>Kingsland, </em>however, forecloses this argument. In <em>Kingsland, </em>the plaintiff also appeared for arraignment, and this Court concluded that such an appearance in a court did not subject the plaintiff to a Fourth Amendment seizure for purposes of a malicious prosecution claim. <em>Id. </em>at 1225-26, 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Accordingly, Mathis has not shown any reversible error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Defendants on Mathis\u2019s \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-8\">. Mathis later sought to amend his December motion, wishing to add a \u00a7 1983 false arrest claim to his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint as well. The district court denied this request. On appeal, Mathis does not challenge that ruling on his false arrest claim, and we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b833-8\">. We review a district court's denial of a motion for leave to amend a complaint for abuse of discretion. <em>Covenant Christian Ministries, Inc. v. City of Marietta, </em>654 F.3d 1231, 1239 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b833-9\">. Mathis has never argued, either in the district court or this Court, that he did not have all of the information he needed to bring his state-law malicious prosecution claim until after the scheduling order deadline had passed. We note, in any case, that this assertion alone would not have been enough to entitle Mathis to relief from the scheduling order under Rule 16(b) because the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>seeking to amend must also show that he has been diligent in pursuing whatever information he needed to amend the complaint. <em>See S. Grouts &amp; Mortars, </em>575 F.3d at 1241 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b834-9\">. Mathis does not challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration to the extent it was brought under Rule 59(e). Furthermore, although a heading in Mathis\u2019s brief makes a passing reference to the district court's January order, the body of the brief argues only that the district court erred in refusing to reconsider its October order denying Mathis's October motion. Thus, these issues are abandoned. <em>See Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins. Co., </em>739 F.3d 678, 681-82 (11th Cir.2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b835-8\">. Because on appeal Mathis does not challenge the grant of summary judgment on his \u00a7 1983 failure-to-train claim or his \u00a7 1988 attorney\u2019s fees claim, those claims are abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b835-13\">. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same legal standards used by the district court. <em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">. Mathis also contends that his arraignment argument \"is not of the frivolous nature worthy of paying the Appellee attorney fees.\u201d The district court, however, did not order Mathis to pay attorney\u2019s fees, and thus we lack jurisdiction to consider the issue. <em>See Zinni v. ER Solutions, Inc., </em>692 F.3d 1162, 1166 (11th Cir.2012). To the extent Mathis challenges the district court\u2019s award of costs, the City and Turner were the prevailing parties, and Mathis has not rebutted the strong presumption under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(d) that the prevailing party will be awarded costs. <em>See Mathews v. Crosby, </em>480 F.3d 1265, 1276 (11th Cir.2007); Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
