Although Colorado Perez claims that his appellate waiver is unenforceable, the record shows that it was knowing and voluntary, because he knew that he had the right to appeal and that he was giving up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>that right by entering into the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Portillo, </em>18 F.3d 290, 292-93 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also United States v. Jacobs, </em>635 F.3d 778, 781 (5th Cir.2011). Additionally, the waiver, which the government invokes, precludes consideration of Colorado Perez\u2019s claim concerning his sentence. Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion to dismiss is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b359-26\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
