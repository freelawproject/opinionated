Gonzalez-Rodriguez argues that: (1) the IJ abused his discretion in holding that she failed to make a prima facie showing of a material change in conditions in El Salvador to support reopening of removal proceedings so that she could seek asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d); and (2) the BIA erred in summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s refusal to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen proceedings due to exceptional circumstances. After careful review, we deny the petition in part, and dismiss it in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-17\">We generally review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Id. </em>We review <em>de novo </em>whether we have subject matter jurisdiction to consider a petition for review. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). When the BIA issues a summary affirmance of the IJ\u2019s opinion under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), we review the IJ\u2019s opinion, not the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1284 n. 1 (11th Cir.2003). Therefore, we review the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cas if it were the Board\u2019s.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number><em>Alim v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 1239, 1254 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">First, we are unpersuaded by Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s claim that the IJ abused his discretion in holding that she failed to make a prima facie showing of a material change in conditions. Motions to reopen in removal proceedings are disfavored. <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256. We have held that, at a minimum, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen on the following three grounds: (1) failure to establish a prima facie case; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and (3) a determination that an alien is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion despite statutory eligibility for relief. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">An alien may file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, which must state the new facts to be proved at a hearing held if the motion is granted, and must be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A)-(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(l)-(2); <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 (11th Cir.2006). The motion must be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of the final order of removal. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2); <em>Zhang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>572 F.3d 1316, 1319 (11th Cir.2009). Even so, time and numerical time limitations do not apply \u201cwhen (1) an alien filed a motion to reopen that seeks asylum, withholding of removal, or relief under [CAT]; (2) the motion is predicated on 'changed country conditions; and (3) the changed conditions are material and could not have been discovered at the time of removal proceedings.\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256; <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The petitioner has a \u201cheavy burden\u201d and must demonstrate \u201cthat, if the proceedings were opened, the new evidence would likely change the result of the case.\u201d <em>Jiang, </em>568 F.3d at 1256-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">To establish eligibility for asylum, a petitioner must demonstrate either past persecution, or a well-founded fear of future persecution, based on a statutorily listed factor. <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1257 (11th Cir.2006). If the petitioner demonstrates past persecution, there is a rebuttable presumption that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Id. </em>If the petitioner cannot demonstrate past persecution, he must demonstrate that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <em>Id. </em>To show a well-founded fear of future persecution, the alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">The burden of proof for withholding of removal is \u201cmore likely than not,\u201d which is more stringent than the standard for asylum relief. <em>Id. </em>at 1232 (quotation omitted). Thus, if a petitioner fails to establish a claim of asylum on the merits, he often necessarily fails to establish a claim for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 1232-33. As a result, if the IJ made findings in support of denying an asylum claim, he need not make specific findings with respect to a withholding of removal claim. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1249 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">To establish a CAT claim, the alien must establish that he \u201cmore likely than not ... would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of removal.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303 (quotation omitted). The torture must be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>tion omitted). A government official acquiesces in torture where the official is aware of the torture before it occurs \u201cand thereafter breach[es] his or her legal responsibility to intervene to prevent such activity.\u201d <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted). Evidence that the police provided a petitioner with some protection does not support a finding that the government acquiesced in torture to qualify him for CAT relief. <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 891 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">In this case, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in denying Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s motion to reopen removal proceedings because Gonzalez-Rodriguez failed to make a prima facie showing of a material change in conditions in El Salvador. As the record shows, Gonzalez-Rodriguez failed to submit evidence concerning changed country conditions that was material and previously unavailable, she submitted evidence that \u2019actually tended to show that murders in El Salvador were declining, and she failed to establish that her own life was threatened on account of a protected class. Nor did the IJ abuse his discretion in failing to make a specific finding on whether Gonzalez-Rodriguez qualified as a member of a \u201cparticular social group,\u201d since the finding was not necessary to the result it reached in denying her motion to reopen \u2014 and especially since the threat she received occurred <em>before </em>her original removal proceeding. <em>See INS v. Bagamasbad, </em>429 U.S. 24, 25, 97 S.Ct. 200, 50 L.Ed.2d 190 (1976) (holding that as a general rule \u201ccourts and agencies are not required to make findings on issues the decision of which is unnecessary to the results they reach\u201d). Even so, evidence that Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s family was targeted by another family and that she faced a risk of persecution by that family did not establish her membership in a \u201cparticular social group\u201d for purposes of granting her asylum. <em>See Rodriguez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>735 F.3d 1302, 1310 (11th Cir.2013) (quotation omitted) (holding that an alien did not qualify as a member of a particular social group based on threats to his family from a drug-trafficking organization that wanted the family\u2019s land for growing drugs, because \u201crisk of persecution alone does not create a particular social group\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">Moreover, because Gonzalez-Rodriguez failed to meet the standard for asylum, and because the standard for establishing eligibility for withholding of removal is even higher than the standard for asylum, the IJ did not abuse his discretion in failing to consider Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s claim for withholding of removal. <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232; <em>see also Amaya-Artunduaga, </em>463 F.3d at 1249 n. 3. Nor did the IJ abuse his discretion in finding that Gonzalez-Rodriguez was not eligible for CAT relief \u2014 among other things, the evidence she submitted in her application tended to show that the Salvadorian government had laws in place to protect its citizens and was attempting to reduce gang violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">We are also unconvinced by Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the BIA erred in summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s refusal to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen removal proceedings. We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen based on its <em>sua sponte </em>authority because 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) provides no meaningful standard against which to judge the BIA\u2019s exercise of its discretion. <em>Lenis v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>525 F.3d 1291, 1292-94 (11th Cir.2008). Under the prior precedent rule, we are bound to follow prior binding precedent unless and until we overrule it sitting en banc, or until the United States Supreme Court overrules <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>the decision. <em>United States v. Vega-Castillo, </em>540 F.3d 1235, 1236 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Because neither this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>nor the Supreme Court has overruled <em>Lenis, </em>we are bound to follow <em>Lenis. </em>Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s refusal to reopen Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s removal proceedings. Moreover, although <em>Lenis </em>indicated that we may have jurisdiction over constitutional claims raised by a petitioner, Gonzalez-Rodriguez failed to make a meritorious constitutional claim that would warrant our consideration. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order summarily affirming the IJ\u2019s refusal to <em>sua sponte </em>reopen GonzalezARodriguez\u2019s removal proceedings, and dismiss Gonzalez-Rodriguez\u2019s petition as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">PETITION DENIED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
