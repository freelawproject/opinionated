J. S. A. </em>30:4D-7(j) by the State Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services, Department of Institutions and Agencies (Division), which administers the New Jersey Medical Assistance and Health Services (Medicaid) Program. The claim was asserted in a negligence action involving a complaint filed on September 18, 1970 on behalf of an infant pedestrian injured in an automobile accident. The first count of the complaint was the infant\u2019s cause of action by his mother as guardian <em>ad litem, </em>and the second count was by the mother individually. Both counts sought damages for the expenditure of \u201clarge sums of money for medical care and treatment.\u201d After a judgment in accordance with a jury verdict on the issue of liability only was entered in favor of plaintiffs on January 29, 1974, a settlement on damages was reached and an order for judgment was entered March 29, 1974 and filed April 4, 1974, providing that $3,000 be paid to the infant plaintiff and $4,500 be paid to the mother individually. The order f arther provided that \u201call medical bills and costs\u201d should be paid out of the mother\u2019s portion of the judgment, as should the counsel fee in the amount of $1,875, or 25% of the gross recovery, which was awarded to counsel for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">A notice of motion was filed by counsel for plaintiffs returnable June 6, 1974 seeking an order why the treasurer should not pay the sum of $7,500 in accordance with the order entered March 29, 1974 \u201cwith no deductions for Medicaid afforded to other persons than the minor plaintiff in the above entitled cause of action * * The Division filed a notice of cross-motion seeking reimbursement in the amount of $481.40 for payments made on behalf of the infant plaintiff under the Medicaid Program arising out of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The trial judge concluded that by virtue of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:4D-7(j) the New Jersey Medicaid Program was entitled to satisfy its statutory claim from the proceeds of the recovery. He also determined, however, that the State\u2019s recovery must be reduced by a pro rata share of counsel fee awarded to plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The State appeals the latter determination. While the immediate appeal involves a fee of $120.35, we are advised by the State that third-party liability recoveries of the kind involved in this matter for calendar year 1974 for the New Jersey Medicaid Program will approximate $600,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">The New Jersey Medicaid Program is a state-administered program of medical assistance to certain categories of indigent recipients. Most of the services are funded half by the Federal Government and half by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:4D-7(j) authorizes the New Jersey Medicaid Program to seek reimbursement such as is involved here. That provision, in turn, is based on provisions of Title XIX of the Social Security Act and in regulations promulgated pursuant thereto which mandate state recovery in cases where third-party liability exists. Social Security Act, \u00a7 1902(a) (25), 42 <em>U. S. C. A. </em>\u00a7 1396a(a) (25); 45 <em>C. F. R. </em>\u00a7 250.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:4D-7(j) provides in pertinent part that the Commissioner of the Department of Institutions and Agencies is authorized and empowered to \u201ctake all reasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay for care and services * * * arising out of injury, disease, or disability * <em>* </em>If a legal liability is found to exist after Medicaid payments have been made on behalf of an individual, the Commissioner is authorized \u201cto seek reimbursement for such assistance to the extent of such legal liability.\u201d Finally, when third-party liability is found, the Department of Institutions and Agencies \u201cshall be subrogated to the rights of the individual for whom medical assistance was made available.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>The evident legislative purpose behind <em>N. J. S. A. </em>30:4D-7(j) as well as its source provision in the Social Security Act is to prevent a \u201cdouble recovery\u201d by a Medicaid recipient who obtains Medicaid benefits, and then effects a recovery from a third party which includes payment for the same medical or hospital treatment. Conversely, it is intended to conserve the public funds of the State of New Jersey and of the United States since the Federal Government receives 50% of all third-party recoveries and the State retains the other half. The only limitation on recovery is the extent of the liability of the third party. The statute provides for no other limitation on the extent of the recovery, and there is no provision for a deduction from the recovery of any expenses of litigation, whether they be counsel fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The State argues that in the absence of any legislative provision requiring or permitting the payment of a pro rata share of counsel fees, the legislative mandate to effect recovery to the extent of the liability of the third party must be construed to preclude any deduction for counsel fees or costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">In a somewhat analogous situation, in <em>Firemen\u2019s Fund Indem. Co. v. Batts, </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>242 (App. Div. 1951), we held that, in the absence of a specific contrary legislative provision, the third-party liability provision of the New Jersey Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act would permit an employer to recover the full amount it had paid in workmen\u2019s compensation benefits to its employee without deduction for a pro rata share of his attorney\u2019s fees. In so holding we rejected the argument of the employee, similar to the argument advanced by plaintiffs here, that the employer would thereby \u201cinequitably receive the benefit of the legal services rendered in the third party action without in any wise contributing thereto.\u201d 11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 245. We concluded in <em>Bat\u00eds </em>that the imposition of a pro rata share of counsel fees was a matter for the Legislature and not the courts, noting that the problem \u201cmay well be appropriate for sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>mission to the Legislature in the event it considers further revision of the statutory provision * * *\u201d <em>Ibid.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">We conclude the New Jersey Medicaid Program, like workmen\u2019s compensation, is wholly a creature of statute and should be controlled by the terms of its enabling legislation without judicial word-straining in quest of a fancied social result. The absence of any specific legislative authorization, federal or state, to deduct a pro rata share of counsel fees from third-party liability recoveries, when read together with the legislative goal of conserving and recovering public funds, must be construed as precluding any such deduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Klacik v. </em>Kovacs, 111 <em>N. J. Super. </em>307 (App. Div. 1970), certif. den. 57 <em>N. J. </em>237 (1970), is misplaced. There we stated that in the absence of statute, rule of court or contract, \u201cthe mere accrual of benefits to a third party does not entitle an attorney to recover any compensation from those benefited,\u201d and, therefore, that any attempt to rely by way of analogy upon the workmen\u2019s compensation statute as support for the imposition of a fee was inappropriate. 111 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 311-312. Although in <em>Klacih </em>we permitted a deduction of a pro rata share of counsel fees based upon equitable considerations, it should be noted that <em>Klacih </em>involved the construction of an insurance contract containing no provision with respect to counsel fees or costs in its subrogation clause, and not the construction of a comprehensive statutory scheme for the payment of governmental benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">Finally, we cannot accept the suggestion of the <em>amicus </em>that because there is no statutory \u201cindependent right to recovery\u201d granted to the State as is granted to the Federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Government under the Federal Medical Care Recovery Act, 42 <em>U. S. C. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 2651-2653, the State\u2019s right of recovery is subrogated to the rights of the individual for whom assistance was made available, and, accordingly, is subject to a pro rata portion of any counsel fees payable. The argument is highly artificial and entirely alien to the statutory scheme of recovery. <em>Cf. United States v. Merrigan, </em>389 <em>F. </em>2d 21 (3 Cir. 1968); see also, Note, \u201cThe Medical Care Recovery Act,\u201d 23 <em>Rutgers L. Rev. </em>141 (1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">We also note with respect to the subrogation argument that here the State is subrogated to the infant\u2019s claim and not the mother\u2019s whose share of the settlement is solely subject to the counsel fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Following the <em>Batts </em>decision, the Legislature amended <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15-40, effective June 5, 1951, to provide that an employee\u2019s third-party liability recovery which is in excess of the employer\u2019s or carrier\u2019s liability and which is used to reimburse an employer or carrier shall be reduced by the \u201cemployee\u2019s expenses of suit and attorney\u2019s fee * * <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15 \u2014 40(b). See also, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>34:15 \u2014 40(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
