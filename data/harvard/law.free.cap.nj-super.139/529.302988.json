P. Reid, Inc., a contract for electrical work on a state construction project at the bTorth Jersey Training School in Totowa. -</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">Reid, the lowest bidder, had submitted a bid $188 less than that of Wittie, the next low bidder. The Director of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>the Division, in a telegram to Eeid, noted that \u201cyour firm does not have an agreement with an electrical building trades union,\u201d and expressed concern that an award to it \u201cmay have a detrimental impact on the progress of the work because it has been our experience that union mechanics will strike a job when non-union workmen are also employed on the same project.\u201d A hearing was scheduled to \u201cgive [Eeid] an opportunity to address yourself to this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Following the hearing the Director addressed a letter to Eeid setting forth his findings and conclusions. Il\u2019is problem, he indicated, was whether to award the contract \u201cto the low Electrical bidder (non-union) or spend $188 more and award to the second low bidder (union).\u201d He determined that, since (1) a mix of union and non-union contractors and workmen on one project or site \u201cis very likely to cause work stoppages due to picketing,\u201d (2) the nature and urgency of \u201cthe life-safety work\u201d involved in the contracts made it imperative to avoid all delays in or possible disruption of operations, and (3) the differential of $188 between the two low bids was a \u201creasonable administrative consideration which is mine to make\u201d under the statutes, it was in \u201cthe best interests of the State, the public and most specifically, the institution\u2019s patients\u201d to reject Eeid\u2019s low bid. However, because of an opinion of the Attorney General addressed to the State Treasurer (Formal Opinion No. <em>24r-</em>1975, dated September 17, 1975), that the Division did not have the authority to reject the bid of the lowest responsible bidder solely on the basis that it did not hire union labor, he had \u201cno alternative but to award this contract to your firm [Eeid] <em>since it appears that you are a responsible bidder in all other aspects.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The thrust of appellant\u2019s argument is that the award of state construction contracts subject to bidding is controlled by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:34-12, which empowers the state agency to award the contract \u201cto that responsible bidder whose bid, conforming to the invitation for bids, will be most advantageous to the State, price and other factors con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>sidered,\u201d and that the Director here could properly consider the \u201cprobability of labor disputes and resultant construction delay in determining to reject the low bid in the public interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Respondents argue that the applicable section is <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:32-2, under which the contract must be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder. We agree. It is clear that this section deals specifically with bids and contracts for the erection, construction, alteration or repair of public buildings. On the other hand, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:34-12 is part of a general statute <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>52:34-6 <em>et seq.) </em>pertaining to contracts in excess of $2500. It is a well-established principle of statutory construction that when there is a conflict between a general and a specific act on the same subject, the latter shall prevail. <em>Kingsley v. Wes Outdoor Advertising Co., 55 N. J. </em>336, 339 (1970). Furthermore, it is evident from a reading of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:34-12, when considered in the context of the chapter of which it is a part, that the subject matter of the contracts involved is of a non-construction nature, such as the purchase of supplies and services, the acquisition of real property, or the leasing of buildings, real property, or equipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">That the legislature intended to restrict the award of contracts under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:32-2 to the lowest responsible bidder on the basis of price is to be seen from its omission from that statute of the language in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>52:34-12 mandating consideration of \u201cprice and other factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Apart from its employment of nonunion labor, the Director conceded that Reid was \u201ca responsible bidder in all other respects.\u201d Thus, the Director must have been satisfied that Reid possessed the requisite moral integrity and the experience, financial ability and facilities necessary to perform the contract. <em>Arthur Venneri Co. v. Paterson Housing Auth., </em>29 <em>N. J. </em>392, 403 (1959). Reid\u2019s labor relations was not an appropriate factor to consider on the issue of responsibility. This is in accord with the prevailing judicial view. See Annotation, \u201cLabor conditions or relations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>as factor in determining lowest responsible bidder for public contract or as factor in determining whether public contract should be let to lowest bidder,\u201d 110 <em>A. L. R. </em>1406 (1937). <em>Cf. Keyes Elec. Service v. Cumberland Ciy. Freeholders, </em>15 <em>N. J. Super. </em>178 (Law Div. 1951); 10 <em>McQuillin, Municipal Corporations </em>(3 ed. 1966), \u00a7 29.48 at 361, \u00a7 29.73 at 428. See also, <em>State ex rel. United District Heating, Inc. v.

Ct. 1937), upon which appellant relies, is distinguishable and, in any event, represents a minority view.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">The Director\u2019s determination to award the electrical contract to respondent E. P. Keid, Inc., is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
