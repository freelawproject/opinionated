Following verdict the trial judge imposed sentences of life imprisonment in the New Jersey State Prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">Defendants were charged with the murder of Frederick Seidoff in Elizabeth. At about 11:00 p.m. on June 15, 1973 the victim was assaulted and robbed by four or five young men on a street near the Elizabeth Armory. The victim later died on July 3, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>The State produced several witnesses to the events surrounding the criminal episode. All of the witnesses generally-agreed that the attack was carried out by a group of four or five young men. The State\u2019s most important- witness was a 16-year-old male, Barry Hankins. This witness testified that he was alone and about 50-75 feet from the scene of the attack when he made his observations. Having said he saw defendant Hare grab the victim initially and then the defendant Lloyd hit the victim. Hankins then saw \u201call four boys\u201d stomp and kick the victim and saw Lloyd take a wallet out of the' victim\u2019s pocket. Hankins could not identify the other assailants. Hone of the other State\u2019s witnesses could describe' the entire event in detail, as did Hankins, who was the only witness who actually identified defendants as participants during the course of the attack. The State\u2019s other witnesses, including Barry Hankins\u2019 sister, Theresa, saw some pertinent aspects of the episode from a distance where they were congregated on the steps of the Elizabeth Armory. Several of the State\u2019s witnesses testified that defendant Lloyd, after the incident and as the group of suspected attackers were walking past the Armory, told one of the State\u2019s witnesses to, in effect, keep \u201chis mouth shut\u201d about anjdhing he saw. Hone, other than Hankins, could positively identify defendants as those carrying on the attack. The crucial aspect of Hankins\u2019 testimony is emphasized by the jury\u2019s request to have his testimony reread during its deliberations. This request was properly granted by the trial judge. The jury did not request the rereading of any other testimony. Following his observation of the attack Hankins joined the other young bystanders congregated on the steps of the Elizabeth Armory. One of those present activated a fire alarm in order to summon help for the victim. Hankins remained in the area until the police came to remove the victim. On the evening of the crime he volunteered no information to the police who came to the scene. On the following evening, in response to a police inquiry, Hankins gave a detailed statement inculpating defendants Hare and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Lloj^d as two of the four assailants whom he observed. He had known Hare and Lloyd for a considerable period of time before the attack. Hankins could not identify the several other assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">At the time of the episode and at the time of trial Hank-ins was on juvenile probation. Prior to Hankins\u2019 direct examination defense counsel applied to the court for leave to cross-examine Hankins on his status as a juvenile probationer. The trial judge denied this application and refused to permit any cross-examination as to Hankins probationary status. The defense\u2019s offer was designed to show bias, prejudice, interest or ulterior motive. Defendants now assert error of federal constitutional dimension, claiming denial of the full right to confrontation under the Sixth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Defendants rely on the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 <em>U. S. </em>308, 94 <em>S. Ct. </em>1105, 39 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 347 (1974), as announced by Chief Justice Burger. In <em>Davis, </em>the court recognized \u201cthe tension between the right of confrontation and the State\u2019s policy of protecting the witness with a juvenile record * * 415 <em>U. S. </em>314, 94 S. Ct. 1109, and opted for the right of confrontation, requiring disclosure of the juvenile record. The New Jersey statute precludes use of a juvenile record to discredit a witness. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:4-61. In <em>Davis </em>the state\u2019s key witness was a juvenile probationer who had been adjudicated delinquent on a burglary charge. In the present ease Hankins was on probation following adjudication on a breaking and entering and larceny charge. In <em>Davis, </em>as in the present case, the defense desired to attack the witness\u2019s credibility by exposure of his vulnerable probation status to reveal possible biases, prejudice, interest or ulterior motives. The following language in <em>Davis </em>is pertinent here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-6\">We cannot speculate as to whether the jury, as sole judge of the credibility of a witness, would have accepted this line of reasoning had counsel been permitted to fully present it. But we do conclude that the jurors were entitled to have the benefit of the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>theory before them so that they could make an informed judgment as to the weight to place on Green\u2019s testimony which provided \u201ca crucial link in the proof ... of petitioner\u2019s act.\u201d Douglas v. Alabama, 380 [U. S. 415] at 418, [419, 85 S. Ct. 1074, 1077] 13 L. Ed. 2d 934. The accuracy and truthfulness of Green\u2019s testimony were key elements in the State\u2019s case against petitioner. The claim of bias which the defense sought to develop was admissible to afford a basis for an inference of undue pressure because of Green\u2019s vulnerable status as a probationer, cf. Alford v. United States, 282 U. S. 687, 51 S. Ct. 218, 75 L. Ed. 624, (1931), as well as of Green\u2019s possible concern that he might be a suspect in the investigation. [415 <em>U. S. </em>at 318, 94 S. Ct. at 1111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">It is difficult to tell from the opinion in <em>Davis </em>whether the United States Supreme Court would require both elements to be present, <em>i. e., </em>vulnerable status as a probationer <em>and </em>the witness\u2019s possible concern that he might be a suspect,</p>\n<p id=\"Atr\">In <em>Davis </em>the State\u2019s witness could readily have been a suspect. A burglarized safe was found on his parents\u2019 property and near the home where the witness lived with his family. In the present ease Hankins would not have been so clearly suspected. In <em>Davis </em>the court felt the defense should be permitted to argue that the witness may have acted out of fear or concern of possible jeopardy to his probation. Hot only might he have made a hasty and faulty identification to shift suspicion away from himself but he might have been the subject of undue police pressure arising out of fear of possible probation revocation. The <em>Davis </em>case speaks of the witness\u2019s \u201cpossible concern that he might be a suspect in the investigation,\u201d and stresses the jury\u2019s right to weigh all facts relevant to such concern. 415 <em>U. S. </em>at 318, 94 S. Ct. at 1111. Here Hankins could have readily harbored such concern. He was a juvenile probationer, presumably a status ready made to attract police suspicions. He was alone and only 50-75 feet from the criminal episode when it took place. He was of the same age, sez and physical characteristics as the generally described four or five assailants. Hankins had earlier been in the group of young people congregated on the steps of the Elizabeth Armory and who had witnessed certain aspects of the attack. At around 10 p.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>he left the group to visit a friend. He left by himself and was returning from his friend\u2019s house to rejoin the group on the Armory steps when he encountered the criminal attack in progress. Again he was alone. In this case we think it entirely feasible and reasonable for a jury to have concluded that Hankins could \u201chave possible concern that he might be a suspect in the investigation.\u201d We find in the present case Hankins was a critical State\u2019s witness and that both requirements of vulnerable status and possible concern for complicity are met. As stated in <em>Davis-.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-5\">On. these facts it seems clear to us that to make any such inquiry effective, defense counsel should have been permitted to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors, as the sole triers of fact and credibility, could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness. [415 <em>U. S. </em>at 318, 94 S. Ct. at 1111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">We need not decide if vulnerable status alone without possible fear of complicity requires disclosure of relevant parts of the juvenile record. In the <em>Davis </em>case denial of this right of effective inquiry was held to be \u201cconstitutional error of the first magnitude,\u201d incapable of cure by a showing of lack of prejudice. The trial judge\u2019s refusal (where, as here, the juvenile may be a potential suspect in the investigation) to permit defense counsel to cross-examine Hankins on his status as a juvenile probationer in order to afford the defense a possible argument as to the lack of reliability of his identification, is constitutional error requiring reversal. Under these circumstances the general thrust of the <em>Davis </em>opinion is to allow the jury to have all available facts bearing on credibility, including a witness\u2019s juvenile probation or parole status, where such status could possibly be construed by a jury as influential in evaluating a witness\u2019s testimony in a criminal case. We believe a more restrictive construction would properly dilute the scope of the confrontation clause as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court. We note the trial judge permitted Hankins to be cross-examined on his concern over being a suspect, which concern he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>denied. The question, however, is not the witness\u2019 professed subjective belief, but rather the jury\u2019s conclusion as to the witness\u2019 motives under all of the factual circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">In view of the necessity for a retrial the following additional points deserve comment. The trial judge permitted the prosecutor to comment upon the nonproduction of certain witnesses by the defense. Within the limits set forth in <em>State v. Clawans, </em>38 <em>N. J. </em>162 (1962) such comment may be proper. At the trial the judge refused to permit defendants to explain why they were unable to find or produce certain witnesses despite efforts to do so. On retrial, if the judge permits the prosecutor to comment on the non-production of certain witnesses, defendants should be afforded ample opportunity to explain any efforts to produce these witnesses and reasons for their non-production.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The trial judge gave limiting instructions with respect to prior inconsistent statements, telling the jury they should not be used as substantive evidence but limited to use in evaluating credibility. <em>State v. Provet, </em>133 <em>N. J. Super. </em>432 (App. Div. 1975), certif. den. 68 <em>N. J. </em>174 (1975), explains the admissibility of a prior inconsistent extra-judicial statement as \u201csubstantive\u201d evidence under our <em>Evid. R. </em>63(1) (a). On retrial the jury should be charged consistently with the holding of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">As to the trial judge\u2019s charge under <em>Davis v. Alasita, supra, </em>the evidence of a prior adjudication of delinquency cannot be used for the purpose of impeaching the general credibility of the witness, as could an adult conviction of a crime. Rather such evidence is admitted for the more specific purpose of impeaching credibility by revealing possible bias, prejudice, interest or ulterior motive on the part of the witness with respect to a particular issue and the charge on new trial should so reflect.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">We have examined defendants\u2019 other contentions of error and find them without merit. In view of our disposition the additional points raised by appellants do not require comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
