Gormley in the Municipal Court of Egg Harbor City for permitting his motor vehicle to be operated by another person, Albert Bridda, while Bridda was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, in violation of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50(a). He was again found guilty on review by the Atlantic County Court which heard the case <em>de novo </em>upon the transcript of the municipal court trial. <em>N. J. S. A. 2A</em>:3-6; R. 3:23-1, 3:23-2 and 3:23-8(a). Both courts imposed the same sentence \u2014 a fine of $200 plus revocation (suspension) of defendant\u2019s driving privileges for two years and $15 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Defendant appeals from the judgment of the County Court, contending in effect that (1) his guilt was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and (2) that the statutory presumption<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the driver, Bridda, was under the influence of intoxicating liquor, should not have been used as evidence in the prosecution against him, the owner of the car. We find no merit in either of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Prank Cinkowski, sergeant of police of Egg Harbor City, testified at the trial in the municipal court that at about 4:15 in the morning of November 22, 1974 he observed Gormley\u2019s car on Route 30 \u201cswerving over the road at\u201d his car; that after he \u201cgot behind\u201d Gormley\u2019s car \u201cit swerved over to the curb lane, and then into the passing lane. This took place six or seven times. As it was swerving, he [the driver] would increase his speed to about forty miles per hour. Then he would slow down to twenty-five miles an hour.\u201d Sergeant Cinkowski stated that he stopped defendant\u2019s car; that he \u201ctook the driver [Bridda] back to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>police station where\u201d he, a qualified operator, \u201cadministered the breathalyzer test to\u201d him; that two tests were administered, one at 4:45 a.m. and the other at 4:50 a.m.; that Gormley was present \u201cin the next room\u201d when the tests were given; that he advised both Bridda and Gormley what was going on; that the breathalyzer \u201cwas in very good operating order\u201d at the time; that the reading on each test was \u201c.21 percent blood alcohol,\u201d and that he also</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">* * ^administered four balance tests; the first one being walking heel-to-toe. The subject\u2019s feet were moving. He could not do it. Standing erect, eyes closed, he was swaying. I asked him to stand bent at waist, eyes closed. He was swaying. I asked him to stand heel-to-toe, eyes closed. He had to move his feet. He could not do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Sergeant Cinkowski was of the opinion that Bridda had been \u201cdriving while under the influence of alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"aoo-dedup-0\">Defendant, the only other person testifying at the trial in the municipal court, stated that at about 11 p.m. on the night of November 21, 1974 he went to a \u201clounge\u201d in Black-wood ; that Bridda was there when he arrived; that he had two beers\u201d; that Bridda \u201chad one while I was there. I don\u2019t know how many he had before that. I didn\u2019t ask him\u201d; that they left the lounge at about 1:00 a.m. \u25a0 \u2014 \u2022 \u201cIt could have been later\u201d; that he drove the car until he started to feel tired; that he asked Bridda \u201cif he was all right to drive. He said he was. He looked all right to me. He talked all right to me. He seemed all right to me. So I let him drive. I fell asleep after that.\u201d Defendant further testified that the next thing he knew they \u201cwere pulled over\u201d and Sergeant Cinkowski \u201cwas awakening\u201d him; that he was not present during the breathalyzer tests; that he \u201cwas in the next room\u201d at the police station and \u201cdidn\u2019t see any of the tests.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ay1-dedup-0\"> From our review of the record we are satisfied that the finding below that the driver had been operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor could reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record, exclusive of the results of the breath<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>alyzer tests administered to the driver. <em>State v. Johnson, 42 N. J. 146 </em>(1964). Moreover, the testimony of Sergeant Cinkowski and of defendant amply supported the further finding that defendant knowingly permitted his car to be operated by a person who was then under the influence of intoxicating liquor. This being so, we need not determine at this time the correctness of either the holding in <em>State v. Carlston, </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>559 (Cty. Ct. 1956), that knowledge by the owner of the driver\u2019s intoxication is not an essential element of the offense, or the contrary holding in <em>State v. Wetmore, </em>121 <em>N. J. Super. </em>90 (Cty. Ct. 1972). We leave for another day the resolution of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">Although an affirmance is thus mandated by the record, irrespective of the results of the breathalyzer tests, we deem it important to comment on the second issue raised by defendant, particularly in light of the holding in <em>State v. Wetmore, supra j </em>\u201cthat the breathalyzer readings resulting from a test administered to the driver may not be used as presumptive evidence against the owner.\u201d 121 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">We are not in agreement with the reasoning in <em>Wetmore </em>which led to that conclusion. There is no requirement that the owner should be present at the administration of the tests to the driver. Moreover, the statement in <em>Wet-more </em>that the owner was not afforded the opportunity to have the operator refuse to take the test, \u201ca right given to the driver by statute\u201d (at 95) is inaccurate in that no such right exists. <em>State v. Macuk, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>1, 15 (1970). Finally, we discern no denial of due process of law by virtue of the application to the owner of the statutory presumption arising from the driver\u2019s intoxication. We have no doubt that the statutory presumptions arising from the amount of alcohol in a driver\u2019s blood as shown by chemical analysis <em>(N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.1) are available against the person charged under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50 (a) with permitting \u201canother person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor * * * to operate a motor vehicle owned by him or in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>his custody or control.\u201d To the extent that <em>Wetmore </em>differs from what we have said, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">It is true that <em>N. J. S. A. </em>39:4-50.1 speaks of the amount of alcohol in the <em>defendant\u2019s </em>blood; but, when viewed in the light of the language that \u201cIn <em>any </em>prosecution for a violation of section 39 :4r-50 of the Revised Statutes <em>relating to driving a vehicle </em>while under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d (emphasis supplied), we are convinced that the Legislature intended the presumptions to arise from the amount of alcohol in the <em>driver\u2019s </em>blood, and not to restrict them solely to a prosecution of a driver-defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">The judgment under review is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b582-7\">Based on the result of breathalyzer tests showing that there was at the time .21% by weight of' alcohol in Bridda\u2019s blood.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
