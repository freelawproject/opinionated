The sole ground asserted in this appeal is that what he did did not \u201crise\u201d to the level of \u201ccontempt conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">The facts are not at all disputed. Substantially, as defendant recounts them in his brief, they are as follows: On March 11, 1974 defendant received a parking ticket in the Town of Westfield. Shortly thereafter he apparently contacted the clerk of the municipal court and inquired about the amount of the fine and the procedure to be followed in the event that he chose to contest the validity of the summons. On March 14, 1974 the court clerk wrote to appellant a letter characterized by his counsel as \u201cvery respectful,\u201d indicating the amount of the fine and the date of the court appearance in the event defendant wished to contest the matter. She added, \u201cif this date [the original trial date] is inconvenient for you, please contact the Court at 232-4666, and a new date will be arranged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Defendant responded by remitting $2, accompanied by the following communication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-11\">Dear Sir or Madam:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-12\">I put three dimes in for only two hours parking. Your coercive methods of getting money are rather ugly, as I have no time to haggle with you bureaucrats. Thank you and----you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-14\">R. Sax</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The judge of the municipal court certified the language of the letter, as required by <em>E. </em>1:10-1, heard defendant and his counsel, and adjudged defendant guilty of contempt. He expressly restrained himself from the imposition of a jail sentence but imposed a $100 fine for contempt of court. When he was reminded that defendant had in fact been charged with two contempts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, he replied, \u201cWell, if you want to do it that way * * * it\u2019ll be $50 for each.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:10-3 defendant sought review in the County Court which heard the matter upon the law and the facts as the statute requires. The County Court judge affirmed the adjudication of contempt but added, \u201cI don\u2019t think the fine should be $100 but it should be reduced to $50.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">We believe defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a contempt and we affirm the adjudication below.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">While defendant, an educated man who teaches in high school, sought below to excuse his abusive comment and gutter language by blaming it on frustration, neither there nor here was there an effort to defend it. Defendant below personally characterized it as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d Rather, defendant seeks to avoid the charge of contempt by pointing out that offending the sensibilities of a person (such as the clerk who was a woman, or the judge of the court, a man), does not constitute a contempt. He insists that there must be a disruption or an obstruction of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">We disagree unless it is conceded that published disrespect aimed directly at the administration of justice by the judicial branch in and of itself constitutes a disruption. With appropriate regard for our safeguards of the sanctity of free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>speech, we observe that the reason can be no better stated than it was in <em>State v. Gussman, </em>34 <em>N. J. Super. </em>408 (App. Div. 1955)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">The rule is that all speech is to be protected, <em>cf. Adams Theatre Co. v. Keenan, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>267, 277 (1953), save as some exception can justify itself. Here we have a public interest in maintaining a sufficient' respect-for the courts, at any event so that the very defendant served with a ticket may not, in place of an appearance on the return day, turn on the court and flout it to itself \u2014 and with gross accusations, insolence and, in a way, defiance. This is not a case that excites society\u2019s interest in truth and individual liberties, [at 413]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">While <em>Gussmam </em>is concededly distinguishable, if for no other reason than that there the letter was sent directly to the judge rather than to an intermediary such as a court clerk, that case clearly and correctly describes the prime importance of guarding against an unwarranted demeaning of the respect so essential to the survival of our judicial system and the totally necessary effective functioning of our courts. We have no doubt at all that to accuse the judicial branch of an \u201cugly\u201d method of getting money is disrespectful. To assert unfair coercion is to accuse the court of ignoring the due process mandate, and,this hacks at the very foundation of the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">Defendant seeks further to avoid the implications of <em>Gussman </em>and <em>State v. Jones, </em>105 <em>N. J. Super. </em>493 (Cty. Ct. 1969). by noting that (1) \u201cthe letter was directed to the court clerk, with no knowledge that the judge would read it\u201d and (2) it \u201ccontained language much milder in nature\u201d than that of <em>Gussman </em>or <em>Jones.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">With respect to the first of these propositions, <em>Gussman </em>itself stands for the rule that an act of contempt may be <em>in facie curiae </em>even\u2019 though the judge never sees it or hears it at all. Moreover, in the matter before us we seriously doubt if the assertedly repugnant haggling with \u201cyou bureaucrats\u201d had only the clerk and not the judge as its object.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">Regarding the nature of the language it is notable that defendant in his bri\u00e9f understandably confines his defense to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>language other than the vulgar obscenity utilized in that which is generally described as the \u201ccomplimentary close.\u201d No matter. The argument is as specious as would be one urging that a murder was less culpable because only one bullet was used rather than several.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">We affirm the adjudication of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The fine gives us a little more trouble. While it was clearly the intent of the municipal judge to impose only one fine of $100 for the contempt, be ended up by imposing two separate $50 fines for that which he divided into two counts of contempt. While the County Court judge reduced the fine, he followed the lead of the municipal court judge in the bifurcation. We believe this was not right. The letter constituted but one contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In view of this we exercise our original jurisdiction pursuant to <em>B. </em>2:10-5 in order that the matter be finally determined. Defendant shall pay a fine of $25 for the contempt and remain liable for costs as assessed in the County Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Except as thus modified with respect to the fines, the judgment below' is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-8\">While it is apparent that the trial judge believed the offense to have been bifurcated into two epithetical attacks, it is not clear precisely where he divided these. His statement at the hearing suggests that the first was limited to the suggestion of ugly, coercive methods of getting money, and the balance of defendant\u2019s vituperation constituted the second. However, in his order of contempt, he suggests that the phrase \u201cfuck you\u201d stands alone. In view of our determination this evident inconsistency is not important.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
