Judgment to account and auditor appointed. The defendant moved to dismiss because the action of account was abolished by No. 90, Acts of 1915, because by the provisions of that act the action should be one of contract and the defendant was entitled thereunder to a trial by jury; and because all actions which do not give the defendant a trial by jury were abolished by the act. The defendant also moved to revoke the reference to the auditor, and recall the rule, for the reason that the ease is not one in which the defendant is not entitled to a jury trial, and that the reference was not agreed to by the parties. Heard on the above motions at the September Term, 1915, Washington County, <em>Waterman, </em>J., presiding. The motions were overruled, and the defendant excepted.

But this argument loses sight of the provision of section 11, whereby nothing contained in the Act \u201cshall be taken to impair any right or remedy now provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>by law.\u201d Certainly before the passage of that Act, the action of account was a means provided by law to enforce a right. It was therefore a remedy, and it remains unimpaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The foregoing ruling leaves without force the defendant\u2019s contention that he is entitled to a trial by jury. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>65 Vt. 421, 26 Atl. 592, 20 L.
