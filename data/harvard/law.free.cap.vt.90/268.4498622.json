Plea, the general issue. Trial hy jury at the December Term, 1914, Windsor County. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. At the time of rendition of judgment plaintiff moved for a close jail certificate. Motion denied, to which the plaintiff excepted. At the time of rendering judgment on the verdict the court found and adjudged only as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">\u201cIt appeared among other things that the defendant at the time of the injury complained-of was a boy thirteen years of age, too young to fully comprehend, in the judgment of the court, the consequences of his act: that he was unlawfully and wilfully riding a bicycle on a walk, well defined, used as a sidewalk, and when so riding, with less judgment than would be expected by a person of mature age, he accidentally struck the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, who with a companion was properly going along the sidewalk and caused the injuries complained of. The riding on the sidewalk, and the act or neglect which caused the injury was wilful but the injury was accidental and without malice. The damages recoverable in this action, if any,- are for the necessary care, nursing and medical attendance, etc., furnished by the plaintiff under his declaration. If the action of the court on the facts is a matter of discretion, as we hold it to be, the motion is overruled and the close jail certificate is denied.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number><em>Davis &amp; Davis </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-5\"><em>William, Batchelder </em>and <em>Raymond Trwinor </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b295-6\">Watson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJt\">The plaintiff moved for a close jail certificate.
