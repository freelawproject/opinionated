The order should have stated that he gave notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeals. The order fails to show this statement, and therefore the Assistant Attorney-General\u2019s motion must prevail. Appellant\u2019s counsel, however, files a motion here to correct the judgment nunc pro tunc, claiming it was a clerical error on the part of the clerk and affidavits as well to support this contention, but this is a matter we can not review. We only have jurisdiction of cases as they are appealed here as authorized by the statutes of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-16\">The motion of the Assistant Attorney-General is sustained, and the appeal is ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-17\">\n<em>Dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
