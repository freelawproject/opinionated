We think the case must be reversed on account of the failure of the court to define the terms \u201cwilful\u201d and \u201cdeliberate.\u201d The charge of the court is in general a fairly accurate submission of the law applied to the facts of the case. The court instructed the jury, among other things, as follows: \u201cThe false statement assigned for perjury must be material to the issue with respect to which it was made, and must have been deliberately and wilfully made. A false statement made through inadvertence, or under agitation or by mistake is not perjury.\u201d There was no other instruction of any kind as to the meaning of the words \u201cwilfully\u201d or \u201cdeliberately,\u201d nor did the court give any definition of the word \u201cwilful\u201d unless it may be comprehended and implied in the language used above. It was held in the case of Steber v. State, 23 Texas Crim. App., 176, that the court should in a case of perjury or false swearing, define the term \u201cwilfully.\u201d Article 201 of the Penal Code is as follows: \u201cPerjury is a false statement, either written or verbal, deliberately and wilfully made, relating to something past or present, under the sanction of an oath, or such affirmation as is by law equivalent to an oath, where such oath or affirmation is legally administered, under circumstances in which an oath or affirmation is required by law, or is necessary for the prosecution or defense of any private right, or for the ends of public justice.\u201d In the Steber case, supra, the court had, in his charge, defined the word \u201cdeliberately.\u201d Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>White, speaking for the court says: \u201cThe jury were, as to the word \u2018deliberately/ properly charged that a false statement made through inadvertence or under agitation or- by mistake would not support a conviction.\u201d That is the language and this is the charge which the court gave in this case. \u201cBut,\u201d he says, \u201cthey were not charged as to the meaning of the word \u2018wilfully which was equally as essential to be understood as the word \u2018deliberately\u2019 since the statute makes them both conjointly essential to the crime. \u2018Wilful\u2019 in legal parlance signifies with evil intent or legal malice, or without legal ground to believe the act to be lawful; and a trial court, in charging a jury upon a case involving this question should, as an essential part of the law of the case, instruct the jury as to the legal meaning of the word \u2018wilful.\u2019 (Trice v. The State, 17 Texas Crim. App., 43; Owens v. The State, 19 Texas Crim. App., 242; Loyd v. The State, 19 Texas Crim. App., 321; Baker v. The State, 21 Texas Crim. App., 264.)\u201d While the Steber case, supra, was distinguished in the case of Woodson v. State, 24 Texas Crim. App., 153, it appears from the report in that case that no objection was taken to the charge of the court in respect to this matter, but that it was urged for the first time on appeal; and that the defect was practically cured by special instruction given at the request of defendant, the court holding the charge of the court was substantially sufficient. It seems to us that by analogy, as well as based on authority, it was important, if not indispensable, to the protection of appellant that the court should have given the definition of this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">There are some other matters assigned in the motion, which, however, are not likely to occur on another trial, and need not, we think, be discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">For the error pointed out the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
