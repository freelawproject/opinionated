This charge has been held by this court as erroneous in the following eases: Oates v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 449; Hinson v. State, 51 Texas Crim. Rep., 102; Barrett v. State, 115 S. W. Rep., 1187; Newman v. State, 116 S. W. Rep., 577; Tate v. State, 55 Texas Crim. Rep., 397; 116 S. W. Rep., 604. See also case of Jack Early v. State, decided at the present term of this court. For a discussion of the question see said cases. Under the decisions of this court the jury must believe the testimony of an accomplice to be true, and that his testimony is corroborated in such a way as to connect the defendant with the commission of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-17\">Various other insistencies are made in appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial, among others that the court did not properly limit the testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>mony of the impeaching witnesses. We do not deem it necessary, however, to discuss the matters, but will -say that any testimony that has a tendency to be unlawfully appropriated for any other purpose than that for which it was admitted should be limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">For the error discussed the judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
