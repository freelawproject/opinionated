Article 883, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provides that an appeal is taken by giving notice thereof in open court and having the same entered of record. See also the decisions cited under said article in White\u2019s Code of Criminal Procedure. Nor can these orders be entered nunc pro tunc. See Quarles v. State, 37 Texas Crim. Rep., 362. This being the condition of the record, the motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-13\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
