Prosecuting witness nailed the gate up and appellant merely fixed the wire so he could go in and out of said place. We think this evidence shows a total lack of criminal intent on the part of appellant to injure the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-18\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-19\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
