The verdict of the jury reads as follows: <em>\u201cWe, </em>the jury, find the defendant guilty, and assess his punishment in penitentiary for two years, and find he is sixteen years of age. E. M. Freeman, Foreman.\u201d Appellant insists the verdict is defective in that the jury should have found appellant to be under sixteen years of age or over sixteen years of age. We think this criticism is hypercritical. If appellant is sixteen years of age he is bound to be some' over it.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-18\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-19\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
