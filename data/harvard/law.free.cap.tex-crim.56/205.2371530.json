Duke, without first having registered in the office of the district clerk of the county of his residence, his authority for so practicing medicine, as required by law. . .</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The Assistant Attorney-General suggests that the indictment is defective on the ground that the indictment should have alleged that appellant practiced for hire. Second, same should have stated the county of residence of appellant and his failure to file certificate in said county. See Act Thirtieth Legislature, page 227, section 13. We think the indictment is insufficient as suggested by the Assistant Attorney-General. The judgment is accordingly reversed and the prosecution ordered dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
