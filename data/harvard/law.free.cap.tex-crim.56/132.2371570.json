The right of self-defense exists as long as there is danger or apparent danger, and the right of self-defense ceases when such danger or apparent danger ceases, viewed by you from the defendant\u2019s standpoint as it appeared to him at the time.\u201d This charge is a full and explicit charge upon appellant\u2019s theory of defense, as suggested in motion for a new trial, and certainly is as favorable to appellant as the law of this State would authorize.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Appellant\u2019s second ground of the motion complains, in substance, of the same matter as the first ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Appellant\u2019s third ground of the motion complains that the court erred in failing to give the following charge: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that the deceased was in a row with Alonzo Baggerly, brother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>of the defendant, and was committing an assault upon him, then you are instructed that the defendant had the lawful right to interfere for the protection of his brother.\u201d This charge was covered by the main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The fourth ground of appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial complains that the court erred in failing to give the following special charge: \u201cIf the jury had a reasonable doubt as to whether or .rot the deceased died from the effects of wounds inflicted o him by the defendant, or from some other sickness or cause, not produced by said wounds, you are instructed that you can not find 3 defendant guilty of any degree of homicide, and you will find him not guilty.\u201d This question was thoroughly covered by the court\u2019s main charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Appellant further complains that the court erred in failing to tell the jury what constituted a deadly weapon. This criticism is not correct. The charge defines a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The evidence in this case supports the verdict, and, finding no error in the record, the .judgment is in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
