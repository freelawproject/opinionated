Appellant denied the charge and claimed not to know where Stephen Pugh lived or to have any complicity in the transactions out of which the charge arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">1. The main error assigned relates to the action of the court in overruling the application of the appellant to withdraw his announcement of ready and continue or postpone the hearing on account of his surprise at the testimony of the witness Stephen Pugh. The statement of facts shows that this witness had testified on direct examination at considerable length, and was cross-examined fully by counsel for appellant. The witness Hall, who kept a grocery store, referred to hereafter, had also testified at length, and one witness for defendant had testified quite fully on direct and cross-examination before this application to postpone the trial was filed. On the trial the old man testified that he had been at work at Bering\u2019s mill in Houston Heights, where he saw appellant; that he next saw him at Hall\u2019s grocery store; that he was at this last named place at about 7 o\u2019clock in the evening; that it took him about a half an hour or an hour to go home and that after reaching home he had supper and then went to bed and had been in bed fifteen minutes or a half hour when appellant reached his house. This would place the time of the robbery, if we assume that he left Hall\u2019s store at 7 o\u2019clock and took an hour, as he says, to go home, and thirty minutes within which to get supper, and had been in bed fifteen minutes, at about 8:45 or 9 o\u2019clock. Appellant\u2019s surprise grew out of the fact that the testimony of this witness given on the examining trial contains a statement that he was at Hall\u2019s store about, 11 o\u2019clock. His full statement, as contained in the statement of facts, is as follows: \u201cOn October 31, 1908, I occupied a house in Harris County, Texas. It was my residence. John Dupree came <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>into my house last Saturday night. He lifted the latch and came up to the house. He came creeping in. I grabbed at him when he snatched my pants; I was home in my house. I first saw him at Bering\u2019s Mill at Houston Heights. I saw him next at Mr. Hall\u2019s store; this was about 11 o\u2019clock at night. He followed me from Hall\u2019s store to my house, and I had only been in about fifteen minutes when he came into my house. He had no right in my house and I gave him no authority to come in there.\u201d Pugh in his testimony denies having said on his examining trial that he was at Hall\u2019s store at 11 o\u2019clock, and said that if the record so showed that it was untrue and incorrect. Mr. Hall\u2019s testimony places both Pugh and appellant at his store on this night at about 7 o\u2019clock or 7:30 o\u2019clock. By the slightest diligence it was easily possible for appellant to have ascertained definitely Hall\u2019s information about the matter; nor is there any showing that any effort was made to ascertain the true facts from Hall or Pugh. This testimony taken altogether advises appellant of these facts: That Pugh would testify that he saw appellant at the mill where he, Pugh, worked; that he saw him at Hall\u2019s store and that he was followed to his residence by him. Appellant admits seeing Pugh at the mill early in the evening and admits seeing him at Hall\u2019s store. Hall\u2019s testimony in this connection discloses the fact that Pugh had money and exhibited it and that appellant was lingering about the store apparently without any object or business and was paying careful attention to Pugh. We think, ourselves, that the facts all show that the figures \u201c11,\u201d as contained in testimony of this witness taken at the examining trial, was an evident error, and that under all the circumstances appellant could not have been misled by the appearance of \u201c11,\u201d instead of the time evidently meant, \u201c7\u201d o\u2019clock. In this connection it may be further stated that appellant did not in terms aver in his motion for postponement where he was, at 8 or 9 o\u2019clock, or that he could produce witnesses showing his whereabouts at that time. Attached to his motion for new trial is the affidavit of one Roberson, who says that he saw appellant at his house about 7:30 or 8 o\u2019clock, and later about a half or three quarters of an hour after this he passed appellant\u2019s house and saw him sitting at the supper table. This time is somewhat indefinitely stated, and in view of the testimony of other witnesses who testified that they saw appellant between 9 and 10 o\u2019clock, quite a distance from his home, and inquiring for an old man, whom he said was his uncle, whose name he was unable to give and whom he could only describe as a man having a mindless daughter, it is clear to us that the affidavit of Roberson, if necessarily in conflict with the other testimony, is obviously untrue. The application to postpone the case was a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial .court, and unless we are prepared to say it had been clearly abused, we do not feel that we should interfere. Matters of this sort can better <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>be determined by a capable and careful judge on the ground than by this court at this great distance from the scene of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-3\"><em>2. </em>There is no merit in the other contentions of appellant. This was a night-time burglary and there was no occasion or necessity for the court to define the terms \u201cforce\u201d or \u201centry.\u201d We have recently held that this is not always essential even in day time burglary. See Geo. Brown v. State, decided at present term.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">3. There is some question made as to the sufficiency of the evidence touching the identification of the accused by the witness Pugh. This objection goes to the weight of the testimony. The identification, it may be conceded, is not as definite or the circumstances so conclusive as ordinarily might be desired, but it is, however, positive, and in the light of the verdict of the jury we do not feel that we should interfere.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">It is therefore ordered that the judgment of the court below be and the same is hereby in all things affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
