McCord, </em>Assistant Attorney-General, for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b306-11\">BROOKS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A0f\">This was a conviction for violating the local option law, the punishment assessed being a fine of $25 and twenty days imprisonment in the county jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">Appellant presented application for continuance. The same is defective in that it does not show whether the witness had permanently left the State or not, and does not show to the court any probability that the witness will ever be back in Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-13\">During the progress of the trial appellant made a motion to postpone same in order that he might procure the testimony of several witnesses by whom he could establish an alibi for defendant; that he had not been advised as to the time when the offense was alleged to have been committed. The date alleged in the information of the commission of the offense was April 1, 1907. The record does not show any steps to procure the testimony, and this is not a matter of surprise, as has been frequently held by this court. It follows that the court did not err in refusing the postponement.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-14\">The record contains a motion to quash the panel of the jury because appellant says they are made up of Prohibitionists, and that they had practically formed an opinion against defendant, for six of the jurors had heard the testimony in another case where the defendant said he did not sell whisky, and, though he testified to that, they convicted him, and thereby had practically prejudged this case. The sale alleged in this case was shown to have been made to one Humphrey, while the sale in the other case in which he had been tried was made to one Bowman, and in no sense companion cases. This shows that .the facts were different, and different witnesses, and would not disqualify the jury. Article 694 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that \u201cthe defendant may challenge the array for the following causes only: That the officers summoning the jury had acted corruptly, and had wilfully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>summoned persons upon the jury known to be prejudiced against the defendant, with a view to cause him to be convicted.\u201d And article 662 says: \u201cThe preceding article does not apply when the jurors summoned are those who have been selected by jury commissioners. In such a case no challenge to the array is allowed.\u201d The bill of exceptions here fails to show whether the jury was selected by the jury commissioners or not, and in the absence of such statement in the record it will be presumed the jury was organized accordingly to law, and drawn by the jury commissioners, and the only question that can be presented here would be that the jury had formed an opinion in the case, and this can not be held so where it is a different offense, and where the State relies upon different witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The other questions have been passed upon by this court in various local option cases, and, finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b307-6\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">May 19, 1909.</p>\n<author id=\"b307-9\">BROOKS, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AqH\">This case was affirmed at a former sitting of this court, and now comes before us on motion for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">In the original opinion we failed to pass upon bill of exceptions Ho. 2, which presents the following matter: While the witness A. L. Humphrey was testifying for the State, and after he had testified to purchasing the bottle of whisky from the defendant, and on cross-examination by defendant\u2019s counsel had admitted that, while working for the Fort Worth &amp; Denver Ry. Co., at Childress, he had cashed his time check for $138, and that the original time check had been issued for $38, and said witness had sought to make his explanation thereof, the State\u2019s counsel presented said witness with what was called a clearance card, and the witness identified same&gt; and testified that he had seen the proper officer sign the same at the time it was delivered to him, whereupon the State\u2019s counsel proposed to read said clearance card as evidence to the jury, and before same was read as evidence defendant\u2019s counsel objected, for the reason that the card was hearsay, and the same did not purport to be under oath of the party who executed same, which objections were by the court overruled, and the clearance card, which is as follows, was by the State read in evidence to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-11\">\u201cFORM 2012.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-12\">\u201cFort Worth &amp; Denver City Railway Co.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b307-13\">\u201cCertificate No. 492.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbX\">\u201cImpression copy to be taken in book kept for that purpose'.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATQ\">\u201cChildress, Texas, January 29, 1903.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaX\">\u201cThis is to certify, that A. L. Humphrey has been employed in the capacity of wiper at Childress, in the M. P. &amp; C, department of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Fort Worth &amp; Denver City Railway Co., from August 18, 1901, to January 28, 1903.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-3\">\u201cServices satisfactory.

W. &amp; D. C. Ry., Jan. 29, 1903:\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">This testimony should not have been admitted. It was clearly hearsay testimony, introducing the opinion of an outside party as to the character of the prosecuting witness, and this was the main point in the case: as to whether the prosecuting witness was credible one. Being the main witness in the case, it clearly authorizes a reversal of this judgment. Accordingly the motion for rehearing is granted, and the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
