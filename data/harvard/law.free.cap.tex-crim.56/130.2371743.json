The State\u2019s witness proves clearly and unequivocally a sale by appellant; she as emphatically denies it. While Oliver was testifying in behalf of the State he was asked by the county attorney if he did not know that the defendant had had many fusses and fights, and at one time whipped her daughters and ran them away from home. Objection was urged to this-for the reason that same tended to prove no issue involved in the trial, and could prove no issue, and was only offered for the purpose of prejudicing the minds of the jury against appellant. These objections were overruled, and the witness was permitted to answer that appellant had had many fusses and fights, and at one time had whipped her daughters and ran them away from home. The court approves the bill as follows: \u201cThat defendant herself had testified that she had had trouble with a number of persons, as shown by the statement of facts, which testimony was admitted without any objection from either party.\u201d Recurring to the statement of facts, we find appellant\u2019s testimony in that respect as follows: \u201cI have had trouble with these parties. Yes, my husband and I have been separated.\u201d The parties to whom she referred were named Jamerson, Lasseter, Callaway and \u201cothers.\u201d We are of opinion that the testimony quoted in the bill, especially that in respect to the whipping of the daughters and running them away from home, was inadmissible. It had no relation to the case on trial. It certainly could not be used as impeaching testimony, and was not one of these extraneous matters which could be offered for that purpose under the circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>case. The jury gave appellant the highest possible punishment, insofar as the fine was concerned, it being $100. We therefore think the error sufficiently important Jo require a reversal of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The judgment is therefore reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
