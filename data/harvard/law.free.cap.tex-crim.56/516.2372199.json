Pratt, while the proof shows that said stolen property, if stolen at all, was owned by the Lincoln Paint and Color Company. The evidence shows that said Pratt had the control, care and management of the property of the company. The evidence supports the verdict, and the proof and allegation entirely correspond. These are the only questions raised in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
