The bill is quite long and entirely unintelligible, and no ground of objection stated in the bill such as this court can review. We can not see for what purpose the testimony was introduced. The bill in no respect complies with the rules of. this court which require a pertinent presentation of the point complained of and a direct statement of the reason why it is offered. Hone of these requirements are complied with. Furthermore, if inadmissible, in view of the fact that appellant received the minimum punishment, we do not see how it could have prejudiced appellant since the record proves a clear case of burglary against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
