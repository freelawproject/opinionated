That the absent attorney telegraphed from Fort Worth to another firm of attorneys at Georgetown that he was very sick, requesting them to take charge of his cases in court, stating that he would be home on the night of Tune 1, and that said attorneys believing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>absent attorney would be at home on the night of June 1 had not had sufficient opportunity to make preparations to try the cause, and that they were expecting said attorney home in time to try the case and, therefore, appellant did not attempt to employ other counsel. The attorney not having arrived, the case was represented by Wilcox &amp; Graves, the firm of lawyers to whom the telegram had been sent. There was a contest over the matter, among other things, it was stated that the absent attorney had sent no message since the one referred to and that there was no prospect of his return during the then pending term of court. The court overruled the application and placed appellant on trial. Exception was -reserved. The bill is qualified in this wise by the court: This cause was called for trial on June. 1, 1908, and was postponed for call till June <em>2. </em>Upon motion made by Wilcox &amp; Graves, for reasons stated in the motion, at which time defendant was informed that this cause would be called for trial when reached regularly on docket, said cause was not again called for trial till June 3, when defendant appeared represented by attorneys Wilcox &amp; Graves and J. F. Taulbee.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The case was tried on June 3, resulting in a conviction. We are of opinion that as the matter is presented there is no such error shown as requires a reversal of the judgment. It is not shown how appellant was hurt or could have been injured otherwise than by the mere statement of the absence of the attorney. During the two days after sending the telegram preparation could have been made to secure evidence or get in readiness for the trial, and the record fails to show and the application does not disclose in what manner he was injured or may have been injured by reason of the absence of the mentioned attorney. It is not shown that there was any testimony or witnesses that was not secured upon the trial which could have been secured by the presence of the absent attorney. Nor is it in any way claimed that appellant was injured, and, so far as the record is concerned, he seems to have been well defended.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">The motion to quash the information is- not well taken. In regard to the bad spelling alleged, it is held that such spelling does not vitiate an information.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Finding no error in the record, the judgment is ordered to be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b275-10\">ON REHEARING.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">May 19, 1909.</p>\n<author id=\"b275-12\">DAVIDSON, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"A1Oh\">At a former day of this term the judgment in this case was affirmed on the merits of the case. The motion for rehearing is based upon the alleged insufficiency of the complaint to charge the offense of violating the local option law. This complaint or affidavit is in the same condition as that in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>ease of Jim Alexander v. State, this day decided. For the reasons there given the motion for rehearing in this case will be overruled and it is accordingly so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\n<em>Overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
