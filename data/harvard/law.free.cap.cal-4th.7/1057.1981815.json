The campaign, it is claimed, improperly targets minors, and seeks to make cigarette smokers of them. The issue before us is whether the action is preempted by federal law. Its resolution requires us to interpret and apply the recent decision of <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc. </em>(1992) 505 U.S. _ [120 L.Ed.2d 407, 112 S.Ct. 2608], which itself interpreted the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-6\">We conclude that the action, as defined and limited by the Court of Appeal, is not preempted, and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">I. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">Plaintiff Mangini sued R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and others (hereafter collectively Reynolds) for injunctive relief, asserting two causes of action, one for \u201cUnlawful, Unfair Business Practices,\u201d and one for \u201cUnjust Enrichment and Imposition of Constructive Trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">The complaint alleges, among other things, the following: About 75 percent of all adult smokers become addicted to tobacco before their 18th birthdays. Tobacco advertising causes children to become addicted. Since 1988, Reynolds has used a cartoon character called Old Joe Camel in its advertising campaign in order to attract teenage smokers. It has disseminated products such as matchbooks, store exit signs, scrip, mugs, and soft drink can holders advertising Camel cigarettes. The advertising has been effective in targeting adolescents. As a result of the campaign, the number of teenage smokers who choose Camel cigarettes has risen from 0.5 percent in 1988 to between 25 and 33 percent in 1992. Teenage smokers accounted for about $476 million of Camel sales in 1992 as compared with $6 million in 1988. \u201c \u2018Old Joe, that hip cartoon camel used to advertise Camel cigarettes,\u2019 \u201d the complaint alleges, \u201c \u2018is now as familiar to young children as Mickey Mouse, and apparently is enticing thousands of teens to smoke that brand,\u2019 \u201d and has caused Camel\u2019s popularity with teenagers to \u201c *lsurge[] 66-fold.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-10\">The first cause of action alleges that defendants \u201ccaused the advertisements of Camel cigarettes without any warning that cigarettes pose a health <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1061\">*1061</page-number>hazard\u201d in violation of the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, and that this constitutes an unlawful and unfair business practice under Business and Professions Code section 17200 et seq. The second cause of action alleges that defendants are being unjustly enriched by the advertising campaign.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-5\">Six months after the complaint was filed, the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S._[120 L.Ed.2d 407, 112 S.Ct. 2608]. Two weeks thereafter, Reynolds moved for summary judgment, contending that the action was preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, 15 United States Code section 1331 et seq., as interpreted in that decision. The trial court agreed, and granted the motion. Plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">The Court of Appeal reversed. It found that the two causes of action pleaded in the complaint were indeed preempted by federal law, which plaintiff does not now challenge, but it concluded that plaintiff should have been granted leave to amend the complaint. On appeal, plaintiff argued two additional theories of unfair business practice based upon facts already alleged in the complaint. The Court of Appeal found that one of the theories was preempted, a finding also not now challenged. The other theory, the one at issue here, \u201cis that the Old Joe Camel advertising campaign targets minors for the purpose of inducing and increasing their illegal purchases of cigarettes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-9\">Preliminarily, the court found the targeting minors theory to be cognizable under Business and Professions Code section 17200. \u201cCalifornia\u2019s statutory law of unfair competition (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200 et seq.) authorizes actions for injunctive relief (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17203) by certain state and local officers and persons acting for the interests of themselves or the general public (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17204). Unfair competition includes \u2018any unlawful, unfair or fraudulent business act or practice and unfair, deceptive, untrue or misleading advertising. . . .\u2019 (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17200.)\u201d The court found that cigarette advertising targeting minors was \u201cunfair\u201d within the meaning of this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-10\">It stated, \u201cthe targeting of minors in cigarette advertising offends public policy as established by statute. In California, it is unlawful to sell or ftirnish cigarettes to persons under the age of 18 years, and it is unlawful for minors to purchase or receive cigarettes. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 308, subds. (a), (b).) This reflects a statutory policy of protecting minors from addiction to cigarettes. In an analogous context\u2014a statutory proscription against nonsale public distribution of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes (Health &amp; Saf. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1062\">*1062</page-number>\u00a7 25967)\u2014the Legislature has declared its intent that \u2018keeping children from beginning to use tobacco products in any form . . . shall be among the highest priorities in disease prevention for the State of California.\u2019 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25967, subd. (a)(11).) Cigarette advertising directed to minors contravenes the statutory policy of keeping children from starting on the road to tobacco addiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-4\">In addition, the court noted that \u201cthe targeting of minors is oppressive and unscrupulous, in that it exploits minors by luring them into an unhealthy and potentially life-threatening addiction before they have achieved the maturity necessary to make an informed decision whether to take up smoking despite its health risks.\u201d It also found that \u201ca persuasive argument can be made that the targeting of minors causes substantial physical injury to them. In the statutory proscription against nonsale public distribution of smokeless tobacco and cigarettes, the Legislature has found and declared the following: \u2018Tobacco product advertising and promotion are an important cause of tobacco use among children.\u2019 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25967, subd. (a)(9).) \u2018The earlier a child begins to use tobacco products, the more likely it is that the child will be unable to quit.\u2019 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25967, subd. (a)(5).) \u2018Smoking is the single most important source of preventable disease and premature death in California.\u2019 (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 25967, subd. (a)(1).) Mangini\u2019s complaint alleges that teenage smokers accounted for $476 million of Camel cigarette sales in 1992 as compared with $6 million in 1988 at the onset of the Old Joe Camel advertisements, implicitly suggesting such advertisements have harmed a great many teenagers by luring them into extended use of and addiction to tobacco products.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-5\">The court went on to find that this cause of action was not preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act. Finally, it held that although this theory was imperfectly pleaded in the complaint, the motion for summary judgment was equivalent to a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and the theory was supported by the factual allegations; therefore, the trial court should have granted leave to amend the complaint to allege this cause of action. The court thus reversed the judgment and remanded the cause \u201cwith directions to the superior court to give Mangini an opportunity to amend her complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1100-6\">Reynolds petitioned for review, contending that the cause of action is preempted by federal law, and that the Court of Appeal erred procedurally in finding that plaintiff should have been granted leave to amend the complaint. Neither in the Court of Appeal nor in the petition for review did Reynolds challenge the holding that the targeting minors theory states a valid cause of action under state law. We granted review limited to the merits of the preemption issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1063\">*1063</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-6\">A. <em>Judicial Notice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1101-7\">The parties have filed eight separate requests for judicial notice, five by Reynolds, three by plaintiff. We grant some of the requests and deny the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-8\">Although a court may judicially notice a variety of matters (Evid. Code, \u00a7 450 et seq.), only <em>relevant </em>material may be noticed. \u201cBut judicial notice, since it is a substitute for proof [citation], is always confined to those matters which are relevant to the issue at hand.\u201d <em>(Gbur </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 296, 301 [155 Cal.Rptr. 507].) \u201cWhile Evidence Code, section 451, provides in mandatory terms that certain matters designated therein must be judicially noticed, the provisions contained therein are subject to the qualification that the matter to be judicially noticed must be relevant (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 350, 450)\u201d, as well as \u201cqualified by Evidence Code, section 352 . . . .\u201d <em>(Mozetti </em>v. <em>City of Brisbane </em>(1977) 67 Cal.App.3d 565, 578 [136 Cal.Rptr. 751]; see also <em>Del Mar Terrace Conservancy, Inc. </em>v. <em>City Council </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 712, 744 [12 Cal.Rptr.2d 785]; <em>ITT Telecom Products Corp. </em>v. <em>Dooley </em>(1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 307, 313, fn. 4 [262 Cal.Rptr. 773]; 2 Jefferson, Cal. Evidence Benchbook (2d ed. 1982) \u00a7 47.1, p. 1749 [\u201cMatters otherwise subject to judicial notice must be relevant to an issue in the action.\u201d].) We therefore \u201cdecline\u201d to judicially notice material that \u201chas no bearing on the limited legal question at hand.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stoll </em>(1989) 49 Cal.3d 1136, 1144, fn. 5 [265 Cal.Rptr. 111, 783 P.2d 698].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1101-9\">Plaintiff asks us to judicially notice a 1994 report of the United States Surgeon General, entitled \u201cPreventing Tobacco Use Among Young People,\u201d and a 1994 report to the California Department of Health Services entitled \u201cTobacco Use in California.\u201d Both are irrelevant to the preemption question here, which interprets a 1969 federal statute. Moreover, to the extent plaintiff asks us to notice the truth of matters asserted in those documents, and not merely their existence, Reynolds has stated a valid objection.  While courts may notice official acts and public records, \u201cwe do not take judicial notice of the truth of all matters stated therein.\u201d <em>(Love </em>v. <em>Wolf </em>(1964) 226 Cal.App.2d 378, 403 [38 Cal.Rptr. 183]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1970) 7 Cal.App.3d 586, 591 [86 Cal.Rptr. 590].) \u201c[T]he taking of judicial notice of the official acts of a governmental entity does not in and of itself require acceptance of the truth of factual matters which might be deduced therefrom, since in many instances what is being noticed, and thereby established, is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1064\">*1064</page-number>more than the existence of such acts and not, without supporting evidence, what might factually be associated with or flow therefrom.\u201d <em>(Cruz </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1131, 1134 [219 Cal.Rptr. 661].) We therefore deny plaintiff\u2019s first two requests for judicial notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-4\">Concurrently with two of its briefs, Reynolds asked us to notice materials relating to legislative history of the statute at issue. Although a simple citation to some of the readily available published material, such as excerpts from the United States Code Congressional and Administrative News, would have sufficed, we grant those requests, consisting of the first three items of Reynolds\u2019s original request, and the second item of its first supplemental request. <em>(Post </em>v. <em>Prati </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 626, 634 [153 Cal.Rptr. 511]; Evid. Code, \u00a7 452, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-5\">Reynolds also requests notice of a 1992 letter from a number of state attorneys general to a United States senator urging repeal of 15 United States Code section 1334(b), and a newspaper account of that letter. A letter by persons seeking repeal of a statute, written long after its enactment, is irrelevant to the interpretation of that statute. Moreover, the existence of the newspaper article is irrelevant, and the truth of its contents is not judicially noticeable. We therefore deny those judicial notice requests, consisting of the fourth item of Reynolds\u2019s original request, and the first item of its first supplemental request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-6\">Reynolds further asks us to notice an excerpt from the same report of the United States Surgeon General that plaintiff asks us to notice, legislative history materials regarding a 1990 bill introduced in the California Legislature, and a complaint recently filed in a different action in Washington State. Those items, too, are irrelevant to the limited issue here. The requests, consisting of the fifth through eleventh items of Reynolds\u2019s original request, and the first item of Reynolds\u2019s second supplemental request, are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1102-7\">After briefing was concluded, a few weeks before oral argument, Reynolds asked us to notice a federal court decision that was not cited in the briefs. That decision aids Reynolds very little, although it is arguably relevant.  Relevant federal decisional law is generally subject to judicial notice. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 451, subd. (a).) However, Reynolds could have, and should have, cited the decision in the briefs, as it cited other federal decisions. Requests for judicial notice should not be used to \u201ccircumvent[]\u201d appellate rules and procedures, including the normal briefing process. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Webster </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 411, 428, fn. 4 [285 Cal.Rptr. 31, 814 P.2d 1273] [judicial notice may not be used to circumvent the prohibition against citing unpublished opinions].) Asking that authority be judicially noticed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>instead of citing and discussing it in a brief gives the parties no orderly opportunity to argue the relevance of that authority or to distinguish it. The request, consisting of the second item of Reynolds\u2019s second supplemental request, is denied on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-5\">Two days before oral argument, Reynolds asked us to notice a newspaper article regarding a reported action by the Federal Trade Commission. The existence of the article is irrelevant, and the truth of its contents is not judicially noticeable. Reynolds\u2019s third supplemental request is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-6\">On the day of oral argument, both sides asked us to notice documents related to an action of the Federal Trade Commission. The commission \u201cclosed\u201d an investigation into the \u201cJoe Camel\u201d advertising campaign, but stated that its action \u201cis not to be construed as a determination that a violation may not have occurred . . . .\u201d This action is irrelevant to the interpretation of the preemption statute; these final requests are therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-7\">B. <em>Preemption</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1103-8\">The only cause of action for unfair business practices that survived Court of Appeal scrutiny, and thus the only one before us, is that \u201cthe Old Joe Camel advertising campaign targets minors for the purpose of inducing and increasing their illegal purchases of cigarettes.\u201d It is unlawful in California to sell or furnish cigarettes to minors, and for minors to buy them. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 308, subds. (a) &amp; (b).)  The narrow issue before us is thus whether, notwithstanding this prohibition against <em>sale, </em>attempts in California to regulate or prohibit <em>advertisement </em>of cigarettes to minors are preempted by federal law. We find they are not, although for somewhat different reasons than those stated by the Court of Appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-9\">Reynolds relies on the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act, enacted in 1965 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 et seq.), which contains an express preemption provision. As amended by the Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act of 1969 (hereafter sometimes the 1969 Act), 15 United States Code section 1334(b) (hereafter section 1334(b)) now provides: \u201cNo requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health shall be imposed under State law with respect to the advertising or promotion of any cigarettes the packages of which are labeled in conformity with the provisions of this Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-10\">The United States Supreme Court interpreted the scope of section 1334(b) in <em>Cipollone </em>v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc., supra, </em>505 U.S._[120 L.Ed.2d 407, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>112 S.Ct. 2608] (Cipollone). There, plaintiff sued three cigarette manufacturers for common law damages resulting from the death of Rose Cipollone from lung cancer. Several theories of liability were alleged, including failure to warn of the health consequences of smoking, breach of express warranty, fraudulent misrepresentation, and conspiracy to misrepresent or conceal material facts. The defendants contended the action was preempted. The high court analyzed the issue under both the preemption clause of the 1965 legislation and the current version of section 1334(b), only the latter of which is relevant to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-4\">The high court first stated the applicable general principles.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The \u201c \u2018 \u201cpurpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone\u201d \u2019 of pre-emption analysis.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 422, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2617].) Because Congress enacted an express preemption provision, it implied that matters beyond the reach of that provision are not preempted. Hence, a cause is preempted by the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act only if it is covered by the express language of section 1334(b). <em>(Id. </em>at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 423-424, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2618].) Moreover, \u201cthe presumption against the pre-emption of state police power regulations\u201d makes appropriate a \u201cnarrow reading\u201d of section 1334(b). <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">After the court stated the general principles and applied them to the 1965 act, the plurality turned to the current statute, the one at issue here. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp._-_[120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 424-432, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2619-2625].) The plurality first rejected the plaintiff\u2019s argument that section 1334(b) applied only to \u201cpositive enactments\u201d such as state statutes, injunctions or executive pronouncements, and not to common law damages actions. <em>(Id. </em>at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 426, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2620].) It found \u201cno distinction between positive enactments and common law . . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1104-12\">But, the plurality said, this \u201cdoes not mean that [section 1334(b)] preempts all common law claims.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 427, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2621].) The court instead \u201cmust fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>but\u2014in light of the strong presumption against pre-emption\u2014narrowly construe the precise language of [section 1334(b)] and we must look to each of petitioner\u2019s common law claims to determine whether it is in fact preempted. [Fn. omitted.] The central inquiry in each case is straightforward: we ask whether the legal duty that is the predicate of the common law damages action constitutes a \u2018requirement or prohibition based on smoking and health . . . imposed under State law with respect to . . . advertising or promotion,\u2019 giving that clause a fair but narrow reading.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">Applying this test to the specific claims, the plurality reached several conclusions. The claim for \u201cfailure to warn\u201d was preempted to the extent it relied on a state law requirement with respect to advertising or promotion. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 427-429, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2621-2622].) The claim for \u201cbreach of express warranty\u201d was not preempted because the predicate duty is not imposed under state law but rather by the warrantor. <em>(Id. </em>at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 428, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2622-2623].) The claim for \u201cfraudulent misrepresentation\u201d based on a theory that the advertising neutralized the effect of the federally mandated warning labels was preempted because it was \u201cpredicated on a state-law prohibition against statements in advertising and promotional materials that tend to minimize the health hazards associated with smoking,\u201d which is \u201cmerely the converse of a state law <em>requirement </em>that warnings be included in advertising and promotional materials,\u201d and is therefore \u201cinextricably related\u201d to the preempted failure to warn theory. <em>(Id. </em>at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 429-430, 112 S.Ct. at p 2623], italics in original.) Finally, as will be discussed in greater detail below, the \u201cfraudulent misrepresentation\u201d and related conspiracy claim based on a theory of false representation and concealment of material facts were not preempted. <em>(Id. </em>at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 430, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2623-2624].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">Justice Blackmun was of the view that no common law damages claims are preempted. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp._-_[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 432, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2625-2632] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Blackmun, J.).) Justice Scalia was of the view that the entire action was preempted. <em>(Id. </em>at pp._-_[120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 432-438, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2632-2638] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Scalia, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-17\">Reynolds argues that because its cigarettes are labeled in conformity with federal law, California may not impose any regulation with respect to advertising the cigarettes if the regulation is \u201cbased on smoking and health.\u201d The prohibition against selling cigarettes to minors is based on underlying health concerns, the argument continues, and therefore the state may not impose any requirement or prohibition with respect to advertisements of cigarettes that target minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>Reynolds contends, in effect, that if it had used billboards depicting Old Joe Camel stating in huge block letters, \u201cKids, be the first in your fourth grade class cool enough to smoke Camels\u201d; or, to use the example of the Court of Appeal, \u201cif Reynolds had . . . presented Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on children\u2019s lunch boxes to promote cigarette smoking,\u201d California could do nothing about it, for any attempt to do so would be a requirement or prohibition \u201cbased on smoking and health.\u201d Only the federal government, Reynolds claims, can prevent advertisements that urge minors to smoke, no matter how blatantly. As we will indicate, Reynolds is incorrect. California may, consistently with section 1334(b), shield minors from cigarette advertising inducing them to smoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">In conducting the \u201ccentral inquiry\u201d established in <em>Cipollone, </em>we find that this action clearly seeks to impose a requirement or, more specifically, a prohibition under state law with respect to advertising or promoting cigarettes. It seeks to prohibit advertising of cigarettes targeting minors based upon state statutes prohibiting unfair business practices and selling or furnishing cigarettes to minors. The entire issue thus comes down to this: Is the predicate legal duty \u201cbased on smoking and health\u201d as that phrase was construed in Cipollone? We answer that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-5\">The <em>Cipollone </em>plurality\u2019s discussion of the fraudulent misrepresentation and conspiracy claims is dispositive. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._ [120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 429-430, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2623-2624].) The claims in <em>Cipollone </em>were based on allegations that the defendants \u201cmisrepresent[ed] or concealed] material facts concerning the health hazards of smoking.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. _[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 431, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2624].) Although concerns about smoking and health ultimately underlie such allegations, the plurality noted that the \u201cpredicate of this claim is a state law duty not to make false statements of material fact or to conceal such facts.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 430, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2623].) Such claims are therefore not preempted because they \u201care not predicated on a duty \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 but rather on a more general obligation\u2014the duty not to deceive.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 430, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2624].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-12\">The plurality found that \u201cCongress intended the phrase \u2018relating to smoking and health\u2019 [language from the original preemption provision but which the court found was \u201cessentially unchanged by the 1969 Act\u201d] to be construed narrowly, so as not to proscribe the regulation of deceptive advertising.\u201d (Ci<em>pollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 430, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2624].) Moreover, the plurality found, \u201cthis reading of \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 is wholly consistent with the purposes of the 1969 Act. State law prohibitions on false statements of material fact do not create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>\u2018diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\u2019 standards. Unlike state law obligations concerning the warning necessary to render a product \u2018reasonably safe,\u2019 state law proscriptions on intentional fraud rely only on a single, uniform standard: falsity. Thus, we conclude that the phrase \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass the more general duty not to make fraudulent statements. Accordingly, [plaintiff\u2019s] claim based on allegedly fraudulent statements made in [defendants\u2019] advertisements are not pre-empted by 5(b) of the 1969 Act [\u00a7 1331(b)].\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">This discussion applies to the instant cause of action. As noted previously, it is unlawful in California to sell cigarettes to minors or for minors to buy them. Advertising aimed at such unlawful conduct would assist vendors in violating the law. The predicate duty is to not engage in unfair competition by advertising illegal conduct or encouraging others to violate the law. In <em>Cipollone, </em>the predicate duty\u2014not to deceive\u2014was not \u201cbased on smoking and health\u201d; this one is similarly not. \u201cThus, we conclude that the phrase \u2018based on smoking and health\u2019 fairly but narrowly construed does not encompass the more general duty not to\u201d unfairly assist or advertise illegal conduct. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 431, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2624].) This action is therefore not preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-8\">Contrary to Reynolds\u2019s argument, this conclusion is wholly consistent with the purposes of the 1969 Act. Congress stated its policy to \u201c \u2018establish a comprehensive Federal program to deal with cigarette labeling and advertising with respect to any relationship between smoking and health,\u2019 \u201d in part to avoid \u201c \u2018diverse, nonuniform, and confusing cigarette labeling and advertising regulations with respect to any relationship between smoking and health.\u2019 \u201d (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, as quoted in <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p___ fn. 5 [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 419, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2614-2615].) State law prohibitions against advertisements targeting minors do not require Reynolds to adopt any particular label or advertisement \u201cwith respect to any relationship between smoking and health\u201d; rather, they forbid <em>any </em>advertisements soliciting unlawful purchases by minors. The prohibitions do not create \u201c \u2018diverse, nonuniform, and confusing\u2019 standards. Unlike state law obligations concerning the warning necessary to render a product \u2018reasonably safe,\u2019 state law proscriptions\u201d against advertisements targeting minors \u201crely only on a single, uniform standard\u201d: do not target minors. <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p. _ [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 431, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2624].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-11\">The Court of Appeal cited various statutes stressing the health consequences of smoking. Reynolds argues this proves that health concerns underlie this action, and it is therefore preempted. Although the Legislature has certainly spoken about the dangers of smoking, we do not rely on those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>provisions in finding no preemption, but on Penal Code section 308, which prohibits the sale of cigarettes to minors. The original version of that statute, which prohibited selling to anyone \u201cunder the age of sixteen years, any tobacco, or preparation of tobacco,\u201d was enacted over a century ago. (Stats. 1891, ch. 70, \u00a7 1, p. 64.) This was long before current health concerns, and specifically the health concerns that fuel this lawsuit, arose. The statute is part of a chapter of the Penal Code containing offenses \u201cagainst good morals.\u201d (Pen. Code, pt. 1, tit. 9, ch. 7.) Several of these offenses involve minors. (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 307 [illegal to sell specified food items containing alcohol to those under the age of 21 years], 309 [illegal to admit a minor to a house of prostitution], 310 [illegal for a minor under the age of 16 years to attend a prizefight or cockfight].) This shows that the state\u2019s protective role, and not primarily health concerns, motivated the prohibition against selling cigarettes to minors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Reynolds argues that health concerns are ultimately at issue here; therefore, the predicate duty is not based on unfair business practices, but on smoking and health. This is essentially the preemption argument rejected in <em>Cipollone.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Responding to the analogous argument by Justice Scalia that \u201cwe should construe fraudulent misrepresentation claims <em>not </em>as based on a general duty not to deceive but rather as \u2018based on smoking and health,\u2019 \u201d the <em>Cipollone </em>plurality noted that this position \u201chas some conceptual attraction.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._, fn. 27 [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 431, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2624], italics in original.) \u201cHowever,\u201d it responded, \u201cour ambition here is not theoretical elegance, but rather a fair understanding of congressional purpose.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>To accept this argument \u201cwould conflict both with the background presumption against preemption and with legislative history that plainly expresses an intent to preserve the \u2018police regulations\u2019 of the States.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The same is true of Reynolds\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-7\">As in <em>Cipollone, </em>evidence of congressional intent bolsters this conclusion. Indeed, some of the evidence the plurality cited is closely on point: \u201cThe Senate Report [regarding the 1969 Act] emphasized that the \u2018preemption of regulation or prohibition with respect to cigarette advertising is <em>narrowly phrased to preempt only State action based on smoking and health. </em>It would in no way affect the power of any State . . . with respect to the taxation or <em>the sale of cigarettes to minors, </em>or the prohibition of smoking in public buildings, or <em>similar police regulations.' </em>S. Rep. No. 91-566, p. 12 . . . .\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p___ fn. 26 [120 L.Ed.2d at p. 431, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2624], second italics added.) If Congress did not intend to affect the power of the state \u201cwith respect to\u201d the sale of cigarettes to minors, surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>section 1334(b) does not preempt attempts to prohibit the advertising of cigarettes directed at minors. Reynolds responds to this argument by quoting the next sentence of the same report: \u201cIt [preemption] is limited entirely to State or local requirements or prohibitions in the advertising of cigarettes.\u201d (1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 2663, reproducing Sen. Rep. No. 91-566, 2d Sess.) This sentence, not quoted in <em>Cipollone, </em>does indeed exist, but it does not support Reynolds. Noting that preemption is \u201climited\u201d to a certain subject does not aid in determining what, within that subject, is actually preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-5\">The same Senate Report cited in <em>Cipollone </em>states that at hearings held before the Consumer Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, and attended by the full committee, the \u201ccigarette manufacturers . . . stated to the committee that with respect to all other advertising, they would <em>avoid advertising directed to young persons, </em>and would continue to abstain from advertising in school and college publications, would continue not to distribute sample cigarettes or engage in promotional activities on school and college campuses, would continue not to use testimonials from athletes or other celebrities who might have special appeal to young people . . . .\u201d (1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 2660, reproducing Sen. Rep. No. 91-566, <em>supra, </em>italics added.) The report noted: \u201cThe committee cannot overstate its strong desire that the cigarette industry not only honor its statement <em>carefully to limit print advertising so as not to appeal to youth, </em>but that it will also exercise restraint in the overall use of print advertising and other forms of promotion.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 2662, italics added.) Reynolds argues this indicates Congress intended to preempt the field of advertising to minors, and to rely solely on voluntary self-regulation. It reads too much into too little. This shard of legislative history is not dispositive either way, but it certainly does not prove Reynolds\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">More recently, Congress enacted legislation allowing certain monetary grants to states, but \u201conly if the State involved has in effect a law providing that it is unlawful for any manufacturer, retailer, or distributor of tobacco products to sell or distribute any such product to any individual under the age of 18,\u201d and \u201cwill enforce\u201d that law. (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x-26(a), (b).) A state receiving such a grant must agree to develop \u201cstrategies to discourage the use of. . . tobacco products by individuals to whom it is unlawful to sell or distribute such . . . products.\u201d (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300x-22(b)(2)(B).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">We thus observe that cigarette manufacturers themselves promised to eschew advertisements targeting the young; Congress intended to allow and more recently has even encouraged states to enact and <em>enforce </em>laws prohibiting the sale of cigarettes to minors; and Congress has required states, as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>condition of receiving certain grants, to \u201cdiscourage\u201d the use of tobacco by those to whom it is unlawful to sell or distribute it, i.e., to minors. No appropriately \u201cnarrow\u201d interpretation of section 1334(b) could conclude, in the face of this evidence, that Congress nevertheless left states powerless to prohibit advertisements that target minors and, by targeting minors, that encourage, not discourage, those illegal sales. This evidence of congressional purpose, the \u201c \u2018 \u201cultimate touchstone\u201d \u2019 of pre-emption analysis\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p__[120 L.Ed.2d at 422, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2617]), shows no intent to preempt the cause of action at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-5\">Moreover, even if congressional intent were less than clear, Reynolds still would not prevail. Given the presumption against preemption, courts assume \u201c \u2018that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by . . . Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 422, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2617] [speaking for the majority at this point], quoting <em>Rice </em>v. <em>Santa Fe Elevator Corp. </em>(1947) 331 U.S. 218, 230 [91 L.Ed. 1447, 1459, 67 S.Ct. 1146].) Here, there is certainly no clear and manifest purpose of Congress to preempt this cause of action. We must therefore assume that the historic police powers of the state have not been superseded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">Reynolds cites certain statements by congressional opponents of the 1969 Act as supporting its position. We doubt that statements criticizing the bill help to discern the intent of the majority. (See <em>California Teachers Assn. </em>v. <em>San Diego Community College Dist. </em>(1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699-700 [170 Cal.Rptr. 817, 621 P.2d 856] [statements by individual legislators who voted in <em>favor </em>of the statute are generally not considered].) The statements do not aid Reynolds. Several dissenting Senators expressed the fear that \u201cif the [Federal Trade Commission] is barred by statute from requiring a warning in advertising, the public will have no meaningful defense, even against a massive onslaught of print advertising . . . designed to make cigarette smoking appealing to young people.\u201d (1970 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News, at p. 2667, reproducing Sen. Rep. No. 91-566, <em>supra.) </em>Attempting to transform rhetoric into self-fulfilling prophesy, Reynolds claims the dissenters prove its case. We disagree. Opponents\u2019 fears hardly prove what the majority wanted or intended. The majority may merely have disagreed with the dissenters\u2019 bleak assessment of the impact of the bill. Other dissenting statements are similarly unhelpful to Reynolds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">Reynolds argues further that because this action seeks injunctive relief rather than common law damages, it is preempted. It seems to argue first that any injunctive relief, of whatever nature, is preempted, and claims the <em>Cipollone </em>plaintiff conceded that section 1334(b) was intended \u201c \u2018to trump <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>\u201cstate statute[s], injunction^], or executive pronouncement[s].\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Quoting <em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at p._[120 L.Ed.2d at p. 426, 112 S.Ct. at p. 2620].) This overstates the plaintiff\u2019s argument in <em>Cipollone, </em>which was merely that the section applied \u201conly\u201d to positive enactments, a claim the plurality rejected, not that <em>all </em>such enactments were preempted. (See <em>ibid.) </em>The <em>Cipollone </em>plurality made clear it found \u201cno distinction between positive enactments and common law . . . <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">Reynolds also posits that because both Justices Blackmun and Scalia, who together spoke for five justices, criticized the plurality\u2019s analysis of what claims were and were not preempted, and because even Justice Blackmun would find at least some positive enactments covered by section 1334(b), the two separate opinions form a majority finding injunctive relief preempted. But the dissenters criticized the plurality from opposite directions. Justice Blackmun argued that the plurality\u2019s analysis resulted in too much preemption; Justice Scalia argued it resulted in too little. Nothing in Justice Black-mun\u2019s opinion suggests that he would find more preemption regarding injunctions than the majority, and certainly nothing suggesting he would leave the states powerless to combat advertising targeting minors. Indeed, Justice Blackmun argued that the 1965 statute \u201ccan bear only one meaning: that States are prohibited merely from \u2018mandating particular cautionary statements ... in cigarette advertisements\u2019 \u201d; and that \u201cthere is no suggestion in the legislative history that Congress intended to expand the scope of the pre-emption provision when it amended the statute in 1969.\u201d <em>(Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. at pp____[120 L.Ed.2d at pp. 434, 437, 112 S.Ct. at pp. 2626, 2629] (conc. &amp; dis. opn. of Blackmun, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-10\">Reynolds finally argues that some forms of injunctive relief at least would be preempted, such as a requirement of \u201cadditional health warning labels on advertisements.\u201d This may be the case, but the sole issue before us is whether the basis for the injunctive relief sought is preempted. It is not. In sum, we hold that the targeting minors cause of action is not preempted, not that any particular form of injunctive relief would be proper. Any challenge to a particular remedy, should plaintiff prevail on the merits, is premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-13\">As early as 1891, the Legislature cared deeply enough about smoking and minors that it prohibited the sale of cigarettes to them, just as it earlier had banned minors from houses of prostitution and would later ban them from prizefights. For over a century, with watchful eye, in its role as <em>parens </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number><em>patriae, </em>it has maintained a paternalistic vigilance over this vulnerable segment of our society. It is now asserted that plaintiff\u2019s effort to tread upon Tobacco Road is blocked by the nicotine wall of congressional preemption. The federal statute does not support such a view. Congress left the states free to exercise their police power to protect minors from advertising that encourages them to violate the law. Plaintiff may proceed under that aegis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-4\">The judgment of the Court of Appeal is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">Lucas, C. J., Mosk, J., Kennard, J., Baxter, J., George, J., and Werdegar, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1104-14\"><em>Cipollone, supra, </em>505 U.S. _ [120 L.Ed.2d 407, 112 S.Ct. 2608], was decided by a fragmented court. The lead opinion by Justice Stevens commanded majority support as to parts I through IV, but was a plurality opinion stating the views of only four Justices as to parts V and VI. Justices Blackmun and Scalia wrote separate concurring and dissenting opinions. Justice Blackmun, speaking for himself and two other Justices, concurred in parts I through IV, but would have found no part of the action preempted. Justice Scalia, speaking for himself and one other Justice, would have found the entire action preempted under the current statute. Discussion of the parts of Justice Stevens\u2019s opinion that received majority support will refer to the \u201ccourt.\u201d Discussion of the parts of Justice Stevens\u2019s opinion not supported by a majority will refer to the \u201cplurality\" opinion.
