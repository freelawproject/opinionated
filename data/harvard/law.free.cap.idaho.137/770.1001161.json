Sharon Grover (Grover) suffered a stroke while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>undergoing oral surgery at Dr. W.E. Isom\u2019s office in Ontario, Oregon. The case was tried in Payette County, Idaho. The jury found that Dr. Isom breached the standard of care, but that his certified registered nurse anesthetist (CRNA) did not. However, the jury found that Grover was 100 percent responsible for her own injuries. The Grovers argue that the district court wrongly applied Oregon law to the case and made errors regarding the admission of evidence. The decision of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In 1996 Sharon Grover was having problems with two of her upper left teeth and was experiencing frequent right-side headaches. Her family dentist recommended extraction of these teeth and referred her to Dr. W.E. Isom, an oral surgeon practicing in Ontario, Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">On January 7, 1997, Grover appeared at Isom\u2019s office for oral surgery. She completed a patient intake questionnaire, which did not contain any questions regarding headaches. Grover testified, however, that she informed the receptionist and Isom and Steven Berg, Isom\u2019s CRNA, that she had been experiencing severe right-sided headaches, which she attributed to her tooth problems. These people testified that they did not remember Grover making these statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">Oral surgery began at approximately 4:00 P.M. Berg administered brevital, a short-lasting barbituate, as the anesthesia. The surgery was completed a half-hour later, but Grover did not awake from the anesthetic as expected. After 5:00 P.M., Berg noticed that Grover\u2019s pupil was dilated and that she manifested additional symptoms of neurological distress. Berg told Isom that Grover needed to be taken to a hospital. Dr. Isom testified that he immediately called for an ambulance. However, an ambulance did not arrive until over two hours after surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Grover was taken to Holy Rosary Hospital in Ontario and then by Life Flight to St. Alphonsus Hospital in Boise, where she was operated on by Dr. Peter Reedy, a neurosurgeon. Grover had suffered a stroke. She lost the use of her left arm and has difficulty walking. She requires assistance in her daily living. Several months later her husband secured a default divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">A malpractice suit was filed in April 1998 in Idaho, because all parties were Idaho domiciliaries. The district court determined that Oregon substantive law should apply because the injury occurred in Oregon. The trial lasted nearly two weeks. The district court ruled that Isom\u2019s discipline by the Oregon Board of Dentistry was exempt from disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-12\">The jury found that Isom had breached the standard of care, but that Berg had not. The jury also found that Isom\u2019s breach was not the proximate cause of Grover\u2019s injuries. The jury found that Grover\u2019s stroke began before she visited Isom\u2019s office, and that she contributed 100 percent to her own injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-13\">The Grovers moved for a new trial and a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which were denied. The Grovers argue that the district court wrongly applied Oregon law, wrongly allowed two witnesses to testify, wrongly excluded the records of the Oregon Board of Discipline, gave improper jury instructions, and that misconduct of counsel warrants a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-15\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN APPLYING SUBSTANTIVE OREGON LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b808-16\">The Grovers argue that the district court erred in applying Oregon law in denying amendment of the complaint to add a claim for punitive damages and in determining to exclude records of the Oregon Board of Dentistry. \u201cThe determination and application of the appropriate choice of law analysis is a question of law over which the Court exercises free review.\u201d <em>Ryals v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>134 Idaho 302, 304, 1 P.3d 803, 805 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-17\">A. Most Significant Relation Test</p>\n<p id=\"b808-18\">Idaho applies the \u201cmost significant relation test\u201d as set forth in the Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 145 in deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>mining the applicable law. In a tort case the following considerations must be taken into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-4\">(a) the place where the injury occurred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">(b) the place where the conduct causing the injury occurred,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-6\">(c) the domicile, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">(d) the place where the relationship, if any, between the parties is centered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\"><em>Seubert Excavators, Inc. v. Anderson Logging Co., </em>126 Idaho 648, 651, 889 P.2d 82, 85 (1995) (citing <em>Johnson v. Pischke, </em>108 Idaho 397, 400, 700 P.2d 19, 22 (1985)). \u201cOf these contacts, the most important in guiding this Court\u2019s past decisions in tort cases has been the place where the injury occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Barringer v. State, </em>111 Idaho 794, 727 P.2d 1222 (1986)). Since this is a malpractice action, these tort principles apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">Applying the facts of this case, it is clear that Oregon substantive law applies. The injury occurred in Ontario, Oregon, in Isom\u2019s office. The alleged negligence occurred in the same office. The parties lived in Idaho, but Isom\u2019s place of business was in Oregon, which could support the application of either Idaho or Oregon law. Finally, the parties\u2019 relationship was centered in Oregon. They met at Isom\u2019s office, and this is where the surgery occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Once these factors are considered, they are evaluated in light of the following policy concerns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">(a) the needs of the interstate and international systems,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-12\">(b) the relevant policies of the forum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-13\">(c) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-14\">(d) the protection of justified expectations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-15\">(e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-16\">(f) certainty, predictability, and uniformity of result, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-17\">(g) the ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-20\">Restatement (Second) of Conflicts of Laws \u00a7 6; <em>DeMeyer v. Maxwell, </em>103 Idaho 327, 329, 647 P.2d 783, 785 (Ct.App.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-22\">These policies support the application of Oregon law. The needs of the interstate and international systems are not likely implicated in this case. In considering relevant policies of other states it is clear that Oregon has an interest in making certain that oral surgeons practicing in Oregon are subject to Oregon laws and the Oregon standard of care. The defendants would justifiably expect to be governed by Oregon law, since they were licensed in Oregon and in this case conducted their business in Oregon. \u201cThe basic policy of negligence law is to allow a person to recover from injury proximately caused by another\u2019s violation of a duty of reasonable care.\u201d <em>DeMeyer, </em>103 Idaho at 330, 647 P.2d at 786. As a general rule, a victim should recover under the system in place where the injury occurred. Predictability and ease in determining and applying law are also better served by applying Oregon law, because it is a simple policy that the place of the injury should generally govern the choice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-23\">The Grovers are correct that in <em>DeMeyer, </em>the Court of Appeals held that the place of the injury does not always control the choice of law. However, that case and this case are distinguishable. In <em>DeMeyer </em>the plaintiff and her sister were driving through Oregon at the time of an automobile accident. <em>Id. </em>at 328, 647 P.2d at 784. The Court of Appeals ruled that under subpart (d) of Restatement Section 6 none of the parties had any expectation that Oregon law would apply. <em>Id. </em>at 329, 647 P.2d at 785. The Court of Appeals described the plaintiffs\u2019 presence in Oregon as \u201cfortuitous,\u201d as the plaintiffs were simply driving through <em>Oregon </em>while going between Washington and Idaho. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 647 P.2d at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-26\">This case is factually different. Grover\u2019s presence in Oregon was not fortuitous \u2014 she purposefully went to Oregon for the operation. Isom and Berg were practicing in Oregon and had every expectation that Oregon law would govern their business in Oregon.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-27\">The conduct causing the injury, as well as the injury itself, occurred in Oregon. Isom\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>place of business was located in Oregon. The only factor that justifies the application of Idaho law is that the parties are Idaho residents. Every other factor supports the application of Oregon law. The district court correctly ruled that Oregon substantive law applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">B. <em>Procedural v. Substantive Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The application of Oregon substantive law was proper in this case. However, the Grovers claim that the amendment of a complaint is a procedural rule, and that they should have been allowed to amend their complaint to allow a claim for punitive damages. The district court ruled that the Grovers could not amend them complaint to add a claim for punitive damages, because punitive damages are available under Oregon law only if a plaintiff shows that the defendant acted outside the scope of his practice and with malice. <em>See </em>O.R.S. \u00a7 18.550. The Grovers could not show that the defendants acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">The jury never reached the issue of damages, because it found that Mrs. Grover\u2019s negligence, not the defendants\u2019 negligence, caused Mrs. Grover\u2019s stroke. Therefore, any error in this regard would likely be harmless. However, even if the error were not harmless, the Grovers are incorrect that this is a procedural issue. This Court recently stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-7\">[sjubstantive law prescribes norms for societal conduct and punishments for violations thereof. It thus creates, defines, and regulates primary rights. In contrast, practice and procedure pertain to the essentially mechanical operations of the courts by which substantive law, rights, and remedies are effectuated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-8\"><em>Floyd v. Board of Commissioners of Bonneville County, </em>131 Idaho 234, 238, 953 P.2d 984, 988 (1998) (quoting <em>State v. Currington, </em>108 Idaho 539, 541, 700 P.2d 942, 944 (1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">Damages and punishments are substantive law. The district court properly applied Oregon law in determining not to allow amendment of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN ALLOWING TROY BRITTON TO TESTIFY</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">The Grovers argue that Troy Britton, a CRNA, was not qualified to give expert testimony because he had not administered anesthesia in an office setting. Britton was licensed as a CRNA in three states and had practiced for nearly twenty years. He had administered anesthesia with dentists before. He acknowledged that he had not administered anesthesia in an oral surgeon\u2019s office, but he testified that where anesthesia is administered does not affect the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-13\">The foundational requirements for expert testimony are set forth in Idaho Rule of Evidence 702, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b810-14\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Au8\">Whether a witness is qualified as an expert is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lunders v. Estate of R. Snyder, </em>131 Idaho 689, 697-98, 963 P.2d 372, 380-81 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-15\">Regarding I.R.E. 702, an expert must be qualified by \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d Britton was qualified as an expert under I.R.E. 702 because of his experience of being a CRNA for nearly twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-16\">The Grovers also argue that I.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6-1012-1013 should have governed the admission of Britton\u2019s testimony. These statutes define the standard of care in Idaho. Idaho Code \u00a7 6-1012, entitled \u201cProof of community standard of health care practice in malpractice case,\u201d states that in any malpractice case, a plaintiff must \u201caffirmatively prove by direct expert testimony and by a preponderance of all the competent evidence, that such defendant then and there negligently failed to meet the applicable standard of care ...\u201d and that \u201csuch individual providers of health care shall be judged in such eases in eompar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>ison with similarly trained and qualified providers of the same class in the same community, taking into account his or her training, experience, and fields of medical specialization, if any.\u201d This statute requires proof of the standard of care and that the standard of care is to be determined by reference to the community standard. This is not a procedural statute. It defines a societal norm \u2014 the standard of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">I.C. \u00a7 6-1013 is titled \u201cTestimony of expert witness on community standard.\u201d It states that the standard of care must be established by expert testimony, and that the expert\u2019s opinion be \u201cactually held by the expert witness,\u201d that the opinion can be testified to \u201cwith reasonable medical certainty\u201d and that the witness possess \u201cprofessional knowledge and expertise coupled with actual knowledge of the applicable said community standard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">I.C. \u00a7 6-1013 lays out how an expert may become knowledgeable about the standard of care. While I.C. \u00a7 6-1012 defines the standard of care, I.C. \u00a7 6-1013 sets forth foundational requirements about how it is to be proved and what type of knowledge the expert needs to have. Even if Idaho Law were applied, Britton was qualified to testify as an expert regarding the standard of care for a CRNA. He was licensed as a CRNA, had administered anesthesia before, and had done so for dentists. He was aware of the standard of care. The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Britton to testify under either Oregon or Idaho Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR BY REFUSING TO ADMIT THE RECORDS OF THE OREGON STATE DENTAL BOARD</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The district court ruled that records of the Oregon Board of Dentistry were privileged under Oregon law. The statute reads in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-9\">(5) A health professional regulatory board record or order, or any part thereof, obtained as part of or resulting from an investigation, contested case proceeding, consent order or stipulated agreement, is not admissible as evidence and may not preclude an issue or claim in any civil proceeding except in a proceeding between the board and the licensee or application as otherwise allowed by law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">O.R.S. \u00a7 676.175.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-15\">The Grovers argue that the district court should have applied Idaho law because this is an issue of procedural law rather than substantive law. They claim the records would not be privileged under Idaho law.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">Regardless of whether Oregon or Idaho law is applied the records are exempt from disclosure. I.C. \u00a7 9-340(15), in effect at the time the lawsuit was filed, stated that \u201cunless otherwise provided by agency rule, information obtained as part of an inquiry into a person\u2019s fitness to be granted or retain a license\u201d is exempt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Grovers have cited no agency rule that allows for disclosure, and the Court has not found such a rule. I.C. \u00a7 9-340(15) exempted professional discipline records from disclosure, as did Oregon Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-18\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN ALLOWING DR. REEDY TO TESTIFY</p>\n<p id=\"b811-19\">The Grovers argue that Dr. Reedy, a defense expert who was Grover\u2019s neurosurgeon at the time of her brain surgery following the stroke, should not have been allowed to testify because he was not disclosed as an expert in the time allowed for discoveiy. This was part of their motion for a new tidal pursuant to IRCP 59(a)(3) which requires a showing of \u201caccident or surprise, which ordinary prudence could have not guarded against.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-20\">The grant or denial of a motion for a new trial is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Highland Enters., Inc. v. Barker, </em>133 Idaho 330, 342, 986 P.2d 996, 1008 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">The discovery cut-off date in this case was June 1,1999. Dr. Reedy was disclosed as an expert witness on June 2, 1999. While this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>was one day after the cut-off date, it was over two months before the trial began. The defendants had disclosed Dr. Reedy as a potential witness before the June 1 cut-off date \u2014 on April 12, 1999, it was disclosed that Dr. Reedy was a possible witness and might testify as to causation. The Grovers deposed Dr. Reedy in January of 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">It is true that Dr. Reedy was disclosed as an expert witness one day after the discovery cut-off date, but the Grovers cannot claim that they were surprised by his testimony. They knew for over two months that Dr. Reedy was an expert witness, that he might testify as to causation, and they had deposed him earlier that year. The Grovers, in the exercise of ordinary prudence, should have been prepared for Dr. Reedy\u2019s testimony. The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing Dr. Reedy to testify and in denying the motion for new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">THE DISTRICT COURT DID NOT ERR IN DENYING THE GROVERS\u2019 MOTION FOR NEW TRIAL BASED UPON THE CLAIM OF MISCONDUCT BY COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The Grovers argue that statements of Isom\u2019s attorney, made during closing arguments, warrant a new trial. This is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Highland Enters., Inc. v. Barker, </em>133 Idaho 330, 342, 986 P.2d 996, 1008 (1999). They claim that this is an \u201cirregularity\u201d under IRCP 59(a)(1) which states that a new trial may be granted for \u201cirregularity in the proceedings of the court, jury or adverse party or any order of the court or abuse of discretion by which either party was prevented from having a fair trial.\u201d The Grovers claim that Isom\u2019s attorney created an \u201cirregularity\u201d by trivializing the Board of Dentistry\u2019s actions against Isom.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">The district court had granted Isom\u2019s motion in limine regarding the Oregon Board of Dentistry\u2019s actions again Isom. During closing arguments, Isom\u2019s attorney stated that if there was anything \u201crelevant\u201d about his history, the jury \u201cwould have heard about it.\u201d The district court noted that during trial, the Grovers attorney attempted to insinuate the Board\u2019s actions into the trial, while the defendants\u2019 attorneys tried to insinuate their absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial as a consequence of the insinuating of counsel. The jury found that Isom violated the standard of care. Isom\u2019s attorney\u2019s statements apparently had no effect on the jury. The jury found that Isom\u2019s breach did not cause Grover\u2019s stroke. The insinuations of counsel are not sufficient to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-12\">NO ERROR IN INSTRUCTIONS HAS BEEN SHOWN</p>\n<p id=\"b812-13\">The Grovers argue that three of the district court\u2019s jury instructions did not accurately reflect Idaho law. These instructions were apparently based on Oregon substantive law, which was correctly applied. Therefore, failing to instruct on Idaho law did not constitute error.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-14\">In any event, the three instructions that were objected to are not a part of the augmented record. They were denied by order of this Court on January 23, 2001, because they did not contain a date stamp. The Grovers acknowledge that these instructions are not part of the record, and therefore \u201cmust remain silent on those submitted instructions.\u201d No error has been shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-15\">VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-16\">THE FACT THE GROVERS DID NOT CHALLENGE THE JURY\u2019S FINDING THAT MRS. GROVER WAS 100% RESPONSIBLE FOR HER OWN INJURIES DOES NOT REQUIRE DISMISSAL OF THE APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b812-17\">The respondents argue that the Grovers do not challenge the jury\u2019s finding that Mrs. Grover was responsible for her own injuries, and, therefore, her appeal must fail under <em>MacLeod v. Reed, </em>126 Idaho 669, 889 P.2d 103 (Ct.App.1995) and <em>Leydet v. City of Mountain Home, </em>119 Idaho 1041, 812 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>755 (Ct.App.1991). The respondents maintain that even if the Grovers are correct with regard to her issues on appeal, that the jury's finding is an independent basis for affirming the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">It is clear, however, that the Grovers are arguing that if Idaho law were applied and certain witnesses excluded, that the jury\u2019s finding and the award would be different. They argue that many legal issues were wrongly determined by the district court and that this would affect the jury\u2019s finding. As the district court noted, \u201cthe jury accepted the testimony of the Defendant\u2019s medical experts on the issue of causation ... and they believed the surgery and the stroke to be coincidental.\u201d The Grovers are challenging the expert testimony of Dr. Reedy on the issue of causation, and are arguing that the jury\u2019s verdict would not be sustained if the jury had known of Isom\u2019s discipline by the Oregon Board of Dentistry. The Grovers assert that the jury\u2019s finding is based on evidence that should not have been in the record and that the jury should have heard evidence that was not in the record. Dismissal of the appeal for failing to expressly challenge the findings that Mrs. Grover was 100% responsible for her injuries would be improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The decision of the district court is affirmed.
