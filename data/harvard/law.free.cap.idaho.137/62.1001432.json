We vacate the decision of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-21\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b99-22\">Ag Services of America, Inc. (herein \u201cAg Services\u201d) loaned money to a farmer named Shane Lierman to be used in raising various crops, including potatoes, during the 1999 growing season. To secure payment of those loans, Lierman granted Ag Services a security interest in his crops and in their proceeds. Ag Services properly perfected its security interest and later assigned its rights to Ag Acceptance Corporation. For convenience we will refer to the plaintiff as \u201cAg Services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-23\">Upon harvesting the potatoes, Lierman stored a portion of his potato crop in a potato cellar owned by Michael Gene Kechter. In January 2000 Michael Kechter granted a general power of attorney to his father Richard Kechter, and on July 12, 2000, Michael passed away. On July 28, 2000, Richard Kechter was appointed personal representative of Michael\u2019s estate. Jennifer Kechter is Michael\u2019s surviving spouse. Michael, his father Richard, acting as both attorney in fact and personal representative, and Jennifer Kechter are herein collectively referred to as \u201cKechter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-24\">Lierman contracted to sell to Nonpareil Processing Corporation (herein \u201cNonpareil\u201d) the potatoes he had stored in Kechter\u2019s potato cellar. After some of the potatoes were delivered to Nonpareil, it rejected the remainder of the crop. Lierman then contracted to sell the remaining potatoes to the J.R. Simplot Company (herein \u201cSimplot\u201d). When Kechter learned that Lierman\u2019s potatoes were being removed from his potato cellar for shipment to Simplot, his counsel wrote a letter dated June 2, 2000, to Simplot in which he stated that Kechter claimed a lien on the potatoes and would stop them from being removed from the potato cellar unless Sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>plot agreed to put Keehter\u2019s name on the check issued in payment of the potatoes. Simplot apparently agreed to do so, and in June 2000 all of Lierman\u2019s -potatoes remaining in Kechter\u2019s potato cellar were shipped to Simplot. On August 1, 2000, Simplot issued a check in the sum of $256,819.90 in payment for Lierman\u2019s potatoes. The payees on the check included Kechter and Ag Services.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Kechter claimed a lien pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A in the amount of $60,000 on the check issued by Simplot. Ag Services countered that Kechter had lost its lien when it relinquished possession of the potatoes. They agreed to negotiate the cheek and to deposit $81,600 in a bank account until they could resolve the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">On October 6, 2000, Ag Services brought this lawsuit to resolve the issue. It alleged that it had a properly perfected security interest in the proceeds of the sale of Lierman\u2019s potatoes, that Kechter did not have a valid claim to the proceeds, and that Ag Service was entitled to the entire sum on deposit. Kechter answered and filed a counterclaim alleging that he had a valid lien on the proceeds under Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A and that he was entitled to $60,000 from the sum on deposit, plus fees and costs. Both parties moved for summary judgment. The district court granted Kechter\u2019s motion for summary judgment and awarded him $60,000 of the sum on deposit, court costs including attorney fees under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3), and prejudgment interest. Ag Services then appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">The facts relevant to the issue decided by the district court are not in dispute. The only issue is the interpretation of Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-8\">(1) An agricultural commodity warehouseman, as such term is defined in subsection</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-9\">(2) of this section has a lien, dependent upon possession, upon any agricultural commodity deposited with the warehouseman, or stored in or upon the warehouseman\u2019s premises, and any proceeds of sale of such agricultural commodity, which lien shall secure payment of any and all lawful charges incurred or payable for the storage, preservation, transportation, labor, weighing, testing, processing, milling, improvement, sale or similar expense incurred with regard to such agricultural commodity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">The specific issue is whether the lien on the proceeds is \u201cdependent upon possession\u201d of the proceeds.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">This Court\u2019s primary duty in interpreting a statute is to give effect to the legislative intent as ascertained from the statutory language. <em>Adamson v. Blanchard, </em>133 Idaho 602, 990 P.2d 1213 (1999). The Court may also seek edification from the statute\u2019s legislative history and the historical context in which it was enacted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b100-13\">The statute grants to an agricultural commodity warehouseman \u201ca lien, dependent upon possession.\u201d Because the phrase \u201cdependent upon possession\u201d modifies the word \u201clien,\u201d the legislature clearly intended that any lien created under the statute be dependent upon possession. The statute grants \u201ca lien, dependent upon possession, upon\u201d three classifications of property. First, it grants \u201ca lien, dependent upon possession, upon any agricultural commodity deposited with the warehouseman.\u201d Second, it grants \u201ca lien, dependant upon possession, upon any agricultural commodity ... stored in or upon the warehouseman\u2019s premises.\u201d Finally, it grants \u201ca lien, dependent upon possession, upon ... any proceeds of sale of such agricultural commodity.\u201d In each instance, however, the lien granted is dependent upon possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">The phrase \u201cdependent upon possession\u201d or \u201cdependent on possession\u201d has long been used in Idaho lien statutes. See e.g., Rev. Stat. of the Terr, of Idaho \u00a7\u00a7 3445,3447, &amp; 3448 (1887). This Court first commented upon the meaning of the phrase in <em>Hill v. Twin Falls Salmon River Land &amp; Water Company, </em>22 Idaho 274, 125 P. 204 (1912), in which the plaintiffs sought to foreclose a mechanic\u2019s lien for the value of their services in hauling concrete from the railroad station to the construction site. They prevailed in the trial court, and the landowner appealed. On appeal the landowner contended that the plaintiffs were not entitled to a mechanic\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>lien and that the only lien to which they could be entitled would be under a statute which granted a lien \u201cdependent on possession\u201d for services rendered in transporting an article of personal property. This Court stated that the plaintiffs would have lost any lien they had under that statute because, \u201c[W]hen the cement was delivered to the appellant, and the possession was surrendered to the appellant, the right to a lien ceased, as the right of lien conferred by this section depends wholly upon the possession of the property.\u201d 22 Idaho at 279, 125 P. at 206. The Court then held that the plaintiffs were entitled to a mechanic\u2019s lien for their services in hauling the cement to the construction site.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">In <em>Gould v. Hill, </em>43 Idaho 93, 251 P. 167 (1926), the plaintiffs brought an action to foreclose an agister\u2019s lien under a statute which granted a lien \u201cdependent on possession\u201d for services rendered in feeding and pasturing livestock. This Court acknowledged, \u201cAs a general rule, a common-law or statutory lien, dependent upon possession, is waived or lost by the lienholder voluntarily and unconditionally parting with possession or control of the property to which it attaches.\u201d 43 Idaho at 107, 251 P. at 171. It then held that the plaintiffs had not lost their lien on some cattle that were returned to the owner because the owner had obtained possession of those cattle by fraud. He had given the plaintiffs a check for their services and then stopped payment on the check once he had possession of the cattle.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In <em>Seafoam Mines Corporation v. Vaughn, </em>56 Idaho 342, 53 P.2d 1166 (1936), the appellant had hired the respondent to look after a mine. When he was not paid for his services, the respondent foreclosed a statutory lien on the personal property associated with the mine and purchased that property at the foreclosure sale. The appellant then filed an action to enjoin respondent from removing the personal property from the mine. On appeal, the appellant argued, among other things, that respondent should not be entitled to a lien for his services rendered in caring for the property during the period from the demand for payment until the foreclosure sale. The statute provided that the lien was \u201cdependent on possession.\u201d When addressing that issue, this Court noted, \u201cThe lien was dependent on possession, so respondent had to continue in possession until foreclosure.\u201d 56 Idaho at 350, 53 P.2d at 1169. This Court then held that respondent\u2019s continued possession of the property was of a dual nature. It stated, \u201c[T]he lien claimant must not only hold the property to protect and perfect his lien, but he must also hold the property in order to return it to the owner if the claim is paid or tender made.\u201d 56 Idaho at 351-52, 53 P.2d at 1170.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Finally, Idaho Code \u00a7 45-115 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">The voluntary restoration of property to its owner by the holder of a lien thereon, dependent upon possession, extinguishes the lien as to such property, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, and extinguishes it notwithstanding any such agreement, as to creditors of the owner and persons subsequently acquiring a title to the property, or a lien thereon, in good faith and for a good consideration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">From this Court\u2019s interpretation of other statutes creating a lien that is dependent upon possession, and the wording of Idaho Code \u00a7 45-115, it is clear that the phrase \u201cdependent upon possession\u201d has been used historically in Idaho to mean that the lien exists only so long as the lien claimant remains in possession of the property to which the lien is attached. That is consistent with what is generally understood to be the law in this area. \u201cA common-law lien or a statutory hen that is dependent on possession continues only so long as possession is voluntarily retained.\u201d 51 Am. Jur 2d <em>Liens </em>\u00a7 60 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Kechter voluntarily relinquished possession of the Lierman\u2019s potatoes in June 2000. Thus, any hen he had in the potatoes was extinguished. The issue is whether or not his hen continued in the proceeds of the sale of the potatoes. Because the hen granted by Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A(1) is dependent upon possession and is extinguished when possession is relinquished, the hen would continue only so long as Kechter had possession of property to which the hen could attach. The hen would continue in the proceeds only if Kechter had possession of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>proceeds at or before the time he relinquished possession of the potatoes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once he no longer had possession of property to which the lien could attach, the lien was extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Kechter argues that his name on the check issued by Simplot constituted possession of the proceeds.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Even if we were to so hold, his lien was extinguished long before that check was issued. He relinquished possession of the potatoes in June 2000, and the check was not issued until August 1, 2000. \u201cThe lien is extinguished if the lienor voluntarily parts with possession, and cannot be restored thereafter by the lienor\u2019s resumption of possession.\u201d 51 Am. Jur 2d <em>Liens </em>\u00a7 60 (2000). Even if Kechter\u2019s name on the check constituted possession of it, such possession could not revive the lien that had been extinguished almost two months earlier when he relinquished possession of the potatoes. In order to preserve his lien, the warehouseman must retain possession of the agricultural commodity until he is paid. Thus, the district court erred in holding that Kechter had a lien on the check issued by Simplot in payment of the potatoes.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Kechter argues that requiring the lien granted by Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A to be dependent upon possession contradicts the legislative purpose for enacting the statute. The statute was enacted in response to this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Curry Grain Storage, Inc. v. Hesston Corporation, </em>120 Idaho 328, 815 P.2d 1068 (1991). In <em>Curry </em>this Court held, that a warehouseman\u2019s lien for cleaning, processing, and storing grass seed did not have priority over a previously perfected security interest in the seed. The statute creating the lien provided that it would have priority over a previously perfected security interest if the secured party had so entrusted the owner with possession of the seed that a pledge of the seed by the owner to a good faith purchaser for value would have been valid. Because the secured party had not done so in the <em>Curry </em>case, this Court held that the warehouseman\u2019s lien did not have priority over the previously perfected security interest. In response, the legislature enacted Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A to provide that an agricultural commodity warehouseman\u2019s lien would have priority over a previously perfected security interest. The <em>Curry </em>case did not address the issue of the loss of a warehouseman\u2019s lien if the warehouseman relinquished possession of the collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">The lien created by Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A can only apply to an agricultural commodity that was in the possession of the warehouseman. It only applies to a commodity \u201cdeposited with the warehouseman, or stored in or upon the warehouseman\u2019s premises.\u201d If the legislature merely intended that the lien granted by the statute be created by possession of the commodity and thereafter continue regardless of possession, there would have been no reason for the legislature to include the limitation that the lien was \u201cdependent upon possession.\u201d To construe the statute to mean that a lien is created when a warehouseman takes possession of an agricultural commodity and that the lien thereafter continues regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>possession would render the phrase \u201cdependent upon possession\u201d merely surplusage. We will not construe a statute in a way that makes mere surplusage of provisions included therein. <em>Sweitzer v. Dean, </em>118 Idaho 568, 798 P.2d 27 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Both parties request attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3). They contend that this case involved a commercial transaction. The statute does not authorize the awarding of attorney fees every time a commercial transaction is connected with the case. <em>Bingham v. Montane Resource Assoc., </em>133 Idaho 420, 987 P.2d 1035 (1999). The test is whether the commercial transaction constitutes the essential part of the lawsuit. <em>Id. </em>There was certainly a commercial transaction between Lierman and Kechter and between Lierman and Ag Service, but there was no commercial transaction between Ag Service and Kechter. Rather, the thrust of Ag Service\u2019s claim was that it was entitled to the entire proceeds from the sale of Lierman\u2019s potatoes because Kechter\u2019s hen was invalid. Likewise, Kechter\u2019s counterclaim merely alleged an entitlement to a portion of the proceeds based upon his claimed lien. Ag Service and Kechter were not involved in any commercial transaction between themselves, nor did either of them allege such a transaction in their respective pleadings. Therefore, attorney fees cannot be awarded under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3). <em>Bingham v. Montane Resource Assoc., </em>133 Idaho 420, 987 P.2d 1035 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The district court erroneously held that a hen created by Idaho Code \u00a7 28-7-209A is not dependent upon possession, and therefore its judgment must be vacated. Kechter also alleged that Ag Service was estopped to deny his claim to the proceeds of the sale of Lierman\u2019s potatoes. Because the district court did not address that issue, this case must be remanded for further proceedings. The judgment entered by the district court is vacated, and this case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. Ag Services is awarded costs on appeal, but not attorney fees.</p>\n<judges id=\"b103-7\">Chief Justice TROUT, and Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS and KIDWELL CONCUR.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">. Had Kechter foreclosed his lien by selling some or all of the potatoes and received payment at or before the time he relinquished possession of the potatoes sold, his lien would have continued in the proceeds of that sale and would have been superior to any party claiming the proceeds based upon a prior perfected security interest in the potatoes and their proceeds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-7\">. At the time relevant to this case, \"proceeds\u201d were defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-8\">\u201cProceeds\u201d includes whatever is received upon the sale, exchange, collection or other disposition of collateral or proceeds. Insurance payable by reason of loss or damage to the collateral is proceeds, except to the extent that it is payable to a person other than a party to the security agreement. Any payments or distributions made with respect to investment property collateral are proceeds. Money, checks, deposit accounts, and the like are \u201ccash proceeds.\u201d All other proceeds are \"noncash proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-12\">Ch. 272, \u00a7 13, 1995 Idaho Sess. Laws 873, 913. The check issued by Simplot was cash proceeds. A majority of courts hold that an account created as a result of the sale of the collateral constitutes proceeds even though the seller had not yet received payment on that account. Ronald A. Anderson &amp; Lary Lawrence, Anderson on the Uniform Commercial Code 218 (3d ed., 1999 rev.) Under the majority view, Lierman\u2019s account receivable owing by Simplot would be noncash proceeds. Kechter does not contend that he retained possession of any noncash proceeds from the sale of the potatoes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
