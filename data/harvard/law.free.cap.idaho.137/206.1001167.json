We vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-28\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b242-29\">On January 27, 1999, Win Henslee, a Gooding County Commissioner, acting as an employee of Luis Bettencourt, filed an application with the Gooding County Planning and Zoning office to obtain a permit for a confined animal feeding operation (CAFO) in order to construct a new dairy. At the time he did so, the Gooding County Board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>Commissioners had a moratorium on new CAFO\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">On February 8, 1999, the Board of Commissioners convened to consider a proposed ordinance that would regulate CAFO\u2019s and to consider various changes to the proposed ordinance that had been recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The discussion centered upon various suggested changes and whether or not such changes could be made without having to begin anew the process for adopting the ordinance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Commissioner Henslee participated in these discussions. Ultimately, he moved that the ordinance be adopted with all the changes that the law will allow, according to the Gooding County Prosecuting Attorney. The motion was seconded, and it passed. Commissioner Henslee then moved to recess the meeting until 9:00 a.m. the following day \u201cto finalize the previous motion.\u201d That motion was also seconded and passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">On February 9, 1999, the Board of Commissioners met again, with Commissioner Henslee absent. Commissioners Faulkner and Arkoosh continued to discuss various changes to the proposed ordinance. They recessed the meeting to type out changes desired by Commissioner Faulkner. Once those changes were made, they reconvened, Commissioner Faulkner moved to adopt what became Ordinance 66, Commissioner Arkoosh seconded the motion, and the motion carried.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">On March 31, 1999, the Gooding County Planning and Zoning Commission held a public hearing on the CAFO permit application filed on behalf of Mr. Bettencourt. Commissioner Henslee represented Mr. Bettencourt at the hearing. On April 9, 1999, the Planning and Zoning Commission granted the CAFO permit with the restriction that the facility never exceed seven cows per acre and that the water permit be obtained before the occupancy permit is issued. Tracy and Sue Scott, Donald Cogger, and two others appealed that decision to the Board of Commissioners. Their appeal was heard on May 10, 1999. Commissioner Henslee, citing a conflict of interest, did not participate in the appeal, although he was present at the hearing because the Board was also considering other matters. On June 14, 1999, the Board of Commissioners denied the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">On July 8, 1999, Tracy and Sue Scott and Donald Cogger filed a petition for judicial review challenging the issuance of the CAFO permit. On July 29, 1999, Mr. Bettencourt moved to intervene on the ground that his dairy was under construction and he desired to protect his interest to construct and operate it. The district court granted that motion. Mr. Bettencourt did not file any pleading or motion in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">Mr. and Mrs. Scott and Mr. Cogger had listed eleven issues on appeal, one of which was, \u201cWhether the Gooding County CAFO Ordinance is valid and enforceable as adopted.\u201d They later filed a motion seeking to dismiss or withdraw that issue from their appeal. The district court denied that motion on June 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">In a memorandum decision issued on July 14, 2000, the district court held that Ordinance 66 was invalid pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6506 because Commissioner Henslee had a conflict of interest. The Gooding County parties moved for reconsideration. Citing <em>Burt v. City of Idaho Falls, </em>105 Idaho 65, 665 P.2d 1075 (1983), they argued that the adoption of Ordinance 66 could not be challenged by a petition for judicial review. The district court denied the motion, holding that it would construe the petition for judicial review to include a claim for declaratory relief. The Gooding County parties then appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">A. Did the district court have the authority to declare Ordinance 66 void?</p>\n<p id=\"b243-16\">The adoption of Ordinance 66 was a legislative action by the county commissioners. <em>Cooper v. Board, of County Commissioners, </em>101 Idaho 407, 614 P.2d 947 (1980). In <em>Burt v. City of Idaho Falls, </em>105 Idaho 65, 665 P.2d 1075 (1983), we held that legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>actions by county commissioners cannot be attacked by a petition for judicial review. The petition filed by the respondents in this case was clearly a petition for judicial review. It was entitled, \u201cNotice of Appeal Petition for Review.\u201d The petition referred to Mr. and Mrs. Scott and Mr. Cogger as \u201cAppellants\u201d both in the caption and in the body of the petition. The petition contained a single count, the allegations of which began:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-4\">1. Appellant\u2019s appeal and request judicial review of the decision filed by Respondent Gooding County Commission in the appeal to the Gooding County Commission for the Gooding County Planning and Zoning Commission issuance of CAFO siting permit No. G99-183. The commissions [sic] written Findings of Facts and Conclusions of Law were entered on June 14, 1999.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The petition alleged that the \u201cAppellants\u201d had exhausted all available administrative remedies and are entitled to appeal under Idaho Code \u00a7 67-5271<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that venue was proper. It then alleged, \u201cThis appeal and petition for judicial review is taken upon issues of fact and law.\u201d The petition eon-eluded with a list of eleven \u201cissues on appeal which appellants intend to assert.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b244-18\">The district court initially interpreted this case as being solely a petition for judicial review. After the district court issued its \u201cMemorandum Decision on Appeal\u201d voiding Ordinance 66, the Gooding County parties pointed out in their petition for rehearing that the district court had no authority to invalidate the ordinance on a petition for judicial review. Only then did the district court find that the petition also included a claim for declaratory relief. The petition listed as an issue on appeal, \u201cWhether the Gooding County CAFO Ordinance is valid and enforceable as adopted.\u201d Because that issue could not be resolved in a petition for judicial review, the district court held that Mr. and Mrs. Scott and Mr. Cogger must have intended the inclusion of the issue to constitute a claim for declaratory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-19\">There is nothing in the record below indicating that they intended their petition for judicial review to include a claim for declaratory relief. In fact, they attempted to withdraw from their appeal the issue of the validity of the ordinance. They likewise have not participated in this appeal from the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>court\u2019s judgment declaring the ordinance void. The petition filed by Mr. and Mrs. Scott and Mr. Cogger was, on its face, clearly a petition for judicial review challenging the issuance of the CAFO siting permit, and it was clearly intended by them to be a petition for judicial review. The district court did not have authority to rule upon the validity of Ordinance 66. <em>Burt v. City of Idaho Falls, </em>105 Idaho 65, 665 P.2d 1075 (1983). Therefore, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">B. Are the Gooding County parties judicially estopped from challenging the judgment of the district court?</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Mr. Bettencourt argues on appeal that the Gooding County parties are judicially estopped from challenging the judgment of the district court. He contends that after the district court\u2019s decision in this case, Gooding County stipulated that \u201cthe <em>Wybenga </em>case\u201d should be dismissed with prejudice on the ground that Ordinance 66 was void. There is nothing in the record identifying \u201cthe <em>Wybenga </em>case.\u201d There is presently pending on appeal before this Court the case of <em>Gooding County v. Wybenga, </em>but the <em>Wybenga </em>case to which Mr. Bettencourt refers is apparently a different case. The case pending on appeal was not dismissed by stipulation. The Gooding County parties refer in their reply brief to <em>\u201cWybenga </em>/\u201d and <em>\u201cWybenga </em>II.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> There is simply no factual record upon which to base the claim of judicial estoppel. Therefore, we will not consider that issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b245-9\">We vacate the judgment of the district court because the validity of Ordinance 66 could not be determined in a petition for judicial review. We do not consider the issue of judicial estoppel raised on appeal. We award costs on appeal to the Gooding County parties.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-10\">Chief Justice TROUT, and Justices SCHROEDER, WALTERS and KIDWELL concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b243-7\">.
