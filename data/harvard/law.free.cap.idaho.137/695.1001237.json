FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">Sanders Orchard desires to sell for residential development approximately 131 acres of its real property located near the city of Emmett in Gem County, Idaho. Under the Gem County Comprehensive Plan, that property was designated as Agricultural/Natural Resources, which only permitted limited residential development. On April 1, 1997, Sanders Orchard initiated proceedings to change the Comprehensive Plan designation with respect to that property from Agricultural/Natural Resources to Urban Residential, which would permit residential development. On May 4, 1998, the Gem County Board of Commissioners (Board) approved the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Sanders Orchard then instituted proceedings to change the zoning classification of the property from A-4 Agricultural Residential, which requires a five-acre minimum lot size, to B-l Residential, which requires a one-half acre minimum lot size. On September 14, 1998, the Gem County Planning and Zoning Commission recommended that the rezone be denied. Sanders Orchard appealed that decision to the Board, who approved the zoning change on November 9,1998. When approving the change, the Board included a requirement that any subdivision developed on the property must have a minimum lot size of one acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">On August 21, 1998, while the rezoning proceedings were pending, Properties West, Inc., submitted for approval a subdivision application and preliminary plat. It sought to subdivide approximately 62 acres of the Sanders Orchard property into a 46 lot subdivision that had minimum lot sizes of one acre. The application indicated that the lots would each have their own water and sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">Under the Gem County Subdivision Ordinance, a request to approve a preliminary plat for a subdivision is first heard by the Planning and Zoning Commission. A party aggrieved by the decision of the Commission can then appeal to the Board who, after a public hearing and considering any additional information, can uphold, conditionally uphold, or overrule the decision of the Planning and Zoning Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-11\">On November 9, 1998, the Planning and Zoning Commission held a public hearing on the application for the preliminary plat. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Commission denied the application because, \u201cThe Preliminary Plat did not have a proposal for central water and sewer system as required by the Gem County Zoning Ordinance.\u201d Sanders Orchard and Properties West, Inc., then appealed that denial to the Board, who heard the appeal on December 7,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-12\">By order issued on February 1, 1999, the Board upheld the action of the Planning and Zoning Commission denying approval of the preliminary subdivision plat. In doing so, it concluded, \u201c[I]t is reasonable and consistent with the Gem County Zoning Ordinance to require central water and sewer systems in this application given the close proximity of the subdivision to the City of Emmett and the future development of residential subdivisions in that area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-13\">On March 1, 1999, Sanders Orchard filed this action seeking judicial review of the Board\u2019s action denying approval for the preliminary subdivision plat. The district court determined that the Board exceeded its statutory authority in requiring that the subdivision have central water and sewer and that the Board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law were not supported by substantial evidence considering the record as a whole. The district court set aside the Board\u2019s order issued on February 1, 1999, and awarded Sanders Orchard costs and attorney fees pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117. Gem County then filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-14\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b733-15\">A person aggrieved by a planning and zoning decision may seek judicial review of that decision under the Idaho Administrative Procedures Act (IAPA). IDAHO CODE \u00a7 67-6521(d) (2001). On an appeal from a decision of a district court acting in its appellate capacity under the IAPA, this Court reviews the agency record independently of the district court\u2019s decision. <em>Price v. Payette County Board of County Commissioners, </em>131 Idaho 426, 958 P.2d 583 (1998). This</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Court does not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence presented. <em>Id.; </em>IDAHO CODE \u00a7 67-5279(1) (2001). Rather, this Court defers to the agency\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. Price <em>v. Payette County Board of County Commissioners, </em>131 Idaho 426, 958 P.2d 583 (1998). There is a strong presumption of favoring the validity of the actions of zoning boards, which includes the application and interpretation of their own zoning ordinances. <em>Rural Kootenai Org., Inc. v. Board of Commissioners, </em>133 Idaho 833, 993 P.2d 596 (1999). The Board\u2019s zoning decision may be overturned only where it: (a) violates statutory or constitutional provisions; (b) exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority; (c) was made upon unlawful procedure; (d) is not supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole; or (e) is arbitrary, capricious, or an abuse of discretion. <em>Price v. Payette County Board of County Commissioners, </em>131 Idaho 426, 958 P.2d 583 (1998); IDAHO CODE \u00a7 67-5279(3) (2001). In addition, the Board\u2019s zoning decision must be upheld if substantial rights of the appellant have not been prejudiced. <em>Payette River Prop. Owners Ass\u2019n v. Board of Commissioners, </em>132 Idaho 551, 976 P.2d 477 (1999); IDAHO CODE \u00a7 67-5279(4) (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">a. Did the Board have discretion to require that there be a proposal for central water and sewer submitted in connection with the preliminary subdivision plat?</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">The real property at issue is zoned B-l Residential. The zoning ordinance describes that zone as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-15\">The purpose of this zone is to provide and protect residential lands properly located for families who desire to live in an environment of single family dwellings. Because of the smaller lot sizes permitted, this zone shall be confined to those areas which can be served by central water, and which may in the future reach densities of development which can be served by central sewage systems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-16\">The zoning ordinance also provides a schedule of minimum lot sizes within the various zones. The minimum lot size for each dwelling unit in the B-1 zone is1/2 acre, but that lot size \u201c[m]ay be reduced if on central water and sewer.\u201d Sanders Orchard argues that because the zoning ordinance does not expressly require central water and sewer facilities in the B-1 zone, the Board had no authority to impose that requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-17\">Idaho Code \u00a7 67-6519<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> grants the governing board of the county the discretion to grant or deny an application for a permit authorized or mandated by the Local Land Use Planning Act, Idaho Code \u00a7\u00a7 67-6501 <em>et seq. McCuskey v. Canyon County, </em>123 Idaho 657, 851 P.2d 953 (1993). <em>See also Brown v. Schafer, </em>96 Idaho 599, 532 P.2d 941 (1975) (holding that the decision of county commissioners approving a subdivision is reviewed under abuse of discretion standard). That discretion is not unbounded, however. <em>Urrutia v. Blaine County, </em>134 Idaho 353, 2 P.3d 738 (2000). The Gem County Subdivision Ordinance lists several factors that the Board is to consider when deciding whether or not to approve a preliminary plat.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those fac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>tors include, \u201cThe conformance of the subdivision with the Comprehensive Plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">The Subdivision Ordinance\u2019s requirement that the Board consider the \u201cconformance of the subdivision with the Comprehensive Plan\u201d does not incorporate by reference all of the provisions of the Comprehensive Plan into the Subdivision Ordinance. <em>Id. </em>When exercising discretion to approve or deny a subdivision application, the governing board can consider whether the application is consistent with the overall goals of the comprehensive plan. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 2 P.3d at 744 (\u201c[T]he Board erred in relying completely on the comprehensive plan in denying the applications, and should instead have crafted its findings of fact and conclusions of law to demonstrate that the goals of the comprehensive plan were considered, but were simply used in conjunction with the zoning ordinances, the subdivision ordinance and any other applicable ordinances in evaluating the proposed developments.\u201d); <em>South Fork Coalition v. Board of Commissioners, </em>117 Idaho 857, 863-64, 792 P.2d 882, 888-89 (1990) (\u201cThe Board of County Commissioners\u2019 Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Decision, demonstrates careful consideration of the requirements of ordinance \u00a7 1-2520 as well as a factual inquiry into whether or not the proposal was in accordance with the Bonneville County Comprehensive Plan. The Board\u2019s conclusion should be reversed only if found to be arbitrary and capricious.\u201d) The governing board cannot, however, deny a use that is specifically permitted by the zoning ordinance on the ground that such use would conflict with the comprehensive plan. <em>Urrutia v. Blaine County, </em>134 Idaho 353, 359, 2 P.3d 738, 744 (2000). \u201cA comprehensive plan reflects the \u2018desirable goals and objectives, or desirable future situations\u2019 for the land within a jurisdiction\u201d, <em>Id. </em>at 357, 2 P.3d at 742, but it does not operate as a legally controlling zoning law. <em>Id. </em>If there is a conflict between the comprehensive plan and a use permitted under the zoning ordinance, the zoning ordinance controls. <em>Urrutia v. Blaine County, </em>134 Idaho 353, 2 P.3d 738 (2000); <em>Bone v. City of Lewiston, </em>107 Idaho 844, 693 P.2d 1046 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-20\">The land upon which Sanders Orchard desires to construct the subdivision is within the City of Emmett area of impact. The Gem County Comprehensive Plan contains many references to the need to protect ground water resources and the desirability of central sewer in the area of city impact.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>The requirement that Sanders Orchard have a proposal for central water and sewer system in connection with the proposed subdivision is consistent with the requirements of the Gem County Comprehensive Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Sanders Orchard contends that the Board could not rely upon the Gem County Comprehensive Plan to require a proposal for central water and sewer because that requirement conflicts with the Gem County Zoning Ordinance. Sanders Orchard relies upon the Official Height and Area Regulations in the Zoning Ordinance which provide that in a B-l zone the minimum one-half acre lot size \u201c[m]ay be reduced if on central water and sewer.\u201d It argues that by implication, the Zoning Ordinance permits individual wells and septic systems on all lots that are greater than one-half acre in size.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-18\">The Board construed this provision as only regulating lot sizes, not as specifying the circumstances under which central water and sewer was or could be required. It permits lot sizes below the one-half acre minimum in B-1 zones if the lots are on central water and sewer but it was not intended to provide that no central water or sewer could be required in B-1 zones if the lot sizes were above one-half acre. This Court defers to the Board\u2019s application and interpretation of its Zoning Ordinance, unless such application or interpretation is capricious, arbitrary or discriminatory. <em>Rural Kootenai Org., Inc. v. Board of Commission</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>ers, </em>133 Idaho 833, 993 P.2d 596 (1999). The Board\u2019s interpretation of this provision is neither capricious, arbitrary, nor discriminatory, and is consistent with the wording of the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The portion of the Zoning Ordinance at issue is a chart entitled \u201cOfficial Height and Area Regulations.\u201d For each of the fourteen zones listed, it states the maximum permissible building height; the minimum yard setback requirements for the front, rear, interi- or, and street side yards; the maximum lot coverage; the minimum lot area per dwelling unit; and the minimum lot width. The minimum lot sizes are 40 acres for dwellings in A and A-1 zones, five acres for dwellings in A 2 through A-5 zones, and one-half acre for dwellings in the eight remaining zones. The chart does not purport to specify whether or not central water or sewer would be required in any particular zone. For each of the eight zones that have a minimum lot area requirement of one-half acre, a footnote states that the minimum lot area requirement \u201c[m]ay be reduced if on central water and sewer.\u201d Thus, the \u201cOfficial Height and Area Regulations\u201d chart does not purport to specify when central water and sewer are or could be required. It does not, by its terms, specifically permit private wells and septic systems on all lots in B-l zones that were greater than one-half acre in size.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">The Zoning Ordinance provides that the B-1 zone is \u201cconfined to those areas which can be served by central water.\u201d Although this provision does not mandate central water for all residences in the B-1 zone, it would be meaningless if the Board did not have the discretion to require central water. There would be no reason to limit B-l zones to areas that can be served by central water if central water could not be required. The Ordinance also provides that the B-1 zone is \u201cconfined to those areas ... which may in the future reach densities of development which can be served by central sewage systems.\u201d Again, this provision would be meaningless unless central sewer could be required in B-l zones for subdivisions in which the planned housing density is great enough that it can be served by central sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">b. Was the decision of the Board supported by substantial evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">The Southwest District Health Department recommended in writing that the proposed subdivision be served with a public water system. It stated that due to concern of possible ground water contamination from improperly constructed wells, its policy is to recommend a public water system for all developments with more than nine lots. The engineering report obtained by Gem County also recommended that any approval of the subdivision application should be based upon a submittal that includes approved plans for a central water supply system, both for protection of the aquifer and for adequate fire protection. Because the B-l zone is limited to those areas that can be served by central water and Sanders Orchard successfully petitioned to have this property rezoned to the B-l classification, there did not need to be evidence that the subdivision could be served by central water. The Gem County Soil and Water Conservation District recommended in writing that the subdivision be placed on city sewer or a central sewer system because of its concern that septic tanks in a subdivision of that density would adversely effect ground water quality. The Board did not make any finding regarding the concerns expressed by the Conservation District, or whether the housing density was great enough that the subdivision could be served by central sewer.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">The Board listed seven findings of fact to support its decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Sanders Or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>chard challenges finding number seven as not being supported by the evidence. That finding stated, \u201cThe proposed subdivision is in an area of increasing residential development close to the City of Emmett and it is projected that development of central sewer system and water lines will be extended to that area in the reasonably near future.\u201d There was nothing submitted in writing to the Board indicating that central sewer and water lines will be extended to that area in the reasonably near future, or ever. Likewise, no oral testimony was presented on that issue at the hearing before the Board held on December 7, 1998.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This finding is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">c. Have substantial rights of Sanders Orchard been prejudiced by the Board\u2019s action?</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Considering the brevity of the Board\u2019s findings of fact, finding of fact number seven was obviously important to its decision. In one of its conclusions of law, the Board mentions \u201cthe close proximity of the subdivision to the City of Emmett and the future development of residential subdivisions in that area.\u201d That conclusion of law was apparently based upon the factual finding that \u201cit is projected that development of central sewer system and water lines will be extended to that area in the reasonably near future.\u201d Therefore, this factual finding was material to the Board\u2019s decision. Because no evidence was presented to the Board on this issue, nor were any findings on this issue made by the Planning and Zoning Commission, Sanders Orchard had no notice that the Board may base its decision upon the issue of when the City of Emmett would extend city water and sewer to the subdivision. As a result, substantial rights of Sanders Orchard have been prejudiced by the Board\u2019s action in basing its decision on an issue upon which no evidence was presented.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, the decision of the Board must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>d. Did the district court err in awarding attorney fees to Sanders Orchard?</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">The district court awarded attorney fees to Sanders Orchard pursuant to Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">Unless otherwise provided by statute, in any administrative or civil judicial proceeding involving as adverse parties a state agency, a city, a county or other taxing district and a person, the court shall award the prevailing party reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, witness fees and reasonable expenses, if the court finds that the party against whom the judgment is rendered acted without a reasonable basis in fact or law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aia\">In this case, the Board\u2019s decision hinged upon its finding that \u201cit is projected that development of central sewer system and water lines will be extended to that area in the reasonably near future.\u201d The Board has not pointed to any evidence it considered that would support that finding. Therefore, by basing its decision upon this finding, the Board acted without a reasonable basis in fact. The district court\u2019s award of attorney fees to Sanders Orchard is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">e. Is Sanders Orchard entitled to an award of attorney fees on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Sanders Orchard also requests attorney fees on appeal under Idaho Code \u00a7 12-117(1). In its decision, the district court reasoned that when the description of the B-1 zone was read in conjunction with the \u201cOfficial Height and Area Regulations\u201d chart, central water or sewer could not be required on lots in B-l zones that were greater than one-half acre in size. We do not agree with that portion of the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance. The Board\u2019s interpretation of the \u201cOfficial Height and Area Regulations\u201d chart, which we uphold, is that the chart does not purport to specify when central water and sewer are or could be required. It does not, by its terms, specifically permit private wells and septic systems on all lots in B-1 zones that were greater than one-half acre in size. Therefore, as we stated above, the Zoning Ordinance grants the Board the discretion to require central water in B-1 zones and to require central sewer in B-1 zones if the density of the proposed development would be high enough that it can be served with central sewer. Because we do not agree entirely with the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Zoning Ordinance, the Board acted with a reasonable basis in law in appealing the district court\u2019s decision. We therefore do not award attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b739-13\">We vacate the decision of the Board and remand this ease for further proceedings consistent with this decision. We affirm the district court\u2019s award of attorney fees, but we do not award costs or attorney fees on appeal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b739-14\">Chief Justice TROUT, and Justices WALTERS, KIDWELL, and Justice Pro Tern SCHILLING CONCUR.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b734-8\">.

There were three public hearings held in connection with the request for preliminary plat approval. Sanders Orchard was represented at all three hearings. The first hearing was held on November 2, 1998, before the Technical Review Committee. During that hearing, several persons, who are not identified in tire record, expressed their opinions as to when the city would extend sewer lines to this subdivision. Those opinions ranged from within one year, to within five years, to not within the foreseeable future. The technical review committee did not make any findings in that regard, and merely concluded that the sewer system would be determined at the public hearing scheduled for November 9, 1998. The second hearing was held on November 9, 1998, before the Gem County Planning and Zoning Commission. A person, who was not identified in the record, stated, \"But I do think they need to install dry lines because my feelings are in less than five years, sewer will be there.\u2019\u2019 This person may have been referring to a prior statement by Mr. Gary Lee, an engineer representing Sanders Orchard. During the public hearing held on September 14, 1998, before the Gem County Planning and Zoning Commission in connection with the request to rezone the property, Mr. Lee stated that if city sewer was going to be extended to the property within five years, it might make sense to install drylines (sewer lines that could be later connected to the city sewer system) in addition to septic tanks. At the conclusion of the hearing on November 9, 1998, however, the Planning and Zoning Commission did not make any finding of fact as to when city sewer would be extended to the property. The third hearing was the appeal to the Board held on December 7, 1998. During that hearing, Mr. Lee stated that the property can be served by central water and sewer in the future, but nobody knows when that will be. No other testimony on that issue was presented. When rendering its decision, the Board stated that its findings of fact were based upon the testimony taken at the hearing held on December 7, 1998, and the file. Because the testimony given at the prior hearings had not yet been transcribed, those transcripts would not have been in the file and could not have been reviewed by the Board. There is no indication that the Board listened to any tape recordings of the prior hearings before reaching its decision. Thus, there is nothing to indicate that the Board considered any oral testimony given during the earlier hearings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b738-12\">.
