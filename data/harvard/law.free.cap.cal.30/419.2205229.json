At the time the agreement was made, and afterwards, it was mutually understood between the parties that if the plaintiff was not able to pay the first instalment when it became due, he should have an extension of time for another year, by paying one hundred and twenty dollars when the first instalment fell due. The plaintiff did not pay the first instalment, nor the one hundred and twenty dollars, but remained in possession of the land, cutting the hay growing upon the land, and leasing portions of it. On the 30th of May, 1864, Clarke served on plaintiff written notice to quit the premises. The defendant Clarke then procured an execution to be issued upon his judgment for possession, and on the 13th of June, 1864, the Sheriff executed it by dispossessing plaintiff and putting defendant Clarke in possession. The other defendants were tenants of Clarke. On the 23d of November, 1865, the plaintiff commenced this action for a specific performance of the contract, and to be restored to the possession of the premises, and for an account to be taken of the value of personal property alleged to have been taken possession of by defendant when he was placed in possession of the land, and for judgment'for the value of the same. The defendant recovered judgment, and the plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b426-7\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b426-8\"><em>Wallace, Patterson &amp; Stow, </em>for Appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5t\">argued that there were admissions in the pleading which, taken in connection with the facts, entitled them to a specific performance. They also argued that the Court erred in dismissing the bill absolutely, even though no specific performance should have been decreed, as plaintiff was entitled to a judgment restoring him to the possession, and for damages; and as the damages were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>consistent with the case made by the complaint and embraced within the issue, and this was the rule in equity, unless the objection was distinctly made by the defendant that the damages were cognizable at law only; and cited Practice Act, Sec. 147; <em>Marquat </em>v. <em>Marquat, 2 </em>Kernan, 341; <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Gorham, </em>3 Smith, 247; <em>Le Roy </em>v. <em>Platt, </em>4 Paige, 77; and <em>Wiswall </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>3 Paige, 313.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b427-6\"><em>Elisha Cook </em>for Respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALK\">argued that plaintiff\u2019s right to damages depended on whether he had performed his part of the contract so as to entitle him to a specific performance, and that having failed to perform, the parties were left in the same position with reference to the land and crops that they occupied when the contract was entered into, arid that Courts of equity had no jurisdiction of matters properly cognizable in a Court of law except where the principal relief prayed for was on the equity side and the legal matters were incidental, and that in this case the Court of equity having denied the relief in equity, it had no jurisdiction over the question of damages, and cited <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Piatti et als., 27 </em>Cal. 451.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b427-7\">By the Court, Shafter, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">Bill for specific performance. Clarke bound himself by a written agreement, dated June 18th, 1863, to convey to the plaintiff an undivided half of certain lands situate in the County of Santa Clara, for the sum of six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars\u2014five hundred dollars whereof was to be paid on the 1st day of September, 1863, and the balance in five equal annual instalments, payable respectively on the 1st day of September of each year thereafter, with interest at ten per cent per annum, payable annually. Clarke also agreed to convey the other moiety of the premises to plaintiff so soon as it should be judicially determined that he was the owner thereof, for two thousand two hundred and fifty dollars, in four equal annual instalments, payable respectively, in one, two, three and four years from the date of such decision. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>The cause was tried <em>by </em>the Court. Findings and judgment for the defendant. The appeal is from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">First\u2014We do not consider that there are any admissions in the answer entitling the plaintiff to a reversal of the judgment. No defect in the findings can be relied on as a ground of reversal, for no exception was taken to them under the Act of 1861. On the facts as found and stated affirmatively there can be no question as to the correctness of the judgment. Not only had the plaintiff failed at the commencement of the action to pay the first instalment due on the contract and without justification or excuse, but by the very terms of the contract the defendant was not bound to convey until all the instalments should be paid with accruing interest and taxes and the last instalment would pot become due until September, 1868.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Nor on the facts is the plaintiff entitled to be restored to the possession. The right of possession is not in him. He was turned out under an execution issued on the judgment recovered in the action of ejectment brought by Clarke against him prior to the contract to convey, and Clarke was put in possession by the officer; nor is there anything disclosed in this record showing that the relations of the parties to each other and to the lands have been changed since that time in any legal particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Second\u2014The plaintiff failing to maintain his claim to specific relief on the findings insists that he is at least entitled to compensation in damages for certain personal property on the premises which the defendant converted to his own use.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">It may well be questioned whether damages for the alleged conversion could be awarded in this proceeding, inasmuch as the title of the plaintiff to the principal relief prayed for has failed. (2 Sto. Eq., Chap. 3 9.) But passing the point as one not necessary to be decided here, it is sufficient to say that on the face of the findings the plaintiff has sustained no appreciable damage. It is found that the hay grown upon the premises in 3.864, and alleged to have been converted, was worth twenty dollars per ton, but there is no finding of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>amount so grown. As there was no exception taken to the findings as defective, it must be presumed that there was an entire failure of evidence on the question of the amount of hay converted, or if evidence was given on that point, then that the amount was so inconsiderable as to fall within the rule <em>de minimis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
