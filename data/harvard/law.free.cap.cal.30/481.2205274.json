Fett, one of the defendants, purchased the Uncle Sam Claims from Benfeldt, and received a deed duly acknowledged from Benfeldt, dated January 3d, 1866. The other defendants were Fett\u2019s hired hands. When Fett purchased he went into possession of the entire claim. Holler and Hoffman had been working in the claims with Benfeldt up to the time of Fett\u2019s purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-9\">After the testimony of plaintiff had closed, defendants moved for a nonsuit, because, among other reasons, if plaintiffs had any interests in the mine they were several and acquired at different times, and they could not maintain an action jointly to recover them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-10\">The Court denied the mdtion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-11\">The mine was worked through a tunnel several hundred feet in length, extending into the side of a mountain, and the gold bearing earth was obtained by drifting the gravel to the height of five or six feet above the bed rock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-12\">Plaintiffs, in making out their case, proved the amount of gold defendant had taken out of the claims, and claimed as damages seven twelfths of its value. Defendants offered to prove by a witness, in order to reduce damages, what was the expense, of digging the gravel and transporting it to the mouth of the tunnel, where it was washed. The Court, on objection of plaintiff, rejected the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-13\">The Court instructed the jury that,- if the jury believed from the testimony that Benfeldt owned the Uncle Sam mining ground, and while he owned and possessed the same he made a verbal sale of interests therein to plaintiffs, then if plaintiffs entered into possession under the verbal sale, such verbal sale was as valid and effective to convey title as a written bill of sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b486-14\">The defendants\u2019 attorney excepted to the charge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Plaintiffs recovered judgment for the possession of the seven twelfths of the claim, and for the value of seven twelfths of the gold dust taken out, as damages. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b487-6\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-7\"><em>Charles A. Tuttle, </em>for Appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Abr\">argued that plaintiffs acquired no title by their purchase, because it was not in writing, and mining claims were real estate; and cited <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Judd, </em>14 Cal. 64; <em>Watts </em>v. <em>White, </em>13 Cal. 334; and <em>Leigh Co. </em>v. <em>Independent Co., </em>8. Cal. 323. He argued that the plaintiffs confessed that the property in dispute was realty by the form of action they had chosen, and by describing in their complaint a tract of land and averring prior possession. He also argued that property in minerals, unsevered from the land, was in the owner of the fee, and that an estate in minerals was an estate in land ; and cited Collyer on Mines, Marg. 2-4.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b487-8\">He contended also that the Statute of Frauds did not permit any legal interest in a mine to be sold, except by instrument in writing, and cited Collyer on Mines, Marg. 7-9, and that the Act of 1860, allowing conveyances of mining claims to be evidenced by bills of sale in writing, could not be construed as permitting verbal conveyances, but only authorized written conveyances in a particular mode.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b487-9\"><em>Jo Hamilton, </em>for Respondents,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ANG\">argued that plaintiffs were not improperly joined ; and cited Laws 1857, p. 62 ; and <em>Touchard </em>v. <em>Keyes, </em>21 Cal. 208. He admitted that if respondent could not acquire title by verbal purchase that the Court erred in its instruction, but contended that a verbal sale, accompanied with a delivery of possession, conveyed a good title to a mining claim; and cited <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Feather R. W. and M. Co. </em>14 Cal. 18; <em>Table Mountain Tunnel Co. </em>v. <em>Stranahan, </em>20 Cal. 208. He argued that the vendor only had a possessory interest in the claim, and if a transfer in writing was requisite to pass title the vendor should hold a higher character of title than mere possession. He argued that where the vendor merely went out and the vendee went into possession, no conveyance was necessary, and that the Act of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>1860 only referred to such sales as the parties chose to have evidenced by conveyance in writing.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b488-6\">By the Court, Shafter, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The plaintiffs sue to recover the possession of certain mining ground, of which they claim to be the owners to the extent of seven twelfths. The allegations of the complaint are denied in the answer, and the defendants plead specially, title in defendant Fett and a misjoinder of parties plaintiff. The plaintiffs recovered a verdict at the trial, on which judgment was duly entered for seven twelfths of the premises undivided. The appeal is from the j udgment and from the order denying defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">Both parties claim under Benfeldt\u2014the defendant Fett by a written conveyance, in due form, executed January 3d, 1866, and including the whole of the property; the plaintiffs by verbal sales and transfers of possession previously made\u2014the sale to Goller being of four twelfths, made in April, 1865; that to Hoffman being of three twelfths, made in August of the same year.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">First\u2014Assuming the sales and transfers by Benfeldt to the plaintiffs respectively, they became thereby tenants in common of the mine, and as such were authorized to sue jointly under the Act of 1857. (Acts 1857, p. 62; <em>Touchard </em>v. <em>Keyes, 21 </em>Cal. 208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">Second\u2014The legal title to the seven twelfths claimed by the plaintiffs did not pass to them by the verbal sales and transfers of 1865. The point arises under the Act of 1860. (Acts 1860, p. 175.) It was considered <em>arguendo </em>in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Keystone Mining Company, ante, </em>360, that the provision that \u201c conveyances of mining claims may be evidenced by bills of sale or instruments in writing not under seal,\u201d contained in the first section of the Act, was mandatory, and that it was' intended that that method of conveying mining claims should exclude conveyances by parol, even though accompanied by a delivery of possession. The point, however, was not directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>adjudged in the case referred to, but it is now determined in conformity with the views therein expressed. The Court below, in opposition to this view of the effect of the Act of 1860, instructed the jury that if they found a verbal sale by Benfeldt to the plaintiffs respectively, accompanied by delivery of possession, that such verbal sales \u201c would be as valid and effective to convey title as written bills of sale.\u201d This instruction was erroneous, and for anything we can know to the contrary, the jury may have based their verdict upon it, without refei\u2019ence to other instructions, presenting to the jury an alternative ground, on which, if found, the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover. We cannot, therefore, intend that the jury ever put their minds upon the question as to whether Fett bought in 1866, with notice of the equitable right of the plaintiffs which their entry and possession had perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Third\u2014The Court erred also in refusing to permit defendants to prove the expense of digging the gold bearing earth. The point was directly adjudged in <em>Maye </em>v. <em>Tappen, </em>23 Cal. 306.)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b489-8\">Sawyer, J., concurring specially.</author>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">I concur in the judgment on the last ground discussed in the opinion of Mr. Justice Shatter, but I am compelled to dissent from the views expressed under the second point discussed. The construction adopted would, upon the same principles, render a conveyance of a mining claim under seal void, as well as a parol sale accompanied by a transfer of the possession to the vendee. I can gather from the language of the Act no intention on the part of the Legislature to abrogate any mode of conveyance before established. It seems to me that the only object of this particular provision was to remove a doubt before entertained by many as to whether a written conveyance of a mining claim required a seal to render it valid. I cannot think it was contemplated that a conveyance of a mining claim should be restricted to the form of conveyance permitted by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Mr. Justice Sanderson expressed no opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
