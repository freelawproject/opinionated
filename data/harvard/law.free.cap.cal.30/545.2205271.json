Drake, </em>for Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Au0\">argued that the fourth section of the Constitution, as amended, only gave the right of appeal affirmatively where the amount in controversy amounted to three hundred dollars, but did not prevent the Legislature from providing for an appeal in other cases, and that at the time this appeal was taken (August 28th, 1865,) section three hundred and fifty-nine of the Practice Act allowed appeals in all cases where \"the amount in controversy exceeded two hundred dollars. He also argued that the amount in dispute here was over three hundred dollars, as the set-off pleaded exceeded three hundred dollars. He cited <em>People </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>9 Cal. 89.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b550-6\"><em>W.C. Burnett, </em>for Respondent,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG\">argued that the Legislature had no power to give appeals in cases where the, amount in controversy was less than three hundred dollars, and that the Court below had no power to have taken into consideration the counterclaim, as it exceeded its jurisdiction; and cited Practice Act, Sec. 574; and <em>Malson </em>v. <em>Vaughn, </em>23 Cal. 61.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b550-7\">By the Court, Sanderson, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">This Court has no jurisdiction in this case. The amount sued for was only two hundred and ninety-eight dollars. The appellate jurisdiction of this Court is fixed by the Constitution, and in this class of cases is limited to such as involve the sum of three hundred dollars, exclusive of interest, and it is not in the power of the Legislature to confer jurisdiction in cases where the demand, exclusive of interest, is less. The <em>ad da/nmum </em>clause in the complaint is the test of jurisdiction, and the costs of the action constitute no part of the amount in controversy. This question is unaffected by the fact that the defendant sets up a counterclaim in excess of three hundred dollars. He had no legal right to do so. He could set up only such a counterclaim as he could have sued upon in a Justice\u2019s Court. (Prac. Act, Sec. 574.)</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
