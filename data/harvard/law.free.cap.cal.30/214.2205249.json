If wrong, it can only be made so by its application to the facts of the case.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b219-8\">Verdict of Jury in case of Assault with Deadly Weapon.\u2014On a trial for assault with intent to commit murder, a verdict of the jury finding the defendant \" guilty of an assault with a deadly weapon with intent to inflict a bodily injury\u201d is sufficient to sustain a judgment subjecting the accused to confinement in the State Prison.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b219-9\">Verdict of Guilty of an Offense not Charged in Indictment.\u2014If the defendant is convicted of an offense of a lesser grade than that for which he was indicted, and the lesser offense is included in the greater, the verdict is followed hy the same judgment as though the defendant had been indicted for the offense of which he was convicted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b219-10\">Appeal from the County Court, Solano County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-11\">The indictment was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-12\">\u201c The said Charles English is accused by the grand jury of the County of Solano, by this indictment, of the crime of an assault with an intent to commit murder, committed as follows: The said Charles English, on the 6th day of September, 1865, at the County of Solano, with a certain pistol loaded with powder and ball, which he, the said Charles English, in his left hand then and there had and held in and upon one Warren Perry Derbin, feloniously did make an assault with an intent him, the said Warren Perry Derbin, feloniously, wilfully, and of his malice aforethought, to kill and murder, and other wrongs to the said Warren Perry Derbin, then and there did, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the people of the State of California.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-13\">The Court sentenced the defendant to imprisonment in the State Prison for the tenn of two years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-14\">The other facts are stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>M. A. Wheaton, </em>for Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apt\">argued that an assault was a legal conclusion drawn from certain facts, which facts should be stated in the indictment; and that the indictment was fatally defective in not stating those facts, and referred to Criminal Practice Act, Secs. 235-239, 246 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Aro, </em>6 Cal. 209 ; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Shuler, </em>28 Cal. 490. He also argued that as the indictment charged only an assault with intent to commit murder, and the verdiet did not find that the circumstances of the assault showed an abandoned and malignant heart, or that no considerable provocation appeared, the Court should have adjudged the defendant guilty of a simple assault only.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b220-6\"><em>J. G. McCullough, Attorney-General, </em>for the People,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AA8\">argued that the indictment was sufficient, as it followed the words of the Act creating the offense, and cited 1 Hittell\u2019s Digest, Art. 1,452 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>King, </em>27 Cal. <em>509; </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ah Woo, </em>28 Cal. 205. He also argued that the verdict showed that the defendant was convicted under the second subdivision of section fifty of the Act concerning crimes and punishments, and that the defendant might be convicted of this offense under the-indictment, and cited 1 Hittell\u2019s Dig., Art. 2,011; <em>People </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>5 Cal. 134; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanard, </em>6 Cal. 562.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b220-7\">By the Court, Shafter, J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">The indictment charges in substance that the defendant feloniously assaulted one Derbin with a pistol loaded with powder and ball, with intent him, the said Derbin, of his malice aforethought, to kill and murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">First\u2014The demurrer to the indictment was properly overruled. The indictment contains all the terms that enter into the description of the offense as given in the statute, together with allegations relating to the character of the weapon used. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>25 Cal. 531.)</p>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">Second\u2014After the jury had retired to deliberate upon their verdict they returned into Court and asked \u201cto be informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>whether or not the assault made by Derbin on English outside of the door should be considered by them.\u201d To this the Court replied in effect that it could not assume that any such assault was made, and that the question of fact was with them; and they were further told that \u201c the acts of the defendant subsequent to the assault alleged could not be considered by them except so far as they tended to establish the theory that the defendant acted in self defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The Court was right in both branches of its response. Clearly so as to the first, and as to the last, right by presumption, for the contrary does not appear. The testimony is not in the record, and if the instruction was erroneous the point could be established in no other way than by the production of the evidence. It cannot be claimed that the instruction violates any legal principle in the abstract. The suggestion that the instruction is erroneous for the reason that it virtually forbids the jury, in passing upon the question of intent, to consider the subsequent acts of the defendant, is not tenable. The difficulty is in seeing how the subsequent acts of the defendant could have any bearing upon the question of self defense. But if the charge was erroneous in that respect the mistake was in the defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Third\u2014The jury found the defendant \u201c guilty of an assault with a deadly weapon with intent to inflict a bodily injury upon W. P. Derbin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">It is insisted \u201c that the verdict under the indictment amounts only to a conviction of an assault.\u201d We consider the legal effect of the verdict to be commensurate with its terms. The offense for which the defendant was indicted was of a higher grade than that for which he was convicted (1 Hit. Dig., page 239, Section 50 ;) still as the offense of which he was found guilty is included in the crime with which he was charged, the verdict is to be followed by the same consequences that would have attended it had the indictment charged the lesser offense in terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">It is true that the verdict does not state that65 no consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>able provocation appeared,\u201d nor \u201c that the circumstances of the offense show an abandoned and malignant heart;\u201d still averments to that effect are not essential in an indictment, and it follows that a finding on neither point is essential to a verdict subjecting the accused to confinement in the State Prison. It is enough, if it is found that the assault was with a deadly weapon and with intent to inflict bodily injury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nugent, </em>4 Cal. 341; <em>People </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>5 Cal. 134; <em>People </em>v. <em>Vanard, </em>6 Cal. 562.),</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
