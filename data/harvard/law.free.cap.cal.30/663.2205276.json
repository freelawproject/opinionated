It required only twelve thousand dollars of this money to pay the interest on the bonds which fell due July 1st, 1866. The plaintiff was the owner of thirty of the bonds, and claimed that it was the duty of the Treasurer to advertise for proposals for the redemption of bonds with the surplus of the money after paying the July interest. The Treasurer refused to advertise, and claimed the right to transfer the surplus to the Redemption Fund of the county, by virtue of the thirty-eighth section of an Act entitled \u201c an Act providing for the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ment of the County of Sacramento,\u201d approved April 25th, 1863.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b668-6\">The plaintiff applied for a' writ of mandate to compel the Treasurer to advertise for proposals to redeem bonds issued to the railroad company, and to redeem the same if there were any proposals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b668-7\"><em>E. B. Crocker, </em>for Plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-8\">The seventh section of the Act of April 25th, 1863, relating to these bonds, requires that \u201c whenever, <em>at amj time </em>after the payment of or providing for the July interest on said bonds, there shall be in the Railroad Fund a sum of two thousand dollars or upwards remaining after the payment of the interest then due on said bonds, the Treasurer of said city and county <em>shall </em>advertise, etc., for sealed proposals for the redemption of said bonds,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-9\">The requirement in this case is plain and specific. There is no room for doubt as to its meaning.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-10\">But the defendant claims that this plain command is overruled by the terms of the preceding section, and that he is under no obligation to redeem any bonds until 1873.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-11\">Section six provides merely that the Board of Supervisors shall yearly \u201c levy a special tax, to be styled the Railroad Interest Tax, sufficient to raise the amount of interest required to be paid each year on said bonds issued under this Act, and on and after the year 1873, an additional amount sufficient to pay five per cent of the principal of said bonds,\u201d which tax when levied and collected is to be \u201c paid to the County Treasurer, to be kept by him as a special fund to be called the Railroad \"Fund, <em>to be paid out solely in payment of the interest on said bonds and, the redemption of said bonds.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b668-12\">This section, instead of qualifying section seven, confirms it. Instead of conflicting, both are harmonious. The meaning of section six is perfectly plain. There is but <em>one tax </em>and but <em>one fund </em>spoken of.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b669-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number><em>H. H.

The language of that section is too plain to admit of a plausible argument in favor of any other construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">If these moneys could, under any circumstances, be transferred to the Redemption Fund, under the provisions of section thirty-eight of \u201c An Act providing for the government of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>County of Sacramento,\u201d passed April 25th, 1863, it could only take place after all claims against such fund (the \u2018Railroad Fund \u2019) have been paid.\u201d (Laws 1863, p. 515, Sec. 38.) And that could not happen till all bonds presented for redemption, upon a proper advertisement of proposals, in pursuance of section seven of the Railroad Act, had been redeemed as therein required. The transfer of the balance in question to the \u201c Redemption Fund,\u201d provided for in the charter, in the mode shown by the record, is an unauthorized diversion of the moneys from the purposes to which they had been appropriated by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">The applicant, we think, is entitled to his writ. A peremp-' tory mandate is awarded, in pursuance of the prayer of the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
