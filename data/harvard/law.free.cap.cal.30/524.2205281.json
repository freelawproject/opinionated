(Wood\u2019s Dig., p. 697.) These Districts were named respectively One, Two, and Three. In 1862, John Tuohy was elected Supervisor for District Number Two, which then contained the three Townships of Tulare, Dent, and Castoria. His term of office expired in the fall of 1865. The regular meetings of the Board, as fixed by law, were on the first Monday of May, August, November, and February of each year. On the 26th day of August, 1864, the Board of Supervisors made an order changing the number of District Number Two to District Number Three, and annexing to it another township called O\u2019Neal. The general election in this State in 1864 was held on the Tuesday next after the first Monday of November. At the general election held in 1865, John Tuohy and J. F. Chase were voted for for Supervisor. In the three Townships of Tulare, Dent, and Castoria, which constituted the district before the order of 1864, Tuohy received two hundred and twelve votes, and Chase received two hundred and seven votes. In the Township of O\u2019Neal, added to the district in ] 864, Tuohy received one hundred and seventy-one votes, and Chase received two hundred and fifty-nine votes. If the Township of O\u2019Neal constituted a part of the district, Chase was elected; but if not, Tuohy was elected. The Board of Canvassers counted the votes cast in O\u2019Neal Township, and determined that Chase had received four hundred and sixty-six votes, and Tuohy three hundred and eighty-three votes. Tuohy contested the election. The County Court gave judgment in favor of Chase, and Tuohy appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b529-6\"><em>J. B. Hall, </em>for Appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABh\">argued that the power of the Board of Supervisors to enlarge the boundaries of a Supervisor District existed at no other time than at the last session before the general election ; that the Supervisors could only perform such duties as might be prescribed by law; and that if the Legislature authorized a body politic to effect these divisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>their act must be strictly within the letter of authorization in every particular as to time and place. He also argued that a Board of Supervisors held the relation of agents, and had a limited statutory jurisdiction, and the facts to give them jurisdiction must appear on the face of their proceedings; and cited <em>Rosenthal </em>v. <em>Mad.

In this case there is nothing in the nature of the power showing that it might not be exercised as effectually before as at the session named; and as there are no negative words restraining the exercise of the power to that occasion, the provision must be considered as directory to the Board and not as a limitation put upon its authority. <em>(People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>v. <em>Allen, </em>6 Wend. 486 ; <em>People </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>11 Wend. 604; <em>Merchant </em>v. <em>Langworthy, </em>6 Hill, 645 ; <em>Ex parte Heath </em>v. <em>Roome, </em>3 Hill, 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b531-6\">Sawyer, J., concurring specially :</author>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The \u201clast session \u201d mentioned in the Act is the last regular session appointed by law. It has no reference to special sessions called by the Board for some specific purpose. And the \u201c session \u201d includes the entire sittings of the Board from the meeting on the first day of the sittings till the final adjournment, \u201c when all the business before them is disposed of.\u201d I think, therefore, that the boundaries of the Supervisor Districts were changed by the Board \u201c at their last session before the general election \u201d within the meaning of the statute. On this ground I concur in the judgment, but express no opinion upon the other point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
