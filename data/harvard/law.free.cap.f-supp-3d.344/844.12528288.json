For the reasons below, the court\n   <strong>\n    REJECTS\n   </strong>\n   the Magistrate Judge's Report (ECF No. 51) and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Defendant's Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Report sets forth the relevant facts, which this court adopts without a full recitation. (ECF No. 51 at 2-4.) As brief background, during the time relevant to this action, Plaintiff was an inmate at Lieber Correctional Institution (\"Lieber\") in Ridgeville, South Carolina.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 51 at 2.) On September 1, 2005, Plaintiff was convicted of murder and sentenced to life without the possibility of parole. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On March 23, 2016, as a result of several disciplinary violations, Plaintiff was transferred from general population into the Restricted Housing Unit on Short Term Detention Status to await a hearing before the Disciplinary Hearing Officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.) On April 14, 2016, Plaintiff was convicted of the March 23 violations and sanctioned to sixty days (60) in disciplinary detention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) On April 18, 2016, the RHU Institutional Classification Committee (\"ICC\"), which consisted of Defendant and two other members, reviewed the classification of inmates on disciplinary detention to determine whether they should be transferred to security detention. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 22 at 4.) Plaintiff's hearing before the ICC took place on April 18, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff claims he did not receive forty-eight hours notice of this hearing, as mandated by South Carolina Department of Corrections (\"SCDC\") policy, and did not know about the hearing until he arrived at the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 1 at 5-6.) At the conclusion of the hearing, after considering Plaintiff's testimony, disciplinary record, and institutional history, the ICC recommended to Central Classification that Plaintiff be placed in security detention. (ECF No. 51 at 3.) Central Classification adopted the ICC's recommendation and placed Plaintiff in security detention on April 20, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) After\n   unsuccessfully appealing his placement in security detention by filing both Step 1 and Step 2 grievances, Plaintiff, proceeding pro se, commenced the present action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff alleges Defendant violated his due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by failing to provide him notice of the ICC hearing. (ECF No. 1 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 8, 2017, Defendant filed her Answer (ECF No. 14) to Plaintiff's Complaint. On October 10, 2017, Plaintiff replied to Defendant's Answer. (ECF No. 21.) On October 20, 2017, Defendant moved for summary judgment. (ECF No. 22.) The Magistrate Judge entered an order pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Roseboro v.

On February 20, 2018, Plaintiff filed a Sur Reply. (ECF No. 49.) On July 11, 2018, the Magistrate Judge issued her Report recommending the court grant Defendant's Motion. (ECF No. 51.) On August 31, 2018, Plaintiff filed an Objection to the Magistrate Judge's Report. (ECF No. 58.) On September 12, 2018, Defendant filed a reply.

And, the\n   <em>\n    Beverati\n   </em>\n   inmates did not allege that they were socially isolated to a similar degree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Second, similar to the\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   inmates' confinement in a supermax facility, Appellant's confinement to the SMU is extraordinary in its duration and indefiniteness.

Furthermore, the district court wrongly concluded that Appellant's stay in the SMU, although not limited to a particular number of days, was not \"indefinite\" because Appellant could secure release by renouncing his affiliation with the Five Percenters.

(ECF No. 39-1 at 5-25.) Many of the confinement conditions Plaintiff identified both the United States Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals have found relevant in determining whether confinement conditions impose an atypical and significant hardship. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   , the United States Supreme Court found \"almost all human contact [wa]s prohibited [and] exercise is 1 hour per day but only in a small indoor room.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p221\">\n    545 U.S. at 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p221\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, \"Plaintiff is confined to his cell for twenty-three hours per day-when he is given recreation time.... On Saturdays and Sundays, Plaintiff is confined to his cell for twenty-four hours.\" (ECF No. 51 at 14.) Plaintiff receives sixty to ninety minutes of recreation five days per week \"in a small cage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) Also, \"Plaintiff is only allowed visits from his attorney, and they are held behind glass.... Plaintiff is allowed no general visitation,\" neither is he \"allowed to receive personal telephone calls.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.)\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p221\">\n    545 U.S. at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209063\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/209/#p221\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Opportunities for visitation are rare and in all events are conducted through glass walls.\"). Furthermore, in\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found that, \"the circumstances of Appellant's incarceration....may ... be worse in some respects [than the\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   inmates because] Appellant is subject to a highly intrusive strip search every time he leaves his cell.\"\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275946\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/517/#p527\">\n    791 F.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Like the Appellants in\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiff is also subject to a highly intrusive strip search before entering and exiting his cell. (ECF Nos. 51 at 12-13; 58 at 7.) The Magistrate Judge did not mention these confinement conditions in her analysis. Instead, the Magistrate Judge noted that \"some of the restrictions[, as recognized by Plaintiff,] would apply even if he were on general population because of his disciplinary record.\" (ECF No. 51 at 16.) However, the confinement conditions the United States Supreme Court and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals found germane to the determination of atypicality in\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   -the amount of human contact, the amount of time an inmate is let out of his cell, and the subjection to intrusive strip searches-would not apply if Plaintiff were on general population. (ECF No. 51 at 12-13.) Accordingly, the court finds \"the circumstances of Plaintiff's incarceration in [security detention] mirror the experience of the\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   [and\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   ] inmates.\"\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275946\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/517/#p527\">\n    791 F.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The court turns now to the second factor of the\n   <em>\n    Wilkinson\n   </em>\n   test: the duration and indefiniteness of Plaintiff's confinement in security detention. The Magistrate Judge found, \"Plaintiff has failed to set forth a duration of the infinite nature that implicates due process concerns because his custody status was reviewed every ninety days, and he was eligible for release after twelve months on [security detention].\" (ECF No. 51 at 18.) Accepting Plaintiff's allegations as true, as the court must in its review of a summary judgment motion, Plaintiff was required to serve at least twelve months in SD before any review of his placement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The court recognizes this period of confinement is far shorter than the duration of time the Appellant in\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   spent in administrative segregation.\n   <em>\n    Incumaa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4275946\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/517/#p527\">\n    791 F.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (twenty years).
