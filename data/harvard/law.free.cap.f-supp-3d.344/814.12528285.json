S\u00e1nchez, C.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In this negligence action, Plaintiff Marlene Aldorasi, individually and on behalf of her husband, Philip Aldorasi, seeks damages for injuries she and her husband sustained when they were struck by falling building material while exiting a Philadelphia hotel where they had parked their car. Plaintiff brings claims against Crossroads Hospitality and Management Company, LLC, the business entity that operates or manages the hotel where the accident occurred, and two hotel employees: Marsha Ray, the hotel's general manager, and George McFeeters, the director of engineering. After Plaintiff filed this action in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County, Defendants promptly removed the case to federal court, asserting Ray and McFeeters had been fraudulently joined to destroy diversity and that, disregarding these individual Defendants' Pennsylvania citizenship, subject matter jurisdiction was proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Defendants also moved to dismiss all claims against the nondiverse individual Defendants. Plaintiff, disputing Defendants' fraudulent joinder allegations, responded with a series of her own motions, seeking to remand the case to state court, amend her Complaint to clarify her allegations against the individual Defendants, or voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice so that she could refile her proposed amended complaint in state court. Although presented in several different motions governed by different legal\n   standards, the parties' dispute centers on whether this case should proceed in state or federal court. As explained below, the Court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff's claims against Ray and McFeeters are not colorable as pleaded in her original state court Complaint. However, because it is undisputed that Plaintiff can state a claim against these individual Defendants-and, indeed, has done so in her proposed amended complaint-and upon consideration of the relevant equitable factors, the Court will exercise its discretion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) to permit Plaintiff to amend her Complaint to rejoin Ray and McFeeters as defendants and will remand the case to the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On April 3, 2016, Marlene and Philip Aldorasi, both citizens of Pennsylvania, parked their car in the parking garage at the Sheraton Philadelphia Downtown Hotel and walked from the garage into the hotel to exit onto 17th Street. While exiting the hotel, they were struck and injured by drywall, plasterboard, or other material that dislodged from a wall or ceiling above the doorway leading to 17th Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 9, 2017, Marlene Aldorasi commenced the above-captioned civil action by filing a Complaint against Crossroads, Ray, and McFeeters in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In her Complaint, which Plaintiff filed in her individual capacity and on behalf of her husband, Plaintiff alleges Defendants breached various duties owed to the Aldorasis as persons lawfully on the hotel premises, including their duty to properly maintain the hotel premises and to reasonably inspect and discover the dangerous conditions which caused the accident in which the Aldorasis were injured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The above-captioned action is the third civil action Plaintiff has filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County with respect to the April 3, 2016, accident. On May 11, 2017, five months before filing this action, Plaintiff and her husband filed an action against four corporate entities, including Interstate Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc., the parent company of Crossroads (the First Civil Action),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   raising allegations of negligence virtually identical to those made in this case. Like Defendants in this case, the defendants in the First Civil Action removed that action to federal court. Following the removal, the Aldorasis filed a praecipe to withdraw the action, and the case was ultimately dismissed without prejudice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a)(1)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 23, 2017, Plaintiff filed a second negligence action against Crossroads and two other corporate entities\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (the Second Civil Action), again raising allegations of negligence virtually identical to those made in this case. Although in the First Civil Action, Plaintiff and her husband had requested damages in an amount in excess of $50,000, Plaintiff filed the Second Civil Action solely on her own behalf as an \"arbitration matter,\" specifically alleging the amount in controversy was \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in\n   excess of $50,000\" and requesting judgment \"in an amount\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in excess of $50,000.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defs.' Mem. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Leave to File Am. Compl. Ex. C, at 1 &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 6 &amp; 29 (emphasis added). The defendants in the Second Civil Action answered the complaint on July 21, 2017, and the parties thereafter exchanged written discovery. In interrogatory responses served on Plaintiff on August 16, 2017, Crossroads disclosed that members of its engineering department were responsible for maintaining the hotel premises on the date of the Aldorasis' accident and identified George McFeeters as the person most knowledgeable about the maintenance procedures in effect at the time of the accident.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. D, \u00b6\u00b6 15, 18. Crossroads also represented, in both its interrogatory responses and answers to Plaintiff's requests for admission, that repeated inspections of the ceiling in question revealed that \"it never required repair [at] any time subsequent to its original construction in or about 1981 other than in connection with the incident [involving the Aldorasis] itself.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex.

On October 13, 2017, Defendants removed the case to this Court citing the federal diversity jurisdiction statute and arguing the two individual Defendants (Ray and McFeeters) were fraudulently joined. Consistent with their position that Ray and McFeeters were fraudulently joined, Defendants also moved to dismiss Plaintiff's claims against these individual Defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on October 18, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 24, 2017, Plaintiff opposed the motion to dismiss and also moved to remand the case to state court. Three weeks later, on November 14, 2018, Plaintiff moved for leave to amend her Complaint to \"clarify and detail\" her allegations against Ray and McFeeters. Pl.'s Mot. for Leave to File Am. Compl. \u00b6 6. Plaintiff's proposed amended complaint adds allegations that Ray specifically authorized inadequate repairs of the ceiling above the 17th Street exit and that McFeeters specifically directed co-employees to inadequately repair the ceiling, a known hazard. The proposed amended complaint also faults all Defendants, including Ray and McFeeters, for improperly repairing and maintaining the ceiling despite knowing it posed a risk of becoming detached and falling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On December 14, 2017, the Court heard argument on all pending motions. At the conclusion of the argument, Plaintiff's counsel candidly advised the Court that if the Court were to deny Plaintiff's motion to remand, counsel intended to withdraw this federal court action and refile Plaintiff's\n   proposed amended complaint-the allegations of which defense counsel conceded were sufficient to state a claim against Ray and McFeeters-in state court. Plaintiff then made an oral motion to withdraw the Complaint in this action without prejudice and, after the argument, submitted a proposed order dismissing this action without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although Defendants did not oppose Plaintiff's oral motion while in court, they subsequently filed a written opposition, asserting that any Rule 41(a)(1) dismissal had to be\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice under Rule 41(a)(1)(B) because Plaintiff had previously voluntarily dismissed two prior actions involving the same claims asserted in this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff thereafter moved to voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice pursuant to Rule 41(a)(2), and Defendants again opposed the motion. The Court held additional argument on all pending motions on April 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff moves to remand this case to state court, disputing Defendants' contention that Ray and McFeeters were fraudulently joined to defeat diversity. The doctrine of fraudulent joinder is an exception to the requirement that when removal is predicated on diversity of citizenship, there must be complete diversity between the parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Briscoe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114225\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/201/#p215\">\n    448 F.3d 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 215-16 (3d Cir. 2006). Under the doctrine, \"[i]n a suit with named defendants who are not of diverse citizenship from the plaintiff, the diverse defendant may still remove the action if it can establish that the non-diverse defendants were 'fraudulently' named or joined solely to defeat diversity jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114225\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/201/#p215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3114225\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/448/201/#p215\">\n    at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the proponent of federal jurisdiction, a removing defendant alleging fraudulent joinder bears a \"heavy burden of persuasion.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyer v.

To demonstrate a defendant was fraudulently joined, the removing party must show \"there is no reasonable basis in fact or colorable ground supporting the claim against the joined defendant,\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   no real intention in good faith to prosecute the action against the defendant or seek a joint judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531167\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/108/#p111\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added) (citation omitted).

The question is not whether the complaint states a claim sufficient to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss against the nondiverse defendant, but whether there is \"a possibility that a state court would find that the complaint states a cause of action against any one of the resident defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516753\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/977/848/#p851\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Boyer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531167\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/913/108/#p111\">\n    913 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   111 ).

In evaluating this issue, the Court is guided by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Wicks\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the plaintiffs, owners of homes built on low ground in a sloped area of a residential development, sued the developer and the builder of some of the homes in the development, seeking damages for personal injury and property damage resulting from drainage problems in the development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wicks\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1785940\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/503/614/\">\n    470 A.2d at 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs also named as defendants three individual officers of the developer, two of whom were sole shareholders of the builder, alleging the individual defendants were aware or should have been aware of the potential drainage problems in the development and were negligent in failing to take appropriate measures to eliminate or minimize such problems, including not ordering or performing adequate soil testing of the site of the concentrated sewage and water; failing to provide for any special drainage considerations in the grading and landscaping of the premises; building and selling a house which, because of its location, would undoubtedly have a drainage problem; and negligently excavating drainage ditches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 88-89. Addressing the sufficiency of the allegations against the individual corporate officers and shareholders under the participation theory, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that while \"the mere averment that a corporate officer should have known the consequences of the liability-creating corporate act\" was insufficient to impose liability, the complaint \"c[ould] be read as setting forth, generally, that the individual [defendants] actually knew that the location of the proposed [development] created, at least, an unreasonable risk of the drainage problems which occurred and that, having the power to do so, they deliberately ordered the work to proceed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 90.

While the Complaint can be fairly read to allege that Ray and McFeeters knew or should have known of the dangerous condition of the wall or ceiling immediately above the hotel's 17th Street exit and had a duty to properly maintain the hotel premises,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Defendants are alleged to have breached this duty solely through inaction. Specifically, Plaintiff alleges Ray and McFeeters breached their duty by \"fail[ing] to maintain the subject premises in a safe and reasonable manner\"; \"[f]ail[ing] to warn persons, such as Plaintiff, that the condition was a hazard\"; \"[f]ail[ing] to properly train, instruct and/or hire employees and/or third persons to monitor the conditions of the area where the accident occurred\"; \"[f]ail[ing] to establish appropriate policies and procedures to inspect the premises in a timely manner and discovery[ ] and/or correct the known or knowable unreasonable risks, including [the] hazard ... which directly and proximately caused Plaintiff's injuries\"; and \"[f]ail[ing] to hire third party contractors to take appropriate actions to preclude the occurrence which caused this Plaintiff's injuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25(a)-(d), (f).

Here, in contrast, discovery in the Second Civil Action was never completed, and Defendants' assertion that the ceiling area in question was never repaired is disputed, as Plaintiff has represented that photographs of the ceiling reviewed by her engineer reflect prior improper repairs.

The subjective inquiry is not at issue here, as Defendants do not argue Plaintiff does not intend to prosecute her claims against Ray and McFeeters. In fact, the limited evidence in the record suggests Plaintiff intends to prosecute her claims against the individual Defendants, as she promptly served them with the Complaint in this action at the same time Crossroads was served, and sought leave to amend her claims against them in light of the pleading deficiencies identified in Defendants' motion to dismiss.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Plaintiff also urges the Court to consider her proposed amended complaint-which alleges that Ray and McFeeters authorized, directed, or otherwise participated in the inadequate repair of the ceiling above the 17th Street exit,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Proposed Am.

In\n    <em>\n     Alpensjo\n    </em>\n    , the court held the participation theory applies to individual corporate employees only when those employees are also officers or owners of the corporation. But the court relied on this interpretation to hold that an employee who did not possess officer or owner status could not be individually liable for the plaintiff's wrongful termination.\n    <em>\n     Alpensjo\n    </em>\n    thus does not support the proposition that employees to whom the participation theory does not apply are subject to greater individual liability than officers to whom the theory does apply.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Plaintiff argues the allegations regarding Ray and McFeeters' failure to act support a colorable claim of misfeasance, citing the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court's recent decision in\n    <em>\n     B &amp; R Resources, LLC v.

At issue in\n    <em>\n     B &amp; RResources\n    </em>\n    was whether the managing member/sole member of a limited liability company could be liable under the participation theory for a statutory violation-failing to plug abandoned oil and gas wells. The Department of Environmental Protection issued an administrative order holding the managing member liable based on evidence showing that, after receiving numerous violation notices from the Department advising him that the company was required to plug its abandoned wells, the managing member made an intentional decision that the company would not plug the wells, but would spend its financial resources for other purposes. Although the Commonwealth Court reversed the administrative order and remanded the case to the Department for further proceedings on a causation issue, the court rejected the managing member's argument that a \"knowing, intentional and deliberate ... failure to act\" can never be a basis for liability under the participation theory.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493553\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/812/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12493553\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/180/812/\">\n     at 818\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . As noted,\n    <em>\n     B &amp; RResources\n    </em>\n    involved application of the tort law participation theory in the context of a statutory violation, a context in which the Commonwealth Court has applied the theory by analogy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kaites v.
