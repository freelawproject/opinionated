Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Almost thirty years ago, Congress established the EB-5 Visa Program (\"the\n   Program\") to stimulate the economy and create jobs through foreign capital investment. Under the Program, \"alien investors\" may become eligible to immigrate to the United States in return for investing certain qualifying amounts of capital in a commercial enterprise in the United States. Plaintiffs in this case are individual alien investors whose EB-5 visa petitions were denied by the agency that oversees the Program: the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"). Plaintiffs allege that their petitions were denied based on USCIS' flawed interpretation of its own regulation. As such, they challenge USCIS' decisions to deny their petitions as arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(5). Plaintiffs also claim that USCIS exceeded its statutory authority under the INA by denying their petitions and impermissibly applying its interpretation retroactively. Finally, plaintiffs claim that USCIS engaged in improper rulemaking without notice and comment, also in violation of the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pending before the Court are: (1) plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment; (2) USCIS' cross-motion for summary judgment; (3) plaintiffs' motion to certify class; and (4) plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint. Upon consideration of the motions, the responses and replies thereto, the relevant case law, and the entire record herein, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS IN PART\n   </strong>\n   plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment,\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   USCIS' cross-motion for summary judgment,\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   plaintiffs' motion to certify class (albeit with a modified class definition), and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint. Rather than approve plaintiffs' petitions, however, the Court instead\n   <strong>\n    VACATES\n   </strong>\n   USCIS' denials of the class members' petitions and\n   <strong>\n    REMANDS\n   </strong>\n   the denials to USCIS for reconsideration consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The Court first considers the cross-motions for summary judgment. The Court analyzes two of plaintiffs' four claims: (1) that USCIS' interpretation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.6\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the EB-5 regulation, is erroneous because it contravenes the regulation's plain meaning; and (2) that USCIS violated the APA because its interpretation is a legislative rule promulgated without notice and comment.

The class does not include investors who received denials for multiple reasons. As such, the Court certifies the following class:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   All Form I-526 petitioners who: (1) invested cash in a new commercial enterprise in an amount sufficient to qualify as an EB-5 investor; (2) obtained some or all of the cash invested in the new commercial enterprise through a loan; (3) filed a Form I-526 petition based on that investment; and (4) received or will receive a denial of their I-526 petition\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the loan used to obtain the invested cash fails the collateralization test described in the USCIS 2015 IPO Remarks announcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

However, assuming this is a concern, USCIS could easily deny a petition based on an investment of cash loan proceeds if the underlying loan was secured by the enterprise.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"318\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.6\">\n     8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.6\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (j)(2). As explained more thoroughly below, USCIS must ensure that the capital invested was \"actually committed\" to the enterprise.\n    <em>\n     See\n     <extracted-citation index=\"319\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.6\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    ;\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    Sec. III.A.1.c.ii.(2). If an alien investor invested cash in the enterprise that could be seized by a lending third-party, the investor has not truly \"committed\" the cash to the enterprise. This is not to say that a loan must be secured by the alien investor's assets, rather that the loan must\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    be secured by the enterprise's assets.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    Plaintiffs agree that the retroactivity analysis need not be reached if the Court finds that the interpretation is arbitrary and capricious.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' MSJ, ECF No. 19 at 51 (\"Indeed, the retroactivity analysis starts with the assumption that the policy or interpretation at issue is\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    arbitrary and capricious. If a rule is arbitrary and capricious, the issue of retroactivity is moot because the rule cannot be applied prospectively, much less retroactively.\").
