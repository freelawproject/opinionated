The Parties and the Staff Nurse Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Juanita Kho was employed by Defendant New York Presbyterian Hospital as a staff nurse in its Intensive Care Unit (\"ICU\") from September 2006 until August 18, 2014. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 1. Kho was born in the Philippines and is of Chinese ethnicity. Compl. \u00b6 47, ECF No. 7. She was fifty-five at the time she commenced her employment. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Hospital is an acute care hospital that provides inpatient, ambulatory, and preventative care. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 2. The ICU provides care for patients in the most critical condition. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 5. The Hospital maintains policies, both on its internal network and in its employee handbook, for providing equal employment opportunities. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 3, The Hospital's policies provide for reasonable accommodation of employees with disabilities, as well as family\n   and medical leave for an employee's own serious health condition. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   John Holmes served as a patient care director in the ICU from June 2006 through April 3, 2017. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7. He was responsible for supervising ICU staff, maintaining patient safety and experience, and managing day-to-day operations. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 8. Holmes interviewed Kho when she applied for a position and made the decision to hire her. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 9. Holmes had managerial responsibilities over Kho throughout the duration of her employment. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Hospital maintained a written job description of the staff nurse position listing all of the job duties and responsibilities. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 14. Staff nurses function as the primary nurse for designated patients. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 17. They are responsible for assessing, planning appropriate care, evaluating progress, and coordinating care delivery and transitions in care. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 18. They also must have effective interpersonal communication skills, adhere to customer service principles, and communicate compassionately. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 21. The Hospital maintains a written policy providing for \"Handoff Communication.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 22.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   This policy is intended \"[t]o standardize handoff communication ... including the opportunity to ask additional or clarifying questions whenever patient care is transitioned [between nurses].\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Hospital Begins Receiving Complaints About Kho\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Beginning in 2006, the year she was hired, and continuing until her termination, there were numerous complaints about Kho from patients, families, managers, and co-workers. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 25. Holmes made Kho aware of many of the complaints at the time they were received and counseled Kho orally and in writing to improve her performance. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 12, 2006, Holmes and another nurse met with Kho to discuss her restraining a patient without first receiving a physician's order, which was contrary to Hospital policy. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 28. In January, a patient's family complained about Kho's \"roughness.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 29. Several months later, on May 2, a nurse complained that Kho was inattentive, abrupt, and harsh during a patient \"handoff.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 30. As a result, the nurse who assumed responsibility for the patient repeated his respiratory status several times. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 30. A mere three days later, another patient's family also complained that Kho had communicated \"roughly\" with him. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Later that month, the Hospital issued Kho a report of caution for not communicating effectively during \"handoff\" and she was instructed to review the Hospital's policy. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 32. On June 1, 2007, Kho received a corrective action report for violating the Hospital's Latex Sensitive Patient\n   Care Policy. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 33. A few weeks later, a staff nurse submitted a written complaint to Holmes informing him,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that: (1) Kho failed to relay essential information during a \"handoff\"; (2) inaccurately charted a patient's information; (3) family members of two patients complained about Kho, including that she advised one \"you know your mother is dying, right?\"; and (4) Kho had demonstrated unsafe care of her patients. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Kho's First Work Improvement Plan and Continuing Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In July 2007, Kho was placed on a Work Improvement Plan (\"WIP I\"). Def. 56.1 \u00b6 35. The WIP I identified the following areas of concern: lack of empathy and service, as well as issues with flexibility and lack of commitment to excellence. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 37. Kho was advised,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that she must communicate effectively and with compassion; \"update family frequently\"; \"[a]nswer questions, demonstrating concern of patient and the extraordinary stress the family is experiencing\"; \"avoid a sharp tone with ancillary staff\"; document patient care in a timely manner; \"[c]ommunicate handoff in a through [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] and precise manner\"; and review the \"handoff policy.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 38. Holmes advised Kho that she was not performing up to Hospital standards. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 39.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kho refused to sign the WIP I. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 40. Holmes documented his ongoing counseling during the 90-day work improvement period. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Holmes discussed Kho's performance under the WIP I with Human Resources. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 42. On August 20, 2007, multiple staff members in the ICU met with the Director of Nursing and raised patient safety concerns related to Kho's care. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 43. Charge nurses, responsible for assigning nurses to patients, reported that they did not assign Kho sicker patients out of concern for patient safety. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 44. By October 2007, six different nurses had complained that Kho's \"handoff\" report \"was disorganized and incomplete.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 10, 2007, several people complained about Kho. The daughter of one patient asserted that Kho refused to provide her with test results because she was too busy. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 47. When the daughter approached Kho again, she responded that the daughter had already been told to wait until the next shift. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 47. Another patient complained that Kho was uncooperative, stubborn, and argumentative in adjusting bath times and only did so after the patient argued with her. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 48. A third patient's family member complained about Kho's \"roughness\" and requested that Kho not be assigned to the patient. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Two days later, on October 12, Holmes reported to Human Resources that Kho was not satisfying the WIP I, but agreed to extend the period for evidence of improvement. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 50. Holmes noted that Kho's \"handoff\" reports \"had been disorganized and required multiple probes\n   from the nurses to obtain the full picture.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 51. On October 16, Kho received separate reports of cautions for not exhibiting the values of empathy and respect. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 52. On November 7, a member of the hospital's IV team complained that Kho yelled at a patient and was not helpful. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 53. In February 2008, Kho was given a performance review for 2007, during which she was issued a \"needs improvement\" rating for her substandard commitment to excellence, including her communications with patients, families, and staff. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On August 26, 2009, a son of a patient complained that Kho ignored his question regarding the amount of insulin she was administering and that he had to ask several times to get a response. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 56. Kho also told the patient he could not call his son. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 56. The patient asked Kho how many pills she was giving him, to which she responded \"[y]ou are like your son, I am not going to explain it to you.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 57. The next month, another patient's daughter complained about Kho's rude behavior. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In February 2010, Kho was given her performance review for 2009. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 59. Kho was counseled to improve her performance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   She has had complaints about being abrupt and brusque when communicating with co-workers and customers. She easily becomes overwhelmed by the expectations of multi-tasking in order to take care of a critically ill patient. She cannot be counted upon to act professionally and appropriately in all situations consistently. She continues to isolate herself from unit and co-workers. Any improvements made in any of the above areas is for short periods of time and is not consistent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Def. 56.1 \u00b6 60. Kho was given \"needs improvement\" ratings in values and behaviors of empathy and respect, as well as multiple specific skills related to clinical excellence, leadership, service excellence, and teamwork. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 60. A plan for improvement was instituted requiring Kho to demonstrate effective verbal communication and interpersonal skills among staff, patients and other departments to foster optimal patient care. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Kho did, however, receive an overall rating of \"solid.\" Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 60. Specifically, she received reviews of solid in the areas of patient care procedures, patient family education, patient safety, and research/education. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 60. This evaluation was not performed by John Holmes. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Kho's Leave to Undergo Cancer Treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 2010, Kho was granted leave from on or about March 18, 2010 to November 22, 2010 to undergo cancer treatment. Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. The Hospital claims Kho was given the eight months of leave and a temporary part-time light duty job upon her return to work, as she requested, and thereafter returned to her fulltime ICU position. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 65. Kho claims, however, that she was required to hire an attorney so that she could be reinstated. Kho Aff. \u00b6 20.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In February 2011, Kho was given her performance review for 2010, which noted that \"she is encouraged to continue to develop her communications skills with her peers and other members of the healthcare team in stressful and all situations.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 67. Kho did, however, receive an overall score of \"solid,\" as well as in every category. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 67. There were no listed areas of improvement. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 67. This review also was not completed by Holmes. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In February 2012, Kho was given her performance review for 2011 and her continuing communications issues were once again identified as an area in need of improvement: \"She is encouraged to continue to develop effective communication skills with her peers and healthcare team in stressful and all situations. She is also encouraged to work on her customer service skills to help patients, families, and peers develop a more positive first impression[ ] of her.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 68. She received a rating of \"solid\" in every category except for patient safety and leadership. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 68. Leadership was the only category in which she received a \"needs improvement\" rating. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 27 2012, Holmes received the following complaint from another critical care unit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Kho] is very unsafe and does NOT belong on 4west. She does not appear to possess critical thinking skills and the questions she asked me were honestly frightening. Here are a few examples ... she had no idea what cardene is or is used for... Sat my post catheter patient up at 90 degrees after being told to keep him flat x4 hours .... This is an accident waiting to happen. I know you have heard complaints about her before. Please do not allow her back because something bad will happen. It is just a matter of time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Def. 56.1 \u00b6 69. The very next month, another critical care unit requested that Kho not be placed on duty there due to her uncooperative and unsafe conduct. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 70. Kho had told an attendant to \"bathe a complete care\" patient by herself and refused to help, jeopardizing the patient's airway, and then failed to render emergency care. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On September 6, 2012, Holmes counseled Kho on her performance issues. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 71. He noted that Kho \"failed to take any ownership for the incidents and claimed that they were erroneous perceptions of what she did ... I also suggested that part of her issue was communication both listening to others and how she communicates with them. I reminded her of some of the issues she has had with communication in the past.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On October 22, 2012, Holmes received the following complaints about Kho: a patient had complained that Kho refused to care for him; a patient's family had complained that Kho was not knowledgeable about the patient's medical condition, did not know how to properly empty internal drains following surgery and administered an IV too quickly; and another patient complained that she had to change her own dressing because it was so soiled, summarizing that \"she would've rather stayed in the recovery room if she knew it was going to be like this.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In January 2013, Kho was given her performance review for 2012, which noted that \"[s]he has been encouraged throughout the year to attempt to demonstrate effective communication with the MICU team .... She is encouraged to continue to improve on her communication and teamwork skills this upcoming year.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 73. Kho was given \"needs improvement\" in four categories: empathy; patient family education; patient safety; and service excellence. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 73. The review\n   emphasized that Kho \"continues to have complaints that she does not listen to family members. That she becomes focused on a task and does not listen to staff members and physicians and repeats questions or misses key information.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 74. Kho did, however, receive an overall score of \"solid.\" Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In May of that year, a patient complained that Kho did not answer her call bell, that she was in a lot of pain and not medicated in a timely manner, and she was ignored. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 76. The same month, a manager complained that Kho's performance was not acceptable as she failed to take a report from the laboratory in a timely manner, did not notify the team right away of an issue involving a patient, and provided incorrect information concerning a patient. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The next month, a patient stated that she would be filing a complaint with the American Medical Association unless Kho was reassigned. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 78. The patient was crying as a result of Kho's treatment and advised that she felt \"very unsafe\" and was \"very nervous and scared if Juanita was going to be her nurse for the rest of the night and that she wanted to leave.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 78. According to the patient, Kho became angry and frustrated, slamming drawers and throwing an insulin pen. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 79. In July, Holmes issued Kho a caution related to the patient complaints from the previous two months. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On November 1, 2013, a patient's wife requested that Kho no longer care for her husband. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 81. The same month, a patient complained that Kho had been \"mean,\" telling him that he was calling too much, and that she had other patients. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 83. The patient's wife also complained. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 84. Another nurse characterized Kho as \"rude.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 85. Later that month, Kho was issued a corrective action report advising her that \"communication with patients, family members and coworkers must improve\" and warning that \"[f]ailure to demonstrate immediate and sustained improvement\" would result in disciplinary action, possibly termination. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 86. Kho refused to sign the report. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 87. The very next month, Kho disregarded a physician's end of life instructions by reconnecting a patient's EKG. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In February 2014, Kho was issued her review for 2013.

Def. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 89-90. The review noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   Juanita Kho fails to maintain the NYP values and behaviors consistently.

Kho's Second Work Improvement Plan\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On April 25, 2014, Kho was placed on another Work Improvement Plan (\"WIP II\") and was given a copy. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 91. The areas of concern in the WIP II were lack of expression of empathy and concern during communications, failure to timely document patient care and have professional/respectful\n   \"handoff,\" and poor communication within interdisciplinary team/co-workers/Patient Care Director (\"PCD\"). Def. 56.1 \u00b6 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Among the action plan items were the following: improve active listening skills including paraphrasing and repeating back ideas or requests; anticipate patient and families need for information and provide the educational handouts along with verbal information about medications, lab results, disease process, and procedures; and respond to questions immediately and, if unable to do so, inform patient and family when you will respond. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 96. During her shift, Kho was required to \"outline on paper the information you will need to provide during \"handoff\" to help it stay efficient and organized.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 96. Kho was also advised to focus on charting throughout the shift and complete shift assessment charting by midnight so she could be prepared for the \"handoff.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 97. She was similarly informed to be accountable for her actions, and not respond with defense or denials when asked to correct behaviors. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 97. Kho refused to sign the WIP II and denied that she had any performance issues. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 98. From April through July 2014, Kho failed to accomplish all of the WIP II behaviors and action plan items. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 100. Holmes met with Kho on multiple occasions to review the WIP II and documented his ongoing counseling to improve her performance. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Holmes consulted Human Resources and Rosenthal concerning Kho's failure to satisfy the elements of the WIP II. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 102. On May 2, 2014, Kho advised Holmes that there was nothing from the WIP II that she had tried. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 103. On May 30, when Holmes asked Kho about whether she had changed her approach to \"handoffs,\" she denied that any change was needed. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 104. Holmes advised Kho that the \"handoff\" he had observed was \"disorganized.\" Def. 56.1 \u00b6 105.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On June 17, 2014, Holmes spoke to Kho about timely charting, and she again denied that there were any issues. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 106. Holmes reminded Kho that the WIP II required her to complete patient charting early in her shift, Def. 56.1 \u00b6 106, though his notes from July 1 indicate that Kho's \"charting was completed in a timely manner from the last few shifts,\" Ex. 43 at 4 (NYPH000321). On July 1, Kho admitted to Holmes that she was not providing patients with the educational handouts, and claimed not to know even where to locate them. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 107. That same day, Kho asked for a copy of the WIP II, and for the third time, Holmes provided her with one. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 108. When asked for written outlines of the \"handoffs,\" Kho advised that she was not reducing the information to paper as instructed. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 109. Kho similarly denied that there were issues with her \"handoffs,\" and Holmes reminded her that she was required to outline them in writing. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 110. On July 18, 2017, Holmes observed a \"handoff\" during which Kho failed to comply with these requirements. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 111. Kho also did not timely chart the admission history of a new patient, nor did she provide a newly admitted patient with educational materials.

Second, during Kho's time at the Hospital through her first meeting with Human Resources, she never once referenced the possibility that she was the victim of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osborne v.

As discussed with respect to Kho's discrimination claims, the Hospital has proffered a legitimate, non-discriminatory explanation for her termination. Here, too, Kho has failed to show that the Hospital's explanation was mere pretext. The only protected activity on which Kho's retaliation claims could be based is her complaint during meetings with Human Resources that her placement on the WIP II might have been due to race or national origin. Any such contention, however, is unpersuasive. In addition to all of the reasons discussed at length with regard to her discrimination claims, Kho has failed to show that the purpose of her termination was anything other than her poor work performance. In arguing that the Hospital retaliated against her for opposing conduct that she reasonably believed to constitute discrimination, Kho appears to rely entirely on the timing of her complaint in relation to her termination, which is wholly insufficient to establish that her protected conduct was a \"but-for\" cause of her termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Simpson v.

The vast majority of Kho's objections, however, are fatally flawed and the Court thus disregards them, principally for five reasons. First, in numerous instances she alleges facts contradicting those contained in the Hospital's statement, but fails to provide citations to admissible evidence. Second, certain of Kho's factual assertions contradict her own deposition testimony.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Palazzo ex rel Delmage v.

Dawkins Dep. 31:14-32:9; 33:10-15; 34:2-5; 36:22-24. To the extent Kho's affidavit in support of her opposition papers contradicts the record, the Court declines to credit it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Kho Aff. \u00b6 34. Moreover, the record is clear that Kho did not reference being discriminated against or harassed in her first meeting with Ms. Dawkins.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dawkins Dep. Tr. 29:9-11 (Q: Did she mention discrimination or harassment at that first meeting? A: No.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    Concerning the adverse action prong, the focus is on Kho's termination. She has never alleged that any of the occasions on which she was reprimanded constitute an adverse employment action. It is doubtful that such events could qualify.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Kpaka v. City Univ. of N.Y.\n    </em>\n    , No. 14-CV-6021 (RA),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204154891\">\n     2016 WL 4154891\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 2, 2016). To the extent Kho relies on her purported difficulty in being re-instated following her leave to undergo cancer treatment in 2010 as the adverse employment action underlying her discrimination, failure to accommodate, or retaliation claims, it is time-barred because that sequence of events did not occur within 300 days of Kho submitting her EEOC claim.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 200e-5(e). The Court does note, however, two ways in which time-barred acts may remain relevant. First, to the extent Kho alleges a continuing violation-such as a hostile work environment-she need only show that part of the violation took place within the limitations period.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Petrosino v.

Second, time-barred events may also be considered as \"background evidence in support of a timely [discrimination] claim.\"\n    <em>\n     Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v.
