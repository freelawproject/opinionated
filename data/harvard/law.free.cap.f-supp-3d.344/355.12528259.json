Otay Mesa has filed the instant action against the FWS and its acting Director, the U.S. Department of the Interior (\"Interior\"), and two high-ranking Interior officers in their official capacities (collectively, \"Defendants\") to challenge the propriety of the FWS's critical habitat designation under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20701\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 706.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   This Court has already issued one memorandum opinion in this matter,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Otay Mesa Prop., L.P. v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n    144 F.Supp.3d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2015), wherein all disputed issues between Otay Mesa and FWS concerning the critical habitat designation for the endangered Riverside fairy shrimp were resolved save one: namely, whether it was proper for the FWS to assign a 'critical habitat' designation to 56 acres of Otay Mesa's property that is immediately adjacent to the stock pond that contains the shrimp solely on the basis of the agency's finding that the types of geological features that are generally necessary to support the shrimp species exist on those acres. The FWS had concluded that the 56 acres constituted either \"occupied\" critical habitat under the first prong of section 1532(5)(A) of Title 16 of the United States Code, or, alternatively, \"unoccupied\" critical habitat essential\n   for the conservation of the species under the second prong of that same provision, but the agency had not conducted any hydrological studies or other surveys to determine the extent to which the 56 acres of land actually supported the ecological system that is necessary for the shrimp's survival. As explained below, the question of whether or not the FWS employed an appropriate methodology to reach the critical habitat determination at issue in this case depends upon the meaning of the term \"occupied\" as it appears in the ESA, and also turns on the distinction that that statute makes between the standards for designating occupied and unoccupied critical habitats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court at present are the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment and the supplemental briefs that they have filed regarding these key legal issues. Otay Mesa maintains that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, because the FWS improperly designated the 56 acres of land as \"occupied\" habitat even though the shrimp live only in the one-acre stock pond and not on the land. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 2d Suppl. Br., ECF No. 42, at 8-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Otay Mesa further contends that the FWS's occupied critical habitat designation is improper under the ESA because there is no record evidence demonstrating that all 56 acres of adjacent land must be preserved in order to supply water to the one-acre stock pond where the shrimp live, and that the FWS improperly designated the 56 acres as \"unoccupied\" critical habitat in the alternative because it failed to apply the statutory standard for unoccupied critical habitat designations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-13; Pls.' Resp. to Defs.' Suppl. Br. &amp; Pls.' Renewed Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 36, at 3-4.) Defendants respond that the Court should order summary judgment in their favor, because the FWS reasonably determined that the stock pond and all 56 adjacent acres satisfy the ESA's definition of occupied critical habitat on the basis of the best available scientific data (Defs.' 2d Suppl. Br., ECF No. 41, at 7-12, 16-22), and the FWS applied the correct legal standards when alternatively designating this area as unoccupied critical habitat under the ESA (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained fully below, this Court finds that the law and record evidence do not support the FWS's \"occupied\" or \"unoccupied\" critical habitat designations, and thus the critical habitat determination that Otay Mesa challenges here must be set aside as arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law in violation of the APA. To be specific, the manner in which the FWS determined the scope of the area that the Riverside fairy shrimp occupies is inconsistent with the ESA's prescriptions for making that determination, and when the agency determined the area of unoccupied critical habitat, it failed to employ the statutory standard that is applicable to unoccupied critical habitat designations. Consequently, Otay Mesa's renewed motion for summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , Defendants' motion for summary judgment must be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , and the designation of Otay Mesa's property as critical habitat must be\n   <strong>\n    VACATED\n   </strong>\n   .

Based upon environmental surveys that showed that the filled stock pond contained adult Riverside fairy shrimp during the wet season and the dried-out bed of that stock pond had Riverside fairy shrimp cysts in it during the dry season, the FWS determined that this endangered species \"occupied\" the one-acre stock pond at the time the species was listed in 1993-a finding that this Court has already upheld.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n    at 59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the 2012 Rule, the FWS proceeded to designate as \"occupied\" critical habitat for the Riverside fairy shrimp not only the stock pond itself, but also approximately 56 acres of surrounding land (which is referred to throughout this Opinion as \"Subunit 5c\" or \"the Property\"), and alternatively, the FWS labelled those same areas as \"unoccupied\" critical habit, for the purpose of the ESA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n    at 52-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Otay Mesa has plans to build a recycling center and landfill on the Property, and in the instant context, it represents that the FWS's critical habitat designation \"may make the completion of this project infeasible.\" (Pls.' Mem. in Supp. of Summ. J., ECF No. 9-1, at 34.) Consequently, Otay Mesa has filed a complaint that contends that the FWS's designation of the one-acre vernal pool and the surrounding 56 acres of land as protected critical habitat under the ESA was an arbitrary and capricious determination, and was also contrary to law, in violation of the APA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Otay Mesa Prop.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n    144 F.Supp.3d at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 30, 2015, this Court denied without prejudice the parties' initial cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In so ruling, the Court found that Otay Mesa had standing to bring its lawsuit, and that the FWS did not act arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to either the economic analysis underlying the critical habitat designation or its decision not to conduct an analysis of the challenged critical habitat designation under the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 4321 - 4370.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n    at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court further found that it had insufficient information to resolve the parties' dispute about the rationality of the scope of the FWS's critical habitat designation, because the Court could not \"determine on the record before it whether the FWS has acted arbitrarily in concluding that 56 acres of land surrounding\n   the one-acre pond is, in fact, watershed\" for the pond.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n    at 39-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"the portion of the administrative record that was submitted to the Court does not explain\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   the FWS determined that all of the geographic area that it designated as critical habitat qualifies as such\" (emphasis added) ). Consequently, the Court ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs that addressed the factual underpinnings for the FWS's designation of 56 acres of land as watershed for the one-acre pond, along with any additional supporting documents from the Administrative Record. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl. Br. Order, ECF No. 31, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Court heard oral argument on the parties' renewed motions (Min. Entry of Mar. 15, 2017), and during the hearing, Defendants' counsel explained that the FWS's methodology for determining the scope of the watershed-and thus the area that the FWS had deemed \"occupied\" or, alternatively, \"unoccupied\" critical habitat for the Riverside fairy shrimp-consisted of mapping the geographic location of the \"primary constituent elements\" (\"PCEs\") that the FWS had identified for the endangered species at issue (which, as noted, is itself located solely in the one-acre stock pond), and then drawing the boundary of the critical habitat around those areas abutting the stock pond where all three PCEs exist, without additional analysis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Hr'g Tr., 47:4-48:24, Mar. 15, 2017.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As a result, it became apparent that the parties' dispute about whether the FWS's designation of the 56 adjacent acres as critical habitat violates the APA is, at bottom, a disagreement over whether the FWS's method of defining the scope of the territory that is \"occupied\" by the endangered species at issue is consistent with the ESA, which in turn implicates the issue of whether the area around the stock pond qualifies as \"occupied\" critical habitat under the statute-an issue that this Court did not reach in the context of its earlier summary judgment ruling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Otay Mesa Prop.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4262708\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/144/35/\">\n    144 F.Supp.3d at 59-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that \"the FWS [had] decided that the Riverside Fairy shrimp 'occupied' the stock pond and [also] the watershed area surrounding the stock pond at the time of listing,\" and had determined, in the alternative, that \"Subunit 5c qualified as 'unoccupied' critical habit[,]\" but finding that, regardless, the agency had the statutory authority to make that determination). In other words, the Court discovered that, far from being immaterial, the question of whether the geographic area surrounding the stock pond constitutes \"occupied\" or \"unoccupied\" terrain under the ESA was crucial to resolving the merits of Otay Mesa's remaining APA claim. As a result, the Court ordered the parties to file a second round of supplemental briefs, this\n   time addressing (1) whether the \"occupied\" or \"unoccupied\" prong of the statutory critical habitat definition applies to the habitat at issue here; (2) whether the ESA authorizes the FWS to delineate the protected critical habitat under either prong by merely mapping the identified PCEs in the general area; and (3) whether this Court should give any weight to the Ninth Circuit's decision in a case that agency counsel raised and relied upon during the hearing-\n   <em>\n    Alaska Oil and Gas Association v.

In its brief, Otay Mesa insists that the \"occupied\" prong of the critical habitat provision is inapposite because the shrimp are indisputably only present in the pond and not anywhere else on the 56 surrounding acres. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' 2d Suppl. Br. at 8.) Otay Mesa argues further that the FWS erred in delineating all 56 acres as \"unoccupied\" critical habitat because the presence of PCEs, standing alone, is insufficient to support an unoccupied critical habitat designation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-17); instead, according to Otay Mesa, the unoccupied critical habitat standards required the FWS to \"determine how much, if any, of the 56 acres was necessary to water the stock pond[,]\" and to make a specific finding that \"this area was essential to the conservation of the species[,]\" given \"that existing occupied habitat was inadequate\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14). Otay Mesa also maintains that this Court should not afford any weight to the Ninth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Alaska Oil\n   </em>\n   , because that case dealt with the designation of occupied critical habitat\n   <em>\n    for a species that was highly mobile\n   </em>\n   , while this case concerns unoccupied critical habitat for an essentially\n   <em>\n    immobile\n   </em>\n   species.

(Defs.' 2d Suppl. Br. at 7.) In Defendants' view, the Riverside fairy shrimp species \"occupies\" the stock pond and also all of the surrounding acres (despite the actual confinement of the animals themselves to the pond) within the plain meaning of the statute, and furthermore\n   <em>\n    Alaska Oil\n   </em>\n   teaches that it is permissible for the FWS to rely solely on the presence of the PCEs on the acres surrounding the pond, without studying runoff or conducting any other kind of hydrologic analysis, in order to delineate \"the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201532\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A)(i). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 2d Suppl. Br. at 7-20.) Defendants further argue that the FWS properly designated the stock pond and the 56 surrounding acres as unoccupied critical habitat in the alternative,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201532\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A)(ii) (authorizing designation of areas \"outside the geographical area occupied by the species\" if the Secretary determines such areas \"are essential for the conservation of the species\"), because the general loss of vernal pool habitat in this area of San Diego County necessitates the preservation of this known vernal pool, and because the Riverside fairy shrimp in this particular pool have unique genetics. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 2d Suppl. Br. at 11-16.) Defendants also maintain that, since no hydrologic studies were readily available at the time of the designation and the ESA only requires that the agency rely on the best\n   available data, the FWS did not need to conduct any hydrologic analysis to support this unoccupied critical habitat designation.

The Act further instructs that, \"[e]xcept in those circumstances determined by the Secretary, critical habitat\n   <em>\n    shall not include the entire geographical area\n   </em>\n   which can be occupied by the threatened or endangered species.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201532\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1532(5)(C) (emphasis added). Properly understood, then, the statutory text of the ESA plainly requires the agency to start by delineating the geographical area that the species at issue occupies, and then proceed to determine the critical habitat by reference to that area, with occupied critical habitat being a\n   <em>\n    subset\n   </em>\n   of that area (or in exceptional cases, coextensive with that area) and unoccupied critical habitat consisting of specific geographical areas outside the area occupied by the species.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201532\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1532(5)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Importantly, the Secretary of the Interior has promulgated regulations that pertain to how the agency implements the ESA's critical habitat requirements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.12\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (titled \"Criteria for designating critical habitat\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.12\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 424.12(b) (specifying that, \"[w]here designation of critical habitat is prudent and determinable, the Secretary will identify specific\n   areas within the geographical area occupied by the species at the time of listing and any specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species to be considered for designation as critical habitat\"). With respect to determining the occupied critical habitat of an endangered species, the regulations underscore that occupied critical habitat should be a\n   <em>\n    portion\n   </em>\n   of the overall area that a species occupies, by instructing the Secretary to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (i) Identify the geographical area occupied by the species at the time of listing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (ii) Identify physical and biological features essential to the conservation of the species at an appropriate level of specificity using the best available scientific data....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (iii) Determine the specific areas\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the geographical area occupied by the species that contain the physical or biological features essential to the conservation of the species.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (iv) Determine which of these features may require special management considerations or protection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.12\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 424.12(b)(1) (emphasis added).

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   It has taken years of litigation and multiple rounds of briefing, but the core legal question underlying the parties' dispute in this matter has now become apparent. This issue-the appropriateness of the FWS's methodology for drawing the boundaries of the critical habitat for the Riverside fairy shrimp-implicates two relatively straightforward questions of statutory interpretation: first, whether the FWS's manner of determining \"the geographical area occupied by the [Riverside fairy shrimp] species\" is consistent with the ESA, and second, whether the FWS acted consistently with the ESA and applicable regulations when it identified the critical habitat of the Riverside fairy shrimp solely vis-\u00e0-vis the topography of the pertinent geographical without further analysis of whether and to what extent the area actually functions as watershed. As explained below, this Court has determined that, even after granting the FWS the deference that it is due under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   , the agency's identification of the geographical area occupied by the Riverside fairy shrimp was unreasonable and therefore arbitrary and capricious, which means that the resulting occupied critical habitat determination violated the APA. The Court further concludes that the agency's alternative designation of the 56 acres surrounding the stock pond as unoccupied critical habitat violated the ESA, because the agency made that determination solely in reference to the presence of PCEs and without conducting any further analysis about whether preservation of this area was essential for the conservation of the species.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    A. By Encircling All Vernal Pools Where The Species Has Been Sighted As Well As All Land In Between, The FWS Improperly Identified The Area Occupied By The Riverside Fairy Shrimp\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Because the ESA defines both \"occupied\" and \"unoccupied\" critical habitat in\n   reference to \"the geographical area occupied by the species[,]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201532\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5)(A), the FWS's first step in making any critical habitat designation must be to identify the \"geographical area occupied by the species\" at the time that the agency initially listed the species,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201532\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20424.12\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 424.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). In the 2012 Rule, the FWS purports to delineate the \"geographical area occupied by the\" Riverside fairy shrimp by identifying the outermost geographical boundaries of the various vernal pools in the state of California where the shrimp have been sighted, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [T]hat area bounded by the coastline to the west, east to an area near tribal land of the Pechanga Band of Luise\u00f1o Mission Indians of the Pechanga Reservation, California, in western Riverside County, north into the central foothills of Orange County near the former Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) El Toro, and south to coastal mesa tops along the United States-Mexico Border in San Diego County.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2072081\">\n    77 Fed. Reg. 72081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The rule further notes that, in the years since the Riverside fairy shrimp was first listed as endangered in 1993, the species has been documented in additional areas in Ventura, Orange, Riverside, and San Diego counties in California, and that the FWS considers these additional areas to also be within the geographical area that the Riverside fairy shrimp occupied when it was listed.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20Fed.%20Reg.%2072081\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Nowhere in the briefing of the issues in this case does the FWS discuss, much less justify, its apparent threshold determination that the Riverside fairy shrimp species \"occupies\" this\n   <em>\n    entire\n   </em>\n   geographical area such that it is appropriate to designate large swaths of land within this area as occupied critical habitat under the ESA.

And for the reasons explained below, it is clear to this Court that it is manifestly unreasonable for the FWS to have determined that this entire geographic area is \"occupied\" by the Riverside fairy shrimp. Thus, even under\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's two-step framework, this Court cannot countenance the FWS's decision to interpret the ambiguous statutory term \"occupied\" to include all of the various vernal pools in the state of California where the Riverside fairy shrimp actually reside\n   <em>\n    and also all of the land in between those pools\n   </em>\n   , which means that the 2012 Rule violates the terms of the ESA at the outset, even prior to setting forth the particular critical habitat designation that Otay Mesa challenges in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Although The Term \"Occupied\" As It Appears In The ESA Is Ambiguous, The FWS's Determination That The Riverside Fairy Shrimp Occupies Areas Where The Shrimp Are Not (And Can In Fact Never Be) Located Is Unreasonable\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   It is undisputed that the ESA does not define the term \"occupied\" or the related and repeated phrase \"geographical area occupied by the species[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cape Hatteras Access Pres.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Suppl. Br.

Thus, this Court rejects Defendants' suggestion that the issue of whether all of Subunit 5c is occupied has already been definitively resolved and is therefore not at issue in the context of this briefing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 2d Suppl.

By contrast, under a permissible construction of the statute, the record evidence in this case establishes that the Riverside fairy shrimp occupy the one-acre stock pond on Subunit 5(c) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 003806-11, 004784-817, 037261-76), and that two of the three PCEs that pertain to the Riverside fairy shrimp-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"ephemeral wetland habitat\" (PCE 1) and \"the topography and soils that support ponding during winter and spring months\" (PCE 3) (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   055645)-exist throughout the entirety of that pond, such that the one-acre pond itself qualifies as \"the specific area[ ] within the geographical area occupied by the species ... on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management considerations or protection\" per the plain text of the section 1532(5)(A)(i) of Title 16 of the United States Code. This means that the stock pond itself can be properly designated as \"occupied\" critical habitat consistent with the ESA, and it also compels the conclusion that the FWS's extension of the \"occupied\" critical habitat designation to the entirety of Subunit 5(c)-the additional 56 acres of land surrounding the stock pond where the species do not and cannot exist but where the PCEs are present-was an unauthorized (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , arbitrary and capricious) critical habitat determination that violated the APA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Alaska Oil and Gas Association v.

(Defs.' 2d Suppl. Br. at 16-17.) Of course, this statutory language says nothing about whether, and to what extent, the agency his required to conduct a study prior to making the challenged critical habitat designation. At most, the \"best scientific data available\" language indicates that Congress was aware of the limits of scientific knowledge and ability, and thus has authorized the agency to use only the best\n   <em>\n    available\n   </em>\n   information when it undertakes to make the necessary findings for the purpose of making a critical habitat designation. To read that language to authorize the agency to\n   <em>\n    dispense\n   </em>\n   with making the \"essential for conservation of the species\" finding entirely not only renders section 1532(5)(A)(ii) of Title 16 of the United States Code meaningless, but also clearly undermines Congress's intent with respect to requiring the agency to make such a finding at all. And the D.C. Circuit has already addressed the mistaken contention that an agency has authority to act in the absence of data regarding the scope of the watershed: \"the absence of a requirement for the Service to collect more data on its own is not the same as an authorization to act without data to support its conclusions, even acknowledging the deference due to agency expertise.\"\n   <em>\n    Otay Mesa Prop.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3416328,3556764\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/914/\">\n    646 F.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This means that the FWS can take no comfort in the fact that it has not yet utilized its expertise to do the kinds of scientific analysis that are needed to make a proper unoccupied critical habitat designation; given the text of the statute, the fact that studies do not currently exist cannot possibly mean that such analysis need not be done. That is, if the ESA's requirement that the unoccupied critical habitat designation be extended only to those geographical areas that are \"essential for conservation of the species\" means anything, then the agency that implements the ESA has to do what it takes to make the requisite finding before it designates an area as unoccupied critical habitat pursuant to that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The bottom line is this: there is no dispute that the scope of the area of unoccupied habitat in the instant case was determined based on the existence and location of the PCEs on Subunit 5(c), and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   on any assessment of the extent of land area that is\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   essential to support the Riverside fairy shrimp, which is what the ESA requires. Thus, the FWS's conclusion that 56 acres of land around the one-acre stock pond qualifies as unoccupied critical habitat turned solely on where PCEs were co-located, rather than how much land was necessary to support the needs of the Riverside fairy species (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 41:7-16), when the plain language of the statute demands that the FWS undertake to make the latter determination.

As this Court has explained in detail, the designation of Otay Mesa's property as critical habitat suffers from substantive defects stemming from the FWS's failure to delineate the area that the species occupies properly, and that failure renders the occupied critical habitat designation unsustainable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .) In addition, the agency acted contrary to the statute and in an arbitrary and capricious fashion when it looked solely to the presence of PCEs to determine what part of the area surrounding the stock pond qualifies as unoccupied critical habitat and essentially ignored the statutory requirement that it actually undertake an assessment of whether and to what extent the surrounding area is \"essential\" to the conservation of the Riverside fairy shrimp species. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.B,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   There is also no evidence that vacatur of the critical habitat designation at issue here will necessarily be disruptive of, or threaten, the species.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Builders Ass'ns of N.

As has been repeatedly explained, the Riverside fairy shrimp is listed as an endangered species and the record demonstrates that that species currently occupies only the one-acre stock pond. The listing alone provides substantial protection for the species, and vacatur of the erroneous critical habitat rule \"will in no way disturb the considerable protections, both civil and criminal, afforded to the [species] as a listed species under the ESA.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9295176\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/293/1/#p4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pub.

Indeed, in 2002, during prior proceedings involving this very species and critical habitat determination, the FWS asked that the designation be vacated and the matter remanded to the FWS to allow the agency to redo the economic analysis for the critical habitat, and the agency specifically represented that \"vacatur of the critical habitat designations during the remand period will not compromise the conservation needs of the two species\" in light of the \"host of regulatory protections beyond those found in Section 7\" that would protect the species \"even absent critical habitat designation.\"\n   <em>\n    Bldg.
