For years, Wells Fargo increased its sales by engaging in illegal banking practices, defrauding customers nationwide for its own financial gain.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. Wells Fargo employees were shamed, disciplined, demoted, and fired for failing to meet sales goals.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-23. They were incentivized to pad sales numbers by management's acceptance and sometimes even active encouragement of misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23. As a result of the intense pressure to meet unattainably high sales quotas, Wells Fargo employees created fake accounts and signed customers up for debit cards, credit cards, and online banking services without their knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Wells Fargo employees regularly practiced techniques such as (1) \"bundling,\" in which a customer was falsely told that the account or product the customer desired was only available as part of a package with other unneeded products or services; (2) \"pinning,\" in which an employee obtained a debit card and assigned it a PIN without customer authorization, and then used that PIN to enroll the customer in online banking services without permission; and (3) \"sandbagging,\" in which the opening or processing of accounts was purposefully delayed without customer knowledge so that the accounts could be included in a new sales reporting period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24. Wells Fargo employees also lied to customers by representing that accounts did not have fees when they did, or by falsely telling customers that they were required to open a savings account to avoid a monthly checking account fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Employees forged customer signatures or obtained customer signatures fraudulently by stating that forms to be signed were related to existing accounts, then using those forms to open additional accounts without customer knowledge or consent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11722121\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/251/#p258\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Wells Fargo employees did inform a customer that an account had been opened and the customer would be receiving a credit card, they then told the customer to simply destroy the card if the account was unwanted and led the customer to erroneously believe that this would terminate the account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2016, Wells Fargo's actions were exposed to the public when the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) announced that \"Wells Fargo employees secretly opened unauthorized accounts to hit sales targets and receive bonuses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The CFPB entered into a Consent Order (CFPB Consent Order, Doc. 26-1) with WFBNA and its \"successors and assigns,\" finding that WFBNA had violated the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 (CFPA) by opening unauthorized accounts, submitting unauthorized credit card applications, enrolling customers in unrequested online banking services, and ordering and activating debit cards without customer knowledge or consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27; CFPB Consent Order \u00b6\u00b6 3(k), 9-37. Wells Fargo's own analysis concluded that 1,534,280 deposit accounts may not have been properly authorized or funded, and that 85,000 of these accounts had incurred $2 million in fees. Compl. \u00b6 28. Similarly, Wells Fargo found that 565,443 credit card accounts may have been unauthorized, and 14,000 of those accounts had incurred over $400,000 in fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   One outside record review reported a total of 3.5 million potentially fake accounts and 528,000 Wells Fargo customers who had been enrolled in online bill pay without their consent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.

CFPB Consent Order \u00b6 61. The California Enforcement Action is the lawsuit\n   <em>\n    People v.

However, in Paragraph 85, the CFPB \"releases and discharges Respondent from all potential liability for law violations that the Bureau has or might have asserted based on the practices described in Section IV of this Consent Order, to the extent such practices occurred before the Effective Date and the Bureau knows about them as of the Effective Date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants argue that the release in Paragraph 85 precludes other actions brought under the CFPA that are based on the same illegal practices. They assert that the other legal actions allowed by the CFPB Consent Order are limited to non-CFPA claims, which the CFPB could not have asserted and to which the release does not apply. By its terms, Paragraph 85 of the CFPB Consent Order releases WFBNA, along with its successors and assigns, from \"all potential liability\" for violations of the CFPA that occurred before the date of the order and were known to the CFPB.

Claims I-III allege actions only by \"Defendants\" or \"Wells Fargo\" and do not mention WFC specifically other than one allegation in Claim II that Navajo consumers had reasonably relied on WFC to protect their interests.

The same types of unauthorized accounts and services form the primary factual basis for both actions. The Nation argues that its allegations that Navajo consumers were specifically targeted with predatory sales practices describe conduct that was not at issue in the CFPB proceeding and is not part of the same series of transactions. However, the Nation's claims under the CFPA are still based on the same systemic practice of unfair, abusive, and deceptive acts that was detailed in the CFPB Consent Order. The acts occurred during the same time period, in the same general location at WFBNA's retail banking facilities, and with the same origin and motivation associated with Defendants' high-pressure sales culture. The Nation alleges specific facts, not listed in\n   the CFPB Consent Order, as to improper practices at the particular retail branches on and near the Nation and the use and effect of these practices on Navajo consumers. However, it also argues that WFC bears responsibility for actions at WFBNA branch locations precisely because they were part of Defendants' corporate culture. The Court concludes that these practices are part of the same series of connected occurrences and form the same cause of action for preclusion purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Despite the similar basis for the actions, preclusion is only appropriate if the Nation is in privity with the CFPB because the Nation was not a party to the CFPB Consent Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

The relief sought by the Nation largely consists of compensatory damages for this individual harm, in the amount of improper fees, service charges, and penalties that were assessed on unauthorized cards and accounts, collections and damage to individuals' credit reports, emotional distress suffered by tribal members, and where allowed, punitive or treble damages. The Nation asserts that because of the particular vulnerability of the Navajo people and their lack of access to any other banking option, Defendants' predatory practices have also harmed the Nation as a whole, and it argues that it seeks civil penalties and injunctive and declaratory relief to remedy this widespread harm, in addition to compensation for tribal members' private losses. These asserted quasi-sovereign interests might be sufficient to establish\n   <em>\n    parens patriae\n   </em>\n   standing, at least at the motion to dismiss stage.

With respect to its federal statutory claims, the Court concludes that Plaintiff has failed to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In its ECOA claim, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants targeted members of the Navajo Nation for unauthorized credit card accounts based on their race and their age.

Plaintiff claims that as a result, tribal members were damaged in the amount of the fees assessed on the unauthorized credit cards, the harm done to individuals' credit reports, and the emotional distress caused by the violations. Compl. \u00b6 146. However, Plaintiff does not plead any harm to the Nation itself from these alleged violations, and the private monetary relief requested would not redress any such injury. Under the EFTA, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants issued unrequested debit cards and PINs that were either already validated when issued or were later validated without the proper disclosures or verification of the consumer's identity. Compl. \u00b6 154;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1693i. The Nation does not describe damages that are specific to this claim, but the alleged injuries were inflicted on individuals, and Plaintiff does not plead any separate harm to its quasi-sovereign interests. Plaintiff similarly alleges that Defendants violated TILA by issuing unrequested credit cards to members of the Navajo Nation.

Again, Plaintiff does not plead any facts demonstrating broader harm to its quasi-sovereign interests, beyond the impact on individual tribal members. Additionally, neither the EFTA nor TILA provide relief beyond actual and statutory damages. Finally, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated the FCRA by regularly pulling the credit reports of Navajo consumers without their knowledge or consent.

Here, Plaintiff has failed to allege facts that would support its assertion of injury to the Nation as a whole, apart from the private injuries suffered by members of the Navajo tribe. Plaintiff argues that its economy was damaged, but pleads only financial harm to identifiable individuals. It alleges discrimination based on race and age, but claims no resulting injury other than private financial and emotional damages. \"[N]o state has a legitimate quasi-sovereign interest in seeing that consumers or any other group of persons receive a given sum of money.\"\n   <em>\n    Mid-Atlantic Toyota\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1855070\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/704/125/\">\n    704 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   129 n.8 (internal quotation marks omitted).
