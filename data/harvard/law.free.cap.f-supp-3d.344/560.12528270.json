The Trade Act of 1974 (the \"Trade Act\") requires the President to \"seek information and advice from representative elements of the private sector and the non-Federal governmental sector\" regarding trade negotiations and policy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202155\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Act authorizes the President to establish industry-specific advisory committees, populated by representative members of key sectors and groups of the economy affected by trade policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2155(c). The result is a system of \"industry trade advisory committees\" (\"ITACs\") that are dedicated to different sectors of the economy and are comprised of members from the private sector who \"provide policy advice, technical advice and information, and advice on other factors\" relevant to trade negotiations. \u00a7 2155(d). These ITACs were called on during the course of TPP negotiations to provide counsel to U.S. Government negotiators. Among the disputed documents at issue here are communications sent among ITAC members, USTR, and other private sector actors, discussing various issues related to TPP negotiations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IPWatch I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160216\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/726/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 731-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' FOIA Request and\n    <em>\n     IP Watch I\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs submitted their initial FOIA request on March 23, 2012, seeking, among other things, draft text of TPP provisions related to intellectual property, U.S. negotiation positions regarding intellectual property, and communications between USTR and certain ITACs. USTR withheld all responsive documents save for some partial disclosures of communications between USTR and ITACs. After Plaintiffs filed suit in this Court on December 18, 2013, the parties entered into a joint stipulation pursuant to which USTR would undertake searches for a representative sample set of documents using search terms proffered by Plaintiffs, which would then provide the exclusive basis for the litigation going forward. As relevant here, USTR's searches produced roughly 700 pages of emails among USTR, ITAC members, and nonmember, private-sector consultants, and forty-one pages of postings to the government's Cleared Advisor site, all of which were identified as a result of search terms provided by Plaintiffs. These communications are referred to as \"ITAC Communications.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   USTR withheld some ITAC Communications in full and some only partially by redacting portions of responsive communications. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment on the validity of USTR's withholdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    IP Watch I\n   </em>\n   was decided on September 25, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IPWatch I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160216\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/726/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court upheld USTR's withholdings of memoranda and drafts chapters of the TPP, as well as select ITAC Communications pursuant to FOIA Exemption 1 (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ), which exempts from FOIA information that is properly classified pursuant to an Executive Order.\n   <em>\n    IPWatch I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160216\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/726/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 736-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Regarding the remaining ITAC Communications, USTR invoked FOIA Exemption 3 ( \u00a7 552(b)(3) ), covering information specifically authorized to be withheld by statute, FOIA Exemption 4 ( \u00a7 552(b)(4) ), covering trade secrets and confidential commercial information, and FOIA Exemption 5 ( \u00a7 552(b)(5) ), covering intra-agency documents that would be traditionally privileged in civil litigation. The Court rejected USTR's use of Exemption 5, holding that communications among ITACs and U.S. officials were not \"intra-agency.\"\n   <em>\n    IPWatch I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160216\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/726/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 747-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, although the Court held that the provision of the Trade Act governing ITAC Communications,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202155\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g), served as a withholding statute for purposes of Exemption 3, the Court was unable to rule on the propriety of USTR's withholdings under Exemption 3 or 4 because USTR had not provided sufficient evidence to sustain its burden of withholding documents under those exemptions. Thus, the Court requested from USTR more detailed and document-specific justifications for the agency's withholdings under those two FOIA exemptions.\n   <em>\n    IPWatch I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160216\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/726/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 739-47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To support its withholdings of ITAC Communications pursuant to Exemption 3,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in November and December of 2015 USTR submitted: (1) two\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indices describing communications and providing withholding justifications for information submitted by email or posted to the Cleared Advisor Website and withheld almost exclusively pursuant to FOIA Exemption 3 (Doc. 78, Ex. 1; Doc. 71, Ex. 2); (2) affidavits and declarations of USTR employees and ITAC members attesting to the nature of those communications and the custom and practice of communications between USTR, ITAC members, and the private sector (Docs. 73, 74-75, 86, 88); and (3) a copy of the agency manual outlining the operations of the ITACs that was in effect at the time of the ITAC communications at issue here (Doc. 72, Ex. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The twelve TPP countries signed the final agreement on February 4, 2016. On February 15, 2016, Plaintiffs moved under Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, seeking reconsideration of the Court's affirmance of the withholdings USTR made under Exemption 1. (Doc. 90). Plaintiffs urged reconsideration because the Court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    IP Watch I\n   </em>\n   turned in part on the fact that TPP negotiations were still ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   was decided on August 31, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Recognizing that the Court's prior opinion had determined that Section 2155(g) served as a withholding statute for purposes of Exemption 3, but had not expressly identified the operative test for determining when a communication is submitted \"in confidence\" under that Section, the Court clarified which standard controlled. In doing so, the Court adopted the well-established test set forth in\n   <em>\n    Landano\n   </em>\n   for FOIA Exemption 7(D), which exempts information submitted to law enforcement that could reveal the identity of a confidential source.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Landano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    508 U.S. 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 172,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    124 L.Ed.2d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). The Court\n   therefore held that the operative test for determining when a communication is \"submitted in confidence\" \"is whether the submitter 'provided information under an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances from which such an assurance could be reasonably inferred.' \"\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Grand Cent.

Having clarified the appropriate evidentiary standard applicable to Section 2155(g), the Court withheld decision on the cross-motions for summary judgment and permitted the parties to submit additional declarations or evidence and further brief that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 348-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also determined that USTR could rely on the ITAC Manual to support its withholding of communications under Section 2155(g), which generally governs information submitted in confidence between the U.S. Government and members of the private sector, and that ITAC members were part of the private sector for purposes of Section 2155(g)(2), which specifically governs \"advice submitted in confidence by the private sector or non-Federal government\" to the U.S. government or its advisory committees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 349-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, the Court denied Plaintiff's Rule 60 motion in substantial part, principally reasoning that the public release of the TPP did not eliminate the risk that disclosure of memoranda and draft chapters could logically and plausibly harm foreign relations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 353-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For support, USTR principally relies on the two\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   indices and declarations from USTR officials and ITAC members. USTR points to the declarations of USTR officials Barbara Weisel and Melissa Keppel, the declaration of Ingrid Mitchem, the Director of the Industry Trade Advisory Center, and the declaration of Omar Kahn, a USTR official charged with managing the relationship between USTR and ITACs. USTR also relies on the affidavits of three ITAC members: Greg S. Slater, Douglas T. Nelson, and Jay Taylor, each of whom sent communications to USTR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Specifically, Mitchem states that as a matter of course ITAC members are regularly provided a security briefing instructing them that their communications with USTR \"are considered confidential.\" Supplemental Declaration of Ingrid Mitchem, dated October 25, 2016 (Doc. 111) \u00b6 1. These briefings occur when a member joins an ITAC, when an ITAC is re-chartered, \"and during mandatory annual online security refreshers during\" a member's term of service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1381288,3668203\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/164/20/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Likewise, Kahn avers that it is the position of the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs and Public Engagement that the ITAC Manual is \"co-extensive\" with Section 2155(g) and therefore \"protects from disclosure communications from private sector individuals ... that were submitted in confidence ... to USTR.\" Declaration of Omar Kahn, dated November 6, 2015 (Doc. 73) \u00b6 3. Each of the three ITAC members noted above has submitted sworn declarations attesting to their belief that communications submitted to USTR were submitted in confidence. For example, Taylor asserts that he received security briefings instructing him as to the confidential nature of his communications, and that he was provided with the ITAC Manual and informed that, pursuant to section VI of the Manual and Section 2155(g) of the Trade Act, his communications \"would be considered confidential, unless otherwise noted.\" Declaration of Jay Taylor, dated November 7, 2016 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. Although Slater and Nelson make no mention of receiving any security briefings, they likewise aver that they operated with the \"understanding that [their, and their private sector affiliates',] communications would be held in confidence in accordance with [ section] 2155(g)(2) and (g)(3) and section VI.C of the ITAC Operations Manual.\" Declaration of Greg S. Slater, dated November 5, 2015 at \u00b6 5 (Doc. 75); Declaration of Douglas T. Nelson, dated November 3, 2015 at \u00b6 6 (Doc. 74). The ITAC Manual-a contemporaneous document in force during the term of the ITAC members service- in turn requires ITAC members to receive a security briefing, sign a \"classified non-disclosure agreement,\" and \"safeguard confidential information.\" Manual at VI.1. Finally, tracking the substance of Section 2155(g)(2), the ITAC Manual informs members that \"advice provided by the Committees themselves\" is one category of information that may be provided \"to the U.S. Government in confidence.\" Manual at VI.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In response, Plaintiffs appear to concede this point and do not contend that USTR has improperly withheld communications sent from ITAC Members to USTR pursuant to Section 2155(g)(2). This is for good reason. The language of the ITAC Manual and Section 2155(g)(2) clearly protects from disclosure \"advice submitted in confidence .. in connection with matters [related to a member's ITAC service].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202155\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Manual at VI.4.

Because an understanding of the ITAC Manual informs the parties' claims regarding whether the communications at issue were submitted in confidence, the Court turns first to the latter requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    (a) The Requirements of the ITAC Manual\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As an initial matter, the parties dispute whether documents\n   <em>\n    withheld\n   </em>\n   under Section 2155(g)(3) must comply with rules promulgated pursuant to that statute. In\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   , the Court concluded that the ITAC Manual, which is promulgated by USTR and the U.S. Department of Commerce, could serve as one of these rules for purposes of withholdings made under Section 2155(g)(3).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d at 350-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It claims that this conclusion follows because Section 2155(g)(3) requires only that the information be \"submitted in confidence\" by USTR, and then carves out from this general protection the limited circumstances\n   under which documents submitted by USTR may be \" 'disclosed in accordance with rules issued by [several agencies].' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202155\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 2155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(3) ). Under USTR's view, however, the ITAC Manual does not limit or qualify the substantive scope of (g)(3)'s protections, but merely provides the conditions under which protected information may be disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs, on the other hand, contend that Section 2155(g)(3)'s protections are not unlimited, but circumscribed by rules promulgated by USTR, in this case the ITAC Manual.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Letter Brief, Dated December 23, 2016 at 11. The Manual states that \"[i]information provided in confidence by the U.S. Government to Committee members will in general be clearly designated as falling into one of two groups: ... Security-Classified Information\" and \"Trade-Sensitive Information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Manual at VI.1-3. Plaintiffs read the ITAC Manual as specifying that\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   communications falling into one of those two categories of information may be considered as \"submitted in confidence\" within the meaning of Section 2155(g)(3). Pls.' Letter Brief at 11. Here, USTR does not seek to withhold any communications as \"security-classified information\" and instead opts to withhold all USTR-ITAC communications as \"trade-sensitive information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply, dated January 17, 2017 at 6 &amp; n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court rejects USTR's claim that Section 2155(g)(3) protects \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   information submitted in confidence by USTR to ITAC members.\" Def.'s Reply at 6 (emphasis in original). This claim runs counter to the Court's prior decisions in this case and is undermined by USTR's prior arguments before the Court. Section 2155(g)(3), provides not only that \"[i]nformation submitted in confidence by [USTR] to any [ITAC], may be disclosed in accordance with rules issued by [USTR],\" but it also instructs that \"[s]uch rules shall define the categories of information which require restricted or confidential handling by [ITACs] considering the extent to which public disclosure of such information can reasonably be expected to prejudice the development of trade policy, priorities, or United States negotiating objectives.\" \u00a7 2155(g)(3). Accordingly, in concluding that Section 2155(g)(3) could serve as a withholding statute in\n   <em>\n    IP Watch I\n   </em>\n   , the Court read that language as \"instruct[ing] USTR to establish rules for sorting between (i) information provided by the agency that requires 'restricted or confidential handling,' and (ii) information provided by the agency that is appropriate for 'public disclosure.' \"\n   <em>\n    IPWatch I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4160216\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/134/726/\">\n    134 F.Supp.3d at 741\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Consistent with that reasoning, in\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   the Court that held that USTR could rely on\n   the Manual for withholdings made under (g)(3) because the Manual \"categorize[d] information submitted by [USTR] into two groups-'Security-Classified Information' and 'Trade-Sensitive Information' \" and provided guidance and examples \"as to what constitutes those two categories\" of information.\n   <em>\n    IP Watch II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n    205 F.Supp.3d 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 349-50. Having advocated that (g)(3) and the Manual refer to categories of information that may be withheld (and not just disclosed), USTR cannot now be heard to argue that neither (g)(3) nor the Manual limit the kinds of communications that may be withheld by establishing specific categories of information that are protectable. The Court therefore concludes that communications withheld pursuant to Section 2155(g)(3) must fall into one of the categories identified by the ITAC Manual: they must be \"security-classified information\" or \"trade-sensitive information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Next, the parties dispute whether communications submitted by USTR must be explicitly marked \"trade-sensitive information\" to be properly withheld. USTR appears to concede that none of the communications at issue were marked \"trade-sensitive information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Letter Br. at 6; Pls.' Letter Br. At 11 (stating \"none of the emails from USTR were marked 'trade-sensitive' \"). Relying principally on the Manual's statement that \"trade sensitive information ... will be clearly identified to ensure proper handling,\" Manual at VI.3, \u00a7 VI.4.(b), Plaintiffs contend that this failure is fatal and that USTR has therefore not demonstrated that the communications it seeks to withhold satisfy the requirements set forth in the ITAC Manual. Plaintiffs' Letter Brief, Dated December 23, 2016 at 11. USTR, in contrast, asserts that (g)(3) does not require that communications be marked \"trade-sensitive information\" to be properly withheld. Def.'s Letter Br. At 6. In support of its claim, USTR notes that (g)(3) contains no express language requiring that documents be marked and the Manual does not affirmatively provide that USTR's failure to explicitly mark documents voids (g)(3)'s statutory protections.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=205%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20334\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   USTR also relies on case law suggesting that procedural defects do not require the disclosure of the documents in question.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court concludes that USTR's failure to mark documents \"trade-sensitive information\" does not defeat its claim for withholding. As an initial matter, the section of the Manual that establishes the categories of information that will be considered as \"provided in confidence,\" states only that such information \"will\n   <em>\n    in general\n   </em>\n   be clearly designated as falling into\" the two established categories.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Manual \u00a7 VI.B.1 (emphasis added). At a minimum, this language suggests, contrary to Plaintiff's claim, that an express marking of documents is not a prerequisite to proper withholding under (g)(3).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bergheim v. Sirona Dental Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=711%20Fed.%20Appx.%2043\">\n    711 Fed.Appx. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 46 (2d Cir. 2017) (noting that \"[a] general rule is, by definition, not an absolute bar\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Moreover, as USTR notes, nothing in (g)(3) requires that documents be marked to be properly withheld. Although (g)(3) instructs that rules promulgated pursuant to that statute \"\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   define the categories of information which require restricted or confidential handling,\" it does not require that documents so categorized must be marked or handled in a particular way. \u00a7 2155(g)(3) (emphasis added). This requirement is consistent with Exemption 3's mandate that statutes authorizing the withholding of communications establish \"criteria for withholding\" or refer to \"particular types of maters to be withheld.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). And notably, the language of Exemption 3 stands in stark contrast to Exemption 1, which exempts from disclosure matters that are \"specifically authorized under criteria established by an\n   Executive order\" and requires that such documents \"\n   <em>\n    are in fact properly classified pursuant\n   </em>\n   to such Executive order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    at 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) (emphasis added). If Congress had wished to require strict adherence to procedural criteria, it could have codified it in either Exemption 3 or (g)(3), as it did in Exemption 1. Instead, (g)(3) cuts the other way. It provides that rules promulgated pursuant to that section \"shall, to the maximum extent feasible, permit meaningful consultations by advisory committee members with persons affected by matters [relating to trade negotiations and trade policy].\" \u00a7 2155(g)(3). In view of the broad aims this provision was designed to affect, the Court is reluctant to read (g)(3) or the Manual as imposing procedural requirements that find no basis in the statute and would thwart its stated aims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Here, the Manual defines \"trade-sensitive information\" as information that \"would reasonably be expected to prejudice U.S. trade policy objectives if publicly disclosed\" and provides a range of examples of the type of information that would qualify for protection under the Manual. Manual \u00a7 VI.B.1.(b). Barbra Weisel, the Assistant United States Trade Representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific and the chief negotiator for the TPP, avers that USTR solicited the views of ITAC members on topics ranging from technical decisions about the \"wording choices in draft negotiating texts to comments on overall U.S. policy on trade-related issues.\" Declaration of Barbara Weisel (Doc. 44) \u00b6 27. Weisel further testified that the U.S. and other participating TPP countries entered into a confidentiality agreement at the outset of negotiations.

The fact that the U.S. committed to keep confidential \"emails related to the substance of the [TPP] negotiations, and other information exchanged in the context of the negotiations,\" as explained in the Weisel declaration, clearly indicates that these communications \"would reasonably be expected to prejudice U.S. trade policy objectives if publicly disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, the withheld communications also fall within the ambit of the examples provided in the Manual.

For support, USTR relies on the declarations of Mitchem and Kahn, USTR officials responsible for managing the relationship between USTR and ITACs, as well as the ITAC Manual itself. Specifically, Mitchem avers that Section VI.B.3 of the Manual \"authorizes an ITAC member to consult with 'non-members in the private sector, both in their own firms or elsewhere in industry, who may be affected by proposed trade agreements or trade policy matters.' \" Mitchem Decl. \u00b6 6 (quoting ITAC Manual, Section VI.B.3).

Mitchem Supp. Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Additionally, USTR points to the testimony of Mehta, the Acting Assistant U.S. Trade Representative charged with negotiating the TPP, who testified that he believed his communications with non-ITAC members would be held in confidence pursuant to Section 2155(g)(3) and the ITAC Manual.

In addition to the declarations from four ITAC members averring that they understood their own communications with non-ITAC members would be kept in confidence, the declarations of Mitchem, Kahn, and Mehta, and the ITAC Manual itself, provide ample evidence that ITAC members were informed as a matter of course that their communications with the private sector would be provided \"in confidence.\" Mitchem Decl. \u00b6 7 (quoting ITAC Manual, Section VI.C (\"the private sector ... may provide information to the U.S. Government in confidence in connection with trade negotiations\") ).

Notwithstanding that proviso, the Manual\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   instructs that information provided by the private sector is \"provided in confidence,\" and directs that such information be kept confidential because it \"may include\n   ... industry data regarding productive capacity, labor costs, and marketing strategies; the effects of various negotiating results on firms' financial performance; and final positions in connection with various issues under negotiation.\" Manual at VI.1.C. Plaintiffs' analysis, therefore, fails to account for the fact that ITAC members may derive their expectation of confidentiality from the information being received from, and discussed with, members of the private sector.

The flaw in this argument flows from the fact that ITACs are managed by the USTR, which is obligated to \"make available to the [ITACs] such staff, information, personnel, ... and assistance as it may reasonably require to carry out its activities,\" 2155 (b)(3), (h), and is the body that conducts trade negotiations on behalf of the United States. Indeed, the individuals Plaintiffs claim vitiate the ITAC members' expectation of confidentiality are the very individuals that were charged with negotiating the TPP based on the advice provided by ITAC members and non-ITAC members. For example, Probir Mehta, an Acting Assistant U.S. Trade Representative charged with negotiating the TPP, is one such individual Plaintiffs claim destroys ITAC members' expectation of confidentiality. In short, the whole point of ITACs having \"meaningful consultations\" with the private sector is so that USTR can negotiate effectively.

Although the Court finds this declaration further supports the conclusion, discussed\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    , that non-ITAC members gave and were given express assurances of confidentiality, it concludes that such declarations are not necessary to its holding.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Moreover, even if ITAC members provided, erroneously or otherwise, \"trade-sensitive information\" to nonmembers, the Court is not persuaded that such an error would forfeit the protections of Section 2155(g)(3), given its purpose is to ensure meaningful consultation, or that disclosure would be the appropriate remedy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Plaintiffs assert that to the extent ITAC members attest to the non-ITAC members own understanding, that testimony is hearsay, and may not be considered at summary judgment.
