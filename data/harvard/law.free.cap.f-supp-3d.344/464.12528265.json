CHEN, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 1986, Defendant Rustico Aala (\"Rustico\"), then aged 42, raped his sister Maria Rossana Aala Quinio (\"Plaintiff\"), then aged 16, and impregnated her. In 1987, Plaintiff gave birth to a child, who was placed for adoption immediately thereafter. Plaintiff kept the rape and pregnancy a secret from everyone in her family - except her siblings - until 2009. Rustico soon thereafter agreed to enter into a written contract (\"the Agreement\") with Plaintiff to compensate her with cash, a new car, a stake in his properties in the Philippines, and part of his retirement accounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2015, Plaintiff filed this action alleging that Rustico and his wife Defendant Lerma Aala (\"Lerma\") (collectively \"Defendants\") breached the Agreement by failing to perform their contractual obligations. The parties allege jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   because the parties are of diverse citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. Before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment in which she seeks a finding of liability against Defendants, specific performance of Rustico's obligation to convey to Plaintiff his properties in the Philippines and 40% of his retirement accounts, including a joint account shared with Lerma, and a declaratory judgment binding Lerma to the Court's decision. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants in part and denies in part Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Relevant Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff was born on 1969 in the Philippines, and immigrated to the United States when she was fourteen. (Pl's. 56.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   , Dkt. 103-21, at \u00b6 I-1.) At some time in August of 1986, Plaintiff\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   was raped by her brother Rustico. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 II-1.) At the time, Rustico was forty-two years old and Plaintiff was sixteen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 II-3.) Plaintiff gave birth to a child on or about May 13, 1987. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 II-4.) The child was subsequently placed for adoption. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 II-5.) Plaintiff does not know if the baby was a boy or a girl. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 II-6.) Plaintiff's two sisters, Yolanda and Marie, handled the hospital paperwork and bills. (Deposition of Maria Quinio (\"Plaintiff Dep.\"), Dkt. 103-2, at 142.) Plaintiff alleges that for twenty-three years she only told her siblings about the rape and the baby, but did not tell her parents. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 109.) Plaintiff told her husband Jesus Quinio (\"Jess\"), whom she married in 1996, in early November of 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 5, 2009, Jess and Plaintiff's sisters, Mary and Marie, met with Rustico and Lerma to discuss the incident. (Pl's. 56.1, at \u00b6 IV-5.) At that meeting, Jess gave Rustico a letter written by Plaintiff in which Plaintiff discloses the rape and recounts her years of secrecy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 15, 2009, Plaintiff wrote a letter to her family stating that Rustico raped her. (Amended Complaint, (\"Am. Compl.\"), Dkt. 7, at \u00b6 10.) On November 20, 2009,\n   Plaintiff and Rustico entered into the Agreement whereby Rustico agreed to compensate Plaintiff. (Pl's. 56.1, at \u00b6 IV-5.) The Agreement consists of three sections, the first of which reads:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Term and Conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   1.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The second section of the Agreement is a seemingly random collection of five blank forms from the Family Court of the State of New York: (1) Order to Show Cause (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 3); (2) Summons (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 4); (3) Order of Protection, setting forth general information about potential arrest and criminal prosecution (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 5); (4) Notice to Respondent Parent(s) in Child Abuse or Neglect Cases (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 6); and (5) Warrant of Arrest (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The third section is a one-page letter containing the signatures of both Plaintiff and Rustico.

Jess taped the conversation, which Plaintiff's lawyer had translated and transcribed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   6/30/15 Transcript, Dkt. 103-11.) In that conversation, Rustico acknowledged (1) his intention to make payments to Plaintiff, but claimed he did not have the money; (2) his obligation to convey his properties in the Philippines; and (3) that he was seeking Plaintiff's forgiveness. (Pl's. 56.1, at \u00b6 IV-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In total, Plaintiff claims that she is entitled to $1,172,000 in damages. (Dkt. 103-21, at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff filed her complaint in this action on August 20, 2015. (Dkt. 1.) The parties completed discovery on February 12, 2017. (Dkt. 65.) On March 24, 2017, Defendants moved to amend their answer to include a defense of mental incompetence as to Rustico. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 67.) On May 8, 2017, the Court granted Defendants leave to amend their answer. On May 10, 2017, Defendants filed an amended answer. (Dkt. 73.) On July 12, 2017, the Court held a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine the admissibility of the testimony of defense expert Dr. Sandlin Lowe regarding Rustico's alleged mental incompetence. On August 7, 2017, the Court precluded the testimony of Dr. Lowe, subject to Defendants submitting medical literature to support the doctor's opinions and testimony-which Defendants failed to do. On December 4, 2017, Plaintiff submitted her motion, seeking (1) summary judgment as to the breach of contract of claim; (2) to preclude Defendants from pursuing Defendants' affirmative defenses at trial; and (3) a declaratory judgment binding Lerma to the Court's decision. However, because neither party addressed the issue of whether the Agreement should be voided on public policy grounds, the Court requested supplemental briefing on that issue, which was completed on June 11, 2018.

The Agreement is difficult to interpret because it is so poorly drafted. Plaintiff's husband, Jess, a non-lawyer, drafted the Agreement and, in doing so, apparently sought to translate contractual terms from Tagalog into English. (Deposition of Jesus Quinio (\"Jess Quinio Dep.\"), Dkt. 103-6, at 23.) As discussed, the Agreement is composed of three parts: (1) a \"terms and conditions\" sheet; (2) a collection of blank Family Court forms; and (3) a signature page. The Agreement itself is replete with misspellings (\"[f]ailure to comply, I will file a legal suite [sic] of 'Rape of a child and incest' \"), ungrammatical and incoherent phrasings (\"[p]rovide lump sum damages that cause my life and suffering with the amount of $500,000 thousand dollars\"), unusual terms (\"[p]rovide and surrender your U.S. passport to me\"), and conflicting dates (stating on the signature page that the parties initially met to discuss the Agreement on December 15, 2009, but signed the Agreement on November 20, 2009)-all of which contribute to the Agreement's ambiguity. (Dkt. 103-7, at ECF 1-8.) In short, the Agreement is a muddled mess.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Nonetheless, the Court finds that based on the undisputed evidence-including the Agreement itself, Plaintiff's and Rustico's June 30, 2015 telephone conversation, and the deposition testimony given in this matter-there existed consideration on both sides for the contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   For her part, Plaintiff promised her silence as consideration; for his part, Rustico promised money and other assets. Though, as discussed next, the precise nature and scope of Plaintiff's promise of silence must be decided by the jury at trial, it is clear that she made a promise not to report Rustico's rape of her in exchange for money and other property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Court finds that the precise nature of Plaintiff's promise under the Agreement is ambiguous as a matter of law because it can be reasonably interpreted in multiple ways.\n   <em>\n    Sayers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515483\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/7/1091/#p1094\">\n    7 F.3d at 1095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a contract is ambiguous if it is susceptible \"to more than one reasonable interpretation.\");\n   <em>\n    Capital Dist.

One way to interpret the Agreement is that Plaintiff agreed not to report the rape to law enforcement or other governmental authorities. Another way to interpret the Agreement is that Plaintiff only agreed not to initiate a civil lawsuit. A third way to interpret the Agreement is\n   that Plaintiff will not tell\n   <em>\n    anyone\n   </em>\n   , including their parents (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 103-7 at ECF 2 (\"our parents ... will pay the price\") ), about the rape. Each of these promises could qualify as a form of consideration; the question is: which promise did Plaintiff make? The Court discusses the bases for each of these interpretations of the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With respect to the first interpretation, portions of the Agreement suggest that Rustico's non-compliance could result in Plaintiff going to law enforcement and seeking to initiate criminal prosecution against Rustico for the rape. Under each sub-part of the contract, the Agreement states, \"failure to comply, I will file a legal suite [sic] of 'Rape of a child and incest'.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 1.) This clause appears seven different times in the Agreement. Under the New York Penal Code, Rustico's alleged crime would be rape in the first degree.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20130.35\">\n    N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 130.35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A)(1) (\"A person is guilty of rape in the first degree when he or she engages in sexual intercourse with another person ... [b]y forcible compulsion.\"). Similarly, on the second page, the Agreement states, \"Again, failure to comply on my terms and conditions, you will be\n   <em>\n    persecuted\n   </em>\n   to the fullest extent of the law.\" (Dkt. 103-7, at ECF 2 (emphasis added).) Plaintiff's use of the phrase \"persecuted to the fullest extent of the law\"-despite her (or Jess's) seeming misspelling of the term \"prosecuted\"-implies that Plaintiff would initiate a criminal prosecution against Rustico in the event of a breach. Finally and most importantly, the second section of the Agreement consists of five blank Family Court forms that most notably include an arrest warrant and an order of protection with information about potential arrest and criminal prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   With respect to the second interpretation, portions of the Agreement, including some of the same sections just discussed, suggest that Plaintiff intended only to bring a civil lawsuit in the event that Rustico failed to comply with the Agreement. The term \"legal suite\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 1-2), even though it is misspelled, could refer to a civil, rather than criminal, proceeding. Although there is no specific cause of action for \"rape of a child and incest,\" there is a cause of action for sexual battery, which would encompass Rustico's conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    LB on behalf of PB v. Hines\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-CV-5238 (NSR),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201773138\">\n    2018 WL 1773138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2018) (\"A claim of sexual battery is ... the intentional wrongful sexual contact with another person without their consent.\"). Indeed, Plaintiff's language agreeing not to file a civil lawsuit could be adequate consideration for the contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sutton v. Shearson Hayden Stone, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4149572\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/490/98/#p103\">\n    490 F.Supp. 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 103 (S.D.N.Y. 1980) (\"It has long been recognized that a bargained for promise to forbear from commencing a lawsuit to collect a debt is good and valuable consideration for a reciprocal promise to pay that indebtedness.\") (citation omitted). Furthermore, the blank Family Court forms, such as the arrest warrant, could indicate that Plaintiff sought to bring an action in family court, a civil court, in the event that Rustico did not fulfill his obligations under the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   With respect to the third interpretation, the Agreement also suggests a blanket promise by Plaintiff not to tell anyone about the incident, since it suggests not only forbearance on initiating civil or criminal proceedings (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the public), but references family members as well, such as Plaintiff's and Rustico's \"parents\" (Dkt. 103-7 at ECF 2)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   . Indeed, to the extent\n   that Plaintiff refers to the Agreement as a \"confidentiality agreement\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8), it could be construed broadly as consideration to guarantee complete non-disclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Because the agreement is ambiguous as a matter of law, the Court must now determine \"whether there is extrinsic evidence regarding the parties' intent.\"\n   <em>\n    Kliszak v.

The extrinsic evidence comes from two exchanges during the deposition of Jess, the Agreement's drafter. In the first exchange, Jess testified about the meaning of the phrase \"Failure to comply I will file legal suite of a child and incest.\" He stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \"Q. Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   A. Failure to comply I will file legal suite of a child and incest. (In English.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Q. So that phrase is your contribution to that paragraph?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   A. Yes.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (Jess Quinio Dep., at 23.) Then, Jess testifies that the phrase was a reference to a lawsuit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   \"Q. Your testimony is that the phrase that \"failure to comply will result\" I am assuming lawsuit not law suite, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A. Yes, I had the wrong spelling.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In the second exchange, Jess testified that he never intended to go to the authorities and have Rustico arrested for his crime:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   \"Q. Sir, was that statement made by Rusty after you told him that you were going to try to have him arrested?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   A. I never said that I will have him arrested.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Although this evidence suggests that Plaintiff sought to punish Rustico's potential non-compliance with a civil suit, rather than a criminal prosecution or more general public disclosure, it does not clarify the ambiguity of the Agreement itself. Amazingly, there is no evidence in the record that either Plaintiff's or Defendants' counsel inquired about the arrest warrant or other Family Court forms that were attached to the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is also no evidence about Plaintiff's intended meaning of the phrase \"persecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" The unresolved ambiguity in the Agreement is fatal to resolution of the contractual dispute at issue at the summary judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nowak v.

Instead, on June 30, 2015-approximately six years after the parties signed the Agreement-Rustico\n   <em>\n    affirmed\n   </em>\n   his financial obligations during a taped telephone conversation with Plaintiff and Jess. Rustico admitted that he was obligated to provide compensation to Plaintiff, but stated that he was financially unable to do so. Rustico conceded that he was willing to pay Plaintiff $200 per month, but could not pay more. (Dkt. 103-11, at ECF 1) (\"What am I going to pay with? [Unintelligible] ... [W]ith meager pension ... I'm going to give $200 a month.\"). Later in the conversation, Plaintiff asks Rustico to transfer his property in the Philippines, one of the terms of the Agreement, and Rustico agrees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 3) (\"I will have it [the property in the Philippines] transferred to your [Plaintiff's] name.\"). Rustico also asks for Plaintiff's \"forgiveness\" during the conversation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 6.) These statements indicate that Rustico intended to be bound by the Agreement, or at least parts of it. Even assuming that Rustico was under duress at the time he signed the Agreement, he did not \"promptly\" disaffirm his obligations under the Agreement and instead ratified them. Based on the undisputed facts, Rustico is not entitled to claim duress as a matter of law. Accordingly, Rustico will not be allowed to assert a duress defense at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

On July 12, 2017, the Court held a\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing to determine the admissibility of the testimony of Defendants' proposed expert, Dr. Sandlin Lowe. (7/12/17 ECF Entry.) Following a hearing at which Dr. Lowe testified, the Court issued an order precluding his testimony, subject to Defendants submitting medical literature supporting Dr. Lowe's opinion that scans of Rustico's brain showed that his cognitive difficulties began eight to ten years prior to Dr. Lowe's examination of him. (8/7/17 ECF Entry.) Defendants failed to do so. Nonetheless, Defendants still seek to offer non-expert evidence in support of their incompetence defense, noting that the Court suggested at the\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   hearing that this evidence would be permissible during trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Defs.'

(Dkt. 103-22, at 12.) Plaintiff's argument, however, ignores the possibility that Rustico's alleged incompetence continued after the Agreement was signed and thus affected his decisions both at the time he signed the Agreement and when he ratified it six years later. Because Defendants allege that Rustico continuously suffered from mental incapacity, the jury must determine whether this condition impaired his ability to act reasonably at both points in time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1997%20WL%20357969\">\n    1997 WL 357969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (finding that where plaintiff did not \"allege that he continue[d] to suffer from the same undue influence, duress, mental disability or intoxication\" after he signed the contract or that \"these factors continued to impair his ability to act reasonably,\" plaintiff \"accept[ed] the benefits of the transaction\" and thereby \"ratified it\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

The Court rejects both of these arguments. Regarding subject matter jurisdiction, the Court notes that the parties are of diverse citizenship-Plaintiff lives in New Jersey and Defendants live in Queens, New York-and that Plaintiff seeks damages of $1,172,000, well over the jurisdictional threshold of $75,000. Defendants thus will not be permitted to present their subject matter jurisdiction defense at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Establishing personal jurisdiction over a party \"requires satisfaction of three primary elements\": (1) procedurally proper service of process on the defendant; (2) a statutory basis for personal jurisdiction;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   and (3) the exercise of jurisdiction must be consistent with \"constitutional due process principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Licci ex rel.

The available statutory bases in federal courts are enumerated by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k).

It is similarly undisputed that Rustico and Lerma live in Kew Gardens, Queens, which is part of the Eastern District of New York. Furthermore, Defendants raise no \"constitutional due process\" issues related to personal jurisdiction. Therefore, the Court finds that it has personal jurisdiction over Rustico, and Defendants will not be permitted to present their personal jurisdiction defense at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Defendants May Not Present Their Statute of Frauds Defense at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Defendants seek to introduce a defense that the Agreement is barred by the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds requires that certain agreements be in writing in order to be enforceable. Section 5-701 of New York's General Obligations Law, in which the statute of frauds is codified, provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   a.

Even though the Agreement consists of three sections-as opposed to one unified document-it establishes a contractual relationship between the parties. The Agreement and the June 2015 telephone conversation establish that the parties came to an agreement on most, if not all, of the terms. Accordingly, Defendants will not be permitted to present their statute of frauds defense at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Defendants May Not Present a Statute of Limitations Defense at Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Defendants seek to introduce a defense that this case is time-barred by the statute of limitations. The Court disagrees. The Agreement was signed on November 20, 2009.

Defendants' Remaining Defenses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Based on the foregoing, Defendants will be allowed to present the following defenses or affirmative defenses at trial: (1) that the Agreement is a contract of adhesion; (2) that the Agreement is void as being against public policy; and (3) that there was an accord and satisfaction that modified the Agreement. Each of these defenses involves a question of fact that must be determined by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    III. There Is a Genuine Issue of Material Fact as to whether Plaintiff is Entitled to Specific Performance that Precludes Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Plaintiff seeks specific performance of the contractual terms, including conveyance of the properties in the Philippines and title to 40% of Defendants' joint retirement account. Because there are genuine disputes of material fact for the jury to resolve, it would be premature for the Court to address specific performance. Accordingly, Plaintiff's claim for specific performance is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Plaintiff is Not Entitled to a Declaratory Judgment Binding Lerma\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Plaintiff seeks to bind Lerma to a judgment declaring that Plaintiff is the rightful owner of 40% of Rustico's retirement plan, and 40% of any retirement benefits to which Rustico is entitled (including Lerma's retirement benefits held in the joint account at the UN Federal Credit Union). (Dkt. 103-22, at 24.) The Court denies this request because there remains a dispute issue of material fact relating to the retirement account. The Agreement states: \"Provide documentation regarding your retirement plan, forty percent (40%) of\n   <em>\n    your retirement plan\n   </em>\n   will be given to me.\" (Dkt. 103-7, at ECF 1 (emphasis added).) Yet the parties dispute whether \"your retirement plan\" includes both Rustico and Lerma's retirement benefits. Plaintiff argues that the parties intended this phrase to include both Rustico and Lerma's retirement assets. Defendants argue that the Agreement as written makes no mention whatsoever of Lerma, and is not signed by her. This issue of fact must be resolved by the jury. The Court, therefore, cannot issue a declaratory judgment regarding Plaintiff's ownership of any retirement account covered by the Agreement at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment is granted in part and denied in part. The parties will submit a joint pre-trial order by October 25, 2018, and the Court will schedule a pre-trial conference thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    \"Pl's. 56.1\" refers to Plaintiff's 56.1 Statement.

However, under New York law, parties who have signed a contract are under the obligation to first read it, and cannot avoid a contract's effects on the ground that they did not read or understand its contents.\n    <em>\n     Marciano v.

Thus, as a matter of law, Rustico's failure to read or understand the Agreement does not relieve him of the obligation to be bound by it. Additionally, the Court will consider limitations on Defendants seeking to elicit or offer evidence or testimony at trial about Rustico's failure to read the contract, since it is irrelevant and may confuse the jury.
