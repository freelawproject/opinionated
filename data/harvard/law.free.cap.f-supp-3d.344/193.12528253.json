On January 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their original motion for conditional certification (ECF No. 11) and Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' original complaint (ECF No. 10). On May 17, 2018, Plaintiffs, with Defendant's consent, filed the operative Amended Complaint (ECF No. 29), which substituted Panera, LLC, as the defendant\n   for Panera Bread Co., and \"clarif[ied] the scope of the proposed collectives.\" ECF No. 30 at 1. According to the Amended Complaint, Defendant is a Delaware corporation operating hundreds of restaurants in the United States and Canada, and which had an annual revenue of over $2.5 billion in 2015. ECF No. 29, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 30-31. Plaintiffs allege that they were employed as assistant managers at two different Panera Bread restaurants: Mr. Meyer worked at a location in Washington, D.C., from April 2015 until October 2015; Mr. Cornelius worked at a location in Birmingham, Alabama, from October 2013 until September 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2032-1001\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 19-20, 25-26.

Rather, such employees are classified as \"exempt\" from the overtime provisions of the statute. Plaintiffs' core allegations assert that Defendant misclassified assistant managers at its restaurants as exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions (presumably pursuant to the executive exemption) although Defendant was aware (and, indeed, required) those employees to perform primarily non-managerial work, therefore entitling them to overtime pay for the hours they worked over 40 per week. ECF No. 29, \u00b6 2; ECF No. 36-1 at 14-15. Plaintiffs seek conditional certification of a collective that includes assistant managers classified as exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions who worked more than 40 hours in a week at Panera restaurants operated by Defendant. The putative collective is nationwide, with the exception of employees in New York, New Jersey, California, and Massachusetts. In support of their motion, Plaintiffs have filed, among other things, declarations from assistant managers at Panera restaurants in Washington, D.C. (ECF No. 36-5 (Alan Meyer) ), Alabama (ECF No. 36-6 (David Cornelius); ECF No. 36-8 (Steven Willms) ), Virginia (ECF No. 36-7 (Chelsea Romano) ), Massachusetts (ECF No. 36-9 (Joseph Whitfield) ), New Jersey (ECF No. 36-10 (Jacqueline Friscia) ), North Carolina (ECF No. 36-19 (Michele Thomas) ), and Wisconsin (ECF No. 36-20 (Elizabeth Tymus) ); a declaration from a general manager and training manager in New Jersey (ECF No. 36-11 (Diana Manrique) ); a declaration from the vice president of human resources for Panera (ECF No. 36-12 (Jaynanne Calaway-Habeck) ); and nearly-identical assistant manager job postings from Alabama, California, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington (ECF No. 36-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The declarations from the assistant managers are very similar to each other, and assert that the declarants\n   were assistant managers categorized as exempt employees by Defendant, that they regularly worked more than 40 hours per week, and that they were not paid overtime wages for the number of hours over 40 that they worked per week. ECF No. 36-5, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4-5; ECF No. 36-6, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 5-6; ECF No. 36-7, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2-3; ECF No. 36-8, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4-5; ECF No. 36-9, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4-5; ECF No. 36-10, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 8, 12; ECF No. 36-19, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 7-8; ECF No. 36-20, \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6-7. They further aver that the majority of their training was geared toward learning the non-managerial tasks performed by non-exempt employees, that the majority of their work time was spent on such non-managerial tasks while the general managers performed the managerial work, and that directives as to the management of the restaurants-including budgets, prices, restaurant layouts, marketing and promotion strategies, hours of operation, and dress code-came from Panera's corporate headquarters, sometimes filtered through regional directors. ECF No. 36-5, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 6-15; ECF No. 36-6, \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, 7-15; ECF No. 36-7, \u00b6\u00b6 5-14\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; ECF No. 36-8, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 6-16; ECF No. 36-9, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 7-16; ECF No. 36-10, \u00b6\u00b6 3-7, 14-15; ECF No. 36-19, \u00b6\u00b6 2-4, 9-17; ECF No. 36-20, \u00b6\u00b6 2-5, 8-18. Some of the assistant manager declarants also state that they either observed other assistant managers performing the same non-managerial work as they, themselves, did, or learned through speaking with other assistant managers that their mix of duties was similar. ECF No. 36-5, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17 (two other assistant managers at District of Columbia restaurant at which declarant worked, and others at another District of Columbia location); ECF No. 36-7, \u00b6 4 (one other assistant manager at the restaurant at which declarant worked); ECF No. 36-10, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18 (an unidentified number of assistant managers at various locations in New Jersey); ECF No. 36-19, \u00b6\u00b6 18 (four other assistant managers at two North Carolina restaurants at which declarant worked); ECF No. 36-20, \u00b6\u00b6 19 (two other assistant managers at Wisconsin restaurant at which declarant worked, and another assistant manager at location at which declarant trained). Each of the assistant manager declarants states that, in order to comply with Panera's practice of \"strictly control[ling] labor costs,\" hourly workers were often sent home and assistant managers were required to complete those non-exempt workers' job duties. ECF No. 36-5, \u00b6 7; ECF No. 36-6, \u00b6 8; ECF No. 36-7, \u00b6 6; ECF No. 36-8, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8; ECF No. 36-9, \u00b6 8; ECF No. 36-10, \u00b6 9; ECF No. 36-19, \u00b6 10; ECF No. 36-20, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. The general manager declarant asserts similar facts-that she observed assistant managers at a number of New Jersey locations performed primarily non-managerial work without being eligible for overtime pay, and that corporate headquarters established the policies and procedures to be followed in the restaurants. ECF No. 36-11, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 8-10, 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Panera's vice-president of human resources asserts that, in 2016, Defendant reclassified assistant managers from exempt employees to hourly non-exempt in response to \"the federal government's publication of a final rule that would have substantially increased the salary level requirement for employees to be classified as exempt from the [FLSA's] minimum wage and overtime requirements.\" ECF No. 36-12, \u00b6 5. Plaintiffs point out that although Defendant allegedly reclassified assistant managers as non-exempt and began paying them overtime, the duties performed by assistant managers did not change, thus suggesting that the original classification\n   as exempt was improper. ECF No. 36-1 at 11 n.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs have thus presented evidence that the assistant managers in the putative collective were classified as exempt from the FLSA's overtime provisions although the bulk of the work that they performed was non-managerial. They have further presented evidence that assistant managers regularly worked more than 40 hours per week. That is, Plaintiffs have presented evidence that their classification as exempt was improper under the statute, and that they should been paid overtime wages for any hours they worked over 40 per week. However, Plaintiffs do not allege that it was Defendant's official policy that assistant managers perform primarily non-managerial duties. Therefore, \"to obtain conditional certification, [they] must make a modest factual showing that they were subject to a common 'de facto illegal policy,' \" by \"providing evidence of 'some identifiable nexus which binds the named plaintiffs and potential class members together as victims of a particular practice.' \"\n   <em>\n    Costello v.

Although it is a close call, Plaintiffs have cleared the low bar that is applied at this juncture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs have presented evidence through declarations that Panera's corporate headquarters exerted significant control over the operations of its restaurants. They have indicated that the ordinary management hierarchy-regional director, general manager, assistant manager-tended to require that assistant managers perform non-managerial duties, as the bulk of the managerial duties were reserved, at the restaurant level, to the general manager. Moreover, they have linked the performance of these non-managerial duties to a corporate policy of strictly controlling labor costs. And they have done so through declarations from employees working in seven different states around the country, as well as job postings from fifteen states.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This case is therefore similar to\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   . In that case, the plaintiffs sought conditional certification of a nationwide collective of assistant store managers who were allegedly misclassified as exempt by a company that operated over 1,000 stores.\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204377931\">\n    2014 WL 4377931\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. After engaging in discovery related to the motion for dissemination of court-authorized notice to the putative collective, the plaintiffs presented evidence \"from only six [assistant store managers] who have worked across the country and consents to sue from six additional [assistant store managers]\" from various states in the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The evidence, which comprised deposition testimony from opt-in plaintiffs based on their \"observations and discussions within the stores that they worked and communications with other [assistant store managers] at districtwide meetings,\" that assistant store managers \"engage[d] primarily in non-managerial duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. For example, one plaintiff testified that she had spoken to assistant managers at various stores who complained that they could not \"get anything done\" because they were always performing non-managerial tasks, such as being \"on a register\" or \"in customer service.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   There was also testimony that assistant store managers had \"to pick up the slack\" for hourly wage-earners-that\n   is, perform the duties of hourly wage-earners-due to budgetary concerns at the corporate level.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6. The district court rejected the plaintiffs' argument that the fact that they had presented evidence from assistant store managers in more than 3 states \"mandated\" conditional certification, noting that \"the probity of drawing ... an inference [of a common illegal policy or plan] will turn in part on the number of plaintiffs from whom the Court has evidence compared to the size of the pool of potential opt-in plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finding the \"number and geographic dispersion of the [assistant store managers] who ha[d] opted in to [the] action\" to \"weigh only slightly in favor of conditional certification,\" the district court nevertheless conditionally certified the collective and authorized nationwide notice in light of the presentation of a \"substantive theory\"-that is, the budgetary concerns that led to the necessity that assistant store managers perform non-managerial duties-that \"tie[d] Plaintiffs' claims to a policy or practice that affected [assistant store managers] nationwide.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   So it is here. Plaintiffs' eight declarations from seven states have indicated that Defendant's corporate policy of cutting labor costs \"affected [assistant managers] nationwide,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , causing them to spend a majority of their time performing non-managerial duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those declarations also aver that assistant managers regularly worked more than 40 hours per week but were not paid overtime. Other evidence (such as job postings from fifteen states) indicate that Defendant had uniform expectations of assistant managers.

However, it asserts that the calculation relies on \"multiple dubious assumptions,\" including (1) that the Amended Complaint relates back to the filing of the original complaint and that the three-year statute of limitations applies; (2) that the timeliness of a collective action member's claim is based on the date she consents to join the collective rather than the date of the filing of the complaint; and (3) that the tolling agreement is ambiguous on its face and \"does not operate to extend the FLSA's statute of limitations in the manner Plaintiffs claim.\" ECF No. 38 at 12-13 &amp; nn.7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As to the relation back issue, Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that an amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading when, in relevant part, \"the amendment asserts a claim ... that arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set out ... in the original pleading,\" and, if the amendment changes the \"party or the naming of the party against whom a claim is asserted,\" the party to be brought in received timely notice of the action and \"knew or should have known that the action would have been brought against it, but for a mistake concerning the proper party's identity.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B), (C). Defendant makes no argument that these requirements are not met here. Indeed, the Amended Complaint contains factual allegations nearly identical to those in the original complaint as well as an allegation that Panera received notice of the claim on the day it was filed and knew or should have known it was the intended defendant. ECF No. 29, \u00b6 38. The undersigned will therefore assume, for the purposes of determining the notification period, that the Amended Complaint relates back to the date of the filing of the original complaint. Further challenge based on relation back can be addressed, if necessary, in connection with any future motion for decertification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Amended Complaint also contains allegations supporting an inference that Defendant willfully violated the FLSA. It asserts that Defendant controlled, oversaw, and directed the duties of potential collective members, including by assigning or being aware of the non-exempt duties that they were regularly performing, and that Defendant was or should have been aware that federal law required it to pay an overtime premium for hours worked in excess of 40 per week to employees performing those duties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 34, 44-45.

Plaintiff relies on the tolling agreement to support its request that the notification period be extended for the length of time the agreement was in effect, that is, 249 days, and its interpretation of the agreement's meaning is quite plausible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Defendant's arguments, if credited, would likely\n   require the Court to take evidence to determine whether an agreement existed and, if so, what it meant. However, at the conditional certification stage, courts should \"refrain from resolving factual disputes and deciding matters going to the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523526\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/95/#p106\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore finds, at this preliminary stage, that the tolling agreement should be interpreted to extend the notice period by 249 days-the number of days that it was in effect-to March 25, 2014. Any challenges to this finding based on the agreement's ambiguity or other defenses, may be raised in connection with a motion for decertification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   As to the end of the notice period, Plaintiffs ask that the DCMWA notice period end on February 27, 2015 (ECF No. 36-1 at 28)-the date that the statute was amended to allow litigation to proceed as a class action-and Defendant does not object. Regarding the FLSA notice period, however, Defendant represents that it reclassified assistant managers as non-exempt over the course of two and one-half months in the Fall of 2016, and that the reclassification was complete on November 16, 2016. ECF No. 36-12, \u00b6 5. It asserts, therefore, that November 16, 2016, is \"the last possible date on which any person could have worked as a salaried-exempt employee in that role.\" ECF No. 38 at 15. Plaintiffs point out that, as discovery has not commenced in this case, they have not been able to test that statement. ECF No. 36-1 at 12. Therefore, the FLSA notice period should end, as Plaintiffs request, on the date of this Memorandum Opinion and Order granting their motion for conditional certification issues. ECF No. 36-1 at 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In sum, notice of the pendency of this FLSA action shall be sent to employees who worked at Panera restaurants operated by Defendant nationwide (with the exception of New York, New Jersey, California, and Massachusetts) as assistant managers beginning on March 25, 2014-which, as explained above is three years plus 249 days prior to the filing of this action-and the date of this opinion.

ECF No. 36-1 at 32-33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Distribution in pay envelopes has been denied on the basis that \"this form of notice 'could imply Defendants' endorsement of the Notice or lead to situations in which Defendants were the ones answering questions about the Notice or lawsuit.' \"\n   <em>\n    Stephens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523526\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/291/95/#p106\">\n    291 F.Supp.3d at 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ayala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4218425\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/12/167/#p170\">\n    12 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   173 ).

In response, Defendant questions \"whether and how any such website would provide information to recipients beyond [any] court-approved notice[,] ... how access would be limited to members of the putative collective,\" and how the website would be administered.

Local Civil Rule 72.2 permits a magistrate judge to \"hear and determine any pretrial motion other than those specified\" in Local Civil Rule 72.3. LCvR 72.2(a). Local Civil Rule 72.3 lists, among other submissions, \"[m]otions for judgment on the pleadings, for summary judgment, to dismiss or to permit maintenance of a class action, to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or otherwise dismiss an action involuntarily\" as motions that a magistrate judge must address in a report and recommendation. LCvR 72.3(a)(3). However, a motion for conditional certification of a collective action is not listed in Local Rule 72.3. The local rules therefore indicate that a such a motion may be heard and determined by a magistrate judge.
