FRIEDRICH, United States District Judge\n   The Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) administers a federal program designed to finance U.S. agricultural exports. Plaintiffs Brett Lillemoe and GTR, LLC bring this suit against FAS under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment, asserting that FAS intentionally applied program regulations and policies to them unequally for no adequate reason. The plaintiffs also bring\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims against two individual FAS employees, Phillip Rowse and Jonathan Doster, asserting that they personally treated the plaintiffs differently from other program participants without a rational basis. Before the Court is the defendants' Motion to Dismiss Amended Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Dkt. 30. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

FAS's Knowledge of and Response to Rented Trade Flow Transactions\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    FAS discovered the widespread use of rented trade flows under the program early on. Cargill Incorporated, a program participant, disclosed the structure and use of rented trade flows to FAS as early as 2002, and FAS neither objected nor gave any indication that rented trade flows were not allowed.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 25. Thereafter, FAS vetted and approved thousands of rented trade flow transactions over the course of thirteen years.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    During that time, GTR repeatedly disclosed its own use of synthetic LCs and rented trade flows to FAS.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 26. On May 12, 2009, Brett Lillemoe, on behalf of GTR, met with Mark Rowse, the Director of FAS's Credit Program Division, and Peter Bonner, a USDA attorney, to explain the structure of rented trade flow transactions in detail.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 27. In the meeting, Lillemoe provided Rowse and Bonner with a detailed diagram of a proposed rented trade flow transaction, which \"clearly illustrate[d]\" that the Actual Exporter and Consignee \"were not directly\n    involved in the GSM-102 transaction\" and that \"the GSM transaction would result in the foreign bank obtaining a loan from the US bank at below-market interest rates due to the GSM guarantee.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 28-29;\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    Ex. B. Further, Lillemoe explained that \"nearly all, if not all,\" program transactions concerning Russia and Eurasia used the rented trade flow structure presented in the meeting.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 29.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    After the meeting, FAS \"fully vetted\" the use of rented trade flows internally.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 30. FAS's legal counsel stated in internal communications that rented trade flows did not violate program regulations.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    And FAS approved multiple GTR guarantees identical to those described in the May 2009 meeting without communicating any concerns to Lillemoe.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    In addition, FAS paid out claims on defaulted program transactions that used rented trade flows in 2002, 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 32. And the structure of those transactions would have been abundantly clear to FAS when it investigated the claims.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 33. FAS was also made aware of the rampant use of rented trade flows when it solicited industry comments regarding the program in 2008.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 35-37. Cargill-a major program participant-submitted comments in which it explained the prevalence of rented trade flow transactions, complained about the impact of rented trade flows on pricing, admitted to using rented trade flows itself in certain markets, and warned that the widespread use of rented trade flows might not withstand congressional scrutiny given the purpose of the program.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     C. FAS's and Rowse's Treatment of Lillemoe and GTR Under the Program\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Lillemoe participated in the program, through GTR and various other entities, for over fifteen years, and GTR became a registered exporter in 2007.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 39. FAS eventually suspended Lillemoe-or GTR, or both (the complaint does not specify)-from the program in May 2015 following Lillemoe's criminal indictment in February 2015.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 39. But before then, from 1999 to 2012, FAS approved over 500 applications by GTR and affiliated entities, and all of those applications relied on rented trade flows.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 41. GTR and its affiliates were subject to multiple compliance reviews during this period and never received a complaint.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 43.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    On October 31, 2012, the plaintiffs' relationship with FAS changed when Rowse contacted Lillemoe to request additional information regarding the transaction structures underlying fifteen of GTR's then-recent and pending program applications.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 45-46. Rowse expressed concern with the fact that the Consignee listed on the bills of lading differed from the importer identified on the GSM-102 guarantee, and he requested additional information about the role each entity played in the transaction.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 45. This request \"surprised\" Lillemoe because he had just spoken with another GSM exporter who submitted similar applications on the same day, but had not faced similar scrutiny.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 47. Rowse approved the other exporter's applications within two weeks, without inquiry or delay.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    Lillemoe responded to Rowse's inquiry, explaining that the transactions mirrored those discussed with Rowse and the USDA attorney back in 2009 and that a majority of program participants used the same structure.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 48. Still, Rowse denied the applications on the ground that the GSM Importer listed on the application had no relationship with the Consignee specified on the bills of lading.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. And he made clear that \"any future applications utilizing the same structure will also be denied.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 50 (quoting\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    Ex. G., Dkt. 25-7). Lillemoe and GTR declined to appeal Rowse's decision because they concluded\n    that FAS simply no longer approved of the rented trade flow structure reflected in the applications.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 51.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    Based on the position articulated by Rowse, Lillemoe withdrew three pending applications in January 2013 that used rented trade flows, and he requested a refund of application fees totaling $122,719.50.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 53. FAS refused to refund the fees.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Lillemoe later learned that FAS had continued to approve applications using rented trade flows from other participants, without inquiry or delay.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 59. On February 20, 2013, Rowse met with Lillemoe and reiterated FAS's position that GTR's use of rented trade flows was impermissible under program regulations.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 59-60. Rowse relayed FAS's concern that \"two or more parties might each apply for a GSM-102 guarantee based on the same shipment or BL,\" and he explained that only \"linear\" transactions, in which the GSM Importer has a direct link to the Consignee, would be approved.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 60. When Lillemoe told Rowse that he had heard from other participants that FAS was still approving applications that did not comply with that structure-including applications from competitors Bunge and Cargill-Rowse responded that FAS was \"having the same conversations with all parties.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 61.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    Over the next few months, Lillemoe realized that FAS and Rowse \"purposefully had misled him\" and continued to approve applications based on rented trade flows with no relationship between the GSM Importer and the Consignee.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 63. In fact, Lillemoe discovered that a new entity, Grove Services, LLC, had executed a program transaction for one of GTR's former customers using not only the exact structure proposed by GTR and rejected by Rowse but also using GTR's forms and changing only the letterhead.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 64. To confirm that Grove Services' approval was not a mistake, Lillemoe's business partner wrote Rowse on July 20, 2013 to tell him what happened, but never received a response.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 65. FAS continued to approve rented trade flow transactions involving other applicants throughout 2013, 2014, 2015, and continuing into 2016.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 67. No other applicant was ever subject to the restrictions on rented trade flows that Rowse and FAS imposed on Lillemoe and GTR.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 78.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    In addition to prohibiting Lillemoe and GTR from using rented trade flows, FAS also made it difficult for them to participate in the program using the \"linear\" structure Rowse required. In January 2013, GTR had applied for three South America guarantees using a linear structure.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 56. FAS would normally confirm such guarantees within one week or less.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    But in this case, FAS delayed for over two weeks, causing GTR's customer, Bancocolumbia, to grow concerned that FAS would not approve the transactions at all.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. GTR tried to reassure Bancocolumbia and persuade Rowse to act quickly on the applications, but he did not succeed.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 57. Rowse eventually approved the applications on January 10, but by that time Bancocolumbia had executed the transactions with one of GTR's competitors.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 57, 58.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    In another instance, Lillemoe had several Russian transactions pending with Deutsche Bank that also conformed with the \"linear\" structure FAS purportedly required.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 70.
