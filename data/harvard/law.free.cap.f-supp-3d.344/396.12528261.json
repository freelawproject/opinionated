In particular, plaintiffs request flight logs and evidence logs associated with twenty-seven planes, identified by their unique tail numbers and the locations where they were allegedly sighted: the Washington, D.C./Baltimore area, California, and New York. Although the agency acknowledges the general existence of the aerial surveillance program, it refuses to confirm or deny whether records exist for these particular aircraft, asserting that merely stating whether the records exist is itself covered by a FOIA exemption. This is commonly known as a \"\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response\" to a FOIA request, and it can be overcome by a showing that the information has already been officially disclosed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The parties have filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of DOJ and deny plaintiffs' motion since it finds that the agency's invocation of the FOIA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   exemptions was proper and that the particular information sought has not been officially acknowledged. At bottom, the Court agrees that simply revealing whether or not the FBI has records concerning any of these particular airplanes would be enough to let the cat out of the bag. Disclosing this information - which has never been officially acknowledged by the FBI before - would interfere with law enforcement proceedings, and disclose law enforcement techniques in a way that would risk circumvention of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to the FBI on March 4, 2016 seeking to examine the government's aerial surveillance practices.

Therefore, the\n   confirmation of responsive records, should they exist, could interfere with pending law enforcement investigations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(7)(A).

This acknowledgment would alert the public of the FBI's interest in particular flight patterns, and afford criminals and terrorists the opportunity to alter their behavior and location, interfering with pending enforcement proceedings. To confirm the existence of records, would be equivalent to the FBI acknowledging there is an active investigation along specific flight patterns. Conversely, if the FBI confirmed no responsive records existed, then the acknowledgment would reveal the aircraft are, in fact, not owned by the FBI and that such flight patterns are potentially free from FBI aerial surveillance.... Thus, the FBI is asserting a (b)(7)(A)\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   in response to Plaintiff's FOIA request because acknowledging or denying the existence of records associated with specific tail numbers could have a devastating impact on current criminal and national security investigations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3610893,10552311\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/801/1386/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In sum, the FBI argues that acknowledging the existence of responsive records would mean revealing its ownership and use of the aircraft in particular locations.

For example, plaintiffs' complaint and opening brief point to testimony from the former director of the FBI, James Comey, in 2015 before the Committee on the Judiciary of the U.S. House of Representatives, confirming that the agency uses aircraft in \"predicated investigations to conduct surveillance of people who are under investigation.\" Compl. \u00b6 8; Pls.'

As the D.C.
