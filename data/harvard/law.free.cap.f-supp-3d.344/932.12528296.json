Acquisition of the Properties and Conversion Side Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Verdad is a large developer of commercial properties, which it leases to single tenants such as fast food restaurants. In March 2014, Verdad and its wholly-owned subsidiary, VRE,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   acquired a group of\n   eleven properties (the \"Chicago Eleven Properties\") from an entity owned and/or controlled by third-party Jason LeVecke. R. 89 \u00b6 22. All eleven properties were leased for use as Kentucky Fried Chicken (\"KFC\") restaurants, both before and after Verdad purchased the properties. The KFCs were owned and operated by LeVecke entities throughout the relevant period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Verdad and LeVecke agreed to a sale/leaseback deal in which LeVecke purchased the properties from an unrelated party for $1 million each, and then immediately sold them to Verdad for $1.9 million each.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. After the closing in March 2014, Verdad and LeVecke entered into new leases for $171,000 in annual rent, doubling the amount of rent paid by each KFC for the same operation. (Before the scheme, each KFC paid about $76,000 in annual rent.) The parties each profited from the scheme-LeVecke made just under $1 million for each property he immediately flipped to Verdad. Verdad made short-term profits by selling the properties above Verdad's purchase price through the higher cap rates achieved by the higher rents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The deal also contemplated conversion of the Chicago Eleven Properties from KFCs to Hardee's restaurants. $400,000 per store was built into the price paid by Verdad for this purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. LeVecke was to renovate and convert each property with the $400,000, and the increased rent amount represented repayment of those costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In early 2015, the conversion plans were abandoned. But Verdad already had paid the $400,000 per store in conversion costs to LeVecke. To account for the change, Verdad and LeVecke entered into new leases in February 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Those leases removed the language requiring conversion, but the rent remained the same. Notably, the new leases Verdad entered into were with a different LeVecke entity, MJC Holdings 123, LLC (\"MJC\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The leases were guaranteed by yet another LeVecke entity, Frontier Star 1, LLC (\"FS1\"), as well as by LeVecke personally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Verdad also entered into a side agreement with LeVecke to account for the conversion costs. In that side agreement, Verdad and LeVecke agreed that if Verdad could obtain high enough sale prices for the properties, it would allow LeVecke to keep each $400,000 without having to spend the money on the properties or otherwise account for it. If Verdad could not sell the properties for what it wanted, LeVecke would have to repay the money in exchange for a rent reduction, or make $400,000 of improvements to each property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. The side agreement was omitted from the February 2015 leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Sale of the Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In February 2015, Verdad offered the Chicago Eleven Properties for sale. One of those properties was eventually purchased by Plaintiffs (the \"Property\"). Verdad listed the Property for 30 percent more than it had paid for it, marketing it largely on the basis that it would generate rental income of $171,000 per year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. Verdad also touted the fact that the February 2015 lease was guaranteed by FS1, and circulated false financial information that, as of 2014, FS1 had a net worth of $70 million and an annual income of $15 million.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. The marketing materials also misrepresented the identity of the tenant of the properties, claiming it was Frontier Star, LLC (another LeVecke entity) when, in fact, it was MJC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. And the materials misrepresented that MJC was part of the FS1 hierarchy of companies and operated 200 restaurants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   When Plaintiffs sought financial statements and sales data related to the Property to verify these claims, defendants EXP and Tartan, acting as the sales and marketing agents for the Property, told Plaintiffs that doing so would violate the tenant's franchise agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. During negotiations, EXP and Tartan also represented that Verdad had considered converting the KFC to a Hardee's restaurant, but since the Property was doing so well as a KFC, Verdad decided to continue to operate the Property as a KFC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 24, 2015, Plaintiffs and VRE entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement, under which Plaintiffs agreed to purchase the Property for $2,443,000. The sale closed on May 15, 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. In connection with the closing, defendant Baker Monroe prepared an Estoppel Certificate and Subordination, Non-Disturbance and Attornment Agreement (\"SNDA\"), which represented that the February 2015 lease constituted the sole agreement between the landlord and the tenant of the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Three months later, on July 27, 2015, Frontier Star filed for bankruptcy. In August, MJC fell behind in its rent payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. On August 29, 2015, LeVecke wrote Plaintiffs that, because of the financial distress of his various entities, MJC could not pay more than $70,000 in annual rent for the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75. FS1 filed for bankruptcy in November 2015. Finally, LeVecke filed for bankruptcy in January 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs allege Verdad had a close and ongoing business relationship with LeVecke and his various entities. They allege Verdad knew of LeVecke's precarious financial position and potential bankruptcy before VRE and Plaintiffs closed on the sale of the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. After LeVecke defaulted, Plaintiffs re-leased the Property, but the new tenant pays substantially lower rent than Plaintiffs expected under the February 2015 lease.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiffs filed suit against defendants VRE, Verdad, EXP, and Tartan on April 5, 2016, and added the remaining defendants in subsequent complaints. The Second Amended Complaint alleges that Plaintiffs were fraudulently induced into purchasing the Property by various misrepresentations and omissions of defendants, and that the defendants conspired with and aided and abetted each other in the fraud. The role of each defendant relevant to this opinion will be discussed in detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Defendants' Motions to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Baker Monroe Defendants' Motion (R. 94)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendants Chris Baker and Justin Huston, through the law firm Baker Monroe PLLC, represented VRE in connection with the sale of the Property. Plaintiffs allege Baker and Huston played a key role in the side agreement regarding the $400,000 payments made to LeVecke for the conversion of the KFCs to Hardee's stores. Baker Monroe ultimately took the lead in implementing the plan by drafting and obtaining the execution of the side agreement. R. 89 \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, 49. Plaintiffs also allege that Baker wrote in an email to defendant Matt Langfield (LeVecke's employee) that the side agreement had to be terminable on a property-by-property basis, otherwise Verdad would have \"to disclose it when we go under contract and you [LeVecke] would have to disclose it when you sign an estoppel.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. Further, Plaintiffs allege that the Baker Monroe defendants participated in obtaining and providing to potential buyers the Estoppel Certificate and SNDA, which falsely stated that there were no other agreements\n   in place relating to the properties other than the leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs bring six claims against the Baker Monroe defendants: fraudulent inducement - misrepresentation (Count V); fraudulent inducement - omissions (Count VI); negligent misrepresentations - affirmative statements (Count VII); negligent representations - omissions (Count VIII); aiding and abetting (Count IX); and civil conspiracy (Count X). All six claims stem from the Baker Monroe defendants' role in the fraudulent scheme, as described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Baker Monroe defendants have moved to dismiss on several grounds. They first argue the Court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over them in Illinois. R. 95. In the alternative, they argue that this Court should defer to a parallel state-court case filed in Texas, or that the claims against them should be dismissed under the attorney immunity doctrine. Finally, they argue that if this Court retains jurisdiction, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The Baker Monroe defendants argue that the only connection they have with Illinois is that their alleged conduct affected Plaintiffs, \"who had connections with Illinois.\" R. 95 at 5. They contend they never directed any communications at Illinois nor did they contact anyone in Illinois. But that argument ignores the entire purpose of the allegedly tortious conduct-to sell eleven properties\n   <em>\n    located in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Illinois\n   </em>\n   . The basis for jurisdiction here does not depend on contacts the Baker Monroe defendants had with Illinois. The Court need not stretch its reach so far. Instead, the Baker Monroe defendants expressly aimed their conduct at Illinois by engaging in a fraudulent scheme regarding Illinois. On that basis-and not through Plaintiffs' citizenship or the communications the Baker Monroe defendants had with fellow co-defendants-the Court finds the express aiming requirement satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Baker Monroe defendants cite\n   <em>\n    John Crane, Inc. v.

The following factors are relevant: \"the burden on the defendant, the forum State's interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\"\n   <em>\n    Tamburo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225693\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/693/#p702\">\n    601 F.3d at 709\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   First, Illinois has a strong interest in providing a forum to seek redress for fraudulent schemes dealing with Illinois property and inflicted by out-of-state actors.

It would be unreasonable to expect Plaintiffs to file separate lawsuits to give each defendant (residents of Texas, New York, Florida, Delaware, and Arizona) who allegedly participated in the scheme the privilege of defending this litigation in its home state when jurisdiction is otherwise proper in Illinois. That would be cumbersome and impractical, particularly when those states do not have any substantial interest in having the litigation in that state. A single suit in Illinois thus promotes the most efficient resolution of Plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tamburo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4225693\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/601/693/#p702\">\n    601 F.3d at 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, the burden on the defendants, including the Baker Monroe defendants, is small. The defendants are individuals or entities that conducted business in Illinois or concerning Illinois (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the fraudulent scheme at issue), as evidenced by the deliberate choice to select Cook County, Illinois as the venue and forum and Illinois law as governing. The Baker Monroe defendants drafted the PSA that contains that clause, and are likely familiar with Illinois laws and courts for that reason as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A finding that the Baker Monroe defendants, as alleged participants in the fraudulent scheme, are not subject to personal jurisdiction in Illinois would create significant barriers to effective relief for Plaintiffs, who are bound by the PSA's forum selection clause. Under these circumstances, it is far more reasonable to conclude that the Baker Monroe defendants should anticipate being haled into court in Illinois rather than a court with little relation to the fraudulent scheme. The exercise of personal jurisdiction in Illinois over the Baker Monroe defendants comports with traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, such that jurisdiction over the Baker Monroe defendants is proper in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

But before the Court addresses abstention, it first addresses the choice of law issue raised by the Baker Monroe defendants regarding attorney immunity, which will affect the Court's abstention analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Illinois choice of law principles govern the case because it was filed in Illinois.\n   <em>\n    CDX Liquidating Tr. v.

This makes little sense from a practical standpoint-why should this case be litigated as two cases in two different states, applying two separate states' laws, rather than as one case in one court applying Illinois law, as the choice of law and forum selection clause intended? Like in\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   , the Baker Monroe defendants are alleged to be coconspirators in a fraudulent scheme. The Baker Monroe defendants also represented VRE and Verdad in connection with the sale of the Property, and were involved with the drafting of many of the transaction's documents, including the PSA. As agents of VRE, they can enforce the PSA's choice of law clause against the Plaintiffs. For this reason, the choice of law clause can be enforced against them as \"closely related\" parties, just as their clients and coconspirators can enforce the clause against Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stifel, Nicolaus &amp; Co. v.

That is not the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finding that the Baker Monroe defendants are subject to the choice of law provision contained in the PSA, the Court next addresses whether that choice of law clause applies to this case. There is no question that it does. The choice of law clause is broad, stating that \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   litigation between the parties (whether grounded in contract,\n   <em>\n    tort\n   </em>\n   , statute, law or equity) shall be governed by, construed in accordance with, and interpreted pursuant to the laws of the State of Illinois, without giving effect to its choice of laws principles.\" R. 89-12 \u00b6 14-5 (emphasis added). The claims against the Baker Monroe defendants (alleging fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation and omission, conspiracy, and aiding and abetting fraud) are grounded in tort principles.

Relying on the comments to Section 148, which assign weight to the various factors, the court held that the place where plaintiff received the representations (New York) was as important a contact as the place where defendant made them (also New York), but neither was as important as the place where the plaintiff acted in reliance on those representations (Illinois).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9093684\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/282/869/#p873\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court further held that the plaintiff's principal place of business (Illinois) was of \"substantial significance\" and was more important than similar contacts of the defendant (Oregon).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9093684\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/282/869/#p873\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, the court held Illinois law applied. Importantly, the\n   <em>\n    Telular\n   </em>\n   court noted that the factor concerning \"the place where a tangible thing which is the subject of the transaction between the parties was situated at the time\" was inapplicable, and so did not take that into its analysis.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9093684\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/282/869/#p873\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Here, by contrast, the tangible thing that is the subject of the transaction-the Property-is situated in Illinois.

Illinois is thus of \"particular importance\" in this determination. The remaining factors do not favor Texas. Although the Baker Monroe defendants argue their fraudulent misrepresentations were made in Texas, there is no indication that Plaintiffs acted in reliance or received those misrepresentations anywhere but in California. Likewise, the parties are in Texas and California. And because the Plaintiffs' domicile or residence is more important than similar contacts\n   of the defendants,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Telular\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9093684\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/282/869/#p873\">\n    282 F.Supp.2d at 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this choice of law analysis favors California, not Texas.

In any event, as described in the personal jurisdiction section, Illinois has a significant public policy interest in having its law applied to fraudulent schemes made regarding Illinois property, further supporting application of Illinois law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Finally, Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7 223 -the section involving conflict of laws regarding conveyances of interest in land-likewise supports applying Illinois law.

The Baker Monroe defendants argue this factor \"is entirely irrelevant to this matter\" without any explanation of why that is so. The Court finds this factor weighs against abstention. The Property is in Illinois, and the Baker Monroe defendants have not provided any indication that Texas has or can assume jurisdiction over it.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the threat of piecemeal litigation weighs against abstention. Several defendants, including Verdad, VRE, Tartan, and EXP, are subject to jurisdiction in Illinois because of the forum selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Those defendants, and several others, have already answered the complaint in this case and are presumably engaging in discovery. The discovery likely overlaps or is identical between the two cases. This case will continue regardless of the Court's decision on abstention as to the Baker Monroe defendants. And it makes little sense for Plaintiffs to litigate the same fraudulent scheme related to the same property in two different fora-here against most of the defendants, and in Texas against only the Baker Monroe defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , this Court obtained jurisdiction first. This case was filed in April 2016. R. 1. On May 15, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to file an amended complaint adding defendant Baker Monroe, which the Court granted. R. 70, 78. That same day, Plaintiffs filed their complaint in the Texas case. R. 95-1. Shortly thereafter, in July 2017, Plaintiffs filed the Second Amended Complaint in this case adding the remaining defendants, including defendants Baker and Huston. R. 89. The Texas case was thus filed after this case was filed, and on the same day that Plaintiffs brought one of the Baker Monroe defendants into this case. Like the other\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   factors, when each court obtained jurisdiction is to be determined in a pragmatic, flexible manner.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caminiti &amp; Iatarola, Ltd. v. Behnke Warehousing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521667\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/962/698/#p702\">\n    962 F.2d 698\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 702 (7th Cir. 1992). \"Thus, priority should not be measured exclusively by which complaint was filed first, but rather in terms of how much progress has been made in the two actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521667\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/962/698/#p702\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This case had been pending for almost a year when Baker Monroe was added, and the Texas case had been pending for only three months when the remaining Baker Monroe defendants were added here. This factor weighs against abstention, particularly when viewed alongside the\n   <em>\n    fourth\n   </em>\n   factor: the relevant progress of each case. The Texas court stayed that action pending resolution of this case without ruling on Baker Monroe's summary judgment motion on a discrete issue-whether the attorney immunity doctrine applies to bar Plaintiffs' suit against the Baker Monroe defendants. Accordingly, the Texas case is no further along than this case.\n   <em>\n    Fifth\n   </em>\n   , as the Court explained above, Illinois law governs Plaintiffs' claims against the Baker Monroe defendants as parties \"closely related\" to the PSA, which is at the heart of this dispute.\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , there is no indication that this action was brought for a vexatious or improper purpose. Plaintiffs had no choice but to file this action against at least some of the defendants because of the PSA's choice of law, venue, and forum selection clause. Adding the Baker Monroe defendants made sense because they are part of the same alleged fraudulent scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The remaining factors (convenience, adequacy of the Texas state court action to protect Plaintiffs' rights, concurrent jurisdiction, and the availability of removal) are neutral or weigh slightly in favor of abstention. But those factors do not justify the surrender of this Court's jurisdiction, especially when weighed against the six factors above supporting jurisdiction. The Baker Monroe defendants' motion to dismiss under the\n   <em>\n    Colorado River\n   </em>\n   abstention doctrine is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Failure to State a Claim Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Finally, the Baker Monroe defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to sufficiently\n   allege that any fraudulent misrepresentations were made by the Baker Monroe defendants. R. 95 at 13. They contend that (1) the statements in the Estoppel Certificate and the SNDA were made by the tenant of the Property-MJC Holdings 123, LLC-not by them, and (2) the statements in the Estoppel and SNDA technically were true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Plaintiffs brought six claims against the Baker Monroe defendants: fraudulent inducement - misrepresentation (Count V); fraudulent inducement - omissions (Count VI); negligent misrepresentations - affirmative statements (Count VII); negligent representations - omissions (Count VIII); aiding and abetting (Count IX); and civil conspiracy (Count X). The Baker Monroe defendants do not address the various standards and elements required for each claim, and it is unclear to which claims their motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim applies. Nor do they point to any case law in support of their undeveloped argument. \"The court will not research and consider the details of defendant's argument where defendant has done little more than provide what would be an opening paragraph to a more properly framed argument.\"\n   <em>\n    Dawson v. W. &amp; H. Voortman, Ltd.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7405219\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/853/1038/#p1046\">\n    853 F.Supp. 1038\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1046 (N.D.

Plaintiffs allege the Baker Monroe defendants \"participated in preparing, approving, obtaining the execution of, and disseminating to the parties involved in the transaction\" the Estoppel Certificate and SNDA. R. 89 \u00b6 68. The Baker Monroe defendants' arguments that they did not misrepresent the facts contained in those documents simply because the documents were not signed by them misses the point of Plaintiffs' allegations-Plaintiffs allege the Baker Monroe defendants knew that the representations contained in those documents were false but continued to misrepresent the truth and prepare and disseminate the documents with that knowledge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-70. It is plausible that the Baker Monroe defendants fraudulently or negligently misrepresented material facts, either themselves or as co-conspirators, through those documents and their role in their preparation, execution, and dissemination. The Baker Monroe defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is therefore denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Matt Langfield's Motion (R. 152)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As to defendant Matt Langfield, Plaintiffs allege he was an employee of various entities owned and/or controlled by LeVecke. R. 89 \u00b6 15.

Langfield explains that he was aware of the allegedly fraudulent transaction and assisted LeVecke when he closed on the Chicago Eleven Properties, but that his role was limited to forwarding copies of the Estoppel Certificate and the SNDA to LeVecke and LeVecke's attorney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. He also attests that he never had the authority to act on behalf of LeVecke or\n   bind any LeVecke-controlled entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   In response to Langfield's motion and declaration, Plaintiffs attach a declaration with several exhibits they contend demonstrate Langfield had significant involvement in the scheme. R. 162-1. To the extent the Court considers Langfield's declaration, Plaintiffs ask that they be permitted to conduct discovery and submit a supplemental response. R. 162 at 7. Langfield disagrees with that approach and instead asks the Court to follow the \"traditional course\" by considering his declaration and the extrinsic evidence included in Plaintiffs' response, without allowing Plaintiffs to take additional discovery that will be costly to Langfield. R. 170 at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The Court finds that the extrinsic evidence Plaintiffs provide shows that Langfield had a more substantial role than the \"purely administrative\" one he describes. However, Plaintiffs' extrinsic evidence does not refute any of the remaining Langfield declarations. Importantly, the exhibits do not refute that Langfield was LeVecke's employee and did not have the authority to act on behalf of LeVecke or any of his entities. Instead, the exhibits show that LeVecke had final authority. LeVecke signed the original PSA between LeVecke and Verdad, R. 162-3, and LeVecke was the main and final decision-maker.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 162-6 (indicating Verdad needed to set up a call with LeVecke to make a decision regarding cap rates); R. 162-11 (Langfield noting LeVecke had a meeting with KFC, and Langfield would send updates once they spoke); 162-12 (LeVecke was the guarantor for the Chicago Eleven leases);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   R. 89-1 at 21 (LeVecke signed lease agreements); R. 89-5 at 19 (same); R. 89-6 at 4 (same); R. 89-7 at 3 (Langfield indicated he needed to review leases with LeVecke); R. 89-11 at 4 (Langfield not included on list of principals of FS1); R. 89-14 at 4 (LeVecke signed Estoppel Certificate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In sum, even viewing all of Plaintiffs' allegations and extrinsic evidence in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, Plaintiffs fail to make a prima facie showing (and fail to refute their own allegations) that Langfield was anything but LeVecke's employee, acting at LeVecke's direction. There is nothing in the complaint or the exhibits Plaintiffs offer suggesting that Langfield had any decision-making power or had any interest in the transactions. It would be unfair to assert personal jurisdiction over Langfield when his actions were directed by his employment situation, and not his personal interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For these reasons, Langfield's motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted.

Plaintiffs allege Vestapoint is a partial owner of VRE. R. 89 \u00b6 40. But that is where its alleged fraudulent activities end. Plaintiffs make insufficient, conclusory allegations that Vestapoint, along with the rest of the co-conspirators, \"formulated and carried out a plan and agreement to endeavor to unload some or all of the Chicago 11 properties,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 155; \"actively encouraged and supported the plan and agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 157; and was \"a chief beneficiary of the plan and agreement,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Nowhere do Plaintiffs allege Vestapoint had any actual knowledge of the agreement.

There are simply no allegations that VestaPoint \"under[stood] the general objectives of [the purported] conspiratorial scheme,\" \"accept[ed] the general objectives of the scheme,\" or \"agree[d], either explicitly or implicitly[,] to do its part to further those objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    Adcock v.

R. 161 at 5. The Court does not find that argument persuasive. Plaintiffs clearly have enough information to describe in significant detail the intricacies of the scheme, including by attaching several exhibits to both their complaint and various responses to the defendants' motions to dismiss. Further, Plaintiffs' counsel attests to having already conducted discovery in other cases dealing with a related scheme against the same defendants. R. 152-1. Surely, if Vestapoint was involved in the scheme, Plaintiffs would have uncovered at least one fact supporting its alleged agreement. But Plaintiffs fail to point to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   facts that indicate agreement in the conspiracy, and their speculation as to Vestapoint's involvement is insufficient to meet the pleading standards of Rule 8(b)(2), much less the heightened standards required by Rule 9(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   , 550 U.S. at 555,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Under the federal notice pleading standards, a plaintiff's \"factual allegations\n   must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs also ask the Court to infer knowledge by Vestapoint. Plaintiffs admit that \"there are no precise allegations in the Second Amended Complaint specifically mirroring those facts [of knowledge].\" R. 161 at 6.

Plaintiffs allege it also provides \"project financing, development and capital solutions, underwriting, and 'expert economic analysis &amp; sales week increases.' \" R. 89 \u00b6 3. Relevant to this transaction, Plaintiffs allege Verdad distributed an offering memorandum and a confidential information memorandum, which included information on the tenant of the Property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. This information was not about the Property itself, which is what Verdad was selling. Rather, it was information Verdad provided Plaintiffs about third parties, in order for Plaintiffs to transact business through a landlord-tenant relationship with those third parties. Where, as here, it is plausible that a company provides both information and non-informational goods, the dispositive question is whether the information furnished with the non-informational goods was central to the business transaction.\n   <em>\n    Orix Credit All., Inc. v.

The Court cannot do that at this stage of the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Plaintiffs plausibly allege Verdad was in the business of supplying information about the third party tenant. As a result, Plaintiffs have plausibly pleaded facts supporting that an exception to the\n   <em>\n    Moorman\n   </em>\n   doctrine applies. Plaintiffs' negligence claims against Verdad and VRE survive, and thus Verdad and VRE's contribution\n   action survives.

Reinsch is a Florida lawyer who represented Plaintiffs in the transaction regarding the Property. His clients are California residents. Verdad alleges that the Court may exercise personal jurisdiction over Reinsch because Reinsch (a) acted as the Plaintiffs' attorney in connection with the sale of the Property, (b) transacted business in Illinois in connection with the transaction from which this action arises, (c) was involved with the making of a contract that was premised on the purchase of property within Illinois, and (d) committed tortious acts and omissions which caused harm in Illinois.

First, Verdad does not contend that Reinsch availed himself of the benefits of Illinois law. Second, Verdad does not allege that Reinsch had any contact with Illinois. Plaintiffs were in California during the transaction leading to the purchase of the Property, and VRE was in Texas.\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   requires analysis of contacts between the defendants and the forum (here between the third-party defendants and the forum), not contacts between the plaintiff and the forum, or between the plaintiff and the defendants. Because Reinsch \"formed no jurisdictionally relevant contacts\" with Illinois during the transaction that led to the purchase of the Property, Verdad has not identified a basis for specific personal jurisdiction over Reinsch.\n   <em>\n    Walden,\n   </em>\n   571 U.S. at 289,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Further, Verdad's allegations that Reinsch was \"involved in the making of the contract\" does not subject Reinsch to jurisdiction here either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reinsch's involvement with that contract stemmed only from his representation of Plaintiffs. Reinsch is a Florida attorney, licensed to practice in Florida, and performed his services from Florida. R. 93 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; R. 168-2. Verdad does not allege Reinsch ever appeared in Illinois during the negotiations or transaction of the Property. Any neglect on Reinsch's part in representing Plaintiffs occurred only in Florida. It does not subject Reinsch to jurisdiction in Illinois.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yates v.

The Baker Monroe defendants are alleged to be not only attorneys to VRE in the transaction but are also alleged to be participants in the fraudulent scheme. Through that fraudulent conduct, they purposefully availed themselves of jurisdiction in Illinois, because the fraud involved Illinois properties. Reinsch's alleged negligence, however, is only connected with his representation of Plaintiffs, not to any conduct he directed at Illinois apart from that relationship. Reinsch did not purposefully avail himself of this Court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walden\n   </em>\n   , 571 U.S. at 289,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578282,12701990\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1115/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the lower court's conclusion that the defendant's knowledge of the plaintiff's \"strong forum connections,\" combined with the \"conclusion that [the plaintiff] suffered foreseeable harm in [the forum],\" was sufficient to establish minimum contacts).
