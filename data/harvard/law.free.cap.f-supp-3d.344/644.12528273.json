NATHAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiffs Dorrelien Felix and Margaly Felix, individually, and Jonathan C. Moore, as Administrator of the Estate of David Felix, bring this suit against the City of New York (\"The City\"), New York Police Department (\"NYPD\") detectives Harold Carter and Vincente Mathias (\"Detective Defendants\"), the not-for-profit organization the Bridge, Inc., and Jane Doe, an employee of the Bridge. Plaintiffs allege,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Mr. Felix's April 25, 2015 death was caused by violations of Mr. Felix's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and by the City's failure to provide protections to which he was entitled under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. Before the Court is the City's motion to dismiss the municipal liability and disability discrimination claims in Plaintiffs' amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, Defendant the City's motion to dismiss is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court begins by reviewing the factual and procedural background leading to this motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are taken from the First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") and documents incorporated into the complaint by reference and assumed to be true for purposes of evaluating the Motion to Dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kassner v. 2nd Ave. Delicatessen, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5704764\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/496/229/#p237\">\n    496 F.3d 229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (2d Cir. 2007) ;\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns, Inc. v.

FAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10, 17, 57. In a physical altercation, Detective Carter shot Mr. Felix once in the chest. FAC \u00b6 95. Mr. Felix died shortly thereafter. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 97-103.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Events Leading to the Encounter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The encounter between the NYPD detectives and Mr. Felix was precipitated by the following sequence of events. The detectives visited the Bridge facility at 538 6th Street in Manhattan for purposes of speaking with Mr. Felix about his alleged involvement in a robbery.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 72. They secured access to the building, and then to Mr. Felix's apartment, by demanding the assistance of a Bridge employee on duty at the facility, Jane Doe. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 77, 79, 81, 84-85. Ms. Doe informed the detectives that the facility housed individuals with mental illnesses and that Mr. Felix was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. FAC \u00b6 82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the amended complaint, this information should have triggered NYPD procedures for working with \"emotionally disturbed persons\" like Mr. Felix. FAC \u00b6 115. Under these procedures, officers are not supposed to take emotionally disturbed persons into custody \"without the specific direction of a supervisor\" and are required to \"attempt to isolate and contain\" such persons \"while maintaining a zone of safety until arrival of a patrol supervisor\" and other emergency personnel. FAC \u00b6 116 (quoting NYPD Patrol Guide). The detectives did not follow these policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Instead, after Ms. Doe unsuccessfully attempted to contact a supervisor, they refused to wait and demanded that Ms. Doe escort them to Mr. Felix's apartment and open the door. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 83-84. Ms. Doe complied without first announcing to Mr. Felix that the detectives wished to speak with him. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 85-86. The detectives did not have a warrant to access Mr. Felix's apartment and did not knock and announce or request entry, nor were exigent circumstances present at the time of their entry. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 85, 87. They merely possessed an \"I-Card,\" an NYPD tool that \"tracks individuals that officers seek to interview or arrest.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 73, 106. According to the amended complaint, I-Cards do not provide a valid basis for entry to residences for the purposes of apprehending suspects. FAC \u00b6 110 &amp; n.1 (citing\n   <em>\n    Crossing the Threshold: An Evaluation of Civilian Complaints of Improper Entries and Searches by the NYPD from January 2010 to October 2015\n   </em>\n   , CCRB (2015) (\"CCRB Report\") at 7, http://www.nyc.gov/html/ccrb/downloads/pdf/Crossing-the-Threshold-2010-2015.pdf).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In response to the detectives' entry to his apartment, Mr. Felix, who feared police, panicked and ran down the fire escape. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 32, 90, 92. The detectives ran down the stairs to the lobby, where they encountered Mr. Felix. FAC \u00b6 92-93. A physical altercation ensued, culminating in the shooting. FAC \u00b6 95. The amended complaint contends that this encounter represented the detectives' deliberately forcing a physical confrontation, using excessive\n   force, and treating Mr. Felix in a \"wantonly reckless\" manner. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 117-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that two alleged customs, policies, or practices caused violations of Mr. Felix's rights, and led to the foregoing encounter: (1) the use of \"I-Cards\" to gain access to residences and (2) failing to properly handle emotionally disturbed persons. Plaintiffs further attribute violations of Mr. Felix's rights to the NYPD's failure to properly train officers with respect to both policies and the NYPD's alleged failure to screen officers for their propensity for violence. Finally, they allege the encounter resulted in violations of Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    2. I-Cards as a Basis for Gaining Access to the Residence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To substantiate its charge that the NYPD has a policy of permitting improper use of I-Cards, FAC \u00b6 108, the amended complaint points to three facts. First, the NYPD Patrol Guide \u00a7 208-23 fails to clearly state that I-Cards do not constitute warrants and cannot serve as a legal basis for entry to a residence. FAC \u00b6 109. Further, a 2015 Civilian Complaint Review Board (\"CCRB\") report analyzing improper entries and searches over the period in which this incident occurred noted a pattern of improper use of I-Cards as a basis for entry and apprehension. Specifically, the CCRB Report found that 28 out of 174, or 16 percent, of substantiated CCRB complaints involved the improper use of I-Cards. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 110, 112 &amp; n.2. Third, in response to this pattern, the CCRB recommended (a) correcting the NYPD Patrol Guide to clearly state that I-Cards were not warrants and (b) clarifying for detectives both the situations in which it was permissible for them to create I-Cards rather than warrants and the need to use warrants to apprehend individuals inside private residences. FAC \u00b6 113a-b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that this policy caused the alleged violations of Mr. Felix's rights because the Defendant Detectives possessed only an I-Card, and not a warrant, and because these alleged policy issues were present when the Detective Defendants entered Mr. Felix's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Treatment of Emotionally Disturbed Persons\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The amended complaint further alleges that the Detective Defendants' treatment of Mr. Felix was reflective of NYPD's de facto custom, policy, or practice of failing to properly handle emotionally disturbed persons like Mr. Felix. It identifies these policies by pointing to three pieces of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   First, an Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD (\"OIG\") report published in 2017 allegedly identified \"long-standing deficiencies in the NYPD's handling of response to EDPs-shorthand for \"emotionally disturbed persons.\" FAC \u00b6 123 &amp; n.3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Putting Training into Practice: A Review of NYPD's Approach to Handling Interactions with People in Mental Crisis\n   </em>\n   (Jan. 2017) (\"OIG Report\"), http://www1.nyc.gov/assets/oignypd/downloads/pdf/Reports/CIT_Report_01192017.pdf). According to Plaintiffs, this report criticizes the NYPD's lack of an emotionally disturbed persons policy and the NYPD's failure to properly train police officers on handling emotionally disturbed persons prior to summer 2015 beyond offering only a \"one-day training\" involving \"a short, basic lecture on mental illnesses\" and four role-playing scenarios. FAC \u00b6 125 (quoting the OIG Report at 10). Second, the City implemented a Crisis Intervention Team (\"CIT\") training a few months after Mr. Felix's death, based on months of research and consultations with experts. FAC \u00b6 122; OIG Report at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Finally, the amended complaint alleges that the City was or should have been\n   aware of its officers' pattern of mistreating emotionally disturbed persons, but failed to adequately screen, train, supervise, or discipline them. FAC \u00b6 121. Specifically, the amended complaint contends that officers should have been trained in the use of equipment other than guns to restrain emotionally disturbed persons; evaluation of initial encounters between officers and emotionally disturbed persons; and in emotionally disturbed persons' needs for adequate medical care. FAC \u00b6 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    4. ADA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   As a final matter, Plaintiffs allege a violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\") and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act on the grounds that the City failed to reasonably accommodate Mr. Felix's disability and denied to Mr. Felix the benefits of the City's services, programs, and activities by failing to properly train, supervise, and discipline police officers regarding crisis intervention techniques, otherwise providing insufficient resources, and failing to follow established policies and procedures regarding crisis intervention techniques for individuals with mental health disabilities. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 150-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Complaint on July 21, 2016. Dkt. No. 1. The nonmunicipal defendants answered Plaintiffs' Complaint on August 12, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 22. Shortly thereafter, the City sought, and the Court granted, a stay of the litigation pending the conclusion of the NYPD's internal investigation into the events precipitating Mr. Felix's death. Dkt. Nos. 25, 28. That stay remained in place until July 28, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 44, after which date the Detective Defendants answered Plaintiffs' Complaint, Dkt. No. 49, and the City filed its first Motion to Dismiss, Dkt. No. 50. In conjunction with the foregoing, Defendant the Bridge and the City Defendants filed and responded to crossclaims against one another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 22, 49, 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 15, 2017, the Plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. Dkt. No. 56. The Officer Defendants and the Bridge answered the first amended complaint and the City filed a \"Renewed Motion to Dismiss.\" Dkt Nos. 57, 58, 59. That motion to dismiss is the subject of the instant Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The City argues that Plaintiffs' claims against it should be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) because Plaintiffs have failed to allege facts necessary to show municipal liability for alleged customs, policies, or practices; training failures; or ADA and Rehabilitation Act violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   To survive a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain \"sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Plaintiffs focus on three municipal policies they claim were responsible for Mr. Felix's death: customs, policies, or practices of (1) using I-cards to gain access to homes and (2) using brute force against emotionally disturbed persons; and (3) failure to train officers in how to work with emotionally disturbed persons. In their amended complaint, they further appear to raise a failure to train claim with respect to I-Cards, see FAC \u00b6 139, and a hiring theory with respect to officers' treatment of emotionally disturbed persons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   As explained in further detail below, the Court dismisses the last two theories of liability because Plaintiffs appear to abandon them in their papers. As to the fully briefed claims, the Court further concludes that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that a custom or practice of using I-Cards to gain access to individual homes or a custom or practice of excessive force towards emotionally disturbed persons caused the injuries complained of here. But the Court finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently stated a claim for failure to train officers and detectives with respect to the treatment of emotionally disturbed persons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Failure to Train Officers in Use of I-Cards and Custom or Practice of Inadequate Screening in Hiring\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Court addresses two claims against the City that the parties discuss minimally or not at all: Plaintiffs' apparent theories of failure to train with respect to I-Cards and a custom or practice of inadequate screening in hiring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 139-40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As to the hiring theory, Defendant argues that this claim should be dismissed on the ground that Plaintiffs have not met the \"rigorous standards of culpability and causation\" it urges apply to such claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

Sept. 23, 2014) (\"At the motion to dismiss stage ... a plaintiff abandons a claim by\n   failing to address the defendant's arguments in support of dismissing that claim.\"). Accordingly, here, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' failure to respond to Defendant's motion to dismiss their hiring claims constitutes abandonment, and such claim is hereby DISMISSED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Neither party discusses the I-Card training theory in any detail. Defendant generically urges dismissal of training claims in its initial memorandum,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. Br. at 13; and Plaintiffs subsequently pitch their opposition to different theories of liability. It is possible that Plaintiffs intended to fold this theory into their custom-or-practice claim. In any case, because Defendant clearly styles its motion as a motion to dismiss\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   municipal liability claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 4-16, and because Plaintiff does not defend this theory, the Court deems it waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged a Custom or Practice of Using I-Cards to Gain Access to Individuals' Homes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court turns next to the claims fully addressed in the parties' papers. To support their I-Card theory, Plaintiffs offer two factual allegations: (1) the NYPD Patrol Guide's failure to state that I-Cards do not constitute warrants and (2) the findings of the CCRB report, which documented improper use of I-Cards as a basis for entry and apprehension and recommended changes to NYPD documents and training procedures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 108-13; CCRB Report at 52-56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The City counters that the CCRB findings are insufficient to support a conclusion that the NYPD had the alleged custom or practice, Dkt. No. 72, Def. Reply at 1-2, and in any case that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that any City custom or practice with respect to I-Cards caused Plaintiffs' complained-of injury,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Because the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged causation, it need not address whether Plaintiff's factual allegations are sufficient to plead the existence of a custom or practice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Causation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiffs tell two causal stories. First, in their opposition, they explain: (1) the NYPD possessed the above-described custom or policy; (2) the Detective Defendants possessed only an I-card; the Detective Defendants (3) improperly represented that the I-Card was a warrant, and (4) secured entry to the building and Mr. Felix's apartment on that basis, which entry (5) caused Mr. Felix to panic and flee and led to the encounter. The problem with this theory is that it is not actually alleged in the amended complaint, which contains no allegation that the detectives secured access either to the building or to Mr. Felix's apartment\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they misrepresented their I-Card as a warrant.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Pl. Br. at 9\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6\u00b6 77, 83, 85. Rather, the cited portions of the amended complaint plead only that the Detective Defendants demanded entry to the building, and then to Mr. Felix's apartment, and that the Detective Defendants lacked a warrant or other exigent circumstances to justify their demands. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 77, 83, 85.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Plaintiffs' second causal theory suffers from the same flaw. They contend in their opposition that \"even if the officers had been granted lawful access to the building,\" they lacked authority to enter Mr. Felix's room, and it was this entry that proximately caused Mr. Felix's death. Pl. Br. at 9. But this theory still fails to allege\n   that the I-Card was responsible for the alleged unlawful entry of Mr. Felix's room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As a final matter, Plaintiffs might have alleged that the fact that the officers possessed only an I-Card, and no other lawful basis for entering Mr. Felix's property, means that their decision to enter must have been caused by the unlawful I-Card custom. Because Plaintiffs did not plead sufficient factual allegations from which the Court could infer this causal pathway occurred, the Court need not address whether it is sufficiently plausible to pass muster at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Plaintiffs Have Not Adequately Alleged a Custom, Policy, or Practice of Subjecting Emotionally Disturbed Persons to Brute and Excessive Force\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   To make out a custom, policy, or practice claim with respect to the NYPD's treatment of emotionally disturbed persons, Plaintiffs point to information in the OIG report and a series of lawsuits and incidents cited in the amended complaint. They contend these factual allegations are sufficient to plead (1) that the NYPD had a pattern of misconduct with respect to treatment of emotionally disturbed persons and (2) that high-ranking officials had knowledge of that pattern. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The OIG Report constitutes a review of the NYPD's efforts to enhance officer training with respect to treatment of emotionally disturbed persons. OIG Report at 1. It focuses on a new four-day Crisis Intervention Team (\"CIT\") training program, which \"first surfaced through the Mayor's Task Force on Behavioral Health and the Criminal Justice System in 2015,\" and was implemented in June 2015 \"after \"many months of research and involving consultation with experts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10, 28. According to the Report, such changes were necessary because of the large volume of calls the NYPD responds to concerning individuals in mental crisis: \"[w]hile NYPD responds to the overwhelming majority of these types of calls without discharging weapons or causing serious injury, [high-profile incidents] demonstrate[ ] the potential for a lethal outcome in some situations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that the OIG Report supports their claims both because it identifies \"long-standing deficiencies in the NYPD's handling of responses to EDPs,\" or emotionally disturbed persons, FAC \u00b6 123; and because the NYPD's decision to implement the changes discussed in the OIG Report constituted its acknowledgment of the failures of its pre-existing policies, FAC \u00b6 122. Although the OIG Report was published in January 2017, Plaintiffs note that it reflects changes made in the summer of 2015, and research and planning necessary to implement those changes prior to that date. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 122-23. Plaintiffs further argue that the civil rights complaints cited in their papers indicate the existence of a pattern of NPYD officers' mistreatment of emotionally disturbed persons and that policymakers' awareness of the problem dates even earlier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 142 (citing 10 cases dating between 1984 and 2017 involving police officers' alleged wrongful killings of individuals with mental disabilities ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants argue that dismissal of this claim is warranted for several reasons: (1) Mr. Felix should not be considered an emotionally disturbed person; (2) Plaintiffs may not rely on records like the OIG Report for purposes of sufficiently pleading the existence at the time of Mr. Felix's death of a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   policy of subjecting emotionally disturbed persons to brute and excessive force because the OIG Report was published subsequent to his encounter with the police officers; and (3) neither the OIG Report nor the civil rights complaints Plaintiffs cite are sufficient to demonstrate\n   a \"persistent and widespread\" practice as required to state this\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   theory. Taking Plaintiffs' allegations as true, and drawing all inferences in their favor, the Court rejects the first two arguments. However, the Court concludes that the OIG Report and the civil rights complaints, standing alone, are insufficient to plead deliberate indifference with respect to the NYPD's treatment of emotionally disturbed individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Applicability of Emotionally Disturbed Persons Policy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Defendant contends that Mr. Felix was not an emotionally disturbed person, or at minimum that his status as an emotionally disturbed person was not apparent to the officers. Under the obligation to take all well-pleaded facts as true at the motion to dismiss phase, the Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   According to Defendant, an emotionally disturbed person is a \"person who appears to be mentally ill or temporarily deranged and is conducting himself in a manner which a police officer reasonably believes is likely to result in serious injury to himself or others.\" Def. Reply at 5 (citing OIG Report at 42). Defendant points out that Mr. Felix's behavior did not conform to this description and that, indeed, Mr. Felix's progress in successfully handling his mental illness suggested the opposite.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It construes his behavior in response to the detectives' entry to his apartment as reflecting someone who did not want to be arrested, not temporary derangement or similar.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   , at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Taking the allegations in the amended complaint as true and drawing all inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, the Court rejects this argument. The fact that Mr. Felix was making progress in successfully handling his mental illness does not mean that he would not qualify as an emotionally disturbed person in the context of triggers for that mental illness, including the presence of law enforcement figures, whom he allegedly feared.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 31-32. Further, Plaintiffs plead that Ms. Doe's statement to the detectives placed them on notice of the fact that Mr. Felix was a \"possible\" emotionally disturbed person, and appear to infer that the NYPD Patrol Guide's policies attach in that instance. FAC \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Although the NYPD Patrol Guide does not precisely clarify its applicability to this situation, at the motion to dismiss stage, the Court finds it reasonable to infer that individuals should be treated as emotionally disturbed persons when officers are informed of a suspect's mental illness prior to encountering that individual. In this case, that inference is supported by Plaintiff's allegation that Mr. Felix \"panicked,\" FAC \u00b6 88, a reaction consistent with his acting pursuant to his mental illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    Estate of Jaquez v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , cited by the Defendants to urge dismissal, does not support a contrary conclusion. In\n   <em>\n    Jaquez\n   </em>\n   , the court rejected the plaintiff's claim that his treatment reflected a pattern or practice of constitutional violations of emotionally disturbed persons' rights in part because the plaintiff had not alleged that the NYPD officers were informed that the decedent was an emotionally disturbed person on the 911 call or on their arrival at the scene. No. 10-CV-2881 (KBF),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202696567\">\n    2014 WL 2696567\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5-6 (S.D.N.Y. June 9, 2014). Contrary to Defendant's framing, the\n   <em>\n    Jaquez\n   </em>\n   conclusion indicates that informing officers of a mental illness\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   identify an individual as an emotionally disturbed person-as was alleged to have occurred here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Reliance on OIG Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defendants next argue that Plaintiffs' reliance on the OIG Report is inappropriate given its publication date.

Namely, the OIG Report was an internal document rather than a document developed by an outside agency. It discusses extensive research and planning leading up to the institution of CIT training in the summer of 2015. Plaintiffs thus rely on the report not for the notice it provided on its date of publication, but for the inference it supports that high-level policymakers were aware of the alleged deficiencies at the time of Mr. Felix's death. Def. Br. at 11 (citing OIG Report at 10).

Br. at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The problem for Plaintiffs, in the Court's view, is somewhat different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Though Plaintiffs labor to make the OIG Report relevant to their de facto practice claim, the bulk of the Report concerns the City's progress in implementing a new training policy and, to a lesser extent, reasons it elected to do so. To the extent the Report discusses incidents of brute and excessive force towards individuals with mental illness, the report represents such incidents as few in number, and the NYPD's response to \"the overwhelming majority\" as occurring without leading to a discharge of weapons or serious injury-in short, documenting few instances of brute or excessive force. OIG Report at 1-2. While it is certainly possible that the NYPD had a de facto custom of excessive force, the limited discussion in the OIG Report is not enough to substantiate its existence, even at the motion to dismiss stage. This situation makes this case similar to\n   <em>\n    Delorbe-Bell v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , in which the district court rejected the plaintiff's reliance on a different OIG Report not because it was published after the complained-of incident, nor because such a report cannot support a custom, policy, or practice claim, but because it concluded that the OIG Report did not sufficiently allege deliberate indifference.

The OIG Report and Plaintiffs' cited civil rights complaints make clear that leading up to the encounter with Mr. Felix, NYPD officers regularly responded to individuals with mental illness in the field. OIG Report at 1-2. The same cases indicate that there is some history of employees mishandling such situations. More importantly, the Report notes that adequate training opportunities, including CIT, would make these situations easier for police officers to manage.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1 (discussing the fact that an officer responsible for the officer-involved shooting of a schizophrenic woman had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   received the Department's CIT training);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3 (discussing the ways in which further improvements to the City's CIT training program will \"improve[ ] the response of officers to people in crisis).

Use of the OIG Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   To counter Plaintiffs' failure to train or supervise claim, Defendant reiterates its arguments that an OIG Report published after Mr. Felix's death cannot substantiate Plaintiffs' claims, and further cites three district court cases that rejected parallel failure to train claims based on a different OIG report concerning use of excessive force. In\n   <em>\n    Delorbe-Bell\n   </em>\n   , for example,\n   the court noted that while that report concluded that NYPD's training sessions spent insufficient time on de-escalation, it also emphasized that the NYPD's time spent on \" 'use-of-force scenario based training' [was] 'roughly on par' with the national average.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201451581\">\n    2016 WL 1451581\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1, 4.\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Boddie\n   </em>\n   reached similar conclusions.\n   <em>\n    Dixon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20U.S.%20Dist.%20LEXIS%20119042\">\n    2017 U.S. Dist.

This sufficiently distinguishes the present case from the notice issues described in the cases cited by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Further, the OIG Report Plaintiffs cite is meaningfully different from the OIG Report rejected in the above-described cases. While that Report described NYPD training as \"on par\" with the national average, the OIG Report cited here provides an allegation that the NYPD training practices in place at the time of Mr. Felix's death fell below that standard. The difference stems in part from the fact that this OIG Report is geared mostly toward describing deficiencies in the NYPD's training model as it existed in the period from 2015-2017, after the NYPD had begun to implement CIT training procedures. This Report, in other words, documents problems with the NYPD's training program\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   it had already improved upon the system in place when Mr. Felix died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   According to the Report, the NYPD's\n   <em>\n    new\n   </em>\n   model constitutes a nationally accepted \"best practice.\" OIG Report at 8. The Report contrasts this model with the minimal training predating it: \"a one-day training ... involv[ing] a short, basic lecture on mental illnesses in the morning\" and then having \"a few officers engage in four role-playing scenarios in the afternoon.\" OIG Report at 10. This description clearly supports the allegation that the NYPD's prior training model prior fell below national standards for training with respect to emotionally disturbed persons. The Report contrasts this training not only with the training implemented in the summer of 2015 or the further improvements it envisions, but also with training given to NYPD's Emergency Services Unit, which has \"mirror[ed] the standards of national CIT training\" since 1986.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In short, the Court finds that the amended complaint's reliance on this OIG Report avoids the concerns courts in this circuit have identified with respect to other reports. The allegations are sufficient to avoid dismissal at this stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Use of the Civil Rights Complaints\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Defendant further argues that Plaintiffs' \"citation to eight lawsuits filed over the last thirty years and two other instances in the press,\" provides scant evidence of a training or supervision failure. Def. Br. at 9. They point out that the cases cited did not culminate in findings of unconstitutional activity; and that in the absence of a past pattern of unconstitutional activity, the City was not on notice of the issue in this case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 &amp; n.4. And they contend that the circumstances of the cases varied\n   enough to fail to provide a consistent pattern, particularly when compared to the volume of emotionally disturbed persons calls NYPD officers responded to in the same period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As this Court has previously observed, there is no requirement that complaints result in a formal finding of misconduct for such complaints to support findings of failure to supervise or failure to train.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manigault v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-CV-4307 (AJN),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2013049173\">\n    2012 WL 13049173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y.

Rather, the question at this stage is whether Plaintiffs have plausibly supported the existence of a training deficiency and the City's awareness of the same. The Court disagrees with Defendant that the complaints Plaintiffs cite are too dissimilar to notify the City that its procedures for training officers to respond to or work with emotionally disturbed persons were deficient. Even if the precise factual circumstances of these cases vary, ranging from eviction enforcement to emergency response situations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 142, Plaintiffs' allegation that the cases illustrate NYPD officers' repeated failures to respond to emotionally disturbed persons is at least a plausible one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As other courts confronted with a pattern of lawsuits\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   corroborating reports have found, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have adequately pled deliberately indifferent emotionally disturbed persons training policies. For example, the court in\n   <em>\n    White v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   found that a DOJ findings letter, together with a pattern of complaints, sufficed to render plausible Plaintiffs' allegation that \"poor training, inexperience, and inadequate supervision\" resulted in \"a practice of using excessive force against inmates in deliberate indifference\" of their rights.

July 31, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs adequately allege causation at the motion to dismiss stage. Taking their allegations as true, the Court finds it reasonable to infer that police officers who had received sufficient training in de-escalation, crisis intervention, or other mental health management techniques would not have instigated entry into Mr. Felix's apartment or pursued him, and therefore would have avoided the harms alleged here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Defendant is correct that courts in this circuit often \"favor bifurcating\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   clams,\" and may do so \"even when the individual defendants may assert a defense of qualified immunity such that a finding in their favor does not necessarily dispose of the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Feb. 16, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   But the Court does not find these arguments persuasive as to bifurcating discovery at this stage of this case.

Applicability of ADA and Rehabilitation Act to Mr. Felix\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As a preliminary matter, Defendant appears to argue that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged that Mr. Felix was a qualified individual for purposes of the ADA or Rehabilitation Act. Specifically, the City contends that \"plaintiffs admit\n   that Mr. Felix was not behaving in an emotionally disturbed manner ... but was merely behaving as a fleeing felon.\" Def. Br. at 20; Def. Reply at 10. Insofar as Defendant intends to argue that Mr. Felix's status as an \"emotionally disturbed\" individual dictates whether his ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims survive, this contention is baseless. Even construing Defendant's argument as an argument that Mr. Felix was not a qualified individual, at this stage, such argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to any \"qualified individual.\" Under Title II of the ADA, which governs programs or activities provided by a public entity, a qualified individual is \"an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012131\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2).
