Marchand alleged (among other things) that Matt's Bar was not in compliance with the accessibility requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012181\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. After Nelmatt failed to appear, the Court granted Marchand's motion for a default judgment and ordered Nelmatt \"to make the alterations or modifications necessary to ensure that ... the premises of 'Matt's Bar' ... are fully in compliance with the accessibility requirements of Title III of [the ADA] and its implementing regulations[.]\" ECF No. 26 at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter is before the Court on Marchand's motion for an award of attorney's fees under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012205\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nelmatt appeared in this action after judgment was entered for the purpose of opposing Marchand's request for attorney's fees. ECF No. 36. Nelmatt argues that Marchand is not entitled to recover any attorney's fees and, even if he is, that the amount of fees he is seeking is unreasonable. After reviewing the materials submitted by the parties, the Court agrees with Marchand that he is entitled to recover attorney's fees, agrees with Nelmatt that the amount that Marchand requested is unreasonable, and finds that Marchand is entitled to recover $6,750.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.

This case is one of dozens of cases filed in this District in the past few years in which a disabled person sues a commercial establishment-frequently a bar, restaurant, or convenience store-and alleges that the establishment has violated the accessibility requirements of Title III of the ADA. There is an assembly-line quality to these lawsuits: The plaintiff shows up at an establishment (sometimes having been driven there by an agent of the attorney), the plaintiff looks for a violation of the accessibility requirements (such as a parking spot that has been reserved for persons with disabilities but that has been improperly configured or marked), the plaintiff (or the attorney's agent) reports any violation to the attorney, and the attorney files a lawsuit using a cookie-cutter complaint. In the vast majority of these cases, there is no real dispute that the establishment had failed to comply with an accessibility requirement. And the vast majority of these cases terminate in one of two ways: (1) the parties settle before the establishment has to incur substantial defense costs or (2) the establishment quickly corrects the problem and moves to dismiss the plaintiff's ADA claim as moot.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Almost everything that Michenfelder did on behalf of Marchand could have been done by a legal assistant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Court is not aware of any order in which a judge of this District has discussed the reasonableness of the hourly rates charged by attorneys who bring these cookie-cutter ADA-compliance actions. (No such order has been cited by either party.) In the Court's view, however, a fair comparator to these ADA-compliance actions are actions under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\"FDCPA\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the majority of FDCPA actions filed in this District, a plaintiff notifies an attorney of a technical violation of federal law by a debt collector, the attorney files suit using a cookie-cutter complaint, there is no real dispute about the facts or the law, and the case settles before the debt collector incurs substantial defense costs. In the past couple of years, judges of this District presiding over FDCPA cases have approved hourly rates for successful plaintiffs' attorneys ranging from $200 to $350.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Meidal v.

In\n   <em>\n    Novus Franchising, Inc. v.

The Court instead finds that $300 is a reasonable hourly rate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    B. Number of Hours Reasonably Expended\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Marchand seeks compensation for a total of 26.4 hours worked by Michenfelder. ECF No. 30 at 5; Michenfelder Decl. \u00b6 11 &amp; Ex. A. Nelmatt objects that many of the tasks performed by Michenfelder were necessitated by Marchand's failure to prosecute the case diligently-a failure that required multiple interventions by Magistrate Judge Katherine Menendez. ECF No. 36 at 4-7. The Court agrees that Nelmatt should not have to pay fees that were incurred because Marchand did not diligently prosecute this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   1. Correspondence with the Court\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   a. October 3 and 13, 2016\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Marchand filed his complaint on June 7, 2016. ECF No. 1. On September 30, 2016, Judge Menendez issued an order to show cause why the complaint should not be dismissed, given that Marchand had failed to serve Nelmatt with the summons and complaint within the 90-day time period allowed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. ECF No. 6. Michenfelder spent .20 hours reviewing that order on October 3, 2016, and .20 hours drafting a response on October 13, 2016. Michenfelder Decl. Ex. A. That response indicated that Marchand had been trying to effect personal service since June 8, 2016, and requested an additional 30 days to accomplish the task. ECF No. 7. In light of Marchand's failure to alert the Court of his unsuccessful efforts before the 90-day period had passed, the Court will reduce the adjusted lodestar by $120 (.40 hours at $300 per hour).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   b. December 14 and 28, 2016\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After Marchand failed to serve Nelmatt within the extra 30 days that he had requested, Judge Menendez issued a second order on December 14, 2016, requiring that Marchand provide the Court with an update within 14 days. ECF No. 8. The same day, Michenfelder spent .20 hours reviewing the order. Michenfelder Decl. Ex. A. Two weeks later, on December 28, 2016, Michenfelder spent .20 hours informing the Court that he had finally located an address for Nelmatt and asking to be given until January 9, 2017, to effectuate service.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20692816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 9. Again, because of Marchand's failure to alert the Court of his unsuccessful efforts prior to the Court's sua sponte order, the Court will reduce the adjusted lodestar by $120 (.40 hours at $300 per hour).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   c. December 27, 2016\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On December 27, 2016, Michenfelder spent .40 hours amending the complaint to remove an unnecessary defendant. Michenfelder Decl. Ex. A; ECF No. 10. Marchand did not specifically respond to Nelmatt's contention that this amount of time was unnecessary, but based on Michenfelder's comments at the hearing on Marchand's motion for a default judgment, the Court is persuaded that this work was reasonable. Marchand had understandable difficulty identifying the owner of Matt's Bar, and it was not unreasonable for Michenfelder to spend less than 30 minutes amending the complaint to remove a defendant against whom Marchand had no viable claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   d. February 28 and March 29, 2017\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   After Nelmatt had been properly served with the summons and amended complaint and failed to respond, Judge Menendez issued an order on February 27, 2017, instructing Marchand to take certain steps within 30 days to perfect service and move the litigation forward. ECF No. 13. The next day, Michenfelder spent .20 hours reviewing the order. Michenfelder Decl. Ex. A. Then, on March 29, 2017, Michenfelder spent .20 hours responding to the Court via email.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%20692816\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14. Because, at almost every turn, Judge Menendez was required to goad Marchand into action, the Court will reduce the adjusted lodestar by $120 (.40 hours at $300 per hour).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   e. February 28, 2018\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   On March 30, 2017, Judge Menendez decided not to recommend dismissing the case for lack of prosecution but instead instructed Marchand to move for entry of default. ECF No. 14. Although Marchand applied for entry of default, ECF No. 15, he took no other steps to move the case forward; in particular, he failed to move for a default judgment. Judge Menendez was therefore forced to issue yet another show-cause order on February 22, 2018. ECF No. 18. Michenfelder spent .20 hours reviewing that order on February 28, 2018. Michenfelder Decl. Ex. A. Again, Nelmatt should not be forced to pay for Marchand's lack of diligence in prosecuting this case, so the Court will reduce the adjusted lodestar by $60 (.20 hours at $300 per hour).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   f. Summary\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons described above, the Court reduces the adjusted lodestar by $420 (1.4 hours at $300 per hour) to account for tasks that were necessitated by Marchand's failure to diligently prosecute this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2. Motion for Default Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Nelmatt also objects to the 6.3 hours that Michenfelder spent on April 2, 3, and 19, 2018, preparing papers related to the motion for entry of a default judgment and preparing for oral argument on that motion. ECF No. 36 at 5-6. The Court does not regard the amount of time that Michenfelder spent on these tasks as unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   3. Motion for Attorney's Fees\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Finally, Nelmatt objects to the 6.5 hours that Michenfelder spent on May 2, 3, and 4, 2018, preparing Marchand's motion for attorney's fees. ECF No. 36 at 6. The objection is well taken; the Court has difficulty understanding why it would take Michenfelder longer to prepare a routine fee request than it took him to draft the papers related to the default-judgment motion and prepare for oral argument on that motion. The Court will compensate Michenfelder for four hours and reduce the adjusted lodestar by $750 (2.50 hours at $300 per hour).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    C. Further Adjustments to the Lodestar\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nelmatt urges the Court to depart from the lodestar based on the presence of \"special circumstances.\" ECF No. 36 at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Newman v. Piggie Park Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n    390 U.S. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 402,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n    88 S.Ct. 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6171007\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/390/400/#p402\">\n    19 L.Ed.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968) ). Nelmatt contends that this case has taken over two years to resolve because of Michenfelder's lack of diligence, and that many of Marchand's difficulties in service could have been avoided if a process server had simply gone to Matt's Bar and handed papers to the manager. These circumstances are not \"special,\" however. Marchand had the right to serve Nelmatt through the Secretary of State; Nelmatt did not get actual notice of this lawsuit because of its own failure to provide a current address to the Secretary of State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   For these reasons, the Court awards Marchand a total of $6,750 in attorney's fees, which represents 22.5 hours of work at the rate of $300 per hour.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   ORDER\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Based on the foregoing, and on all of the files, records, and proceedings herein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   1.
