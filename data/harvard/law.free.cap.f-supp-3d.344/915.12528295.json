Lee, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Michael K. Desmond (\"the Trustee\") is the Chapter 7 Trustee for the Bankruptcy Estate of Yellow Cab Affiliation, Inc. (\"YCA\"), a former Chicago taxicab affiliation. The Trustee has filed sixteen counts against the following Defendants: Taxi Affiliation Services LLC (\"TAS\"); Michael Levine; Patton R. Corrigan; Evan Tessler; Gary Sakata; John Moberg; Yellow Cab Association, Inc. (\"New YCA\"); Yellow Group LLC (\"Yellow Group\"); Yellow Medallion Holdings LLC (\"YMH\"); CL Medallion Holdings LLC (\"CLMH\"); Taxi Medallion Management LLC (\"TMM\"); People Mover, LLC (\"People Mover\"); and Yellow Cab Partners LLC (\"Yellow Cab Partners\"). In short, the Trustee claims that Defendants engaged in a scheme to render YCA insolvent, so that it could not pay its creditors, and then established a new company that appropriated YCA's valuable trade dress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants now move to dismiss the Trustee's claims under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(6). Defendants argue that the Trustee's claims fail to meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b), which requires that allegations\n   of fraud be pleaded with particularity. Defendants also contend that the Trustee's claims are precluded by prior bankruptcy proceedings and barred by the applicable statutes of limitations. Defendants have also moved for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11. For the following reasons, Defendants' motion to dismiss [22] is granted in part and denied in part. The motion for sanctions [36] is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   YCA was a Chicago-based taxicab affiliation from 1996 until 2016, when it dissolved. Compl. \u00b6 2, ECF No. 1. It had over 1,600 members who paid it dues pursuant to affiliation agreements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Yellow Group, which owned YCA, owned and licensed to YCA the design mark YCA used on its vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, 99, 159-60. Levine, Corrigan, Sakata, and Tessler (\"YCA's officers and directors\") were officers and directors of YCA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, 39, 101-02. Levine was the majority owner of People Mover, which held a majority interest in Yellow Group.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. The other 45% of Yellow Group was owned by Yellow Cab Partners, an entity wholly owned by Corrigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Levine and Corrigan also owned or managed YMH, CLMH, and TMM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 44-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   YCA passenger Marc Jacobs was injured while riding in a taxicab in 2005.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 55-56. Jacobs filed suit in September 2005 against the driver of the vehicle, as well as the owner of the vehicle who was a YCA member, and YCA was later added as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Around this time, YCA's officers and directors became aware of the lawsuit and YCA's potential liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 59, 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   According to the Complaint, in order to prevent creditors from reaching YCA's assets, YCA's officers and directors established TAS in 2006, and Defendant John Moberg became TAS's president.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 38, 57, 59-60, 66. Defendants then engaged in a series of transactions to defraud YCA's creditors and prevent YCA from being able to satisfy a possible future judgment against it in the Jacobs lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-15, 56-66, 203-13. For example, YCA paid TAS approximately $6 million per year pursuant to an unfavorable services agreement that had not been negotiated at arms' length.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12, 69-74, 82. TAS continued to charge and collect these fees from YCA despite a decrease in the scope of services it provided, and YCA's officers and directors did not attempt to renegotiate the agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In addition, TAS collected and retained all payments from YCA members pursuant to their affiliation agreements with YCA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 57, 79. TAS then transferred portions of that revenue, disguised as \"management fees\" and \"referral fees,\" to YCA's officers and directors, Moberg, and affiliated companies, including TMM.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, 62, 64, 87-97, 110-11, 120-26. While YCA was still operating, YCA's officers and directors failed to keep accurate records and commingled YCA and TAS funds.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 187-202. Using YCA revenue that had been transferred to them, Levine and Corrigan purchased and sold taxicab medallions, but failed to distribute any of\n   the profit to YCA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-20, 175-86. As a result, YCA was insolvent and unable to pay its creditors from 2006 through 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Jacobs obtained a $26 million judgment against YCA in 2015.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. YCA then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which was converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy on November 3, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 24, 53, 127. TAS informed YCA on November 15, 2016, that it would no longer provide services to YCA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26, 138. This forced YCA to cease business operations almost immediately.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 136, 141.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 17, 2016, certain Defendants formed a new taxicab affiliation, Yellow Cab Association, Inc. (\"New YCA\"), to solicit members away from YCA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 129-30, 132, 145, 151-52. New YCA is wholly owned by Moberg.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 38, 150. After its formation, New YCA used mobile data terminals and other taxicab equipment that belonged to YCA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 153-57. In addition, New YCA used the same color scheme and design mark that YCA had used, merely replacing \"Affiliation\" with \"Association.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 166, 168. This tricked customers into believing that New YCA and YCA were one and the same.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 158-74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on these events, the Trustee brings the following claims: breach of fiduciary duty (Count I); tortious interference with contractual relations (Count II); tortious interference with prospective business advantage (Count III); violations of the Illinois Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act (\"UFTA\"), 740 Ill.

Defendants argue that the Trustee's claims should be dismissed because they fail to meet the heightened pleading standard of Rule 9(b). The Trustee disagrees, noting that none of the sixteen counts is based in fraud. Defendants also argue that the Trustee's claims are barred by the statutes of limitations and are precluded by prior bankruptcy proceedings. The Trustee, in turn, contends that the claims are not time-barred because tolling may apply and that the bankruptcy judge's findings have no preclusive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Statutes of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, Defendants seek dismissal of all the Trustee's claims based on the applicable statutes of limitations, which vary in lengths of up to five years. As Defendants point out, some of the Trustee's claims date back to 2006, and this action was filed 11 years later in 2017. The Trustee in turn contends that the claims are not time-barred on their face because tolling may apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Trustee is correct. Dismissal of claims at the pleading stage based on an affirmative defense of a statute of limitations is appropriate only when a plaintiff pleads facts that \"affirmatively show that his suit is time-barred.\"\n   <em>\n    Clark v. City of Braidwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9339032\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/318/764/#p767\">\n    318 F.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (7th Cir. 2003). And, as is pertinent here, Illinois law (which the parties implicitly agree governs here) recognizes the tolling doctrine of \"adverse domination,\" a \"corollary to the discovery rule,\" which is applied in certain limited circumstances to toll a statute of limitations until the time at which a corporation is deemed to have \"knowledge\" that it has been harmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sandburg Mall Mgmt. LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187000\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/563/875/#p887\">\n    563 B.R. 875\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 887 (Bankr. C.D.

Ill. 2016) (tolling statute of limitations on bankruptcy trustee's claim until the date when the trustee was appointed, based on the adverse domination doctrine). Moreover, the doctrine \"creates a rebuttable presumption that knowledge of [an] injury will not be available to [a] corporation as long as the corporation is controlled by wrongdoing officers and directors.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Mollie Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12127742\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/559/501/#p506\">\n    559 B.R. at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, the Trustee contends that, from 2006 to 2016, Defendants had control of YCA and were acting against its interest. That control did not end until the Trustee's appointment in 2016. Compl. \u00b6 127. This action was filed exactly one year later. As such, it is possible that the statutes of limitations on the Trustee's claims were tolled until he was appointed in 2016, and so dismissal based on the statutes of limitations is not warranted at the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Preclusive Effect of the Bankruptcy Court's Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants also contend that the Trustee's Complaint should be dismissed because the claims are precluded by the Bankruptcy Court's findings. Defs.' Mem. Supp. at 10. YCA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2015, and the case was converted to a Chapter 7 case in 2016. Prior to the conversion, the creditors committee\n   sought the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee. Bankruptcy Judge Doyle denied the motion, largely relying on the report of a court-appointed examiner who, after an investigation of TAS's relationship with YCA, had found no evidence of fund diversion or other wrongdoing.\n   <em>\n    In re\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    YCA\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-B-9539, ECF No. 972. Defendants now argue the Trustee's claims are barred by Judge Doyle's findings. Defs.' Mem. Supp. at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For his part, the Trustee contends that neither\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   nor collateral estoppel applies because denying the appointment of a Chapter 11 trustee is not a \"final judgment,\" a required element of both preclusive doctrines. Pl.'s Mem. Opp. Mot. Dismiss (\"Pl.'s Mem. Opp.\") at 10-12, ECF No. 33.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gambino v.

Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 255-70. Count IV alleges a claim of actual fraud under the UFTA, pointing to various \"badges of fraud\" showing Defendants' intent to defraud YCA's creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 255-63.

Other officers and directors also received transfers from TAS.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 274-82. Count VI is a UFTA actual fraud claim, while Count VII is a UFTA constructive fraud claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Like Counts IV and V, these claims also satisfy Rule 9(b). The Trustee alleges that TAS received transfers from YCA that were then distributed to Levine and Corrigan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 273.
