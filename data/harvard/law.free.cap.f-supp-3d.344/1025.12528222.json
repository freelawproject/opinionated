JARVEY, Chief judge\n   This matter comes before the Court pursuant to Defendant Principal Life Insurance Company's April 20, 2018 Motion for Summary Judgment pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56. Dkt. No. 187. Principal also filed a Motion to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Richard Kopcke. Dkt. No. 186. Plaintiff Frederick Rozo, individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated, filed a Resistance to the Motion for Summary Judgment and a Motion to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Craig Merrill on May 15, 2018. Dkt. Nos. 193, 194. Principal filed a Reply to Rozo's Resistance and a Motion to Decertify the Class on June 4, 2018. Dkt. Nos. 206, 207. Rozo filed an Opposition to Principal's Motion to Decertify the Class on June 22, 2018. Dkt. No. 215. Principal filed a Reply to Rozo's Opposition on June 29, 2018. Dkt. No. 221. For the reasons that follow, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   as to Counts I, II, and III. Accordingly, Plaintiff's Motion to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Craig Merrill, Defendant's Motion to Exclude Opinions and Testimony of Richard Kopcke, and Defendant's Motion to Decertify the Class are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED as moot\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. STATEMENT OF UNDISPUTED MATERIAL FACTS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Frederick Rozo (\"Rozo\") resides in California and was employed by the Western Exterminator Company (\"WEC\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During his employment, Rozo participated in the WEC Employees' 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan (the \"Plan\"), which allocated funds to the investment plan at issue in this lawsuit. Defendant Principal Life Insurance Company (\"Principal\") is an insurance company headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa. Principal offered a product called the Principal Fixed Income Option (\"PFIO\") to 401(k) plans. Participation in the PFIO is governed by a group annuity contract and incorporated schedules (the \"Contract\"). PFIO funds are deposited into Principal's general account, which is invested in bonds and fixed income instruments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The PFIO is structured as a series of Guaranteed Interest Funds (\"GIFs\"). Every six months during the class period, Principal created a new GIF that accepted participants' deposits into the PFIO for the following six months.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For each GIF,\n   Principal declared in advance an applicable Guaranteed Interest Rate (\"GIR\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, every six months during the class period, Principal issued a new PFIO schedule that related to and governed the new GIF. The interest rate credited to the participants is called the Composite Crediting Rate (\"CCR\"), and during the class period, Principal established a new CCR every six months, with effectivity dates of January 1 and July 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The PFIO Contract describes, in words, the formula used for calculating the CCR.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Participants are guaranteed to earn interest at the CCR for that six-month period-if Principal's general account performs at a rate of return less than the CCR, Principal will lose money by paying participants the CCR, but if the general account performs at a rate of return above the CCR, Principal will make money by retaining the \"spread.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Principal's ability to retain the spread is therefore dependent on participants' decision to invest in the PFIO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Principal notifies plan sponsors of the new CCR about 30 days in advance of the new effectivity date. Plan sponsors (also called \"plan administrators\") are required by law to notify participants of the new rate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   If participants object to the new CCR, they can withdraw their monies subject to the terms described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Contract governs the terms on which a plan or participant can withdraw from the PFIO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Participants are allowed to withdraw their money from the PFIO at any time and deposit it in another plan investment option without a contractual financial penalty, though transfers to Competing Plan Investment Options are subject to an equity wash.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Contract defines equity wash as follows, \"any transfers made from this Contract to a Competing Plan Investment Option must first be directed to a Plan Investment Option that is not a Competing Plan Investment Option. There will be a stated period of time before such amounts may be directed to a Competing Plan Investment Option.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   During all relevant times, Principal set the equity wash period at 90 days. In the fourth quarter of 2008, Rozo transferred $9,395 out of the PFIO and immediately placed those funds in non-competing investment options. Plans are allowed to terminate their entire interest in the PFIO either by giving Principal 12-month advance notice or by paying a 5% surrender charge to receive their funds immediately. If the plan chooses to pay the 5% surrender charge, the plan sponsor makes the\n   decision as to whether or not to pass that charge along to participants. The Contract and related schedules also describe the \"stampede provision,\" which states that if a collection of participant withdrawals appear to have been motivated by plan sponsor action, Principal can impose the surrender charge on the plan sponsor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   An inquiry into whether a stampede has occurred is triggered if participants representing 20% of the plan's interest in the PFIO withdraw within a three-month period and the plan has given notice of its intent to withdraw.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Article I of the Contract covers basic definitions; Article II details the deposits and funds; Article III of the Contract sets forth a description of Principal's fees with reference to the associated schedules; Article IV covers benefits and other payments; and Article V describes limitations and termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Additional undisputed material facts are set forth below as needed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Principal Life Insurance Company\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Counts I and II of the First Amended Complaint allege that Principal breaches its fiduciary duty and engages in prohibited transactions under ERISA when it sets\n   the fixed rate of return guaranteed to participants every six months. Count I states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   These breaches include but are not limited to the following: (a) setting the Guaranteed Interest Rate and/or Composite Guaranteed Rate for its own benefit rather than for the benefit of the Plans and participants; (b) setting the credited rate artificially low; (c) misrepresenting the extent to which the rate was \"guaranteed;\" (d) failing to disclose its retention of the spread; and (e) charging an excessive disclosed fee in addition to the undisclosed compensation from the spread.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dkt. No. 67. Count II states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Principal engaged in prohibited transactions in violation of ERISA \u00a7 406(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), by dealing with the Contract in its own interest or for its own account. Specifically, Principal set the credited rate to ensure its own profit rather than for the benefit of the Plans and participants, and set the rate artificially low.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dkt. No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   If Principal is not a fiduciary, Counts I and II fail as a matter of law. Principal argues it is not a fiduciary for two reasons. Dkt. No. 187. First, Principal announces each new rate in advance, which allows participants time to decide whether to accept or reject the new rate. Because participants decide whether each new rate will apply to their funds, Principal argues it lacks discretionary authority or control over plan assets sufficient to make it a fiduciary or set its own compensation. Second, Principal argues the PFIO is a guaranteed benefits policy (\"GBP\") under ERISA, which means that the assets allocated to the PFIO are not plan assets. If so, Principal lacks discretionary authority or control over plan assets sufficient to make it a fiduciary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Count III alleges that Principal engages in a prohibited transaction by offering the PFIO and is liable under ERISA as a nonfiduciary party in interest. Count III states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Principal understood that it would receive millions of dollars in compensation from the Plans by retaining an excessive portion of the investment earnings derived from the Fund. Principal's failure to properly disclose this compensation caused the Plans to engage in transactions with Principal for the furnishing of services to the Plans, that are prohibited under ERISA \u00a7 406(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201106\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Dkt. No. 67. Principal argues that Count III fails because it lacked the requisite knowledge that the transaction was unlawful, which precludes the imposition of liability for a prohibited transaction. Dkt. Nos. 187, 207.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Frederick Rozo and Class Members\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, Rozo argues that Principal acts as a fiduciary with respect to the PFIO. Dkt. No. 194-1 at 5-15. Rozo states that Principal's exercise of any discretionary authority over the management or disbursement of plan assets creates a fiduciary duty to participants because: (1) it directly affects the value of the Contract; and (2) it allows Principal to determine its own compensation. Further, Rozo argues that Principal need not have unilateral control or a final say over participants' ability to accept or reject the guaranteed rate for a fiduciary duty to exist. Finally, Rozo argues that there are genuine issues of material fact regarding participants' ability to \"vote with their feet\" by leaving the PFIO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, Rozo argues that the guaranteed benefits policy (\"GBP\") exemption does not relieve Principal of fiduciary status. Dkt. No. 194-1 at 15-20. Rozo states that his claims pertain to Principal's administration of the Contract, which qualifies as a plan asset regardless of the GBP exemption. He also argues that the Contract\n   is not a GBP because it does not guarantee any amount of benefits or a reasonable rate of return and the investment risk is borne primarily by the participants in the PFIO.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, Rozo argues that Principal was a party in interest upon entry into the Contract and engaged in prohibited transactions. Dkt. No. 194-1 at 20-25. Rozo states that Principal is strictly liable so long as it was aware of the details of the prohibited transactions and that he need not show Principal knew its conduct was illegal. In short, he argues that Principal's \"singular\" knowledge of its own compensation provides the requisite knowledge for Count III. Finally, Rozo claims he is entitled to a remedy for Principal's Section 406(a) violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The analysis and conclusions below address whether Principal is an ERISA fiduciary, and then whether Principal may still be liable as a nonfiduciary. ERISA states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), a person is a fiduciary with respect to a plan to the extent (i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, (ii) he renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation, direct or indirect, with respect to any moneys or other property of such plan, or has any authority or responsibility to do so, or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan. Such term includes any person designated under section 1105(c)(1)(B) of this title.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201002\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (21)(A). Because the Court finds that Principal is not an ERISA fiduciary through its discretion as to the credited rate itself or as to its own compensation, it is unnecessary to analyze the parties' arguments regarding the Plan's status as a GBP. The Court notes, though, that even if the Plan is a GBP, \"the only effect of the GBP exception, if it [applied], is to free the insurer from the requirement to manage its general account solely for the benefit of ERISA plan participants whose contributions reside in the general account.\"\n   <em>\n    Teets v. Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522996\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/1192/#p1200\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1200-01 (D. Colo. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Fiduciary Status and Discretion as to the CCR\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With regard to the first theory, the core of Principal's argument is that it is not a fiduciary because it announces each new rate in advance, which allows participants time to decide whether to keep their money in the PFIO or move it elsewhere. Principal relies on\n   <em>\n    Teets v. Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Teets\n   </em>\n   \"), which explains \"there are a number of cases favoring the theory that a pre-announced rate of return prevents fiduciary status from attaching to the decision regarding ... what rate to set, at least when the plan and/or its participants can 'vote with their feet' if they dislike the new rate.\"\n   <em>\n    Teets v. Great-West Life &amp; Annuity Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522996\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/286/1192/#p1200\">\n    286 F.Supp.3d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1201 (D. Colo. 2017). This line of cases begins with\n   <em>\n    Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. v. Connecticut General Life Insurance Company\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   \"). Rozo, on the other hand, argues that the\n   <em>\n    Teets\n   </em>\n   decision is factually distinct\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the instant\n   case and relies on a misinterpretation of\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 194-1 at 10 n.11. For the reasons listed below, the Court agrees with Principal and will apply the standard established in\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   as described in\n   <em>\n    Teets.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   , the company announced a guaranteed rate of interest for its \"Guaranteed Account\" in advance.\n   <em>\n    Chicago Bd.

Later, the insurance company exercised unilateral authority to amend the contract, forcing participants to transfer 10% of their contributions per year for the next 10 years into a new account called \"Guaranteed Account B.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the contract, participants were forbidden from withdrawing funds after 10% of an account had been transferred or withdrawn in a single year.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The plaintiff sued, claiming that the insurance company had intentionally set up the second account to trigger the withdrawal provision and essentially freeze the funds for its own benefit.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The plaintiff argued that the insurance company had breached its fiduciary duties under ERISA when it exercised unilateral control for its own benefit by amending the contract.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Holding that the plaintiff had a viable ERISA claim, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals observed a critical distinction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   For our purposes the relevant question is whether the power to amend the contract constitutes the requisite \"control respecting ... disposition of [plan] assets.\" Had\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   simply given Plan assets to Connecticut General and said, \"Invest this as you see fit and we will use the proceeds to pay retirement benefits,\" Connecticut General would clearly have sufficient control over the disposition of Plan assets and be a fiduciary under ERISA.\n   <em>\n    Because Connecticut General guaranteed the rate of return in advance for the Guaranteed Accounts, that is not the case here.\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, the policy itself is a Plan asset, and Connecticut General's ability to amend it, and thereby alter its value, is not qualitatively different from the ability to choose investments. By locking\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   into the Guaranteed Accounts for the next 10 years[,] Connecticut General has effectively determined what type of investment the Plan must make. In exercising this control over an asset of the Plan, Connecticut General must act in accordance with its fiduciary obligations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    CBOE\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1874638\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/713/254/#p256\">\n    713 F.2d at 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted) (emphasis added).

First, Principal is acting pursuant to the PFIO Contract, which is the result of an arms-length bargaining process with the plan sponsors. Until they sign the Contract, plan sponsors are free to choose another investment firm or not offer investment services at all. Participants, in turn, choose whether to invest subject to the terms of the Contract-they could choose not to invest at all or to retain private investment services separate from those offered by the plan sponsor. Second, Principal announces the GIR and CCR in advance and communicates those rates to plan sponsors. Plan sponsors are required by law to communicate those rates to participants. The overwhelming weight of authority indicates that announcing the rate in advance forestalls fiduciary responsibility under ERISA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, participants have a meaningful opportunity to \"vote with their feet\" by leaving the PFIO in response to an objectionable CCR set by Principal. At the participant level, there are no contractual fees or penalties for transferring funds to a non-competing fund. Transferring funds to\n   a competing fund does trigger a 90-day equity wash, similar to that present in\n   <em>\n    Insinga.\n   </em>\n   The equity wash is described in the Contract, which participants agree to prior to making their decision to invest in the PFIO. The requirement of a short equity wash period, especially when included in an investment contract, does not obviate the meaningfulness of a participant's ability to leave the PFIO. At the plan level, plan sponsors are free to leave without any penalties if they provide 12-month notice to Principal (subject to the stampede provision), but they are subject to a 5% surrender charge if they do not provide notice. These restrictions are not as severe as those in\n   <em>\n    Charters\n   </em>\n   , where the Court held that fiduciary liability did attach because the only way to reject the service provider's decision was to terminate the entire relationship and be subject to termination and administrative charges. Here, while there are restrictions included in the Contract at the plan level, they do not pose such a bar to leaving the PFIO that plan sponsors do not have a meaningful way to reject Principal's rate-setting decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Therefore, the Court rejects Rozo's argument that it may hold Principal to fiduciary standards under the theory that Principal exercises discretionary authority when it sets the CCR and the GIR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Fiduciary Status and Discretion as to Defendant's Own Compensation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Next, Rozo argues, \"Principal's ability to set a new GIR every six months also gives Principal authority over the amount of its own compensation, because Principal retains the spread between the rate paid to participants and the return on the underlying investment portfolio.\" Dkt.

Discussion and Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Rozo begins with the proposition that essentially any violation of ERISA \u00a7 406 (codified at 29 U.S.C \u00a7 1106 ) is a strict liability offense-once a contract is signed,\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   transactions between a service provider and a plan are prohibited unless subject to the exceptions in ERISA \u00a7 408 (codified at 29 U.S.C \u00a7 1108 ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   29 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1106, 1108. Rozo alleges that \"Principal used the Contract (which is a plan asset) on an ongoing basis to set the CCR, collect contributions, pay interest to plan participants at the CCR, and retain the spread [in violation] of ERISA \u00a7 406(a).\" Dkt. 194-1 at 21. Specifically, he argues that Principal's actions are prohibited unless they fall within the exception allowing for the exchange of services for \"no more than reasonable compensation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201108\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Rozo argues his entire case regarding nonfiduciary liability using the\n   <em>\n    Neil\n   </em>\n   version of the\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   standard. Dkt. No. 194-1 at 21-24. Under the\n   <em>\n    Neil\n   </em>\n   standard, ERISA liability as a nonfiduciary party in interest would attach if Principal had \"knowledge of the facts, events, conditions, or evidence\" of its use of plan assets to provide services to the plan for unreasonable compensation.\n   <em>\n    Neil\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4267283\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/753/724/#p731\">\n    753 F.Supp.2d at 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Rozo states, \"There can be no question that Principal was in possession of all the facts regarding its compensation. Indeed, Principal determined the deducts it applied to price the PFIO, and had all the necessary data and information to calculate the spread for each six-month period.\" Dkt. No. 194-1 at 23. Under\n   <em>\n    Neil\n   </em>\n   , Rozo would not have to show that Principal knew its use of the Contract \"to set the CCR, collect contributions, pay interest to plan participants at the CCR, and retain the spread\" violated ERISA \u00a7 406(a). It appears to the Court that Rozo's argument for the imposition of nonfiduciary liability upon Principal boils down to an allegation that Principal engaged in prohibited transactions under ERISA by executing its assigned duties as described by the Contract without knowledge that using the Contract to perform those duties was unlawful because its compensation-also detailed in the Contract-was unreasonable. Because of his reliance on\n   <em>\n    Neil\n   </em>\n   , Rozo does not explain how Principal knew or should have known its use of the Contract was unlawful. Dkt. No. 194-1 at 20-25. Further, Rozo repeatedly emphasizes a perceived disparity in the information held by the parties regarding Principal's compensation without explaining how this alleged fact contributes to Principal's knowledge that its conduct was unlawful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As reflected in its reply brief, Principal's most persuasive argument is that Rozo simply has not made out a claim for nonfiduciary liability under the\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   standard as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Teets\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 187-1 at 19-20; Dkt. No. 207 at 13-15. Using Rozo's description, the undisputed facts show that \"Principal used the Contract (which is a plan asset) on an ongoing basis to set the CCR, collect contributions, pay interest to plan participants at the CCR, and retain the spread.\" Dkt. No. 194-1 at 21. Applying the rationale from\n   <em>\n    Salomon\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Teets\n   </em>\n   , Rozo needs to show that Principal knew or should have known that the transaction violated ERISA. Even if engaging in a prohibited transaction is a strict liability offense, Rozo \"has not presented any evidence that Principal\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   its compensation was unreasonable. The fact that [Rozo's] expert claims the compensation is unreasonable does not mean Principal thought it was unreasonable.\" Dkt. No. 207 at 14-15. Given that Principal's duties and the methods of calculating its compensation were agreed-upon terms of the Contract, Principal had no reason to think its compensation was anything other than reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Court finds that the undisputed material facts demonstrate that Principal neither knew nor should have known that it was engaging in an unlawful prohibited transaction under ERISA. Count III fails as a matter of law and Principal is entitled to summary judgment. Because the Court finds that Rozo's argument to impose nonfiduciary liability on Principal as party in interest is without merit, the Court does not reach the questions presented by Rozo's request to recover.

Also, the product in\n    <em>\n     Teets\n    </em>\n    had no equity wash provision. Dkt. No. 194-1 at 6 n.4. While it is true that the PFIO has no guaranteed minimum and could theoretically drop below zero, the rate is announced in advance every six months, has never gone below zero during the class period, and participants have meaningful opportunities to leave the PFIO if the rate is unsatisfactory. Additionally, the equity wash provision does not destroy participants' meaningful opportunity to leave the PFIO, as illustrated by the fact that Rozo did remove his monies. Given these undisputed facts,\n    <em>\n     Teets\n    </em>\n    is sufficiently analogous to the instant case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    Rozo also argues that the exercise of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    discretionary authority or control over management or disposition of plan assets confers fiduciary status and the existence of\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    barrier to rejecting a service provider's decision at the plan-level imposes fiduciary liability.

Essentially, Rozo argues that ERISA is intended to protect participants and that absolving an investment provider of fiduciary status because participants are able to withdraw their monies \"improperly places the onus entirely on participants to protect themselves\" and places them on equal footing with service providers or plan fiduciaries. The Court is not persuaded.\n    <em>\n     McCaffree\n    </em>\n    is cited to support the proposition that a service provider's adherence to a properly-negotiated agreement with a plan administrator does not implicate fiduciary duty on behalf of the service provider.
