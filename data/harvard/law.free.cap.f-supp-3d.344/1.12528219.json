The parties have arrived at a negotiated solution, and they have filed a joint motion for an indicative ruling pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1.

The parties have executed a conditional settlement agreement providing that the Department will search for and produce certain documents from its investigation of the operation to the Committee, subject to this Court's vacating the Orders and dismissing the case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b). Joint Suppl. Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Indicative Ruling [Dkt. # 135] (\"Joint Suppl.\") at 3-4, citing Conditional Settlement Agreement, Ex. A to Joint Mot.

The operation, run by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Phoenix, Arizona, sought to track the suspected flow of firearms from the United States to drug cartels in Mexico. During the course of the investigation, agents permitted straw purchasers to buy firearms illegally in the United States, and then let the purchasers \"walk\" the firearms into Mexico without being apprehended. Am. Compl. [Dkt. # 35] \u00b6 1. The tactic was designed to track the guns to their ultimate destination and reveal any nexus between the leaders of Mexican crime syndicates and the individuals who purchased the firearms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the initiative came under intense scrutiny when a U.S. law enforcement agent was killed in December 2010 with one of the guns that was part of the operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. Members of Congress began inquiring into the matter, and in a letter dated February 4, 2011, the Department of Justice firmly denied that ATF ever knowingly failed to interdict weapons that had been purchased illegally.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As more facts came to light, though, the Department acknowledged that law enforcement agents had in fact permitted some guns to walk during the course of the Phoenix operation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The Committee then shifted its focus to uncovering why the Department had provided it with incorrect information at the outset.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On October 11, 2011, the Committee issued the subpoena to the Attorney General that lies at the heart of this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 8. While a large volume of materials was produced, the Department informed the Committee on June 20, 2012 that the President had asserted executive privilege over all relevant documents dated after February 4, 2011.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. On August 13, 2012, the Committee filed this action to compel the production of those records, which had been withheld on the grounds that they were covered by the deliberative process prong of the executive privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. [Dkt. #1].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case produced a number of rulings. After the lawsuit was filed, the Department of Justice moved to dismiss it. It took the position that this Court did not have - or should decline to exercise -\n   jurisdiction over what the Department characterized as a political dispute between the executive and legislative branches of the government. The Attorney General warned that it would threaten the constitutional balance of powers if the Court endeavored to weigh the Committee's stated need for the material against the executive's interest in confidential decision making, or if the Court were to make its own judgment about whether the negotiation and accommodation process to date had been adequate. Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss [Dkt. # 13-1] at 19-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Committee opposed the motion to dismiss. It argued that it was both lawful and prudent for the Court to exercise jurisdiction since the case involved a discrete, narrow question of law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   This type of case - at bottom, a\n   <em>\n    subpoena enforcement case\n   </em>\n   - has been brought in and addressed by the courts in this Circuit many times before....

The Committee contended that as a matter of law, the executive branch could not invoke the deliberative process privilege in response to a Congressional subpoena. Pl.'s Mot. for Summ. J. [Dkt. # 61].

It took the position that not one of the records was deliberative, and that even if some were, the interests advanced by the privilege were outweighed by the Committee's need for the material. The Committee asked the Court to hold that intra-agency communications about responding to Congressional and media requests for information are not covered by the privilege. Pl.'s Mem. for Mot. to Compel at 26-29.

Based upon authority from this Circuit, it found that records containing the agency's internal deliberations over how to respond to Congressional and media inquiries were entitled to protection under the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But the Court also acknowledged, citing\n   <em>\n    Espy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n    121 F.3d at 737-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that the privilege is a qualified one that can be overcome by a sufficient showing of need for the material.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"285176,3708318\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/121/729/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ultimately, though, the Court concluded that there was no need to balance the Committee's need for the records against the impact their disclosure could have on candor in future executive decision making because the Department had already disclosed the records itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 105-06, citing U.S. Dep't of Justice, Office of the Inspector Gen.

That too has been accomplished. Br. for Appellee at 10-11. So even if the first order contemplated that the Court would remain involved for some time to rule on the privilege assertions in the list, neither order has any prospective elements now. Both parties advised this Court on February 3, 2016 that the orders resolved all of the outstanding issues presented in the case, and they called for entry of final judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Notice Regarding Entry of Final J.; Pl.'s Not. of Compliance with Court's Feb. 1, 2016 Min.

Indeed, the only aspect of the dispute that was supposed to play out in the future was that portion of the process from which the Court expressly excluded itself: negotiation over other privileges that were not a part of the initial complaint, and the resolution of the parties' spat over whether they had or had not narrowed the subpoena by agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch\n   </em>\n   , 156 F.Supp.3d at 119 (\"[A]ny responsive documents that were not embraced in [the privilege assertion on June 20, 2012] are an entirely separate matter, and intervention in that dispute would entangle the Court in an ongoing political dispute of the sort that is not suitable to judicial resolution.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Furthermore, if a goal of the request that the Orders be vacated is, as the parties have indicated, to eliminate any \"preclusive effect[s],\" Conditional Settlement Agreement \u00b6 4, the Circuit has made it clear that future preclusive effects do not fall within the scope of \"prospective application\" as that term is used in Rule 60(b)(5).\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

So the suggestion that the parties should be permitted to work this out among themselves comes a little late in the proceedings to be a compelling factor. Indeed, the Supreme Court has observed that a settlement at this stage does not weigh in favor of vacating an order, because granting vacatur after appeal may create an incentive not to settle earlier in the process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/18/#p22\">\n    513 U.S. at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416,6117237\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/386/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (warning that making vacatur available while a judgment is on appeal \"may\n   <em>\n    deter\n   </em>\n   settlement at an earlier stage\" because \"\n   <em>\n    [s]ome\n   </em>\n   litigants ... may think it worthwhile to roll the dice rather than settle in the district court ... if, but only if, an unfavorable outcome can be washed away by a settlement-related vacatur\") (both emphases in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Neumann v.

While it would render a decision by the Court of\n   Appeals unnecessary, \"the judicial economies achieved by settlement at the district-court level are ordinarily much more extensive than those achieved by settlement on appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bancorp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/18/#p22\">\n    513 U.S. at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1332416,6117237\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/115/386/\">\n    115 S.Ct. 386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is also particularly true in this case, which involved multiple rounds of briefing and argument to resolve the large number of legal issues. And, since the Orders were not executory, and they have already been complied with, denying the instant motion would not hinder a negotiated resolution in any way; the parties do not need vacatur to agree to settle the matter and eliminate the expenditure of additional effort on the part of counsel or the Court of Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At the end of the day, the parties' emphasis on the fact that they have come to an agreement that the Court should welcome rings hollow, and their request that the Orders be vacated because of the settlement and for no other reason is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Not only did the parties fail to take advantage of multiple opportunities to achieve a mediated solution while the case was pending, but the case was virtually over when they came to this vaunted accommodation - the Court had already ordered the production of the documents that had been withheld on deliberative process privilege grounds, and they had already been turned over. The few loose ends that remained had been expressly left to be negotiated between the parties anyway, and the Department advised the Court of Appeals that it had already granted the Committee access to the bulk of those materials too. So there was little if anything to negotiate, and the only real change in circumstance since the filing of the appeal has been the change in political leadership at the Department of Justice in the wake of the Presidential election. This suggests that the primary, if not the sole, objective of the conditional settlement and the pending motion is to erase the Court's prior rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Court of course appreciates the fact that the parties were willing to sit down and resolve the few open issues there were among themselves, even if it was long after the case had come to a conclusion and after the expenditure of the parties' and the Court's resources. But the fact that this unique dispute involving the production of a specific set of records - which the Court found had already been disclosed to the public in any event - has been resolved does not diminish the importance of the fundamental legal questions that arose along the way. And the parties have not articulated any reason why the Court's opinions on those broad subjects - which were shaped by its consideration of the thorough briefing and skilled argument by both sides - should simply evaporate. During the course of this litigation pitting two branches of the United States government against one another, the Court determined: that the dispute was justiciable and that Congress could seek to enforce its\n   duly issued subpoena in this Court; that the executive branch could invoke the deliberative process prong of the executive privilege to shield records from production to the legislature; that the privilege could not be asserted on a blanket basis, though, but only on a document-by-document basis; that the privilege covered internal deliberations concerning communications with Congress or the media; and that the privilege was not absolute and could be waived or overcome by a showing of need. These are all issues that could very well arise again in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The parties maintain that the opinions should be vacated so that this Court's decisions on those complex and delicate issues do not bind other courts in the future.

Miers\n   </em>\n   , not because it was required to follow it, but because it independently reached the same conclusion. However, it found the opinion to be persuasive and instructive in that process, and it had access to the ruling on the jurisdictional question even though that dispute was ultimately resolved among the parties. Judges find other judges' opinions to be helpful when they are considering difficult questions, even if they ultimately disagree with them, and that is one reason why these rulings should remain on the books.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also, the concordance between the two opinions - written by different judges, at times when different political parties were in control of the House and were running the Department of Justice - is a powerful illustration of the fact that under the Constitution, the rule of law endures even when power changes hands, and no matter which party's interests are affected by its application. This is why the mere fact that the leadership of the Department of Justice has changed should not be deemed to be a circumstance that warrants extraordinary equitable relief, and it is yet another reason that the public interest would not be served by vacatur in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In light all these factors, the Court holds that the balance of equities weighs against vacating the Orders and that granting the parties' motion would not be in the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   For the reason set forth above, the Joint Motion for an Indicative Ruling [Dkt. # 130] is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Order [Dkt. # 81],\n    <em>\n     Comm. on Oversight &amp; Gov't Reform, U.S. House of Representatives v.

So there was nothing left to negotiate after that took place. With respect to other privileges that had not been challenged in the complaint, and the parties' dispute about whether they had narrowed the universe of records to be searched by agreement, the Court ruled that it would not get involved in those issues and that they were better suited to the process of negotiation and accommodation.
