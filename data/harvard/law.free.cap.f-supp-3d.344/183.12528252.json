On January 26, 2016, the Court dismissed Mr. Nyambal's complaint, finding that he failed to state a claim against AlliedBarton for: (1) tortious interference with business relationships; (2) defamation; (3) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (4) civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nyambal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290334\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/309/\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d at 315-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On February 23, 2016, Mr. Nyambal filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the Court wrongly dismissed his defamation claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recons.

Compl., ECF No. 1-3 \u00b6\u00b6 2-4. Plaintiff Mr. Nyambal is a \"distinguished economist,\" who served as a senior advisor at the IMF until he was fired in June 2009, purportedly in retaliation for raising \"serious concerns\" about the lack of transparency and potential corruption in a Cameroon mining project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 6-7. In order to \"silence and punish\" Mr. Nyambal for whistleblowing, the IMF and AlliedBarton allegedly conspired to \"blacklist [him] by posting his name and picture on the World Bank's 'No Admit List.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. Based on the information within an IMF \"blacklisting memo,\" AlliedBarton \"place[d] his name and picture on the World Bank's 'No Admit' list, which ... prevent[s] individuals deemed a security threat from entering the premises.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 20. As a result, Mr. Nyambal was denied access to the World Bank in July 2013\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and October 2013.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11, 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 9, 2013, Mr. Nyambal sought to enter the World Bank with a colleague to attend the World Bank's Annual Meeting to \"meet with government officials and secure contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 13. Despite having a three-day pass, Mr. Nyambal was denied access, which \"publicly humiliated [him] in the presence of former colleagues, professional acquaintances,\n   and government officials.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At least one potential client was \"advised\" that Mr. Nyambal was on the World Bank's and the IMF's Do Not Admit lists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. Mr. Nyambal's contract negotiations \"have come to a halt\" as a result of this alleged blacklisting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 5, 2014, Mr. Nyambal met with representatives from the World Bank and AlliedBarton.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. The World Bank \"declined\" any responsibility for Mr. Nyambal's inclusion on the Do Not Admit list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. The World Bank also sent him a redacted version of the IMF's \"blacklisting memo,\" which confirmed that his name was included on the Do Not Admit list.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Mr. Nyambal, AlliedBarton allegedly \"acknowledged that Nyambal's blacklisting [in October 2013] was triggered by the information provided by the IMF to the World Bank through AlliedBarton.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Mr. Nyambal's Motion for Leave to File a Supplemental Memorandum in Support of his Motion for Reconsideration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Nyambal moves to file a supplemental memorandum in support of his motion for reconsideration \"pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(2) and 15(d)....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Suppl., ECF No. 36-2 at 1. However, neither Rule 15(a) nor Rule 15(d) allow Mr. Nyambal to file a supplemental memorandum in support of a motion. Rule 15(a)(2) provides that \"a party may amend its\n   <em>\n    pleading\n   </em>\n   only with the opposing party's written consent or the court's leave.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a) (emphasis added). Rule 15(d) provides that \"the court may, on just terms, permit a party to serve a supplemental\n   <em>\n    pleading\n   </em>\n   setting out any ... event that happened after the date of the pleading to be supplemented.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(d) (emphasis added). Plainly, Rule 15 allows a party to amend or supplement pleadings; however, motions are not considered pleadings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(a) (defining pleadings); Fed. R. Civ. P. 7(b) (distinguishing a motion from a pleading);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sokos v.

Mr. Nyambal argues that leave to supplement is warranted because his supplemental memorandum addresses \"newly discovered evidence\" that \"goes to the basis of why the Court dismissed his claim ... [because] it shows the level of knowledge and control the Defendant has concerning security and blacklisting ....\" Mot. to Suppl., ECF No. 36 at 3. The evidence includes an IMF administrative order outlining the procedural steps the organization must take before imposing sanctions on employees,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1-3, ECF No. 36-2; the IMF's public description of its Security Services team, Ex. 4, ECF No. 36-2; and AlliedBarton's public job description of its IMF security officer position, Ex. 5, ECF No. 36-2. Mr. Nyambal argues that this evidence \"probably would have changed the outcome\" of his defamation claim. Mot. to Suppl., ECF No. 36-2 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Court dismissed Mr. Nyambal's defamation claim based on his failure to state a claim, not because of insufficient evidence.\n   <em>\n    Nyambal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290334\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/309/\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 317-18. In so doing, the Court evaluated the \"legal sufficiency\" of the complaint itself, not the \"truth of what is asserted\" or \"whether a plaintiff has any evidence to back up what is in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Browning v.

Cir. 2002) (quotations and citations omitted). Therefore, even if these exhibits had been\n   included, the Court would not have considered them. As discussed below, the Court grants Mr. Nyambal's motion for reconsideration based only on the allegations within his complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Mr. Nyambal's motion for leave to file a supplemental memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Recons. Mot., ECF No. 17 at 2, 4-14. Mr. Nyambal argues that the Court should have found that AlliedBarton plausibly published false and defamatory statements about him when it included his name and picture on the World Bank's Do Not Admit list.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414873,3699663\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/235/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A motion to alter or amend a judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e)\"is discretionary and need not be granted unless the district court finds that there is an intervening change of controlling law, the availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    Messina v.

Instead, the Court determined that Mr. Nyambal had insufficiently imputed liability through a theory of civil conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    Nyambal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290334\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/309/\">\n    153 F.Supp.3d at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Recons. Mot., ECF No. 17 at 6-7. Mr. Nyambal contends that a \"closer read\" of the complaint shows that he \"distinguished\" the blacklisting memo from the Do Not Admit list, attributing \"the source of the former to the IMF and the latter to the Defendant.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. Therefore, the Court \"should have decided that Plaintiff sufficiently alleged multiple distinct writings [attributable to AlliedBarton] which communicated defamatory statements (DNA list) about him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To support this argument, he points to several paragraphs in his complaint in which he \"repeatedly asserts that AlliedBarton was either independently or jointly responsible for the publication of the defamatory Do Not Admit list.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-12 (citing Compl., ECF No. 1-3 \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13, 16, 17, 20, 21).

Because Mr. Nyambal makes \"no effort\" to explain how an \"independent vendor providing security\" had any reason to know of Mr. Nyambal's whistleblowing activity, AlliedBarton contends that the \"only reasonable inference is that AlliedBarton did not act on its own, and therefore, could not have acted negligently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   To state a defamation claim under District of Columbia law, one must allege: (1) the defendant made a false and defamatory statement about the plaintiff; (2) the defendant published the statement without privilege to a third party; (3) the defendant's fault in publishing the statement amounted to at least negligence; and (4) the statement was actionable as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Solers, Inc. v.
