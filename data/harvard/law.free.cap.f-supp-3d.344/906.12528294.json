(\"FFN\") brings a copyright claim against defendant Jasmine Enterprises, Inc. for alleged infringement of FFN's copyright in three photographs of Nicky Hilton and James Rothschild taken at their July 10, 2015 celebrity wedding (\"the Hilton-Rothschild Photos\"). Currently before the Court is FFN's motion for summary judgment as to liability [58]. For the reasons explained below, the Court grants FFN's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FFN is a California-based company that provides photojournalism services and owns the rights to many photographs, primarily featuring celebrities, which it licenses to online and print publications for profit. R. 84 \u00b6\u00b6 1-3 (Jasmine's L.R. 56.1 Response to FFN's Statement of Material Facts).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among FFN's copyrighted photographs are the Hilton-Rothschild Photos taken at Hilton and Rothschild's July 10, 2015 wedding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17. Since the wedding, FFN has sold a number of licenses to the Hilton-Rothschild Photos. The highest fee it received for the Photos was $2,500 from People Magazine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; R. 91 \u00b6 18 (FFN's Reply to Jasmine's L.R. 56.1 Statement of Additional Facts). FFN made seven additional sales of the Photos in July 2015, the highest of which was for $300. R. 91 \u00b6 16. FFN registered the Hilton-Rothschild Photos with the United States Copyright Office on September 24, 2015. R. 84 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Jasmine is an Illinois-based company that sells wedding dresses out of a retail store, owns and operates a website (www.jasminegalleria.com), and operates a blog with posts on fashion trends and news about weddings (http://jasminegalleria.com/blog).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12; R. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. In October 2015, FFN observed the Hilton-Rothschild Photos on Jasmine's blog, along with the comment: \"Now without further ado ... let's discuss THE dress ... Isn't that a dream? Elegant and timeless,\" along with a photo of a similar-looking Jasmine wedding dress and the caption \"Real Celebrity Wedding ... Acquire It! Jasmine Couture Style F161069.\" R. 84 \u00b6 22; R. 91 \u00b6 12; R. 85-2 at 68-69. Jasmine employee Allison Paschold originated this posting in August 2015. R. 84 \u00b6\u00b6 23-26. The blog post gave credit for the images to \"POPSUGAR.com.\" R. 91 \u00b6 13. Neither Jasmine nor Allison Paschold had FFN's permission to copy or display the Hilton-Rothschild Photos.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. After the blog posting date, FFN continued to sell licenses to the Hilton-Rothschild Photos for amounts ranging from $11.73 to $250. R. 85-2 at 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   FFN's president Boris Nizon lacks specific knowledge about Jasmine, its website, its blog, or any financial benefits Jasmine receives from them. R. 91 \u00b6\u00b6 3, 6-7, 9. As a general matter, however, FFN's business model of acquiring celebrity photos and selling them to online and print media outlets depends on being able to control the timing and volume of the distribution of its photos. R. 84 \u00b6 7. When a photograph is stolen, FFN loses the ability to control that photograph's exclusivity,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, and when a photo is leaked to the public, the value of the photograph usually diminishes immediately,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. The value of photos typically goes down as they get older. R. 91 \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   FFN sued Jasmine for copyright infringement in the Southern District of New York in September 2016. R. 1. The Southern District of New York granted Jasmine's motion to change venue in June 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R. 45. That same month, FFN rejected Jasmine's offer of judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 68 for $15,000 including attorney's fees. R. 83-3. FFN instead has elected to recover statutory damages as\n   well as attorney's fees. In September 2017, FFN moved for summary judgment as to liability only.

Jasmine does not dispute that FFN has established these elements. FFN has produced valid copyright registrations for the Hilton-Rothschild Photos, which constitutes\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of the copyrights' validity.\n   <em>\n    JCW Investments, Inc. v.

And there is no dispute that Jasmine copied the Hilton-Rothschild Photos and displayed them on its blog.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jasmine instead asserts that summary judgment should be denied based on its affirmative defense of fair use. \"Fair use is a mixed question of law and fact, which means that it may be resolved on summary judgment if a reasonable trier of fact could reach only one conclusion-but not otherwise.\"\n   <em>\n    Ty, Inc. v.

They are: \"(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20107\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[T]he four factors ... are not exhaustive and do not constitute an algorithm that enables decisions to be ground out mechanically.\"\n   <em>\n    Chicago Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296186\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/624/#p629\">\n    354 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   629 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9416592\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/512/#p516\">\n    292 F.3d at 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the four factors are a checklist of things to be considered rather than a formula for decision\"). \"The general standard, however, is clear enough: the fair use copier must copy no more than is reasonably necessary (not strictly necessary-room must be allowed for judgment, and judges must not police criticism with a heavy hand) to enable him to pursue an aim that the law recognizes as proper.\"\n   <em>\n    Chicago Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296186\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/624/#p629\">\n    354 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Jasmine is a for-profit business selling wedding dresses, in connection with which it operates a blog that displays wedding dresses and comments on them. In this case, it posted the Hilton-Rothschild Photos along with a photo of a similar-looking Jasmine dress and the caption \"Real Celebrity Wedding ... Acquire It!

But Jasmine presents no affirmative evidence that it does not make money from the blog itself, which is its burden.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chicago Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296186\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/624/#p629\">\n    354 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the defendant must present \"evidence sufficient to withstand summary judgment\" on fair use). And even if it is true that Jasmine makes no money directly from the blog, \"[f]inancial benefit exists where the availability of infringing material acts as a draw for customers.\"\n   <em>\n    A&amp;M Records, Inc. v.

The court found that \"the first of the statutory fair use factors weighs in favor of fair use\" because \"the commercial value to Miller and any resulting decline in the commercial value of the original work resulted not from the value of the original, but from Miller's [critical] additions\"-a non-substitute use that is \"encouraged by the fair use doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. Here, by contrast, Jasmine's use of the Hilton-Rothschild Photos was not for criticism or a related purpose. It was a substitute use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As explained in n.1 above, this Court has stricken four statements of fact made in a declaration filed by FFN's lawyer about the purposes of Jasmine's blog (R. 61 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 19, 21). But that does nothing to move the needle in Jasmine's favor. The same is true for FFN's president's lack of knowledge about the purpose of Jasmine's blog.

An analysis that properly combines the first and fourth factors generally results in fair uses that fall into one of two categories: (1) a use that enhances the market for the original work (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , book reviews); or (2) a use that creates a new market for the new work that references the original work and does not detract from the original work's market (parody).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   There is no evidence that Jasmine's use of the Hilton-Rothschild Photos either enhanced the Photos' fair market value like a book review or created a new market like a parody. A consideration of the first and fourth factors together thus further weighs against a fair use defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Jasmine relies on three main fair use cases involving photographs in support of its contrary position. All are readily distinguishable, first and foremost because they each involved use of a photograph for parody or criticism.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ty\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9416592\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/512/#p516\">\n    292 F.3d at 518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"A parody, which is a form of criticism ... is not intended as a substitute for the work parodied.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Jasmine points to the Seventh Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kienitz\n   </em>\n   , where a photographer sued an apparel company for copyright infringement based on its t-shirts displaying a heavily modified version of a copyrighted photograph of the Mayor of Madison, Wisconsin.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4201682\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/766/756/#p758\">\n    766 F.3d at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Kienitz\n   </em>\n   , the images were identical, and FFN not only had a plan to license the Hilton-Rothschild Photos, but had licensed them numerous times as part of its business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Jasmine also relies on\n   <em>\n    Galvin\n   </em>\n   . But the\n   <em>\n    Galvin\n   </em>\n   court found that a satirical flyer depicting a copyrighted photo of a political parade would not \"plausibly cut into demand for the Photograph\" largely because the flyer was a \"complement\" rather than a \"substitute.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763345\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/1187/#p1195\">\n    130 F.Supp.3d at 1196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Anyone who wants an accurate depiction of the political parade\" depicted in the photo, the court explained, \"would not plausibly license the Flyer instead.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5763345\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/1187/#p1195\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is not the situation here, for reasons already explained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Finally, Jasmine relies on\n   <em>\n    Katz v.

The plaintiff stipulated to the lack of any economic harm, and plaintiff did not show that any market existed for the photo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *9. These are not the facts here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, under the \"general standard\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Chicago Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   , Jasmine undisputedly copied the entirety of the Hilton-Rothschild Photos, and Jasmine has not met its burden of \"present[ing] ... evidence\" showing that it used the copyrighted works \"to pursue an aim that the law recognizes as proper.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9296186\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/354/624/#p629\">\n    354 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Jasmine claims that FFN's counsel should not be able to submit an affidavit in support of summary judgment while taking the position that he is not a witness in this case. Jasmine takes particular issue with four statements FFN's counsel makes in his affidavit about the purpose of Jasmine's blog, including statements that it is \"a popular and lucrative enterprise that purposefully displays celebrity and/or news photographs,\" that it is used \"to sell merchandise,\" and that Jasmine receives financial benefits from the blog in the form of increased traffic to its website. R. 61 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 19, 21. FFN relies on these assertions by its counsel as its sole support for \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14, 30, and 33 of FFN's L.R. 56.1 Statement of Material Facts (R. 59).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Jasmine is correct that \u00b6\u00b6 8-9, 19, 21 of FFN's counsel's affidavit recite improper substantive testimony without record support and without a showing of a basis for personal knowledge.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c)(4) (\"An affidavit or declaration used to support ... a motion [for summary judgment] must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\"). The Court therefore strikes these four statements from FFN's counsel's declaration. The Court also strikes \u00b6\u00b6 10-14 of FFN's counsel's declaration, which merely repeat statements from the declaration of FFN's president Nizon as to which FFN's counsel has not made a showing of personal knowledge. (FFN cites Nizon's declaration-not its counsel's declaration-in support of these statements in its L.R. 56.1 Statement of Material Facts (R. 59).) But the Court declines to strike the remainder of FFN's counsel's declaration, which introduces and recites facts from attached discovery responses. It is customary for counsel to submit a declaration authenticating and reciting basic facts from discovery exchanged in a case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    The Court also declines Jasmine's request for sanctions against FFN's counsel under Fed. R. Civ. P. 11. This is not a situation where counsel should have known the facts did not support his client's claims but made the claims anyway, as in\n    <em>\n     Senese v. Chicago Area I.B. of T. Pension Fund\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164427\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/819/#p824\">\n     237 F.3d 819\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 824 (7th Cir. 2001), on which Jasmine relies. As FFN's counsel points out in his declaration responding to Jasmine's surresponse, Jasmine does not deny the accuracy of any of the facts in FFN's counsel's declaration based on any evidence or declaration of its own. Indeed, FFN's counsel cites record support for these statements in his reply declaration. In other words, Jasmine has not shown that the facts recited by FFN's counsel are inaccurate, but only that they were not presented in a procedurally proper manner. Sanctions are not warranted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
