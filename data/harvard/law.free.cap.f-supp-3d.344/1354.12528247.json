Then, the Court will determine whether Section 2404 is an appropriate vehicle for the Government to pursue its claim, and whether the Government has a basis to proceed outside the context of Section 2404.

In other words, not only did the named plaintiffs, who were dead at the time of filing, not have the capacity to sue, the claims brought by the dead plaintiffs seeking damages for personal injury rather than damages for wrongful death were \"never viable.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Engle Cases (\"Engle II\")\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4203178\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/767/1082/\">\n    767 F.3d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1104 (11th Cir. 2014).

Applying the version of Rule 15(c) in effect at that time, the court held that amendment was permissible because the personal representative received notice of the suit before the statute of limitations expired and knew or should have known that but for a\n   mistake the action would have been brought against him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"719692\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/466/249/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, because the relation-back requirements of the Federal Rules were satisfied, the action was not a nullity and the court determined that the amendment should have been permitted.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"719692\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/466/249/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"719692\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/466/249/\">\n    at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although the phraseology of the statute has changed, the meaning is the same.

Although courts have broad \"discretion in refusing to aid the unclean litigant,\" the Government fails to provide any authority suggesting that this maxim may be used to allow a claim to proceed in the absence of a legal basis and against a defendant which lacks the legal capacity to be sued.

Further, it contends that \"[a]s the personal representative named in Steven's will and the sole beneficiary of his Estate, Robert is a proper party to this suit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 22. The issue of whether a distributee is a proper party to a lawsuit has come up most frequently in the context of determining who is a proper party for substitution under Rule 25. Rule 25 provides that \"[i]f a party dies and the claim is not extinguished, the court may order substitution of the proper party. A motion for substitution may be made by any party or by the decedent's successor or representative.\" Thus, although the Government did not substitute Robert Schoenfeld under Rule 25, case law regarding the substitution of distributees is instructive as to a distributee's capacity to be sued under Rule 17.
