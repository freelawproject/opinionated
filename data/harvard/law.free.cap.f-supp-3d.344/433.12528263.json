Beginning in 1978, however, Congress enacted legislation to reduce regulatory oversight of the price of natural gas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Congress further deregulated the price of natural gas through the enactment of the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989, which prohibited FPC's successor, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\"), from imposing any price regulations on \"first sales\" of natural gas at the\n   wellhead.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75. \"First sales\" include sales by a natural gas producer to a pipeline or a direct purchaser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75.

Because natural gas transmission is often a \"natural monopoly,\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , where a single pipeline infrastructure is the only source of natural gas transportation in a given area), FERC is charged with ensuring that the transmission monopoly is not abused and that prices are \"just and reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 80, 85.

Defendants' conduct in the upstream natural gas transmission market allegedly impacted downstream retail electricity prices due to the relationship and connection between the markets at issue in this litigation. For example, Plaintiffs assert that the price of natural gas is the most significant factor in determining the price of wholesale electricity because natural gas-fired power plants are the primary generators of electricity in New England.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. An increase in the price of natural gas due to a shortage in natural gas supply, therefore, will directly impact the price of wholesale electricity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121. In that same vein, artificially inflated wholesale electricity prices result in artificially inflated retail electricity prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Accordingly, where, as alleged here, Defendants restricted the natural gas supply to New England, Defendants allegedly caused the market price of natural gas to increase, resulting in an increase in wholesale and retail electricity prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   With the regulatory framework and Plaintiffs' allegations in mind, the Court now turns to the New England energy markets at issue in this litigation: (1) the commodity market for natural gas, (2) the natural gas transmission market, (3) the wholesale electricity market and (4) the retail electricity market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    1. Natural Gas Commodity Market\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The natural gas market encompasses two transactions: (1) the purchase of natural gas; and (2) the transmission of natural gas from seller to purchaser.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. With respect to sales of the commodity itself, natural gas is sold to consumers either directly from gas producers via contracts called \"gas futures\" or through the \"spot market.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86. Futures contracts allow gas producers to sell a specific quantify of gas at some predetermined future time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. Purchasers with a steady natural gas demand, such as load distribution companies (\"LDCs\"), which distribute gas to retail customers, typically utilize futures contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84, 87. By contrast, entities with variable or less predictable natural gas demand, including natural gas-fired electricity generators, purchase gas on the \"spot\" market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88. The spot market allows LDCs and other direct purchasers to resell excess amounts of natural gas to which they hold title.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89. According to Plaintiffs, the spot market price of natural gas is not regulated by FERC and is, instead, determined by supply and demand.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 90. Accordingly, the spot market price of natural gas increases when the amount of available natural gas decreases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    2. Natural Gas Transmission Market\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to purchasing natural gas directly from gas producers or indirectly via the spot market, gas purchasers must also pay for the transmission (or transportation) of natural gas to its final destination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. In New England, a network of pipelines facilitates the transmission of natural gas from the wellhead to the purchaser (or a destination determined by the purchaser).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As mentioned, as compared to the price of the commodity itself, which is determined by contract or by the market, FERC oversees the rates charged for transmission capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The process for reserving pipeline transmission capacity in New England differs depending on the purchaser.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. LDCs have the option to enter \"no-notice\" contracts, which give them the power to reserve transmission capacity on a pipeline for a given day and time, and to adjust that reservation \"upward or downward\" at any time without penalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By contrast, other purchasers may be penalized if they do not use the full capacity reserved on a given day or if they have to reserve additional transmission capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Transmission capacity reservations play an important role in determining the supply of natural gas available to gas purchasers in New England because there is a fixed amount of pipeline capacity on any given day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. In other words, the transmission capacity reserved by one purchaser limits how much capacity is available for other purchasers' natural gas needs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Even when LDCs adjust their capacity reservations downward or cancel a reservation, that capacity is not automatically released for others to use.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108. For example, assume an LDC called Firm X reserved enough capacity on a pipeline to move a total of 2400 cubic feet of natural gas through a pipeline at a steady rate over the course of a 24-hour period (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , 100 cubic feet per hour).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109. If Firm X cancelled 20 hours of that reservation and did not affirmatively release the excess capacity it reserved, then the pipeline would, for 20 hours out of the day, flow at 100 cubic feet per hour under capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In that example, other purchasers would not be able to take advantage of the excess units of natural gas capacity caused by Firm X's downward adjustment of its capacity reservation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    3. Wholesale Electricity Market\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Wholesale electricity is typically sold by electricity generators or power plants to load serving entities (\"LSEs\"), which then\n   deliver electricity to retail consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. Some wholesale electricity is purchased via contracts pursuant to which LSEs agree to purchase a certain amount of electricity at a certain rate over a certain period of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. These fixed-rate, bilateral contracts are regulated by FERC, which may review the agreed-upon rate for reasonableness.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   More often, however, wholesale electricity is purchased through auctions between electricity generators and LSEs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. The auctions are administered and overseen by intermediaries called Independent System Operators (\"ISOs\") or Regional Transmission Organizations (\"RTOs\"), which are independent non-profit organizations that FERC has charged with facilitating an efficient market for wholesale electricity while also ensuring reliability for electricity consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As part of their auction-related responsibilities, ISOs and RTOs must file with FERC a tariff that describes in detail the procedures for a given auction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   FERC may review or approve the auction procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In New England, auctions are conducted in accordance with the ISO New England Inc. Transmission, Markets, and Services Tariff (\"ISO-NE Tariff\"), which was approved by FERC and describes the rules that govern ISO-NE's facilitation of auctions for wholesale electricity in the region.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61 (citing ISO-NE,\n   <em>\n    Day-Ahead and Real-Time Energy Markets\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    https://www.iso-ne.com/marketsoperations/markets/da-rt-energy-markets\n   </em>\n   (last visited Sept. 10, 2018) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   There are two types of auctions: (1) \"same-day\" auctions for immediate delivery of wholesale electricity to LSEs experiencing a spike in demand for retail electricity, and (2) \"next-day\" auctions to satisfy expected demand the following day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. In both instances, the auction process is as follows. First, an ISO (or RTO) obtains orders from LSEs indicating how much electric energy is needed over a given period of time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Second, the ISO obtains bids from electricity generators specifying how much electricity can be produced during the relevant time period and how much they propose to charge for it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, the ISO accepts the generators' bids in order of price (from lowest to highest) until the total LSE demand is satisfied.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The price of the last unit of electricity purchased is then paid to all generators whose bids were accepted, even if their offer was lower.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For example, suppose that LSEs inform their ISO that they require 275 units of electricity for the day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Also assume the ISO receives the following bids from electricity generators: Generator A offers 100 units of electricity for $10/unit; Generator B offers 100 units of electricity for $20/unit; Generator C offers 100 units of electricity for $30/unit; and Generator D offers 100 units of electricity for $40/unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ISO will accept Generator A's $10/unit bid (and all 100 units offered); then Generator B's $20/unit bid (and all 100 units offered); and then Generator C's $30/unit bid (but only the first 75 units offered).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given that the wholesale demand from the LSEs was satisfied after the ISO accepted part of Generator C's bid, Generators A, B, and C will all be paid at a rate of $30/unit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The total cost of the 275 units of electricity will be split proportionally amongst the LSEs, according to the units of electricity ordered by each.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    4. Retail Electricity Market\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The wholesale electricity prices paid by LSEs are passed on to retail customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Accordingly, the price of wholesale electricity influences the cost of retail electricity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Alleged Anticompetitive Conduct\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    1. Defendants' Alleged Market Power\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiffs allege a monopolization scheme in which Eversource and Avangrid\n   each allegedly abused their power over the retail electricity market in New England through anticompetitive conduct in the upstream natural gas transmission market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5-8; D. 48 at 39. Plaintiffs contend that Defendants possess the power to raise the price of electricity in New England because they can restrict the amount of natural gas flowing into the region and, therefore, the amount of natural gas available to fuel natural-gas-fired electricity generators. D. 33 \u00b6 94. Plaintiffs point to several aspects of Defendants' energy businesses to suggest that Defendants controlled New England's natural gas supply and, therefore, the price of retail electricity. For example, New England's principal natural gas pipeline, the Algonquin Gas Transmission Pipeline, is owned, in part, by Defendant Eversource.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95. Both Eversource and Avangrid also own and operate, through their subsidiaries, substantial \"natural gas utilities\" known as LDCs-which purchase natural gas directly from gas producers and, in turn, distribute natural gas to retail consumers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. Of the eight largest LDCs in New England, half are owned by Eversource or Avangrid.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of their LDC operations, Eversource and Avangrid possess a large number of \"no-notice\" contracts for natural gas transmission capacity along the Algonquin Pipeline.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. As mentioned, no-notice contracts allow LDCs to adjust their transmission capacity reservations upward or downward at any time and without penalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition to their natural gas businesses, Defendants Eversource and Avangrid, through their respective subsidiaries, operate retail electric utilities or LSEs, which provide electricity to millions of residential, commercial and industrial customers in New England.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101. The price of electricity sold by Defendants' retail utilities is driven, in large part, by the market-wide wholesale price of electricity established within the ISO-NE market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104. When the price of wholesale electricity established within the ISO-NE market increases the price of electricity sold by Eversource and Avangrid to their respective retail customers similarly increases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Eversource and Avangrid also own and operate renewable electricity resources such as hydroelectric, wind and solar generating facilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105. Plaintiffs allege that these facilities have low variable operating costs and, as a result, are more competitive than natural gas-fired electricity generators when the price of natural gas increases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    2. Defendants' Alleged Monopolization Scheme\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As previously explained, the New England electricity market sets a single price for wholesale electricity sold in a given auction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 165. That price is determined by the highest accepted bid in the auction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants, by artificially restricting natural gas supply, raised wholesale natural gas prices on the spot market, which (in turn) raised the bids in electricity auctions, including the highest accepted bid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Higher overall accepted bids resulted in an increase in the cost of wholesale electricity. And, finally, since increases in wholesale electricity prices are passed on to retail electricity consumers, Defendants' conduct caused the retail price of electricity to increase throughout New England.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Defendants' purported systematic abuse of no-notice contracts for natural gas transmission capacity provided the catalyst for the alleged scheme.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. No-notice contracts allow LDCs to reserve natural gas transmission capacity on the Algonquin Pipeline and to adjust such reservations at any time without penalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. Because there is a fixed amount of pipeline capacity on a given day, the volume reserved by LDCs, including those owned by Defendants, affects the transmission capacity available to meet the needs of other consumers, including natural gas-fired electricity generators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107. Moreover, to the extent Defendants adjust their capacity reservations downward \"at the last minute,\" that capacity is not automatically released for use by other actors in the natural gas market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108. Accordingly, the nature and timing of Defendants' adjustments to their capacity reservations may prevent their previously reserved supply of natural gas from being released and used by others to satisfy demand in the natural gas market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendants' conduct was unique.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 122-126. For example, industry research shows that, as compared to the utility company with the next highest \"last-minute\" cancellations, Eversource and Avangrid cancelled their natural gas capacity on approximately 40 and 184 more occasions, respectively.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122. In addition, Defendants' \"clear pattern of large downward adjustments at the very end of the gas day ... is very different than the pattern\" of their top competitors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 125. Defendants also failed to take advantage of the \"capacity release\" mechanism authorized by FERC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 128. The \"capacity release\" mechanism allows holders of no-notice contracts to release excess capacity directly to the relevant pipeline, which then sells that capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 145. Capacity release can occur on a seasonal, monthly and even intra-day basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141. Accordingly, Defendants could have-but did not-release their excess capacity to be sold to other actors in the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 147.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    3. Market Advantages Stemming from Defendants' Alleged Anticompetitive Conduct\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendants benefitted from artificially inflating natural gas and electricity prices in at least two ways. First, by increasing the spot market price for natural gas and/or restricting available natural gas supplies, Defendants artificially increased demand for value attributed to and prices paid to non-natural gas-fired power plants, including power plants owned by Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 152, 156-60. Second, as a result of the artificially depressed natural gas supply and inflated electricity prices caused by Defendants, Defendants were able to advocate for the construction of \"other multi-billion-dollar energy infrastructure.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 161-63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    4. Plaintiffs' Alleged Injury\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Eversource and Avangrid consistently cancelled substantial volumes of transmission capacity in the last three hours of the day every day during the class period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119. In so doing, they reduced the Algonquin Pipeline's daily effective capacity by 14% on average.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118. The reduced gas supply caused by Defendants resulted in natural gas prices on the spot market that were, on average, 38% higher than they would otherwise have been.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120. The increase in spot market natural gas prices impacted the wholesale price of electricity and, in turn, increased retail electricity\n   prices by 20%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121. Plaintiffs estimate that over the course of at least three years, Defendants allegedly caused New Englanders to overpay for retail electricity by at least $3.6 billion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Class Definitions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs assert state and federal law claims on behalf of themselves and similarly situated classes of persons pursuant to Fed.

The causal connection between Defendants' alleged suppression of the supply of natural gas and Plaintiffs' injury as retail electricity consumers is attenuated at best. Plaintiffs' injury allegedly stems from Defendants' anticompetitive conduct in the natural gas transmission market, which is at least three markets removed from the retail electricity market.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , D. 33 \u00b6 8.

As Defendant Eversource indicates, determining damages in this case would require speculation. D. 43 at 29. For example, for each day during the class period, the factfinder would first be required to determine whether Defendants adjusted their natural gas capacity reservations. Then, the factfinder would have to distinguish between the anticompetitive suppression of natural gas supply and Defendants' legitimate need to adjust reservation capacity for the benefit of natural gas customers. Subsequently, the factfinder would need to determine whether Defendants' alleged suppression of New England's natural gas supply impacted the market price of natural gas in the spot market that day, whether the clearing price for wholesale electricity was artificially inflated because of the price of natural gas that same day and, finally, the extent to which the resulting artificial inflation of wholesale electricity prices was passed on to retail electricity consumers. In other words, to determine Plaintiffs' damages based upon Plaintiffs' allegations, the factfinder would be required to engage in an analysis of how multiple markets functioned on a given day, including evaluation of the inputs and outputs for each market, factors that influenced prices offered and accepted by actors in each market and the effectiveness of an auction process regulated by FERC. There is a risk that resulting damages calculations (if they could be fairly determined) would be speculative and would present significant concerns regarding apportionment of damages and the risk of duplicative recovery. Any damages award would need to be correctly apportioned amongst hundreds of thousands of retail electricity customers of Avangrid and Eversource's subsidiaries. In addition, allowing the Plaintiffs, as retail electricity consumers,\n   to move forward with their claims, opens the door for duplicative recovery in contravention of well settled antitrust law since Plaintiffs' injuries are the indirect result of harm allegedly suffered by actors in the spot market for natural gas or the wholesale electricity market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Associated Gen.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/#p542\">\n    459 U.S. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6199687\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/459/519/#p542\">\n    103 S.Ct. 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (reversing lower court's holding in favor of antitrust plaintiffs where \"the [d]istrict [c]ourt would face problems of identifying damages and apportioning them among directly victimized ... and indirectly affected ... entities\");\n   <em>\n    Ill.

Specifically, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Eversource partially owns New England's principal natural gas pipeline. D. 33 \u00b6 95. Both Eversource and Avangrid own and operate multiple LDCs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. Of the\n   eight largest LDCs in New England, half are owned by Eversource or Avangrid.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result of their LDC operations, Eversource and Avangrid possess a large number of \"no-notice\" contracts for natural gas transmission capacity, which allow Defendants' LDCs to reserve large quantities of natural gas transmission capacity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 127. In addition, LDCs can adjust their transmission capacity reservations upward or downward at any time and without penalty and, as a result, LDCs control the supply of natural gas transmitted to New England.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. Finally, Defendants' combined ability to suppress natural gas supply grants them control over the price of wholesale electricity, which, in turn, impacts the price of retail electricity for the reasons previously explained. Nonetheless, as Defendants correctly note, Plaintiffs have failed to allege any facts indicating that Avangrid and Eversource each separately have the power to control or raise prices of any product in any market. At bottom, a claim for monopolization requires that Plaintiffs allege facts sufficient to establish that Defendants separately possessed monopoly power in the relevant market. Accordingly, courts in the First Circuit and elsewhere have rejected monopolization claims based on a \"shared monopoly\" theory of liability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    PSW, Inc. v.
