The Journal News then brought an action in the New York State Supreme Court, Westchester County, in 2013 to obtain the names and addresses of all handgun permit holders in Putnam County. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In 2014, the trial court ruled against Putnam County, and ordered the Clerk of Putnam County \"to comply with [The Journal News'] request for the names and addresses of all pistol permit holders in Putnam County who had not qualified ... to exempt themselves from disclosure.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Gannett Satellite Info.

Putnam County decided not to appeal the Appellate Division's decision, and intends to comply with the Appellate Division's order. (Letter from James. A.

Doe No. 1 has a permit and owns a handgun, and objects to disclosure of his name and address as a handgun permit holder. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.) Doe No. 1 alleges he does not qualify for and thus has not applied for an exception to disclosure pursuant to \u00a7 500.00(5)(b), because \"[h]e does not have reason to believe that his life or safety may be endangered or that he may be subject to unwarranted harassment if his name and address as a permit holder is disclosed publicly.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

However, Doe No. 1 has privacy objections to disclosure of his name, address, and status as a permit holder, because \"[h]e believes that his status as a handgun owner and permit holder is a private, personal matter, and that public disclosure of that information will subject him to unwanted public attention and censure by those in the community who are hostile to guns and gun owners.\" (Compl. \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Decl. of John Doe No. 1 \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Doe No. 2 claims that he desires to own a handgun, and would satisfy the requirements under \u00a7 400.00(1) to obtain a firearm permit, but has refrained from doing so because of privacy objections to disclosure of his name and address. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 23-25.) Doe No. 2 is a law-abiding and responsible former police officer and a former member of the United States Coast Guard, and is highly trained in the proper and responsible use and maintenance of\n   handguns. (Compl. \u00b6 23.) Doe No. 2 alleges he does not qualify for any of the exceptions to disclosure listed in \u00a7 400.00(5)(b), because he \"does not face specific threats that differentiate him from the typical, law-abiding citizen,\" and \"[h]e does not have reason to believe that his life or safety may be endangered or that he may be subject to unwarranted harassment if his name and address as a permit holder is disclosed publicly.\" (Compl. \u00b6 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Prelim. Inj. Mem Ex. C (\"Decl. of John Doe No. 2\") \u00b6 9 (Dkt. No. 12).) Doe No. 2 has privacy objections to disclosure of his name, address, and status as a permit holder, because \"[h]e believes that one's status as a handgun permit holder is a private, personal matter and that public disclosure of that information would subject the permit holder to unwanted public attention and censure by those in the community who are hostile to guns and gun owners.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25; Decl. of John Doe No. 2 \u00b6 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the public disclosure requirement in \u00a7 400.00(5)(a) is facially unconstitutional, as well as a permanent injunction prohibiting Putnam County from disclosing the names and addresses of handgun permit holders.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 16, 2016, Defendants answered the Complaint. (Dkt. No. 34.) In a letter to the Court on November 30, 2016, the NYAG responded that the \"Office has concluded that there are serious jurisdictional obstacles to the Court's consideration of [P]laintiffs' claims.\" (NYAG Letter 1.) Accordingly, the NYAG \"decided not to participate at th[at] juncture in the proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.) On December 9, 2016, Plaintiffs responded to the jurisdictional concerns raised by the NYAG. (Dkt. No. 41.) On December 9, 2016, Defendants filed a letter informing the Court that they would not take a stand on the jurisdictional issues, but responded to certain assumptions in the letter regarding whether Defendants would disregard the Appellate Division's decision. (Dkt. No. 40.) On November 13, 2017, the Court issued an Order concluding that, at that point in the proceedings, the jurisdictional obstacles raised by the NYAG did not prevent the Court from retaining jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' facial challenge to \u00a7 400.00(5), however, as noted, the Court also found that the NYSPRA did not have\n   standing to bring the suit. (Standing Order (Dkt. No. 45).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On December 1, 2017, the NYAG wrote a letter seeking to intervene, (Dkt.

On December 22, 2017, the NYAG filed a pre-motion letter indicating the grounds on which it would move to dismiss the Complaint. (Dkt. No. 50.) On October 15, 2015, Plaintiff opposed the request.

Requiring Doe No. 2 to apply for a handgun permit in order to challenge the statute would run head first into the constitutional challenge he raises to the licensing regime. His first claim is that were he to apply for a permit, release of his private information into the public record would violate his constitutional right to privacy. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 28-30.) The second claim is that \u00a7 400.00(5)(a) infringes on his Second Amendment rights by requiring his personal information to be a matter of public record before exercising his Second Amendment right to own a firearm. (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3, 25, 35-39.) As a result, Doe No. 2 claims he is in a catch-22: vindication of his Second Amendment rights comes at the expense of his constitutional rights to privacy. (Compl. \u00b6 17.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because none of the exceptions to disclosure allegedly apply to him, seeking one would be futile.

Moreover, Doe No. 1 has sufficiently alleged an \"actual or imminent\" injury from the public availability of his private information. (Compl. \u00b6 3, 28-30.) Those injuries exist even without a party currently seeking the information, as it remains the case, allege Plaintiffs, that any party could easily seek and obtain the permit information.

(NYAG Mem. 10, 12.) The exception the NYAG refers to is not unlimited in scope: it applies to applicants who have \"reason to believe his or her life or safety may be endangered\" or have \"reason to believe he or she may be subject to unwarranted harassment upon disclosure of such information.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Penal%20Law%20%C2%A7%20400.00\">\n    N.Y.

Rather, Plaintiffs fear \"unwanted public attention and censure by those in the community who are hostile to guns and gun owners.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25.)

(NYAG Mem. 14.) However, the Court stands by its prior finding that Defendants' agreement with Plaintiffs' position on the merits of this case is not dispositive. Putnam County informed the Court that it will comply with the Appellate Division's decision regarding disclosure of the names and addresses of handgun permit holders in Putnam County. (Dk. No. 40.) Thus, Putnam County is sufficiently adverse to Plaintiffs: absent a ruling from this Court, Putnam County would be required to release publically available data about Doe No. 1 (and Doe.

The NYAG proffers conclusory assertions that FOIL serves the important interest of \"shed[ding] light on government decision making\" and permits \"the electorate to make informed choices regarding governmental activities\" and \u00a7 400.00(b) serves to aid the \"law-enforcement interests served by the statute\" by \"enlist[ing] the public in the enforcement of\" the statute.\" (NYAG Mem. 20.) While, in the abstract, these may be \"important governmental interests,\" the NYAG fails to substantiate or explain how \u00a7 400.00(b) reasonably satisfies these objectives. Indeed, one could be skeptical about what additional assistance the public could provide in enforcing the licensing regime above and beyond what is gained from disclosure to just the government. The NYAG also point to articles discussing how the press uses the data to inform the public \"about trends, accountability gaps and other potential problems in\n   a state's gun licensing scheme,\" but fails to expand on what the government's interest in such reporting is.
